<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Benefits)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</b> asked the Minister for Trade

and  Industry  (a)  what  kind  of  programmes  does  the

Government plan to initiate in order to reap the benefits

that  will  be  derived from the recent  successful  Free

Trade  Agreements  (FTAs) reached between  Singapore  and

various   countries;  and  (b)  how  can   the   recently

retrenched employees from the banking sector be reskilled

and trained to take up job opportunities arising from the

successful FTAs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, our FTAs enhance

Singapore's  attractiveness to investors  and  strengthen

our  hub  position in Asia.  This is because  the  market

access benefits and other preferential treatment that our

FTAs  carry  will  enhance the exports  of  companies  in

Singapore.  Singapore companies and foreign



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1488</b></font><br><br>



investors  will  find  it more attractive  to  invest  in

Singapore,  thus generating more employment opportunities

for Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our efforts to ensure that businesses are able to

benefit from the FTAs begin well before negotiations  are

concluded.   In  the  course  of  the  negotiations,   we

actively  seek feedback and suggestions from the  private

sector,  in  order  to find out where the  problems  are.

Armed  with this information, we are able to negotiate  a

better  agreement for companies.  For the FTAs  that  are

still  under negotiation, we strongly encourage companies

and  business  organisations like the Singapore  Business

Federation  to  play  an even more active  role  in  this

process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once an FTA is concluded, our focus turns to helping

businesses  understand  the   agreement  so  as  to  take

advantage of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we seek to reach out to the general business

community  through the media, the Internet and  seminars.

Such  large-scale programmes allow us to create a general

awareness of FTAs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we recognise that a focused approach will be

more effective in helping individual companies understand

how  they  can  directly  benefit  from  the  Agreements.

Therefore, our economic agencies have also been in  touch

with  Singapore-based  companies  to  see  how  they  can

specifically leverage on FTA provisions to gain a greater

competitive edge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies may not always want to reveal details on

how   they   organise  their  operations  to   Government

agencies.   Instead, they may wish to tap on their  legal

or  accounting  advisors or other consultants  to  advise

them  on  how  to take advantage of the FTAs.   We  would

therefore  welcome  efforts by the legal  and  accounting

professions,  as  well  as  management  consultants,   to

develop  capabilities to be able to advise their  clients

on international trade and FTA issues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, the extent to which Singapore benefits

from these FTAs will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1489</b></font><br><br>



depend   on   our   people  and  businesses.    Singapore

businesses must seize the opportunities afforded  by  our

FTAs to grow and expand internationally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Singapore workers must be prepared

to  retrain  and  prepare  themselves  for  the  new  job

opportunities  that will be created as a  result  of  the

FTAs.  The FTAs will not help us to hold on to jobs  that

are  no  longer competitive, whether in the manufacturing

or services sectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers can take advantage of MOM's retraining

schemes,   such  as  the  WorkSkills  Training  Programme

(WSTP), the Self Employment Training Programme (SET), the

Strategic  Manpower Conversion Programme (SMCP)  and  the

Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP).  Retrenched banking

sector employees who are subsequently re-employed in  the

financial  sector,  can  also  take  advantage  of   MAS'

Financial  Sector  Development  Fund  Financial  Training

Scheme to upgrade their technical expertise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We encourage workers and unions to look to the new

opportunities provided by the FTAs, and take advantage of

the  resources  provided  by the  Government  to  prepare

themselves well for these opportunities.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, can the Senior

Minister  of  State kindly enlighten how we can  actually

explain  this whole concept and programme of the FTAs  to

the  man-in-the-street because, according  to  the  Prime

Minister's  statement a few days back, about 20,000  jobs

can be created arising from the FTAs and especially so in

the  manufacturing and service sectors?  There  are  many

people  who are finding hope in this announcement and  if

more could be done to communicate and make it more simple

to the man-in-the-street, it will help a lot.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> I think that is a good

point.   We  have been doing a fair bit to publicise  the

FTAs.   First, of course, the full text of  the  FTAs  as

well  as the business guides are all posted on the  MTI's

website.   The economic agencies are organising  seminars

and business



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1490</b></font><br><br>



briefings.   We have done seminars on our FTAs  with  New

Zealand  and  Japan and we also did a fairly  large-scale

briefing  of  SMEs sometime in the middle of  this  year.

This  process  will  have to go on,  not  just  to  build

general awareness but also to build specific awareness of

opportunities  involved in each  FTA.   Another  approach

will be to work with the unions so that they get a better

awareness  of  the specific opportunities that  the  FTAs

provide for workers in their sectors.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. Nithiah Nandan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. Nithiah Nandan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I am

very  glad to hear that the Senior Minister of State will

be  briefing the unions.  As a suggestion, maybe we could

try ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Nandan, you are supposed to ask

questions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nithiah Nandan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nithiah Nandan:</b> All right. Will the Senior

Minister of State consider having a dialogue session with

the unions and also at the same time to work out specific

programmes where the FTAs can positively benefit  workers

in general and where are the areas we need to identify to

train them up?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is

a useful suggestion that MTI and Ministry of Manpower can

look into together.

<div align="center"><b>RECESSION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Assistance to companies)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister for

Trade  and  Industry  in  view  of  his  statement   that

Singapore may slide into another recession, (a) how  long

and  how deep will this coming recession be, and (b) what

additional measures are being taken to help small and big

Singapore companies to tide over this difficult period.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, MTI's growth

forecast for this year has been revised downwards to 2-2.5%.   For  next year, we are forecasting  2.0  -  5.0%,

although there is considerable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1491</b></font><br><br>



uncertainty  because of the state of the  global  economy

and the possibility of war in Iraq.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our growth forecast for this year reflects

expectations of continued positive growth in  the  fourth

quarter on a year-on-year basis, in other words, compared

to  the fourth quarter of last year.  This is because our

key  exports  markets  are  still  growing,  albeit  more

slowly.   However, should GDP contract on  a  quarter-on-quarter basis in the fourth quarter, as happened  in  the

third quarter, we will technically be in recession. We do

not  expect  this to happen, but we cannot rule  out  the

possibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an environment as uncertain as today's, there can

be little certainty in short term economic forecasts.  If

US  consumption  does  not fall  sharply  in  the  fourth

quarter, and the major economies do not stumble badly, we

should  be  able  to  achieve positive quarter-on-quarter

growth  in  the  fourth  quarter and  avoid  a  technical

recession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's economic performance next year will also

depend very much on how various external events pan  out.

We could see a good recovery in the economy in the second

half  of  2003 if the US has by then worked  through  the

after-effects of the investment bubble of the late 1990s,

and if confidence in the region around us is sustained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned in this House last month, several of

the  measures  the  Government implemented  in  July  and

October last year to help companies during this difficult

period  are  still in place.  These include JTC  and  HDB

rental  rebates,  the cut in foreign  workers'  levy  and

concessions  on port dues. We have also made enhancements

to  the  Local  Enterprise  Technical  Assistance  Scheme

(LETAS) and the Local Enterprise Finance Scheme (LEFS).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also introduced other schemes aimed at

helping SMEs.  SPRING Singapore launched a Loan Insurance

Scheme  (LIS) in September 2002 to complement  the  Local

Enterprise Financial Scheme



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1492</b></font><br><br>



(LEFS),  and  help SMEs get better access  to  financing.

Unlike LEFS, which stipulates a fixed interest rate,  LIS

gives    participating   financial    institutions    the

flexibility to decide on interest rates according to  the

risk  profile of the borrower. This increases the  chance

of  success of an SME's loan application. Private  credit

risk  insurers  insure 50 per cent of  the  loan  against

default.  The  Government  co-shares  the  cost  of   the

insurance premium with the SME.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Micro Loan Programme was also set up in November

last  year,  to provide easier access to loans  for  very

small  enterprises to meet their working  capital  needs.

Since  its  launch  in November last year,  almost  1,000

firms have benefited from this scheme with a total of $32

million in loans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Government has also implemented

reductions  in corporate income taxes, and postponed  the

restoration  of  the CPF contribution rates.  These  will

help all businesses during this difficult period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is monitoring the economy closely. It

is looking at whether some of the earlier economic relief

measures need to be extended, and whether additional ways

to  help  businesses and workers tide over the  difficult

period are necessary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

given the economic uncertainty and the fact that we  have

been told that there might be even a double-dip recession

next year, would not the Government consider, as part  of

its strategy, a postponement of the proposed increase  in

the  GST hike scheduled for January next year?  Given the

fact  that the unemployment situation is set to  increase

further  in  the coming weeks or months, that people  are

already  tightening  their belts and will  tighten  their

belts  even  further  and therefore consumption  spending

will drop and businesses will suffer, and this would lead

to  a  contraction  in the economy in the  months  ahead,

would he not consider such a move?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1493</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a

double-dip recession cannot be ruled out but  it  is  not

likely  at this stage.  There are some economists in  the

US  who have painted a scenario of a double-dip in the US

but  the majority opinion remains that of positive growth

in the US economy.  Likewise for the region around us and

the  global economy.  So we cannot rule it out but it  is

not  a central scenario at this point, not something that

we  attach high likelihood to.  We will have to watch the

economy  very carefully in the coming months and  respond

accordingly.    Likewise,  for  unemployment.    We   are

watching  it  very carefully but it is  not  a  situation

where we expect a sharp surge in unemployment figures  at

this point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has mentioned publicly yesterday

that the manner of implementation of the GST increase  is

being considered.  This is being looked at together  with

various other economic relief measures, whether we should

extend  some  of  the earlier economic  relief  measures.

This  is  being  considered very  carefully.   There  are

obviously  revenue implications.  I should  clarify  that

the  existing plan, as it stood, was not a contractionary

plan  because  the GST increase was accompanied  by  very

substantial  offset  measures,  including  the   Economic

Restructuring Shares that would actually have meant a net

boost  in the amount of funds being put into the  economy

by  the  Government.   It was actually,  on  balance,  an

expansionary   package.   But  having  said   that,   the

Government  is  considering very carefully  the  mode  of

implementation of the GST increase, bearing in  mind  the

economic difficulties of businesses and workers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Charles Chong</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  if his Ministry will consider extending  the

rental rebates and deferring the rental increases or  the

upward  adjustments to 'market rental'  of  HDB  and  JTC

commercial   properties  until  the  economic   situation

improves.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1494</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, existing rental rebates

provided by HDB to its commercial tenants will expire  at

the   end  of  the  year.  The  Government  is  currently

reviewing  these  rebates taking into  consideration  the

economic outlook.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the upward adjustments to "market rental" of

HDB  commercial  properties, HDB  has  already  moderated

their  impact  on  its tenants by staggering  the  rental

adjustments  over  four  renewals at  3-yearly  intervals

since  1988 - a 12-year period. Tenants who are  renewing

their tenancies with rental increases from November  2001

onwards can further stagger their rental increase equally

over a 3-year term.



<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  could the Minister of State confirm when were these

market  rentals established?  Was it before the recession

or after the recession?



<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

proposal to adjust rentals to the market is not a new one

and, in fact, was negotiated back in 1988.  The intention

then  was  to ensure equity between shopkeepers who  have

heavily  subsidised rentals versus the newer  comers  who

were  paying market rents.  So this is not a new  policy.

Having  said  that, however, in view of  the  conditions,

since  November  2001,  we have provided  for  a  stagger

within  a stagger.  And for those in their final term  of

adjustment,  we  stagger  out the  increases  over  three

years.



<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Minister  of  State  has not answered  my  question.   My

question  was:  when  were  these  market  rental   rates

established?  Is it still current?



<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> The market rental rates are

decided  by  valuers and they will ensure  that,  at  any

point in time, the level at which it is set takes into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1495</b></font><br><br>



account  the  current market conditions.  And  for  those

facing  renewals  from now onwards,  the  current  market

conditions are certainly taken into account.

<div align="center"><b>CODE ON RELIGIOUS HARMONY</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam</b> asked the Prime Minister

(a)  if he will clarify how the Code on Religious Harmony

can be applied by Singaporeans; (b) from whom individuals

can  seek counsel when the Code is flouted; (c) what kind

of  remedial action can be taken when it is flouted;  and

(d)  whether  he  will consider setting  up  a  mediation

council comprising different religious leaders to resolve

conflicts  arising from non-compliance with the  Code  on

Religious Harmony.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen (Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Chan Soo Sen) (for the Prime Minister):</b> The proposed

Code on Religious Harmony is meant to be a set of guiding

principles  on  how  Singaporeans should  practise  their

religion when they interact with one another in our multi-racial,  multi-religious,  society.   As  Singapore   has

already achieved many years of religious harmony, I think

the   Code,  when  it  is  completed,  will  look  rather

familiar. However, it is still useful to remind ourselves

of all these basic principles which have helped, and will

continue to help, achieve and maintain religious  harmony

in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the Code is actually a reflection of

moral  values  and social norms.  It is not  a  piece  of

legislation.   Hence, there will be no penalties  if  the

Code is flouted.  If someone acts in such a manner as  to

violate  religious harmony, there are existing mechanisms

to  deal with them, and it will not be dealt with by  the

Code.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, under the Maintenance of Religious

Harmony  Act, the Minister for Home Affairs is  empowered

to  issue  restraining orders of up to a maximum  of  two

years against persons inciting religious misunderstanding

or  causing  inter-religious hostility.  Any  person  who

breaches the restraining order shall be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1496</b></font><br><br>



guilty  of  an offence and be liable on conviction  to  a

fine  not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term

not  exceeding two years or to both.  In the  case  of  a

second  or subsequent offence, the person will be  liable

to a fine not exceeding $20,000 or to imprisonment for  a

term  not exceeding three years or to both.  The Act also

provides for the establishment of a Presidential  Council

for Religious Harmony.  The Chairman and every member  of

the  Council are appointed by the President on the advice

of  the  Presidential Council for Minority Rights  for  a

period of three years.  The Council considers and reports

to the Minister for Home Affairs on matters affecting the

religious harmony in Singapore which are referred to  the

Council by the Minister or by Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has proposed a draft Code on

Religious Harmony for discussion.  And since I have  been

appointed to head the Working Group on the Code,  I  have

been consulting with the national groups representing the

various  faiths  in order to develop the Code,  and  this

process will take place in the next few months.   I  will

listen  to  and,  as  far  as possible,  incorporate  all

relevant  views.   The  Code  will  be  referred  to  the

Presidential   Council   for   Religious   Harmony    for

consideration before it is finalised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the elaborate consultation process, I hope

the  finalised Code would be one that all major religions

in  Singapore can agree with and feel ownership for,  and

one   that   can   be  understood  and  internalised   by

Singaporeans.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister  of  State  in what manner would  this  Code  be

practised.  Is there a consideration to integrate  it  as

part  of  the pledge-taking session, or are we  going  to

have a separate session?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, through the

consultation  process,  we hope to  achieve  a  situation

whereby the various religious groups consider the Code as

their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1497</b></font><br><br>



Code,  and not the Government's Code.  And if the various

religious  groups consider the final Code as their  Code,

we  can  discuss in what manner they could  remind  their

believers  of  this  Code.  I have actually  exposed  the

preliminary idea to them that, for example,  if  all  the

religious  groups agree, we can say that  for  the  first

week  of  every month, at the end of their weekly prayer,

the  Code  can  be read out to the devotees or  followers

just  to remind the people.  But all these are very, very

preliminary at the moment.  I maintain that what we  want

to  achieve  is  for  the  various  religious  groups  to

consider  the Code as their Code, and that they  take  it

upon themselves to remind their believers and devotees of

their Code.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Based on what the Minister of

State  has  just described, it will really take  care  of

citizens with a religion.  But in cases where they do not

have a religion, they will not have a place of worship to

practise such an oath-taking.  So eventually when we have

this  objective  of coming up with the Religious  Harmony

Code,  how  do we intend actually to cover  the  rest  of

Singaporeans who may not have a religion at this point?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> I think it will depend on the

content  of the Code, whether it addresses everybody,  or

it addresses people who are practising a religion.  If we

are  talking about addressing everybody, there is already

a  code  which  is in our National Pledge  that  all  our

students read every day where we pledge ourselves as  one

united  people regardless of race, language or  religion,

and  so on.  But for those who are practising a religion,

if  the  Code  is  to  remind them  that  when  they  are

practising a religion and when this goes into the  common

space, when they are interacting with people of different

faiths,  what  is the understanding between  our  various

religious  groups on how we should handle  that  kind  of

situation.  If the Code is to address that, then I  would

say  it  suffices to remind the people who  are  actively

practising their religion.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> From what the Minister of State

has  just described, would he not think that it may  lead

to  a lot of confusion in the sense that we are going  to

have two sets of Codes, one in the school and another set

just basically for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1498</b></font><br><br>



the  religious  groups?  I do not  know  how  this  would

develop eventually.  Would he care to share some thoughts

on this?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> I do not know how it will develop

eventually  either.   We are in the consultation  process

and  we  would like the various religious groups to  play

their part in formulating the Code and to play their part

to  remind  their  followers  on  the  Code  and  how  to

internalise  the Code.  Since the process  is  still  on-going, I cannot presuppose what would the turnout  be  at

the  end.   But  if we are talking about Singaporeans  in

general,  my  own view is that there is  already  a  code

called  the  National  Pledge.  But  for  those  who  are

practising  their religion actively and bearing  in  mind

that  Singapore is a multi-religious type of society,  we

want  to practise a faith in such a way that it does  not

create  misunderstanding or, worse still, create  offence

with  each other.  What I was saying is that if the  Code

addresses  this situation, then to be able to remind  the

people  who are actively practising their religion  would

have been well-served by this Code.  And in addition,  as

Singaporeans, they also remember the National Pledge.  So

they are reminded twice.



<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Could I

ask the Minister of State about the question on mediation

council?  In the on-going process, is it possible that we

do  not have to use the Act and we can nip things in  the

bud?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> This is a question that I will

pose  to  the various religious groups that my colleagues

and I are currently consulting.  What we are doing is  we

are  visiting group by group and we listen to their views

on  the Code itself as well as to listen to some feedback

on the current state of religious harmony.  After we have

consulted all the groups, we will sit down and draft  the

Code before inviting everybody to sit and go through  the

Code  together.   Depending on what the Code  looks  like

then,  we  would  be  able  to  raise  this  question  of

mediation council with them and to see whether they  feel

good enough to actually form their own mediation councils

so that, for minor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1499</b></font><br><br>



matters,  there is no need to make use of the Maintenance

of Religious Harmony Act.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</b> asked the Acting Minister for

Community Development and Sports, after September 11  and

the   recent   development  of  Jemaah   Islamiyah   (JI)

activities, (a) are there plans to (i) review  the  model

of  self-help  groups  and (ii) enhance  the  concept  of

cohesiveness by amalgamating them under one umbrella body

without disrupting their individuality at the same  time;

and  (b) what more can be done and how can we ensure that

there is more collaboration of resources among these self-help groups.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports (Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim):</b> Sir, September

11  and  the  arrests  of  the Jemaah  Islamiyah  members

reinforce  the  need  for  a concerted  effort  to  build

harmony  and  trust among Singaporeans.   But  they  have

nothing  to  do  with  the  self-help  groups'  role   in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The self-help groups were set up to help the

underachievers  in their community to  level  up.   While

national   programmes  and  CDCs  can   cater   to   most

Singaporeans, the self-help groups are more effective  in

reaching  out to the last 5% that need help, given  their

cultural   affinity,  language  and  networks.  Moreover,

different   communities  have  different  priorities   to

address.   A  community  self-help approach  allows  each

community  to focus on the issues and problems  that  are

most pressing for that community.  The existence of self-help groups should not be perceived as a weakness but  as

complementary to our multi-racial approach.  If the multi-racial  approach was not well accepted, we would  not  be

able  to  form self-help groups without creating communal

tension.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1500</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The self-help groups recognise that their programmes

should promote and not undermine multi-racialism.   Where

feasible,  they  pool their resources and organise  joint

programmes.   For example, the students  can  now  attend

tuition classes run by any of the self-help groups island-wide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-help groups are governed by boards of

management and overseen by MCDS.  Amalgamating them under

one umbrella body may not be necessary, and could in fact

impede  their ability to respond quickly to the needs  of

their community.  The self-help groups should continue to

network  regularly  and consciously  seek  out  areas  of

collaboration  among themselves and with other  agencies.

This will also enable them to pool resources and minimise

duplication.

active interest in the management of their building and a

greater  awareness  of  the  LTSA.   Some  have  provided

feedback  that  the  provisions  in  the  LTSA  could  be

<div align="center"><b>(Impact on Singapore Changi Airport)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</b> asked the Minister for

Transport   in   view   of  Shanghai   promoting   Pudong

International  Airport as an aviation  hub  in  the  Asia

Pacific  region from 27th October 2002, (a) what will  be

the  impact on Singapore Changi Airport (SCA)  which  has

consecutively been voted as the best Airport in the world

by  Business  Travellers (Asia Pacific) in  the  last  11

years; and (b) what measures can SCA take to address  the

challenges so that it will continue to be competitive and

maintain its number one position.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Transport) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Transport (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir, China's civil aviation market is expected to grow by

about 8% per annum with its air cargo traffic growing  at

an  even  faster  12% per annum for the  next  20  years.

China is likely to become the largest commercial aviation

market outside the USA.  Given this immense potential, it

is  likely  that there will be several aviation  hubs  in

China, including Pudong in Shanghai.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see this development in positive light. As the

established  hub  for Southeast Asia and the  Australasia

region,  Changi Airport will benefit from the  growth  of

the   North  Asian  hubs,  because  the  airports   serve

complementary  roles.  For instance, air traffic  between

Changi  and Pudong is expected to increase three-fold  by

end of this year compared to just a year ago, from 14  to

44  weekly services.  As Shanghai and Pudong continue  to

develop rapidly, we expect the traffic between Changi and

Pudong to grow in tandem.  The development of the Chinese

hubs  will  also bring about further downstream  economic

opportunities  for  Singapore, eg,  in  the  maintenance,

repairs and overhaul sector.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1503</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to how Changi Airport

intends to stay ahead of its competitors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globally, the aviation industry has yet to fully

recover  from  the economic downturn exacerbated  by  the

September 11 events.  Regionally, competition has  become

more  intense, with many airports offering new facilities

and larger capacities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this backdrop of continued uncertainty in

the  global  aviation  industry and intensifying  airport

competition,  my Ministry has embarked on  a  fundamental

review of Changi Airport's competitive strategy.  What we

aim  to do is to not just help our airline partners  tide

through  this  difficult  period but,  more  importantly,

position Singapore for the long haul.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore happy to inform Members of the

setting up of a 3-year, S$210 million Air Hub Development

Fund  (AHDF)  as  part  of our competitive  strategy.   A

number  of  initiatives will be launched under the  AHDF.

These will be targeted at our industry partners, and help

us  further  anchor  Changi's  position  as  the  premier

regional air hub.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, CAAS will, under the AHDF, step up

collaboration   with  airlines  and  various   Government

agencies,  like the Singapore Tourism Board,  on  traffic

development programmes.  Fundamentally, the most critical

element for an airline is the demand for air travel.   If

we  can  stimulate  greater demand  for  air  travel  to,

through  and from Singapore, the business of the airlines

will  improve, margins will increase, and they  will  not

only stay, but increase their presence here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also enhance our existing cost reduction

measures  under the AHDF.  The House may recall  that  as

part  of  the Government's Off-Budget measures in October

2001, we had introduced a 10% landing fee discount and  a

15%  rental discount.  With effect from 1st January 2003,

we  will  increase  the  landing fee  discount  from  the

current 10% to 15%.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1504</b></font><br><br>



This will generate savings for the airlines of about S$30

million  annually for the next three years.  In addition,

the current 15% rental discount will also be extended for

another  three  years.  This will benefit  not  only  our

tenants  at the passenger terminals but also our  tenants

at the Changi Airfreight Centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, CAAS will announce more details of the AHDF,

and   all   these   measures  will  help  Changi   remain

competitive as a key aviation hub.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> In view of the fact that cost is

a  big  consideration in the airline business,  does  the

Minister  think that it is viable for Singapore  to  look

into the possibility of setting up a no-frills airline?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, as the CAAS has replied in

the  newspapers  a  few days ago, we  would  welcome  the

setting up of an additional airline in Singapore, whether

it is a low-cost carrier or otherwise.

(a)  whether  he  will consider shutting down  the  Bukit

Panjang  LRT system for a period of time so as to conduct

a  thorough investigation and testing of the system;  and

(b)   what  are  the  key  safety  features  of  and  the

performance standards specified for the LRT system.



<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan (Senior Minister of State for Transport) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan) (for the Minister for Transport):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  with your permission, I would like to take Question

Nos. 8 and 9 together, please.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1505</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Until the service disruption on

21st October 2002, the Bukit Panjang LRT had overcome its

initial  difficulties and has begun to meet  our  service

expectations.   In the four months preceding  the  recent

incident, it had met the service availability standard of

99.7%,  ie, a delay of not more than 4 minutes over  each

20-hour operating period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 21st October service disruption occurred at

around  6.40 am.  Service was partially restored on  24th

October.   Full  service resumed on 26th October.   While

the incident caused commuters a lot of inconvenience,  at

no time was safety of commuters compromised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened? Each LRT vehicle has eight guide-wheels to help position the vehicle centrally on its

track.   Guide-wheels  are not the same  as  the  running

wheels  on  which the vehicle travels.  On 21st  October,

one of the eight guide-wheels got dislodged and fell off.

The  spindle that held the guide-wheel grated against the

rail,  damaging  about one kilometre  of  it  before  the

vehicle  came to a stop.  SLRT had to replace the damaged

portions of the rail.  It was a major repair, and it took

them several days to complete.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately after the incident, the Land Transport

Authority  directed  SMRT,  the  parent  company  of  the

operator,  to  set  up a Panel of Inquiry.   The  Panel's

findings  were released just last week.  Let me highlight

the key points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, why did the guide-wheel drop off? A guide-wheel is normally held in place by a castle nut and a

cotter pin.  A cotter pin is about five centimetres  long

and  is  inserted  through a castle nut  to  prevent  the

castle nut from loosening as a result of vibration.    It

is  an  important component of the guide-wheel  assembly.

Without  the cotter pin to hold it in place,  the  castle

nut  may turn loose and, in extreme cases, can result  in

the guide-wheel falling off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the incident, SMRT and SLRT staff searched the

entire  site.  They could retrieve all the components  of

the guide-wheel assembly, but not the cotter pin.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1506</b></font><br><br>



This  has led the Panel to conclude that the most  likely

cause  for the guide-wheel to be dislodged was a  missing

cotter pin in the guide-wheel assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the second question was: why was the cotter pin

missing?  The Panel considered the possibility of the pin

breaking or dropping off through wear and tear.   But  it

ruled  out such a possibility as neither the pin nor  its

broken  parts  were recovered.  The Panel concluded  that

the  cotter  pin was probably never inserted  during  the

last  overhaul  maintenance in August  2002,  two  months

before the incident.   This is despite the fact that  the

maintenance procedure does require the maintenance  staff

to  sign off after inserting the pin, and the maintenance

record did contain their signatures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This finding would suggest to me that the quality of

preventive maintenance is not up to the mark.  First, the

failure  to insert the cotter pin, an important component

of  the  guide-wheel assembly, should have been noted  at

the time of the overhaul in August.  Second, daily checks

for excessive free play of the guide-wheel assembly by an

experienced team could have detected the loosening of the

guide-wheel before it became completely dislodged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of this incident, there are several

actions being done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, LTA is conducting an audit of the maintenance

regime  of  the BPLRT.  The objective is to identify  the

shortcomings so that they can be corrected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, SMRT and SLRT will follow through the

various  recommendations put up by the Panel of  Inquiry.

These  were technical matters and were already  announced

by  the Panel last week.  I would not repeat them, except

to highlight one key recommendation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Panel has recommended that SMRT and SLRT should

work  closer together in cross-training their maintenance

staff  so that they can reinforce each other in the event

of  any  major  service disruption.  This will  speed  up

service recovery and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1507</b></font><br><br>



minimise  inconvenience to commuters.   This  is  a  good

arrangement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I see value in integrating and centralising

the  maintenance functions of SMRT and SLRT,  to  achieve

economy  of  scale  and,  more  importantly,  in  raising

professionalism of the maintenance team at the LRT level.

But  this  is  really  an  operational  matter  that  the

operator should think through and decide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo proposed that the BPLRT be shut down for a

period  so that a thorough investigation and testing  can

be carried out.  But this is not necessary. This incident

is not due to a flaw in design.  Neither does it point to

a  safety  risk.  It is caused by a lapse in maintenance.

It  is human error.  The way forward is to tighten up  on

maintenance and to prevent such human errors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo also asked about the key safety features and

performance standards that we impose on the LRT.  Let  me

assure  Dr  Teo that the BPLRT is safe.  It has  adequate

safety  features, and one example is the Automatic  Train

Protection  System  that regulates the  distance  between

trains to prevent any collision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for performance standards, they are set out in

full  in the Licence and Operating Agreement between  LTA

and  SLRT.   They relate to service quality,  safety  and

operations of the system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I share the disappointment of Members and

commuters  affected by this latest disruption.  But  this

recent  incident  is  not quite similar  to  the  earlier

problems.  The earlier teething problems of the LRT  have

been  largely  resolved.  That is  why  it  was  able  to

achieve 99.7% service level for several months.  This did

not  happen  by  chance.  I know that SMRT  has  seconded

significant engineering resources to SLRT and has engaged

Bombardier,  the  train supplier,  to  provide  technical

training.  As a result, the maintenance standard  of  the

operator  has  improved significantly in  recent  months.

But  the  21st October incident shows that it  still  has

some way to go.  We will continue to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1508</b></font><br><br>



press   the   operator  to  improve   its   standard   of

maintenance.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> I would like to ask the Senior

Minister of State whether there are any specific  reasons

for  the less than satisfactory performance and vigilance

of the maintenance team.



<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> As I have said, it has to do with

the  quality  of  maintenance.  I  have  been  very  much

involved  in  looking at this project over the  last  few

months since our last Budget debate, and I have seen  the

quality  improving.   It is quite a different  team  now.

They are serious about what they are doing.  But like all

things,  it cannot be fixed overnight.  Until the October

21st  incident,  indeed, the quality has  improved.  They

have  put in significant engineering resources, at  great

cost,  from the parent company into the subsidiary.   But

the  October 21st incident shows that they are not  quite

there yet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own take-away is this. I have been involved in

running hospitals for many years and was helping Minister

Yeo  Cheow Tong at that time in restructuring the various

hospitals.   Initially,  when  we  started  restructuring

hospitals   and   splitting  them  up   into   individual

hospitals,  the immediate reaction was to go  independent

on  everything - maintenance was split up, PR, HR,  CFOs,

and  so  on - all decentralised. And what was the result?

The  result  was  that  for  large  hospitals,  like  the

Singapore  General  Hospital or the  National  University

Hospital  which  I  was running at that  time,  they  had

enough  critical  mass.  They were able to  accumulate  a

very professional team.  But it was the smaller hospitals

that   suffered  because  of  their  lack  of  scale   of

operation.  They were not able to recruit a giant team as

they needed to, as in the large hospitals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own observation about this whole BPLRT incident

is  this.  As they split up into SMRT running the  larger

system  and,  inevitably, you have a  much  smaller  team

running SLRT.  With a smaller team, it is not just budget

constraint,  but also career development for  the  staff.

It  is harder to recruit top maintenance staff.  In fact,

I was at a conference this morning and met the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1509</b></font><br><br>



SLRT  management there.  My suggestion to them was:   why

not  consider  seriously,  as in  my  own  experience  in

hospital  management, centralising their  maintenance  so

that  they have one team that runs both the MRT and  LRT?

Of  course, from the financial point of view, we have  to

split  up  and  account their operation separately.   But

that  does not prevent us from running certain supportive

operations  centrally.  And that goes  with  maintenance,

human  resource management, training, etc. That would  be

my  advice  to them but, of course, it is a decision  for

the company to take.



<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Senior Minister  of

State  whether  he  could assure the residents  that  the

operation  of  the Bukit Panjang LRT is safe,  given  the

fact  that such an important component like a cotter  pin

can  go missing despite stringent maintenance procedures.

How  could  we  be sure that there are no other  critical

components  that  affect the safety that  might  also  be

missing?



<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in my main

reply, I have assured Members that LRT is safe.  Even  in

the  case of the guide-wheel where it dropped off, it was

in  the  central  trough and there  was  never  a  safety

concern.  I do not know whether it is necessary for me to

go  beyond  this.   The system is safe  and  that  is  an

assurance that I can give Members.



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  may I ask the Senior Minister of State whether  the

frequent breakdowns of the LRT since day one were due  to

design  fault,  construction  fault  or  maintenance   or

operation  fault, and whether the SLRT  or  the  Ministry

will  be  taking any legal action against  the  designer,

suppliers, contractors or the operator?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I understand the Ministry is doing an

independent audit of the system.  May I know what is  the

scope of work of this audit and whether the findings will

be presented to this House?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Senior Minister of State mentioned just

now that we need a giant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1510</b></font><br><br>



team  to maintain the system, so that would increase  the

cost  of maintaining and running the LRT.  Will the  cost

be passed to the commuters in the long run?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, on the measurement of 99.7%, is it measured

over  a  one-month,  three-month or a three-year  period?

Maybe  the Senior Minister of State can give us the exact

formula  and  how we measure the performance standard  of

the LRT.



<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member has

asked four questions.  I hope my memory can hold.  Let me

answer in reverse order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last question was: how is the 99.7% measured?

As  I have said, 99.7% is measured on a daily basis.   In

other words, over a 20-hour operating period - it runs  a

20-hour operation period - any disruptions, cumulative or

a single incident, cannot exceed four minutes.   So it is

a very, very stringent service level.  And the system has

been   able  to  deliver  that  until  the  October  21st

incident.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question was on the giant team and the

cost of maintenance and whether it would be passed on.  I

think  the cost of maintenance has to be part and  parcel

of  running the BPLRT system, both the LRT as well as the

SMRT.  Fare revision is a separate issue and that is  why

we have the Public Transport Council (PTC) to review what

is  the  cost  and  whether there are  justifications  to

revise  fares. That is a separate issue altogether.   But

as  we have always maintained, safety and reliability are

key  priorities.   When you provide  a  public  transport

system,  if it is not safe, if it is not reliable,  every

other  day  it  breaks  down, exceeding  the  four-minute

disruption  standard,  it  is  a  terrible  system.   But

whatever is the right level of cost, you just have got to

float  up  to that level.  Of course, there is no  reason

for us to pad up the maintenance crew so that the cost is

higher than necessary.  It is the job of the operator  to

make  sure  that they deliver that level  of  safety  and

reliability at minimal cost.  And as I have outlined just

now, my thinking is, to deliver that optimum level, there

is  a  case for centralisation rather than splitting  up.

Splitting up will inevitably raise costs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1511</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BPLRT has a life of about three years now and I

think  it  is useful to break it up into various  stages.

People always criticise the LRT about the 50 disruptions,

much  of it were teething problems in the earlier period.

If  you  look  at this year's performance record,  it  is

quite different.  We were not responsible for the earlier

opening  of the BPLRT.  If you ask me, as an engineer,  I

would have preferred to test the system thoroughly before

we  opened  it up because, like all complicated  systems,

there  will be problems.  There are bound to be  teething

problems.   For  example, the Esplanade  has  roofs  that

leak.   When I opened hospitals, I remember that for  the

first  six months, we have to fix several leaking  roofs.

This is normal for any sophisticated project.  And for  a

public  utility like transport, my preference would  have

been  to:   test, test and test again, until we are  very

sure,  then we open it.  And that is the approach we  are

taking  to the Sengkang LRT and that will be the approach

we are taking to the North-East line.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On hindsight, perhaps BPLRT should not have been

opened  prematurely.  If they had done that, I think  all

those  50 disruptions probably would have happened during

the trial period rather than when the system was open for

revenue service.  Anyway, that is history now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more important is to focus on the way going

forward.   My point is this.  Until the October incident,

for  four months, they have been able to deliver  on  the

very  high standard of 99.7%.  Let us not demoralise  the

existing  management team.  They are working  their  guts

out.  I know because I have seen them working.  They  are

serious  people.   I  think they are not  proud  of  what

happened  on  October 21st.  The lapses could  have  been

avoided  and I think resources will now be pumped  in  to

make sure that those mistakes do not crop up again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the scope of audit by LRT? It will be as

wide  as necessary.  The key question to answer is:   are

there  faults  in  the  maintenance  regime?   Are  there

shortcomings



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1512</b></font><br><br>



there  which  can  be  fixed?   Preliminary,  looking  at

things,   for   example,  looking  at  this   guide-wheel

incident, the procedures are correctly worded.  In  fact,

because  cotter  pin  is  such  an  important  piece   of

component,  the  SOP  in  the  maintenance  requires  two

signatures  - the one who inserts the pin signs  it  off;

the  one who supervises it signs it off.  Both signatures

were  there.  But what happened?  We discovered that  the

one  who supervised, the second signature, did it without

actually looking at it.  That is bad and that has  to  be

fixed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that there is any design problem.

This  is not the first time Bombardier installed an  LRT.

There  have  been many Bombardier systems all around  the

world.   I do not think we can say that that was a design

problem.  I did make a comment when I toured BPLRT that I

would  have  preferred not to retrofit  an  LRT  into  an

existing  town  because I have travelled on  BPLRT.   Two

weeks  ago, I took a trial run on the Sengkang LRT.   The

Sengkang LRT is planned and built together with  the  new

town.   When  you do so, you get a simpler  system.   The

tracks  are by and large, level.  Whereas if you  take  a

ride on our BPLRT, not quite a Disneyland roller coaster,

you get ups and downs, twists and turns.  As an engineer,

I  know that such twists and turns, ups and downs exert a

lot  of stresses on the system.  It causes much more wear

and  tear.   It does not mean that it cannot be  made  to

work,  but  it means that your maintenance must  be  top-class.   If  your  maintenance  is  not  top-class,  then

occasionally,  there will be lapses and disruptions  crop

up.  Having built the system and run it, let us now focus

on  the operation and make sure that maintenance is  top-class.  Today, it is not quite there yet but there is  no

reason  why  they cannot achieve top-class  if  they  put

their hearts and souls into it and we intend to make sure

that they do.



<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have heard

the Senior Minister of State confirm that the most likely

cause  is  due to a maintenance lapse.  Could the  Senior

Minister of State at least confirm that inspections  have

been carried out on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1513</b></font><br><br>



all guide-wheels on all trains to ensure that more cotter

pins have not been inevitably left out?



<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Yes, indeed. That was almost the

first task that was done.



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Nominated Member):</b> Can the

Minister  of  State  give the assurance  that  after  the

extensive  testing  of the Sengkang  and  North-East  MRT

lines  there  would be no teething problems  and  service

disruptions when the lines are operational?



<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a

Chinese  proverb, "mou shi zai ren, cheng shi zai  tian".

It  is for human beings to design and plan but, like  all

things, you cannot guarantee success.  I cannot.  I  will

be  dishonest to say that no incident will happen.   This

morning,  I  happened to have to officiate at a  seamless

transport conference and as a habit that I acquired  when

I  was in Istana, I always make sure that I am there five

minutes  before  a  function.  But,  today,  I  was  four

minutes  late.   So, there was a nine-minute  disruption.

Why?   Because,  half way through my journey,  I  noticed

that  the  temperature of my 7-year old  car  was  rising

beyond  the normal level.  I had no choice but  to  stop,

and  I  discovered that the radiator almost  ran  out  of

water.   So, I had to find some water to top it  up,  and

that  accounted  for  the  nine-minute  disruption.    As

Members  can  see,  even in private transport,  I  cannot

assure  100% that there will be no incident, but we  will

do  our  best.  If everybody plays his part, there  ought

not to be such incidents.



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, if I understand from the Senior

Minister  of State, he was saying that the Bukit  Panjang

LRT  was  not  tested properly before  it  was  put  into

operation.   Does that not warrant a total shutdown  now,

so  that  they could do a total investigation and testing

before  it is actually put into operation?  If the system

is  not tested properly and it is put into operation,  is

that not gross negligence on the part of the operator?



<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would not use

such  strong  words.  Like all things, you can  test  and

test and test, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1514</b></font><br><br>



never  start  the  system.  And what  is  the  limit  for

testing?   At the end of the day, someone has to  make  a

judgment on when to stop testing.  You are satisfied  and

you proceed.  A decision was made three years ago to open

at  that point in time.  On hindsight, everybody  is  now

wiser.  The more important thing is that after the  Bukit

Panjang LRT incident, we decided, and to use Singlish, to

be  more  kiasu here.  So we tested a lot more, which  is

what we are doing with Sengkang.



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, based on the Senior

Minister of State's explanation earlier, how can we  take

the  assurance  that  the LRT is safe  when  they  cannot

actually  predict  that it will  not  break  down?   They

cannot predict that it is actually safe.  How can we take

the assurance that it is safe?



<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> It is just like flying or driving

on the road.  You know that they are safe, but you cannot

eliminate  or  nullify accidents.  There  will  still  be

accidents.   Like in the case of the Bishan  MRT,  a  boy

decided to jump in front.  There is nothing we can do  to

prevent  such kind of incident.  But like all things,  we

do  our best.  There are procedures and our job, as human

beings, is to minimise errors, and processes are  put  in

to minimise errors.  And that is what we will do.

<div align="center"><b>ELDERSHIELD SCHEME</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Gan Kim Yong</b> asked the Minister for Health

(a)  what  were the main reasons for the large number  of

people opting out of the ElderShield Scheme; (b) will his

Ministry consider improving the Scheme so as to encourage

more  people to participate in it; and (c) what  can  his

Ministry  do  to  help those who have opted  out  of  the

Scheme.



<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan (Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Health (Dr Balaji Sadasivan) (for the Minister for Health):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  out  of  1.2  million  Singaporeans  and  permanent

residents  aged  40 to 69 years, more  than  800,000  are

covered  under  ElderShield.  To have more  than  800,000

persons  now covered under a severe disability  insurance

plan is a reasonably good start.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1515</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had initially expected the majority of those who

opted  out  to be from the very low and very high  income

groups.   This is because those in the low income  groups

may  worry  about not being able to sustain  the  premium

payments, while those in the high income groups may  have

other alternatives to take care of their care expenses in

the  event of severe disabilities.   We had also expected

the  opt-out rate to increase steeply for the  older  age

groups.   This is because the premiums for them would  be

relatively   higher  even  with  the  premium   subsidies

provided  by  the Government, and older persons  tend  to

have less understanding of insurance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as it turned out, the opt out rates did not

vary  that significantly across income and age groups  as

expected [see Annex A and B (Cols. 1661-1664)].  In Annex

A,  Members  can  see that the opt-out rate  of  the  low

income group is 35%, slightly higher than the average opt-out  rate  of 33%.  In Annex B, Members can see that  the

opt-out  rate  of the older age-group is 40%.   We  still

managed to attract 60-65% of the older age group and  the

lower income group to enroll for ElderShield.

<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2002/20021125/20021125-HA-0751663.gif">Chart - Proportion opted out within each age band (Cols. 1663-1664)</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There could be a few reasons why one third opted out

of  ElderShield. First, Singaporeans may  not  understand

fully  the  benefit of risk pooling and a pure  insurance

scheme,  without  death benefits or a savings  investment

feature.  Many may perceive it as money down the drain if

they  eventually  do  not  get  to  claim  the  benefits.

However, this is precisely what insurance is all about  - you buy protection but hope that you would not be unlucky

enough to claim it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Singaporeans may also have opted out because

they  think  ElderShield does not offer  good  value  for

money.    They  may  have  underestimated  the  risk   of

disability  because  our population  is  still  generally

young   today.   They  may  also  not  have  taken   into

consideration  the  feature that  once  you  have  joined

ElderShield,  the premiums do not increase as  one  grows

older, and coverage is for life.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1516</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the ElderShield is run by the private

sector.   Some Singaporeans may have preferred  that  the

scheme  be administered by the Government.  I would  like

to  highlight  that  ElderShield is awarded  to  the  two

private  insurers - NTUC Income and GE Life  Insurance  - through competitive tendering process.  The Ministry  has

also  put  in  place a framework on premium  rebates  and

limits  on  premium  adjustments based  on  actual  claim

experiences to safeguard the interests of Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ElderShield is one of the many schemes that the

Government has put in place to help Singaporeans pay  for

their  healthcare  costs.  For the low-income  group  who

have opted out, they would be helped through other means.

VWO  residential step-down care facilities are affordable

as they are subsidised, with charges at between $300-$500

a  month,  after  50-75% subsidy from  Government.   Low-income   Singaporeans  who  still   cannot   afford   the

subsidised   charges  will  be  eligible   for   Medifund

assistance through the step down care providers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, the immediate task of the Ministry

and  the  ElderShield insurers is to  ensure  the  smooth

operation of the scheme and that it serves the  needs  of

the policyholders.  The scheme has just rolled out.  When

we  have  gained sufficient experience on the scheme,  we

will work with the ElderShield insurers to offer enhanced

benefits  such as higher monthly payouts or payouts  over

longer periods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who have opted out, the deadline for

opting-back into ElderShield has been extended to the end

of  this  year.  I would like to urge them to re-consider

their decision.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, the Minister for

Health   mentioned  that  ElderShield  will  provide   an

enhanced scheme.  May I ask the Minister of State whether

now  is  a  good time to introduce an enhanced scheme  in

view  of  the  large  number  of  people  opting  out  of

ElderShield?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1517</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, first of all, I would like

to  disagree  that  a  large number  have  opted  out  of

ElderShield.   It is all a question of  opinion.   A  few

months  ago,  very  few  Singaporeans  had  any  kind  of

insurance against disability.  Today, 800,000 people  are

covered.   This  is  a  very large number  being  covered

today.   As for looking at enhanced benefits, the  scheme

has just started.  We need to monitor it over a period of

time to see how the scheme works, and then we will review

it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Sir, could the Minister of State

tell  us  how  many people have opted out of  the  scheme

because of the difficulty to qualify for the pay out, and

how many have opted out because the pay out is too low in

terms of quantum and too short in terms of duration?



<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, we have not surveyed the

people  who  have  opted out.  There is  still  time  for

people to opt in, and this is something that we can  look

into  when  the  scheme  closes.   However,  this  is  an

insurance scheme.  In an insurance scheme, the premium is

related  to the pay out and benefits.  This is  a  scheme

that  we have just started and, obviously, it covers what

is the minimum requirement and the premiums are as low as

they can be.



<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister  of State whether he would consider it important

to  find out what are the reasons that our citizens  have

opted  out of the scheme - whether it is because  of  the

pay  out  or  whether  is because of  the  difficulty  in

qualifying for the pay out.



<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> I have spoken to Singaporeans

who  have opted out.  Some of the reasons given are  that

they  feel the pay out should be more.  Others felt  that

the premium should be less.  This is quite natural.  Most

people  want  to  pay the least premium  and  expect  the

highest  pay  out.   But for an insurance  scheme  to  be

viable, there has to be a balance between the two.   That

is  why  we tendered out the scheme and selected the  two

insurers who offered the best deal for the public.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to me, about 400,000

people who opted out of ElderShield is a large number.  I

would like



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1518</b></font><br><br>



to  ask  the  Minister of State whether he is aware  that

many   older  and  poorer  Singaporeans  opted   out   of

ElderShield  because  they  cannot  afford  to  pay   the

premium.  Will the Minister of State extend more help  to

this group of people who are most in need of ElderShield?



<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, we realise that in the

older  population group, there may be people  who  cannot

afford  the  premiums.   But under  our  current  system,

should   they  become  disabled,  they  still   can   get

assistance  when  they  enter  into  nursing  homes  with

disabilities.   And in the event that they cannot  afford

to  pay  their bills, there is still MediFund  assistance

through the nursing homes.



<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, insurance

is  based on the pooling of risks.  So we need a  minimum

number.   What is that minimum number to make the  scheme

viable?   That is my first question.  My second  question

is:   given  that  about 400,000 people opted  out,  will

there  be a risk of anti-selection?  If that is the  case

and, in future, if the claims experience do stress on the

system  itself,  will  that lead to  a  revision  of  the

premiums?  Is there any guarantee of premium status quo?



<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, I am not an expert on

insurance.   The insurance companies are quite  satisfied

with the numbers as being viable.

<div align="center"><b>UN CHARTER ON THE COMPLETE ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN (CEDAW)</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Compliance with Article 10)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Charles Chong</b> asked the Acting Minister for

Community  Development and Sports (a)  whether  Singapore

had  registered any reservation to Article 10 of  the  UN

Charter  on  the  Complete Elimination of  All  Forms  of

Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) when it ratified the

convention  in  October  1995;   and   (b)  if  not,   is

Singapore  in compliance with Article 10 of  CEDAW  which

provides women with equal rights as men in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1519</b></font><br><br>



field of education, including the study of medicine.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, Singapore did

not tender any reservation to Article 10 of UN CEDAW,  as

equal   access  to  education  is  one  of  the  cardinal

principles in the Singapore education system.  Women made

up  52.5% of the local university population in the  2001

intake.  But equal access to education does not mean that

every  student has a free choice as to the type of course

he or she may pursue.  It depends on the number of places

available  for  each  course, which depends  on  national

needs and the cost of providing different courses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of training a medical student is five times

higher than that for other disciplines in the university.

It costs over $400,000 over five years to train a medical

student,  80%  of which is subsidised by the  Government.

This means a relatively higher investment by taxpayers in

medical education compared to other disciplines.   Hence,

the  Government  has imposed a quota  on  the  intake  of

female medical students wishing to study medicine in  NUS

as,  comparatively, more female doctors tend to leave the

workforce prematurely or switch to part-time work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not regard this policy a violation of our

obligations  under the CEDAW, within the overall  context

of  our  health care and education systems in  Singapore,

as:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) There is no quota on the number of female

doctors allowed to practise medicine in Singapore;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) There are no discriminatory practices against

female  doctors in our health care organisations.   Women

doctors  have  equal opportunities to  take  up  training

opportunities and assume responsibilities for which  they

have the necessary qualifications and experience; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) We have to address a real and practical

problem,  ie,  of  ensuring Singaporeans have  sufficient

doctors to attend



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1520</b></font><br><br>



to  their health care needs, bearing in mind the cost  of

medical education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, Sir, the Remaking Singapore Committee

has  recommended that the quota on the female  intake  at

NUS  Medical School be lifted, and will be submitting its

report  to the Government early next year.  The  Ministry

of Health would study and respond to its recommendations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, could the Minister confirm

that  there is no discrimination, that there is  complete

equal  opportunity,  and there is  no  discrimination  by

virtue  of  gender in the field of education?   That  was

what my question was.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, to the best of

my  knowledge,  there is no such thing.  Every  child  is

given equal opportunity to access to the schools that  we

have in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the

disagreement  on  the interpretation  of  Article  10  of

CEDAW,  would  the Minister then consider  referring  the

interpretation of Article 10 to arbitration  as  required

by Article 29.1 of CEDAW?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, we believe

that  we  are not violating the principle of Article  10,

for  the  reasons  which I have given earlier,  that  the

basis  of  our  education system is equal access  to  all

gender  in  Singapore.   But yet  at  the  same  time  we

recognise  that even if you are free to choose a  course,

it  all depends on other factors.  It is inevitable  that

some  students who would be left out of some  courses  in

which he or she may prefer.  The inevitable fact is  that

because  of  the size of our country we need to  maximise

our  human resources so that we can best serve the  needs

of all Singaporeans.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I beg to differ

with  the Minister for Community Development and  Sports,

because  actually the attrition rate for  female  doctors

now  is  about the same as the male doctors, contrary  to

what he said earlier.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1521</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also ask the Minister whether it is correct to

say that the National University of Singapore is the only

highly  ranked university in the world that deprives  the

entry  of medical students on the basis of gender?   Does

this  not hamper the vision of NUS as being a world-class

university  and  does  this  not  run  contrary  to   the

meritocratic system in Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, I do not think

in  any  way  does this policy affect NUS in its  aim  to

become a world-class institution.  At the end of the day,

I  think  we have to address the larger issue of  how  we

maximise  our resources, given the limited pool  that  we

have.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on her first question whether NUS is the

only  university that discriminates against women, I have

no  knowledge  of  that as far as other universities  are

concerned, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, can I ask the Acting

Minister why the decision as to whether we should reverse

the  policy of female intake into the medical course  has

to  await  the recommendations of the Remaking  Singapore

Committee?  After all, when the decision to restrict  the

intake was taken years ago, I do not recall that it  took

a  committee to make the decision.  So surely  Government

is  capable  of  making  such a decision  after  so  many

pressing  demands from Backbenchers over the years.   Why

do  we  now  have  to wait for a few months  more  for  a

committee to come to a decision?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, we are not

waiting  for  the Committee to submit the  proposal.   We

understand   that  this  has  been  raised   by   several

Backbenchers.   But the Remaking Singapore Committee  has

actually met people who are interested in this particular

issue and gathered feedback and submitted the proposal to

Government.     They  have  built  up  a  consensus   and

submitted to the Government for consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that

the  Sub-Committee had not only made its recommendations,

it   had   also  called  a  press  conference   and   its

recommendations were announced by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1522</b></font><br><br>



Government.  So what more have we got to wait for?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> As I said earlier,

the  matter is under the Ministry of Health and  I  think

they  will study the proposal constructively and we  will

wait for their recommendations, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I recognise what the Minister  said  about

equal access to opportunities, but would not the issue of

having  quota  for the female students in medical  school

mean that there is access, but based on gender?  If it is

based  on gender, then would it not be discriminatory  in

itself  because  the gender becomes a factor  in  getting

access to the medical school?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, I would not

disagree with the Member's interpretation.  As it  stands

now,  there  is  a selection process to  ensure  that  we

maintain a balance between the number of male doctors and

female doctors that we have in our institution.

<div align="center"><b>FOREIGN WORKERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin</b> asked the Minister for

Manpower whether his Ministry will consider lowering  the

foreign  worker  levy and raising the  quota  of  foreign

workers  in  value-added or highly specialised industries

where  SMEs are facing difficulties in attracting skilled

local workers to fill vacancies in their operations.



<br><br><!-- Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin</b> asked the Minister for

Manpower whether the Ministry will consider allowing  the

employment   of   foreign  workers  from  non-traditional

sources for the textile industry or other industries with

high export activities.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, may I have your permission to take Question

Nos.  12 and 13 together as they are both related to  the

same subject?



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1523</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Thank you. Mr Speaker, Sir, our

unemployment  rate  rose to 4.8% in September  2002,  the

last quarter.  This was the highest level for the past 15

years.  Sir, unemployment is projected to rise to as high

as  5.5%  by  the  end of this year.   Our  economic  and

employment  outlook  for the next six  months  is  rather

uncertain.   It is therefore critical for the  Government

to strike a judicious balance between meeting businesses'

needs for low-wage foreign workers and helping unemployed

Singaporeans to find jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the foreign worker levy was already lowered on

1st  January 1999.  The reduction was $70 for the skilled

foreign workers and $90 for the unskilled foreign workers

in  the  manufacturing and services sectors.  The reduced

levies  will  remain in force until December  2002.   The

current  lower-tier  levy of $30 is already  a  very  big

concession  to  help  employers  keep  costs  down.   The

outcome  of  my  Ministry's review on the foreign  worker

levy  will  be  announced in early  December  before  the

current moratorium expires.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our key challenge now is to re-deploy the

unemployed and the retrenched workers to industries where

there  are opportunities for gainful employment.   It  is

therefore unwise and not in the interest of Singapore  to

raise  the  dependency  ceiling or  to  allow  more  non-traditional  sources workers into our  labour  market  at

this juncture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should focus on retraining and re-orientating

displaced workers for current and imminent job vacancies.

For  employers,  the present slack labour  market  offers

good opportunities to recruit local workers so as to meet

their  manpower  needs  and to  enable  them  to  recruit

additional   work  permit  holders  under   the   current

dependency ceiling.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, in view of the

fact  that we have a very high unemployment rate  now  of

4.8%, I would like to ask the Minister what mechanism  is

in  place right now in the Ministry before approving  any

work  permit  applications, to ensure that the  employers

actually exhaust all possibilities in recruiting local



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1524</b></font><br><br>



employees who are Singaporean workers first?  I feel that

there  could be a possibility that there could be  abuse,

in the sense that employers look to foreign workers as an

easy  alternative, instead of exhausting all avenues  and

possibilities, in terms of trying to redesign work, or in

terms  of  trying to retrain workers before resorting  to

foreign workers.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we now have two

contrary  views  or opinions on this situation.   I  just

like to remind hon. Members that what I said was that  we

should  strike a judicious balance.  We should not  shift

from  one  end  of the spectrum to the  other  end.   The

Member's  proposal that we apply labour market  test,  in

other words, we make sure that the employer has conducted

proper recruitment exercise and has offered similar  jobs

to Singaporeans and these offers were turned down, before

we  approve  the work permit application.   This  is  one

possibility.   Some countries do implement labour  market

test.   But in our context, if we introduce labour market

test, we would increase the rigidity in our labour market

and  I think that is not good for us because, on the  one

hand,  while  we have rising unemployment, on  the  other

hand,  many  of  our industries are still actually  quite

dependent  on  some  percentages  of  lower-wage  foreign

workers to maintain their competitiveness.  Our companies

have to survive in the global market and if we force them

to  employ  higher-wage workers, then we might  seriously

cripple their ability to compete.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, while unemployment has gone up, we should not

swing   too  far  towards  trying  to  protect  displaced

Singaporeans.  What we should do, as I have said,  is  to

help  them, equip them with the skills so that  they  can

take  on  the  new  jobs  that are  available,  and  also

encourage employers to give them an opportunity.  So as I

said  earlier  on that in the light of our  slack  labour

market,  it  is an opportunity for employers  to  recruit

more  Singaporeans.  And, if they have more  Singaporeans

then they can recruit more work permit holders under  our

present dependency ceiling.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1525</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to elaborate that this is a serious

invitation  to  employers  because  the  Government   has

offered   through   the  People  for   Jobs   Traineeship

Programme, a wage subsidy for up to six months or a limit

of  50%  of the first six months' salary, up to $2,000  a

month, for employers to recruit Singaporean workers  aged

40  and  above.   If  you do so, we give  you  this  wage

subsidy, and on top of it you can recruit another foreign

worker  in  the manufacturing sector under the dependency

ceiling  of  50%.   So  it is a win-win  situation.   You

recruit  a Singaporean and you get an additional  foreign

worker.   Overall, it averages downwards your wage  cost.

So  I  would  urge  employers to take advantage  of  this

scheme  to  reach  out to the unemployed Singaporeans  to

give them a chance, to help them to make this adjustment,

rather  than  to just look towards getting  more  foreign

workers, getting more non-traditional source workers,  or

to ask Government to further lower the levy.  At $30, the

levy is almost practically nothing.  It is already such a

generous  concession.  How much lower can we go?   Cancel

the   levy  completely?   I  think  that  would  be  most

unreasonable,  and I think that could be very  disruptive

to our own resident labour market.



<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Mr Speaker, given that

Government has been doing all these things to  make  sure

that  Singaporeans  are  trained  and  available  to   be

employed,  what  is the problem faced by SMEs  that  they

have  all  these  difficulties attracting local  workers?

Has MOM done anything to study what are the problems that

SMEs  are  facing  because we have all these  schemes  in

place?  Is there any kind of help that has been given  to

the SMEs to understand all these schemes and for them  to

actually utilise what is already made available?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

problem  that  we are facing today is a problem  that  we

have discussed before, that of a mismatch in expectation,

both   in   terms  of  wages  and  in  terms  of  working

conditions,  and also a mismatch in the skills  that  are

required by the SMEs and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1526</b></font><br><br>



the  skills  that the displaced workers have  with  them.

That  is  why  our  overall strategy  towards  addressing

rising unemployment is to offer workers, or those who are

unemployed, more opportunities for skills upgrading,  and

at  the same time, to raise their awareness that economic

restructuring is going on.  Old jobs that they have  lost

are  unlikely to come back and new jobs would require new

skill-set, which they must make an effort to acquire, and

in  order  to  fit into these new jobs they may  have  to

start  lower down the ladder from where they were before,

because  they have now moved to a new industry,  doing  a

different  kind  of work.  So there are quite  a  lot  of

adjustments  that are needed, both on  the  part  of  the

worker,  the  person looking for a job, and also  on  the

part of the employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also helping companies, particularly SMEs, to

look   into  how  they  can  restructure  their  business

operations.  One thing that the employers need to  do  is

to look into how to improve the productivity of the jobs.

If  he has a job, if the job can be re-engineered into  a

more  productive  job, then he could  obviously  offer  a

higher salary to the worker and still remain competitive.

If  he  continues to do business in the old  way,  in  an

unproductive manner, then his wages would be  constrained

by  his low level of productivity and he will not be able

to offer wages that can attract more Singaporeans to take

up  this job.  One thing that employers have to do is  to

take  a  hard  look at their business operation  and,  if

possible,  restructure their business so  that  they  can

offer  more value-added and more productive jobs  to  job

seekers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 2002 seeks to give

legislative  effect  to the income  tax  changes  that  I

announced  in this year's Budget Statement.  I have  also

taken  the  opportunity to make other amendments  to  the

Income Tax Act to allow for changes that were not covered

in the Budget Statement.



<br><br><i>Tax changes announced in the 2002 Budget Statement</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall begin with the tax changes announced in the

<br><br>2002&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget Statement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1528</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) To help us maintain our tax competitiveness,

the  corporate tax rate will be reduced from 24.5% to 22%

with effect from the Year of Assessment 2003. Clauses 30,

38,  47,  48  and 52 amend the Act to provide  for  these

changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) In a move to simplify the tax code and reduce

tax compliance and administration costs, the current full

imputation  corporate taxation system  will  be  replaced

with a one-tier corporate tax system with effect from 1st

January  2003.   Under  the new  one-tier  corporate  tax

system,  tax will only be imposed at the corporate  level

and  any dividends paid by the company will be tax-exempt

in  the  hands of its shareholders.  The flow-through  of

exempt   dividends  will  be  for  unlimited   tiers   of

shareholders  with no minimum shareholdings  requirement.

As  an anti-avoidance measure, preference dividends  paid

out  of exempt income currently subject to tax under  the

imputation system will be deemed as interest and so  will

be  taxable.   In  addition,  dividend  franking  credits

available during the 5-year transitional period  for  the

change  in  the tax system and exempt dividends  will  be

capped in proportion to the shareholder's shareholding in

the dividend paying company.  Clauses 10, 11, 12, 14, 17,

45,  46,  52, 58, 60 and 61 amend the Act to provide  for

these changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) To reduce the cost of doing business in

Singapore, a loss-transfer system of group relief will be

introduced with effect from the Year of Assessment  2003.

Transfers  of  the  current  year's  unutilised   capital

allowances, losses and donations will be allowed  between

group companies.  Clauses 28, 31, 33 and 62 amend the Act

to provide for this purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) To boost our fund management industry, the

qualifying  investment income of foreign  investors  from

funds  managed by all fund managers in Singapore will  be

exempt from tax.  Clause 13 amends the Act to provide for

this purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) To further enhance the attractiveness of

managing  a foreign trust in Singapore, the tax exemption

granted on income from foreign trusts administered by  an

approved trustee company,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1529</b></font><br><br>



will  be  extended to income derived through an  eligible

holding company.  Clause 16 amends the Act to provide for

the change.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) To encourage further development of the equity

capital market, income derived by Asian Currency Units of

financial  institutions and Approved Securities Companies

from  managing the initial public offering of  securities

of  foreign  companies listing on the Singapore  Exchange

will  be  taxed  at  a  concessionary  rate  of  5%.   In

addition,  corporate SGX members who are  ranked  amongst

the  top  20 in terms of annual trading volume  generated

for  each approved new derivative product denominated  in

any  foreign currency will enjoy a concessionary tax rate

of  5% on total income derived from transactions in  each

product.   This will apply to new products that  commence

trading on SGX during the period 1st January 2002 to 31st

December 2006. Clauses 39 and 40 amend the Act to provide

for these changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) To further develop our bond market, the 10%

concessionary  tax rate on interest from qualifying  debt

securities will be extended to bodies of persons.  Clause

36 amends the Act to provide for this change.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) To enhance Singapore's competitiveness as an

insurance  centre,  approved general insurance  companies

will  be  allowed  to  claim  tax  deduction  on  special

reserves set aside for certain offshore risks with effect

from  the Year of Assessment 2003.  Clause 25 amends  the

Act to provide for this purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) To encourage Singapore-based companies to tap

research and development (or "R&D") capabilities globally

to  upgrade their operations in Singapore, I announced  a

single  tax  deduction  for  expenses  incurred  on   R&D

activities  which are outsourced to any R&D organisation,

whether  local or overseas.  In addition,  the  scope  of

further  tax deduction for R&D expenses will be  extended

from specified services to all services.  Clauses 22  and

23 amend the Act to provide for these changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(j) In order to enhance our attractiveness to

international shipping companies,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1530</b></font><br><br>



the   scope   of  the  Approved  International   Shipping

Enterprise  Scheme  will be expanded  to  include  towage

vessels  and  salvage ships as qualifying ships  for  the

purpose  of the scheme.  Clauses 10 and 15 amend the  Act

to provide for this change.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(k) To further support regionalisation, the

unilateral  tax credit scheme will be extended  to  cover

all   services   income  remitted  from  all   non-treaty

countries  with effect from the Year of Assessment  2003.

Clause  54  amends  the Act to provide for  this  change.



(l)  I will now cover changes related to individuals.  To

promote   the   international  arbitration  industry   in

Singapore, payments to international arbitrators will  be

exempt  from  withholding tax with effect  from  3rd  May

2002.   Clause  10  amends the Act to  provide  for  this

purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(m) To reward effort and achievement, promote

entrepreneurship, and attract and retain talent, the  top

marginal income tax rate will be further reduced to  22%,

with   corresponding  cuts  in  all  income  bands.    In

addition,  the  personal income  tax  structure  will  be

simplified by consolidating the existing 10 bands  to  7.

This  will take effect from the Year of Assessment  2003.

Clauses  34  and  63 amend the Act to provide  for  these

changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(n) To attract talent to relocate to Singapore and

use  it  as  a base for regional activities, as  well  as

create  favourable conditions for Singaporeans  who  have

been  away  for  some time to re-establish themselves  in

Singapore, special tax treatment will be given  to  these

taxpayers  classified  as  `not ordinarily  resident'  or

`NOR' taxpayers.  An NOR taxpayer will be exempt from tax

on  income earned before he came to Singapore and on  his

employer's contribution to his overseas pension fund.  In

addition, an NOR taxpayer who spends at least 90  days  a

year  outside Singapore on business will pay tax only  on

his  Singapore employment income, based on the number  of

days  he spends here. This is subject to a floor rate  of

10%  on his total employment income.  The NOR scheme will

take effect from the Year of Assessment 2003.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1531</b></font><br><br>



Clause 20 amends the Act to provide for these changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(o) To further enhance our share option incentive

scheme,  I  announced the following changes  to  the  tax

treatment  of  stock option and other forms  of  employee

share ownership plans:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Gains from stock options granted in

respect  of  overseas  employment  will  not  be   taxed.

Correspondingly,  gains  from stock  options  granted  in

respect  of Singapore employment will be taxed no  matter

where the stock options are exercised;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Where there is a moratorium on the shares,

the  taxable gains arising from the shares acquired  will

be taxable only after the moratorium is lifted;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The scope of existing stock options

incentive  schemes is also extended to  include  employee

share  ownership  plans so long as  there  is  a  holding

period requirement that achieves a similar effect as  the

standard vesting requirement; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Departing employees who are neither

Singapore  citizens nor Permanent Residents, or  who  are

Permanent Residents leaving Singapore for good,  will  be

deemed to have exercised their stock options at the  time

they cease employment, and pay taxes accordingly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2, 18, 19, 26 and 57 amend the Act to

provide for these changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(p) To further recognise the contributions of

NSmen, the current NSmen reliefs will be increased by 50%

with effect from the Year of Assessment 2003.  Clause  34

amends the Act to provide for these changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(q) The Government recognises that withdrawing the

procreation  tax rebate from divorcees can add  to  their

already  difficult burden.  Divorcees will  therefore  be

allowed  to  continue  to  claim  their  procreation  tax

rebates  with  effect from the Year of  Assessment  2003.

Clause 37 amends the Act to provide for this change.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1532</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(r) To encourage families to look after aged

parents  in their own homes, a handicapped parent  relief

of  $3,000  on  top of the normal parent relief  will  be

introduced with effect from the Year of Assessment  2003.

Clause 34 amends the Act to provide for this purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(s) The original objective of granting double child

relief   to   subsidise   the   overseas   education   of

expatriates'   children  is  no  longer  relevant.    The

Government therefore decided to reduce the quantum of the

relief  from $4,000 to $3,000 for the Year of  Assessment

2003,  and to withdraw the relief altogether with  effect

from  the Year of Assessment 2004.  Clause 64 amends  the

Act to provide for this change.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(t) To reduce compliance costs, a final income tax

of 15% will be levied on the gross income of non-resident

professionals.   However, non-resident professionals  can

still opt within a specified period to be taxed at 22% on

income  net  of  expenses if it is more  advantageous  to

them.  Clauses 38, 51 and 52 amend the Act to provide for

these changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(u) To promote the spirit of philanthropy in

individuals and corporations, the following measures were

introduced:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Donations to Institutions of a Public

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Character (IPCs) will

be allowed double tax deduction;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Tax deductions for donations to IPCs can

be carried forward for up to five years of assessment;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Some IPCs name their buildings or

scholarships  after  their  donors.   These   and   other

donations  with  similar  naming  opportunities  will  be

allowed a single tax deduction;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 31 amends the Act to provide for these three

changes.



<br><br><i>Tax changes not announced in the 2002 Budget Statement</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now move on to tax changes that are not

covered in the 2002 Budget Statement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1533</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>2001 Off-Budget Measures</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the 2001 Off-Budget package, the

following measures were introduced:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The Government would grant a 50% corporate tax

rebate  on the first $25,500 of tax payable and a further

5%  rebate  on any tax payable above $25,500 to companies

on  their  corporate income tax payable for the  Year  of

Assessment  2001.   For the Year of  Assessment  2002,  a

corporate tax rebate of 5% was granted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Government would grant an additional 5%

personal income tax rebate to individuals on their income

tax  payable  for the Year of Assessment 2001.   For  the

Year  of  Assessment 2002, a 10% personal tax rebate  was

granted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government would remove the income tax on gains

from  short-term property transactions, contracted on  or

after 13th October 2001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 5, 6, 49, 59 and 65 amend the Act for these

purposes.



<br><br><i>Global Trader Program</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With effect from 1st June 2001, the Approved Oil

Trader  scheme  and Approved International Trader  scheme

were  merged  into  a generic trading scheme  called  the

Global  Trader Program.  Clauses 41, 42 and 44 amend  the

Act for this purpose.



<br><br><i>Comptroller  of Income Tax's powers to access  and  seize records</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the Comptroller of Income Tax's powers

to  access and seize records is limited only to  physical

documents.   The Act is amended to enable the Comptroller

to  have access to and take possession of information and

records kept in electronic or other formats.  Clauses  55

and 56 amend the Act for this purpose.



<br><br><i>Property Trusts</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act is also amended to provide that property

trusts that are in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1534</b></font><br><br>



business of making investments, like other companies that

are  in  the business of making investments, will not  be

allowed  to carry forward to future years the  excess  of

expenses  and capital allowances over income.   Clause  4

amends the Act for this purpose.



<br><br><i>Supplementary Retirement Scheme</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS), non-Singaporeans are subject to withholding tax on

withdrawals  in  excess  of  contributions  made  in  the

preceding years, but not in the current year.  The Act is

amended to close this loophole by extending applicability

of the withholding tax to the current year also.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act is amended to allow the Minister to remit,

for  a good cause, the 5% penalty for pre-retirement  SRS

withdrawals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act is also amended to make clear that an

individual  must be a non-Singaporean SRS account  holder

for  a  continuous period of at least 10 years to qualify

for  a waiver of penalty and 50% tax discount on his  SRS

withdrawals.  Clauses 8 and 50 amend the  Act  for  these

purposes.



<br><br><i>Foreign income taxed at concessionary rate</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 amends the Act to make clear that

Singapore-based  companies may offset their  losses  from

local  operations against certain foreign income remitted

into  Singapore at a concessionary tax rate under section

13(8) of the Income Tax Act.



<br><br><i>Capital allowance for purchase or development of websites</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 27 amends the Act to provide for a 100% write-off of capital expenditure incurred on the purchase or

development of websites.  This will encourage  businesses

to  leverage  on information technology to  expand  their

customer reach or offer new electronic services.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1535</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Securities, lending or repurchase arrangements</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clauses 3, 7, 9 and 26 amend the Act to

provide   the   tax  treatment  applicable   to   certain

securities lending or repurchase arrangements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will amend the Stamp Duties Act to give

legislative effect to the following measures:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) To specify the conditions under which stamp

duty relief may be granted for gifts of property made  as

a consequence of marriage;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) To charge stamp duty on an arrangement to

dispose  of shares by cancelling existing shares and  re-issuing new shares;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) To limit stamp duty exemption only to co-operative societies, instead of granting exemption of

stamp  duty  to all parties transacting with co-operative

societies;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) To give finality to the assessment by the

Commissioner  of  Stamp Duties if the taxpayer  does  not

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f) To charge ad valorem duty on transfer of shares

and/or  properties to a shareholder where  he  becomes  a

shareholder  only  after  winding  up  proceedings   have

commenced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now explain the main amendments in the

Bill.



<br><br><i>Transfers made in consideration of marriage</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is common for parents to transfer property to

their children, when they marry, to provide a matrimonial

home  for  them.  The current Act already provides  stamp

duty  relief for property that is transferred to a newly-wedded  couple  by  their  family  as  a  wedding   gift.

However, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1537</b></font><br><br>



conditions to qualify for this relief are not specified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill amends section 16 of the Act by

inserting a new section 16(3A) to specify that the relief

is  only granted for the transfer of property to a  party

to  the marriage.  The property must be transferred  from

their  spouse  or a parent, grandparent or sibling  of  a

party  to  the marriage.  In addition, the transfer  must

take  place  within one year of the date of solemnisation

of  the  marriage, and the property must be used  as  the

matrimonial home of the couple.  These conditions are put

in place to ensure that the transfer represents a genuine

gift to the couple for their marriage.



<br><br><i>Stamp duty on disposal and re-issue of shares</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, no stamp duty is levied on the

cancellation  and  issue  of  shares.   Thus,  a  company

intending  to sell existing shares to a buyer  may  avoid

incurring  stamp  duty  by  cancelling  existing   shares

followed with an allotment and issue of new shares to the

same  purchaser for a consideration.  Clause 5 will close

this loophole by amending section 33 of the Act to impose

one set of stamp duty on a document that effects such  an

arrangement to cancel and re-issue shares.



<br><br><i>Limiting   stamp  duty  exemption  only  to  co-operative societies</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, section 36(e) exempts instruments

executed  by or on behalf of co-operative societies  from

stamp   duty,  if  the  underlying  transaction  in   the

instrument relates solely to the business of the society.

Both  the  co-operative society and the party  it  enters

into a contract with are exempted from stamp duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the current laws, parties entering into such

commercial agreements with co-operatives would  stand  to

benefit  from  stamp duty exemption.  There  is  no  good

reason for parties transacting with the co-operatives  to

enjoy the exemption from stamp duty, as they have entered

into   the   agreement   based   on   purely   commercial

considerations.  Thus, clause 6



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1538</b></font><br><br>



amends  section 36(e) of the Act to limit  the  exemption

from  stamp duty only to co-operative societies, and  not

to extend it to the parties transacting with co-operative

societies.



<br><br><i>Objections to the Commissioner's assessment</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, objections to the Commissioner's

assessment  under  section 37 of the  Act  must  be  made

within  30 days.  Section 16(3) of the Act also  empowers

the  Commissioner to impose an additional dutiable amount

when he assesses that the consideration is far lower than

the  market value.  However, there is no finality to  the

time  period  within which a taxpayer can object  to  the

Commissioner's assessment under section 37.  As such,  it

is possible for a taxpayer to dispute the assessment many

years after the assessment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 amends section 39A(1) such that any

objection   to  the  Commissioner's  assessment   of   an

additional dutiable amount must be made within  30  days.

The  30-day  time  period is the same as  that  currently

provided  in the Income Tax Act for a taxpayer  to  raise

any objections to the assessment of income tax.



<br><br><i>Levying two sets of Stamp Duty on exchanges of properties</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, for an exchange of properties, only one

set  of stamp duty is payable, based on the property with

the  higher value.  However, a transaction involving  the

exchange  of  properties between two  parties  should  be

treated  as  two transactions involving two parties  each

buying  and selling a property at the same time.   Hence,

an  exchange of properties should be levied with two sets

of stamp duty.  Clause 9 amends the First Schedule of the

Act to effect this.



<br><br><i>Stamp  duty  on  distribution of assets  in  specie  upon liquidation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 also amends the First Schedule of the Act

such  that  if a person becomes a shareholder only  after

winding-up proceedings have commenced, he would be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1539</b></font><br><br>



charged  ad  valorem duty on the transfer  of  shares  or

properties  instead  of  a  fixed  duty  of  $10.    This

amendment will prevent opportunistic attempts to  acquire

the liquidating company's assets with minimal stamp duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Lee Hsien Loong].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>PAYMENT AND SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS (FINALITY AND NETTING) BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br>2.28 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Payment and Settlement Systems (Finality and

Netting)  Bill seeks to make provision for the protection

of  payment and settlement systems from disruptions  that

may  lead  to  risks  in  the financial  system.   Proper

protection  of such systems is critical to the  effective

functioning   of   the  financial   system.    The   Bill

strengthens  the  legal environment for operating  stable

and  secure  payment and settlement systems by empowering

the  Monetary  Authority of Singapore (MAS) to  designate

payment and settlement systems.  These designated systems

will  be  exempted from the application of certain  legal

rules,  including  the  rule in insolvency  law  for  the

unwinding of certain types of transactions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I go into the Bill proper, let me first

give  some  background  on the importance  of  protecting

payment and settlement systems from disruptions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1540</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Importance  of protecting payment and settlement  systems from disruptions</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment and settlement systems consist of sets of

instruments,   banking  procedures  and  funds   transfer

systems  that ensure the circulation of money.  They  are

therefore  an  important part of the market and  economic

infrastructure.  However, payment and settlement  systems

also  provide  a  channel for shocks  to  be  transmitted

across  financial  markets.  This is especially  true  in

large  value  inter-bank payment and  settlement  systems

that  are systemic in nature, where one disruption  could

trigger  or transmit further disruptions to the financial

system.   Take,  for instance, MEPS, the Real-Time  Gross

Settlement  system operated by the MAS for the settlement

of  funds between banks.  In 2001, MEPS processed a total

of  $11.6  trillion of payments; this was  more  than  75

times the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Singapore  over

the  same  year.  Clearly, any disruption  to  the  sound

operation  of  MEPS  would have a significant  impact  on

Singapore's  financial  system.  Therefore,  payment  and

settlement systems with systemic implications  like  MEPS

must have a robust architecture, well-planned contingency

arrangements,  proper  operational procedures  and  clear

rules for participants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is equally important for these payment and

settlement  systems  to have a sound  legal  basis.   The

rules,  regulations  and  agreements  relevant  to   such

systems  must  be  legally enforceable.   In  particular,

transactions  that  have  already  been  settled  by  the

systems should be final and irrevocable, and must not  be

unwound  or  otherwise adjusted by any legal proceedings.

Any  netting  arrangements in the payment and  settlement

systems  should  likewise  be  enforceable.   While   the

payment  and  settlement systems should have  contractual

arrangements  and  rules  in  place  to  set  out   these

provisions,  existing laws can operate to override  them.

For  instance, the law of insolvency allows a  liquidator

of  an  insolvent corporation to reverse, or  "claw-back"

payment  transactions that have already been  settled  if

these  transactions are deemed to be unfair  or  to  have

been made at a significant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1541</b></font><br><br>



undervalue.  Such claw-back provisions are based  on  the

general principle that favours the equal distribution  of

assets  to  the  creditors of an  insolvent  corporation.

This  principle  must, however, be balanced  against  the

disruption that might be caused to payment and settlement

systems  and  to  the participants if  it  applies  to  a

disposition made through these systems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is therefore a strong case for the law to

recognise the importance of the integrity and finality of

transactions  in  payment  and  settlement   systems   in

maintaining  financial  stability  and  for  the  law  to

protect  these systems from the legal risks that  I  have

just  outlined.   The legislatures in countries  such  as

Australia,  the United States of America, Canada  and  in

many  European  countries have  already  taken  steps  to

address   these   legal   risks   by   enacting   similar

legislation.



<br><br><i>Enhancing Singapore's Legal Framework to Protect Designated System</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, section 59A of the Banking Act has

provided   for   the   finality  and  irrevocability   of

transactions  made  through MEPS  since  1998.   However,

section  59A  is  not wide enough to  cover  payment  and

settlement systems that are not operated by MAS.  We  are

an  important international financial centre.   With  the

continuing advancement of technology, greater competition

and  increased  scale  and  sophistication  of  financial

players, there will be new payment and settlement systems

in  Singapore  that  require the same  legal  protection.

The Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) system is one such

system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Continuous Linked Settlement system is a global

payment and settlement system that aims to reduce foreign

exchange  (FX) settlement risk.   Launched  in  September

this   year,   with  the  participation  of  over   sixty

international banks and seven major currencies,  CLS  has

already  reached  a  daily  settlement  value  of  US$300

billion  and it is expected eventually to settle a  large

percentage  of  the US$1.2 trillion a day global  foreign

exchange market.  The Singapore Dollar



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1542</b></font><br><br>



is  expected  to  be included as a CLS  currency  in  the

second  quarter of next year.  The three local  banks  in

Singapore have established the capability to join CLS  as

participants  in December 2002.  As one  of  the  largest

foreign   exchange   trading  centres   in   the   world,

Singapore's  participation  in  CLS  will  reinforce  our

position as a key node in the global financial system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Payment and Settlement Systems (Finality and

Netting)  Bill  will provide an omnibus solution  to  the

legal  risks  that surround the operation of payment  and

settlement  systems  by  according  legal  protection  to

systems that are designated by MAS.  It will allow us  to

provide for the integrity and finality of transactions in

systems  such as MEPS and CLS, as well as any new payment

and  settlement  systems that may be  introduced  in  the

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now highlight the major provisions that

are being introduced in this Bill.



<br><br><i>Major Provisions in the Bill</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 gives MAS the power to designate payment

and   settlement  systems  to  provide  them   with   the

protection offered under this Bill.  Clause 4  gives  MAS

the   power   to  revoke  the  designation   in   certain

circumstances.   In determining whether  to  designate  a

system,  MAS will take into account a number of  factors,

in  particular  the systemic risks associated  with  that

system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part II of the Bill sets out the protection that is

accorded  to  transactions effected through a  designated

system  when a participant in that designated  system  is

bankrupt, in judicial management or winding up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, clause 7 gives statutory backing to any

rule  of  the  designated system that  provides  for  the

finality  of fund transfers into and out of the  accounts

of  participants, as well as the finality of transactions

settled in the system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, clause 8 provides that the regime

established  by the rules of a designated  system  is  to

take  precedence  over the insolvency  law  principle  of

equal and pro-rated distribution of assets.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1543</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 9 and 10 then go on to make clear that the

legal   provisions  providing  for  the  "claw-back"   of

transactions  that are unfair preferences or transactions

at  an  undervalue,  and other like provisions,  are  not

applicable  to transactions effected through a designated

system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 gives effect to the default arrangements

that  are provided in the rules of the designated  system

and  provides that only the net sum, following completion

of  action taken under the default arrangements, shall be

provable or payable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 establishes the end-date for the

protection  accorded  by Part II.  Transactions  effected

after the date the participant goes into insolvency  will

not have the benefit of the protection under Part II.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Part III of the Bill, clause 13 makes netting

available  to  a  designated system where  a  participant

becomes insolvent.  In such a situation, the operator  of

the designated system may net all obligations owed to  or

by  the  participant incurred before or on the  date  the

participant  goes into insolvency, with the  result  that

only the net sum shall be provable or payable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 fortifies the position by providing that a

court in Singapore is not to recognise or give effect  to

an  order  from a foreign court in so far as  that  order

would be contrary to the provisions of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 clarifies that the protection accorded by

the  Bill  will not affect the rights of persons  arising

from the underlying transaction or under the general law.

For  instance, if a person had made a payment to  another

by  mistake, and this mistaken payment was routed through

a  designated  system by banks that were participants  in

the  designated  system,  the  person  who  received  the

payment  would  not  be immune from a legal  action  that

might  be available to the payer for the recovery of  the

mistaken  payment.  The Bill is intended to  prevent  the

unwinding of transactions made through a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1544</b></font><br><br>



designated  system.   It  is  not  intended   to   accord

additional  legal protection or benefit to the  recipient

at the end of the payment chain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the protection given by the Bill will only apply

to  transactions entered into a designated system  before

or on the day a participant becomes insolvent, the system

should not accept any transactions from a participant  as

soon  as  it  has  notification that the participant  has

become insolvent.   To facilitate this, clause 16 of  the

Bill  imposes  an obligation on the participant  that  is

insolvent to give notice of that fact to the operator  of

the designated system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 protects MAS and its officers from

liability  in  connection with any action taken  in  good

faith in MAS' capacity as the designating authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 empowers MAS to make regulations for

carrying out the purpose and provisions of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the enactment of the Bill, MEPS will be a

designated system and clause 19 accordingly provides  for

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 deals with the migration of the current

section  59A of the Banking Act to the Monetary Authority

of  Singapore  Act.    It  is more  appropriate  for  the

statutory provision relating to the operation by  MAS  of

real-time gross settlement systems such as MEPS to be  in

the  MAS Act.  This will also make it possible to  extend

participation in such real-time gross settlement  systems

to  institutions other than banks.  Accordingly,  section

59A of the Banking Act will be repealed and a new section

29A will be inserted into the MAS Act.



<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, the Bill provides the broad

legal foundations for the operation of stable payment and

settlement systems, thereby reducing the risk of systemic

disruptions  to  Singapore's financial system.   This  is

essential for Singapore's competitiveness and development

as a major financial centre in the world.

<div align="center"><b>RAPID TRANSIT SYSTEMS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan (Senior Minister of State for Transport) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Rapid Transit System (RTS) has expanded over the

years.  In 1987 when we started, we had less than  70  km

of  network.  With the opening of the Woodlands extension

in  1996,  the Bukit Panjang LRT in 1999 and  the  Changi

Airport  extension this year, the network is  now  nearly

100 km long.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Northeast Line (NEL) opens next year, the

network will further expand to about 120 km.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, changes have also taken place in the

industry.   The SMRT Corporation, the holding company  of

SMRT  Ltd (SMRT) which operates the existing MRT network,

was  listed  in 2000.  SBS Transit Ltd, another  publicly

listed company, will be operating the NEL.



<br><br><i>Rationale</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our current licensing and regulatory framework for

rapid  transit systems must keep pace with these  changes

so  that  it  remains  relevant in the  light  of  actual

experience.   This  is  the reason for  introducing  this

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will empower the Land Transport Authority

(LTA),  the  industry  regulator, to  impose  conditions,

restrictions  and performance standards on rapid  transit

licensees,   both   existing  and   future,   through   a

legislative framework.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1546</b></font><br><br>



The  imposition  of  these conditions,  restrictions  and

performance  standards  on  the  licensee  is  not   new.

Currently, they are provided in the Licence and Operating

Agreement  negotiated between LTA and the licensee.  What

this Bill will allow us to do is to put these conditions,

restrictions  and performance standards on a  legislative

footing.  In this way, we achieve greater transparency in

our regulatory framework.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now highlight the two key provisions in the

Bill.



<br><br><i>Clause 2</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill amends section 15 of the Act to

empower the LTA to impose:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) conditions on its licensees on matters relating

to corporate governance;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) restrictions on the licensees' involvement in

non-public transport businesses; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) standards on the licensees' performance in

areas  such  as the provision of RTS services  and  their

maintenance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA has a duty to retain regulatory oversight over

key  issues  of  corporate governance and other  business

activities   of   its   licensees   because    the    RTS

infrastructure  is paid for by public  funds.   Such  LTA

oversight  ensures that the huge capital investments  and

the public interest are adequately safeguarded.



<br><br><i>Clause 3</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill expands the statutory powers of

the LTA in three areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it empowers the LTA to issue codes of

practice and directions, under sections 15B and  15C,  in

areas  such  as  the  operation and  maintenance  of  RTS

systems.   This is necessary as changes in  the  industry

and  advances  in  technology may require  new  codes  of

practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it expands the definition of events of

default  to  include,  among others, non-compliance  with

Codes of Practice and LTA's Directions (under



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1547</b></font><br><br>



section  16).   It  also  makes provision  for  financial

penalties to be imposed in the event of any occurrence of

default.  The ability to impose financial penalties  will

provide  LTA with the means to take deterrent  action  if

the operators fail to perform to regulatory expectations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, it empowers the LTA (under section 15A) to

add,  delete  or  modify the conditions of  the  licences

granted  under section 13.  However, any such change  can

only  be  effected in accordance with the due process  as

set  out under this clause.  The proposed amendment  also

allows  licensees  aggrieved by  the  new  conditions  to

appeal  to the Minister.  In this connection, the grounds

of  appeal  by  licensees have also been  expanded  under

section 17.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since its beginning in 1987, our

Rapid  Transit  System has grown to become  an  important

part  of our public transport system.  It now serves  one

million commuters a day.  When the North East Line opens,

more  commuters  will get to benefit from  this  form  of

transport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our regulatory regime has to keep pace with

developments, both in the industry as well as the changes

in  RTS technology.  In this way, we can better safeguard

the   interests   of   the  commuters,   while   ensuring

transparency and fairness to the industry players.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

this  amendment  Bill  on the rapid  transit  systems  is

timely and necessary.  As our MRT lines have expanded and

another new operator of the North East Line is coming  on

stream,  it  is  also important to lay  out  and  further

improve   the  ground  for  competition  and  performance

requirements  of  our  operators.   Performance   related

indicators  and  codes of practice must  also  comply  in

order  for  our MRT to operate efficiently.   By  nature,

this area of public transport, whether it is for buses or

trains, usually



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1548</b></font><br><br>



falls  into  some  area  of  natural  monopoly.   It   is

necessary to run it both efficiently and yet meet  public

expectations of service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, rule-based competition is important to evaluate

the  performance  of the operators.  The  amendment  Bill

focuses  on three main areas  -  on the corporate changes

in  shareholding, on restrictions to lines  of  business,

and  standards of performance.  While I applaud that such

conditions   and  restrictions  spelt  out  clearly   for

operators are good, sometimes it is difficult to see  how

it  is  applied in practice.  Have we not,  for  example,

seen the original SBS gone into property development?  On

the  other  hand, if an operator maximises the employment

of   its   assets  by  properly  going  into  interesting

businesses,    should   it   be   discouraged    in    an

entrepreneurial   and   efficient   economy?    We   must

appreciate  that  the MRT commands a  sizable  amount  of

assets  and should be a dynamic sector in creating  value

in  the economy.  Infrastructural companies operating  on

public charter should run their business efficiently with

the aim also of serving the public.  Their aim must be to

make  a  reasonable return by industrial  comparison  and

ensure that the services are efficient, satisfying public

demand and reinvestment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I agree that rules and regulations should be

tightened  to ensure efficiency to service public  needs,

the  LTA  should also determine what are the  performance

yardsticks  for  monitoring and making  these  yardsticks

known  publicly.   They can be the number  of  delays  in

operations  per year, the number of failures  to  observe

safety  regulations, revenue and load  factors,  etc,  so

that  the  public  will be able to know  how  the  public

facility operator is doing.  These red marks must be  the

basis to impose fines and penalties on these operators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, this proposed amendment only provides for

the  penalty  of $1 million on operators for  failure  to

comply   with  the  provisions  or  directions   of   the

Authority.  It makes no mention of failure to comply  for

performances.   I believe operators who fail  to  deliver

services  up  to  standard  should  be  given  fines  and

penalties.  This does not seem to be provided at  all  in

this Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1549</b></font><br><br>



Although  there  is  a provision in  this  Bill  for  the

Authority  to  suspend  or  cancel  the  licence  of  the

licensee,  it  is hard to envisage what alternatives  the

Authority has in cancelling the licence.  After all,  the

trains  have  to run.  Hence, I feel that  putting  in  a

scheme  of  fines  and penalties for  non-performance  or

failure is necessary.  This will awake the management  of

the   company.   Public  infrastructure  operators   fear

penalties  and fines more than public outcries.   And  by

these  fines,  I  do not mean a fine of $10,000  for  the

stoppage  of  trains for four days.  The fine  should  be

meaningful enough and of sizable amount so as to make  it

a  deterrent for the companies.  The reason for  this  is

simple.  For fines, such public infrastructural companies

will  have  to  measure the yardstick.   And  for  public

outcries,  it  is  very hard sometimes to  determine  the

impact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister will consider this point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Mr Chay

for  his  comments.   I  take  it  that  he  supports  in

principle  this  Bill.  He made a number  of  points.   I

noted three important ones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, he made a philosophical point. He said, yes,

while he understood the need to place restrictions on non-public  transport activities of licensees, we should  not

go overboard and stifle entrepreneurial activities on the

part  of  licensees.  That I agree.  The  clear  dos  and

don'ts   are easy to define, but there will be a  lot  of

grey  areas.  So, it is one of those things where  it  is

very  difficult  to codify.  Therefore, occasionally,  it

has  to  be on a case-by-case basis.  And the way  to  go

about doing it is to make sure we have wise men and women

sitting on the board of LTA, so that they can apply their

wisdom, expertise and experience when a case crops up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point he made was about performance

yardsticks   -   that  licensees  should  be  subject  to

measurement,   whether   they   meet   up   with    their

expectations,  and  he made a point  about  making  those

indicators  public.  I agree.  We already  have  sets  of

performance indicators governing SMRT or SLRT, and I will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1550</b></font><br><br>



ask LTA to think about going forward to the next step  of

making them public and make the process transparent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point he made was about financial penalty

-   the  point that, yes, we have the power to  cancel  a

licence  in  the event of a major default in  activities.

To  him, that is a very drastic step, which I agree.   In

fact,  one of the objectives for moving this Bill  is  to

build in this financial penalty framework so that we  can

have   a   more  discriminatory  way  of  governing   the

performance of the licensees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Khaw Boon Wan].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>STRATEGIC GOODS (CONTROL) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br>2.55 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill puts in place an enhanced system to

regulate  trade  in  strategic goods.   In  broad  terms,

strategic goods comprise munitions and sensitive dual use

items,  as  well  as  goods used for the  development  or

production of weapons of mass destruction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore supports the global efforts to curb the

proliferation  of  weapons of mass  destruction  and  has

always maintained high standards in controlling trade  in

strategic  goods.  Since the 1970s, we  have  been  state

parties  to the Biological Weapons Convention (1975)  and

the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (1976).  In  recent

years,  we  have ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention

and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill strengthens existing controls to keep pace

with recent international developments.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1551</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the imperative for the Strategic Goods

(Control)  Bill?   Mr  Speaker, Sir,  let  me  elaborate.

Rapid  globalisation and technological advancements  have

spurred  economic  growth, and  stimulated  much  greater

cross  border flow of goods and people.  But  these  same

forces  driving  global growth have also  thrown  up  new

security challenges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technological advances have spawned a range of

highly advanced products.  Properly deployed for civilian

use,  these  can  improve productivity  and  promote  new

industries.   But some of these products  and  technology

can  also be deployed for building deadly weapons.  There

is  also  the  risk of nuclear, biological  and  chemical

weapons  falling  into  the  wrong  hands.   History  has

provided  us  with  cases on the use  of  sarin  gas  and

anthrax,  and  they  are a sobering confirmation  of  the

physical and psychological damage that such chemical  and

biological weapons can cause.  Their use makes clear that

the threat and risk are real and not just hypothetical.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Global trade is growing, and the conduits which

carry  these  huge  global  flows  of  goods  have   been

exploited  by  rogue  traders to  smuggle  a  variety  of

weapons,  including  those  of  mass  destruction.    The

methods  used  by  them  to  illicitly  divert  sensitive

strategic  goods to proscribed entities have also  become

more   sophisticated.   There  is  growing  international

concern  in  recent years that such sensitive  goods  and

weapons could fall into the hands of terrorists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No country alone can tackle this problem. Nor can

any  country  isolate herself from  the  dangers  of  the

proliferation of such weapons and components.  More  than

ever  before, countries need to work in close partnership

to  build  a  tight,  effective and efficient  system  of

controls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a major trading and logistics centre, Singapore

may  be  used  as  a potential conduit for  such  illicit

activities. It is in our interest to enhance security  of

our  ports' operations and to step up vigilance.   It  is

also our responsibility, as a member of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1552</b></font><br><br>



international community, to play our part in building  an

effective global system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill represents a comprehensive effort by

Singapore to plug into international efforts to curb  the

proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work on the proposed Bill began more than two and a

half  years  ago,  as  we  had assessed  that  proactive,

preventive actions were necessary.  This was well  before

the  world  was shaken by the September 11 attacks.   The

September  11 attacks brought to the fore the urgency  of

dealing  with terrorists threats.  In recent  months,  we

arrested  a  total of 36 members of the Jemaah  Islamiyah

network.  These members were plotting to attack strategic

locations  in Singapore.  These recent developments  lent

greater   impetus  to  our  efforts  to  take   proactive

measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore will be the first country in Southeast

Asia to enhance our controls on strategic goods.  This is

a  strong deterrent measure to prevent rogue traders from

using  Singapore to conduct illicit activities.  This  is

also  a  pre-emptive  measure  to  tighten  our  domestic

security.   It will also contribute to enhanced  regional

security.    A   volatile   and  insecure   neighbourhood

undermines  investor  confidence.   This  will  have   an

adverse impact on our regional stability and will  dampen

our prospects for growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from enhancing our security, our export

control   system  can  become  a  source  of  competitive

advantage for our industries.  With a robust and credible

system  in place, our trading partners will have  greater

confidence  in  granting  us  access  to  their  high-end

technology  and  equipment because  they  know  that  any

shared technologies will remain in safe hands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now turn to the salient

features of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we will require all traders to apply for a

permit  before  they are allowed to export,  tranship  or

bring  into  transit strategic goods  as  listed  in  the

Schedule to the Bill.  The list comprises about 600



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1553</b></font><br><br>



items   by  broad  categories.   It  includes  munitions,

chemical and biological items, as well as nuclear-related

materials  and  equipment.   These  have  been  carefully

selected  mainly  for their direct military  and  nuclear

applications, as well as their dual-use nature (ie,  they

are  items  which  can  be used  for  both  military  and

civilian  purposes).  In drawing up  the  list  of  goods

under  control,  we have also referred  to  practices  of

other  reputable export control regimes in  the  US,  EU,

Japan and Hong Kong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, beyond the control of physical goods, we

will  also  regulate  the  electronic  transmissions   of

military,  encryption and WMD end-use  technology.   This

feature  recognises  the realities  of  the  information-communications  age where the most sensitive  part  of  a

product  may  lie in its software.  The provision  deters

all  irresponsible handling as well as illicit  transfers

that  may potentially undermine our security and  defence

interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we will also regulate all brokering

activities   directly  related  to  WMD   and   offensive

categories of conventional arms, such as small  arms  and

light  weapons.   The  controls apply  to  all  Singapore

entities  regardless of whether the goods were physically

transferred through Singapore.  We want to send a  strong

signal  that  we do not condone the conduct of  any  such

clandestine activity within our territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, to ensure the continued relevance of our

enhanced  controls to evolving technologies  and  weapons

development  programmes, we have incorporated  a  blanket

control,  or `catch-all' on all goods that are likely  to

be  used for WMD purposes.  This ensures that even  where

the item does not fall on the control list, it will still

be subject to the controls under this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, we have proposed stiff penalties for non-compliance. The penalties of a maximum $100,000 fine or

3  times the value of the goods, and/or 2 years' jail for

first  offenders, and a maximum $200,000 fine or 4  times

the  value  of  the  goods,  and/or  3  years'  jail  for

subsequent offenders, are in line with the Regulation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1554</b></font><br><br>



of  Imports and Exports Act.  On a case by case basis, we

will be prepared to compound minor offences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn now to an important issue - addressing

business  concerns.   Mr Speaker, Sir,  in  drafting  the

Bill,  the  Ministry  is  very  conscious  that  we  must

minimise the potential impact on businesses.  Hence, over

the   last   two  years,  we  have  conducted   extensive

consultations with several hundred companies representing

the  key  industries that may be potentially affected  by

the   proposed  controls.   Our  industry  has  expressed

understanding and support for the need for such  enhanced

security.  But they ask that we implement these  measures

in  a cost-effective and sensible way, and not erode  the

efficiency   of   our   transportation   and    logistics

infrastructure.   Otherwise,  our  competitiveness   will

suffer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me assure the House that we have taken,

therefore, all necessary steps to address their concerns.

Let me elaborate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the permit application procedures will be

simple,   convenient  and  business-friendly.   We   have

upgraded  the  TradeNet  system  to  accept  all   permit

applications.    We   will   process   all   applications

electronically.   This will reduce  processing  time  and

allow for permits to be granted more expeditiously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we will not impose any additional charges

for these permit applications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, ground enforcement will be largely based on

intelligence and risk profiling.  This ensures that cargo

flows  will  not be impeded by unnecessary  checks.   Our

risk profiling system will be similar to those adopted by

key ports, such as Rotterdam and Hong Kong.  As our risk-profiling  databases develop over time, the accuracy  and

speed  with  which high-risk cargoes are identified  will

increase.   This will allow legitimate traders  to  enjoy

even swifter clearances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, our outreach programme is currently

ongoing.  We want to allay any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1555</b></font><br><br>



concerns   that  may  be  generated  by  these   proposed

controls.   We also want to engender a greater  sense  of

familiarity  and instil confidence so that  the  affected

industries can adjust and ease into the changes  as  soon

as  possible.   We  have launched a  website  to  provide

detailed information.  Prior to actual implementation, we

will  also  conduct  trial runs of the enhanced  TradeNet

system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we cannot take peace for granted.

The  recent  attacks in Bali are fresh reminders  of  how

fragile peace and security can be.  The proliferation  of

dangerous  weapons  threatens  all  countries.   We  need

greater international cooperation to safeguard our  local

security.  The proposed Bill strengthens Singapore  as  a

strong link in the global chain of anti-terrorism and non-proliferation measures.  It will also serve to  safeguard

the  reputation and integrity of Singapore's status as  a

major  international  shipping  hub.   By  securing   our

trading  channels,  our cargoes can clear  our  partners'

ports  faster.  We would also generate greater confidence

in  our  system, and secure greater access  to  high-tech

equipment  and  technology from more advanced  economies.

The  enhanced controls are in our national, economic  and

security interests.  The proposed Bill is both timely and

necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa-Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  thank  you for allowing me to speak on  the  Second

Reading of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the explanations of the Minister of

State for Trade and Industry, and reading the contents of

the Bill, I wish to express my support for this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I take this opportunity to seek a few areas of

clarification with respect to the general objectives  and

the  implementation of these new measures on  control  of

strategic goods.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1556</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I support the concept of having a central

agency  to be the single authority to be responsible  for

this  Bill.   However, I notice that the Strategic  Goods

for   Control  Items  related  essentially  to  military,

chemical,  biological  and technology-related  goods  and

materials.  Therefore, in essence, this Bill, in my mind,

relates to defence and security items.  So I wish to  ask

whether  it is appropriate for this control of  strategic

materials  to  be  vested in the Ministry  of  Trade  and

Industry,  which  is  more interested  in  trade  issues,

rather  it  should be vested in the defence  or  security

agencies like the Ministry of Defence, or the Ministry of

Home Affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the second area of enquiry is with

regard  to  whether  the  implementation  of  these   new

measures will hamper the free flow of legitimate  trading

and  importation  of non-offensive goods  and  materials,

which  are classified within the areas of being strategic

goods.  For example, our defence industry, most of  which

are  Government-owned  in fact, and  they  do  engage  in

activities  in  manufacturing and  trading,  as  well  as

importation   of   military   and   sensitive   products.

Therefore would their businesses be affected or  hampered

in the process?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the private sector's point of view, there are

also  many  small and large private companies  which  are

involved  in  the transhipment, trading and brokering  of

strategic   goods,  such  as  software   and   technology

products.   With these new measures being put  in  place,

would  they  be  hampered  or  handicapped  in  terms  of

operational efficiencies in their businesses?   Will  the

additional documentation and procedure controls  lead  to

delays and inefficiencies in their brokering business  or

even  transhipment  business, for the  movement  of  such

strategic  goods?  In the process, they may  become  less

competitive against our neighbouring countries  which  do

not  have  such kinds of controls.  As the  Minister  has

said, we are the first country in Southeast Asia to  have

this form of controls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I conclude by emphasising that

once again I do support this Bill, but I wish to ask  the

Minister of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1557</b></font><br><br>



State  whether  he  could  give  an  assurance  that  the

carrying  of  legitimate materials would  not  be  unduly

affected.



<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</b> Mr Speaker, I thank Mr

Leong for his helpful comments and for his support of the

Bill.   I  think we need to put this Bill in perspective.

It   does  not  deal  solely  with  security  issues   in

isolation,  but  the  security aspects  of  a  particular

category of international trade - strategic goods.  In so

far  as  it impinges on international trade of goods  and

services,    the   economic   considerations    in    the

implementation of this Bill are just as important.   This

is  of course what the second part of Mr Leong's question

relates  to.  So we need to see which is the best agency,

the  most appropriate ministry, in striking this  balance

between our economic and security interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We studied what had been the practice in other

jurisdictions that have export controls.  In  the  United

States  and  in  Hong Kong, they are vested  in  economic

agencies.   We have decided, after careful consideration,

that  we  will  vest this in the Ministry  of  Trade  and

Industry,  and  that  the  national  authority  for   the

administration  of  export control scheme  should  be  IE

Singapore.  As the national authority, IE Singapore would

be  the  main  point of contact for the  proposed  export

controls scheme.  But it would coordinate with the  other

relevant  agencies, including the security agencies.   It

would  coordinate with the Customs and Excise Department,

with the Police and the DSTA Technical Advisory Office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of Mr Leong's question is just as

important.   He asked what are the economic and  business

implications  of having an export control regime  scheme.

This  concern,  which  he raised,  applies  not  just  to

defence  software  technology  companies,  but   to   all

businesses  in Singapore that deal with the  movement  or

trade of goods and services.  My Ministry is mindful that

any  export  control regime would impose  some  costs  to

businesses.   What we have decided to do  is  to  take  a

practical approach.  There is no point in afflicting upon

ourselves an onerous



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1558</b></font><br><br>



system,  if  it  is  not effective.  It neither  benefits

Singapore,  nor the international community.  Indeed  the

goal   of   enhancing  our  security  would  be  severely

undermined  if  shippers  were  put  off  by  our  strict

controls and chose to divert their cargoes to ports  with

weaker  control  systems.  Therefore,  the  key  lies  in

establishing  an  effective system at a reasonable  cost.

To  achieve this, we are building on the strengths of our

current system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we will tap on our already highly efficient

TradeNet  system to process applications  for  controlled

goods.   This  electronic submission process will  ensure

that traders continue to enjoy the expeditious processing

of  the permits as before.  Second, we are enhancing  our

intelligence  gathering  capabilities.   With  its  risk-profiling   mechanism  and  provisions  for  intelligence

sharing,  the proposed export control regime will  ensure

that  the efficient and smooth operation of the port will

not  be compromised.  Third, the list of controlled items

has  been carefully scrutinised to ensure that the  level

of  regulation is not more onerous than what is necessary

to achieve our policy objective.  The result is a control

list that is not excessively long.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to make a final point

here  that  beyond  this limited  cost,  there  are  also

benefits  to  Singapore.  One is  that  it  enhances  the

reputation of Singapore as a secure international trading

hub.   Two, it would actually help our defence technology

and  software companies by facilitating their  access  to

technologies in developed economies.  Without  the  Bill,

these  companies may find it difficult, as  the  supplier

countries  may be concerned that the shared  technologies

may  inadvertently fall into the wrong hands.  The  Bill,

therefore,  contributes, rather than detracts,  from  the

competitiveness of our defence and technology companies.

<div align="center"><b>(Motion)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House, having noted the Report of the

Junior  College  (JC)/Upper  Secondary  Education  Review

Committee  2002, contained in Paper Cmd 8  of  2002,  (1)

supports the new JC curriculum which will better  develop

thinking,  communication  and other  process  skills  and

engage  students in greater breadth of learning; and  (2)

endorses greater diversity and opening of new pathways in

JC/Upper  Secondary education to cater to  the  different

strengths and interests of students.



<br><br><i>Rationale for Review</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our education system is a strong

one,  well  recognised for the high levels of achievement

and  the  high rates of completion of our students.   The

foundations were laid in the Goh Keng Swee Report,  which

was debated and endorsed by this House in March 1979.  We

have  a  well-structured and efficient education  system,

which  allows  every student to go as far as  he  can  in

achieving  his  potential.  Since 1979, we  have  various

adaptations  and  improvements to  the  system  so  that,

today,  80%  of  our  students now proceed  on  to  post-secondary  education.   Our  students  do  well  by  most

international comparisons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our current JC/upper secondary education system

has  served us well.  However, we have to look ahead  and

prepare ourselves for new challenges, as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1560</b></font><br><br>



we  move  from an industrial-age economy to a  knowledge-based economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to prepare our students for a more

unpredictable  and frequently changing environment.   New

developments  in science and technology will  change  the

way  we  live, communicate, work and play.  Globalisation

will  continue to change and transform economies and  the

relations  between  nations.   Knowledge  and  creativity

will  be the driving forces that determine whether people

and countries thrive, or merely struggle to survive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be good, not only at efficiently making

chips  or pharmaceuticals, or trading in stocks and other

financial instruments; but we must also be able to create

new  products whether they be gene chips, a new  drug  to

treat  a  disease,  a  digital movie,  or  new  financial

instruments and services.  Singaporeans must  be  willing

to   take   calculated  risks,  to   create   their   own

opportunities, to search out new niches and markets, even

in the world of existing technologies and products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prepare our young for this new future, education

needs to move away from an industrial model of production

which  worked  well  in the past when  things  were  more

organised, stable and bounded by convention.  But this no

longer  reflects the world we live in.  In the globalised

world,   there   are   fewer  certainties   and   greater

variability.   To  prepare our people,  the  Ministry  of

Education  has been making changes in this  direction  in

the last five years. We have:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Trimmed down our curriculum content to give

more  emphasis  to process skills and learning  to  apply

knowledge;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Introduced IT to encourage independent learning

and  to reach beyond the classroom to the wider world  to

expand the horizons of learning;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Encouraged multi-disciplinary learning,

teamwork and new ideas through project work;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1561</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Introduced new assessment methods such as open

book   and   source-based   questions,   and   continuous

assessment for `A' level practical; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Given greater recognition to achievements

beyond  the academic by counting co-curricular activities

for entry to university.



However,  such changes have been carried out  within  the

current structure of our education system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, when the Ministry of Education embarked

on  this review, the aim was to make a departure from the

current  structure,  to  open  up  the  system  to   more

flexibility and diversity in curricula and structure, and

to  provide more avenues for our students with  different

strengths and interests to develop.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes proposed for the JC/upper secondary

education  are major and substantive, and will  make  our

system  a less uniform one.  Fundamental changes will  be

introduced in two areas - we will have a more broad-based

and  flexibly structured JC curriculum, and more  diverse

structures  and  mix of schools in the  system.   I  will

elaborate  on  each  of  these  further.   But  before  I

proceed,  let me just record my thanks to Senior Minister

of  State,  Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, and his  Committee

for  having done a very good job in reviewing the  system

and making these proposals.



<br><br><i>A Broader and More Flexible JC Curriculum</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new JC curriculum will do more to nurture the

skills,  outlook and habits required for success  in  the

knowledge age.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current JC curriculum has its strengths. The

`A'  levels  have served as the standard  bearer  of  the

rigour and high standards of our pre-university education

for  the last 30 years.  The programme is challenging and

provides  students  with a strong core  of  knowledge  in

their chosen fields.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1562</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the JC curriculum in its current form - consisting of a narrow selection of specialised `A' level

subjects - may not be adequate to prepare our JC students

for a future that places a premium on flexibility and  an

ability  to  understand and draw on  different  knowledge

disciplines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our universities have already moved towards offering

a  broader  undergraduate education  with  cross  faculty

modules.   Their  programmes  had  been  based   on   the

traditional  British model.  Such a model - characterised

by  specialised degree programmes - had served  us  well.

Going  forward, we should be cognisant of the demands  of

the  new  economy,  which require a  greater  breadth  of

knowledge and skills.  Hence, the move towards  a  broad-based  education  model adopted by many US  universities.

The  changes  to  our  JC programme are  motivated  by  a

similar recognition of the merits of a broader education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new JC curriculum has three key features.

First,  JC  education  will  be  more  broad-based.   All

students will do a contrasting subject outside their main

area of specialisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of a more broad-based JC education is

not to teach more facts about more things.  The intention

is  to ensure our students acquire a strong grounding  in

the major families of disciplines and an understanding of

different   ways  of  knowing  the  world  -  scientific,

mathematical, humanistic.  Our students must have  strong

anchors in both the sciences, which seek the truths about

the  physical, social and biological worlds, as  well  as

the  humanities,  which tell us about  man's  search  for

individual meaning and social purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will ensure students have a fuller

understanding  of the world around them  -  the  physical

world, the biological world, the social world, the  world

of   human  experiences,  our  past,  our  society,   and

ourselves - so that they are better able to draw on  this

to create their own future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the new JC curriculum will do more to

nurture knowledge skills -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1563</b></font><br><br>



conceptual thinking skills, communications skills  and  a

firm grasp of different modes of knowledge inquiry.  In a

globalised,    technologically   driven,    fast-changing

knowledge  society,  our young need to  be  critical  and

original  thinkers,  as well as to  present  their  ideas

cogently, persuasively and forcefully to win the  contest

of ideas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's JC curriculum emphasises both process skills

and  content  mastery, though more could  be  done.   The

various  subject  disciplines in  JC  education  seek  to

deliver   core  skills,  such  as  communication  skills,

information   and  knowledge  application   skills,   and

thinking  skills and creativity.  Project Work  has  also

been  introduced since 2000 to develop inter-disciplinary

learning, collaborative skills, independent thinking, and

communication skills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new JC curriculum will build on these changes.

Project Work will be brought within the formal `A'  level

framework  and  accorded  the same  standing  as  General

Paper.   The different modes of gathering, analysing  and

synthesising  knowledge  will be  infused  into  existing

subjects.   We are introducing a new optional  subject  - Knowledge   and  Inquiry  -  to  develop  the  conceptual

abilities of our students to a higher level, and to  have

them    critically   analyse   issues   from    different

perspectives    by   drawing   upon   knowledge    across

disciplines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broad-based nature of the revised curriculum

will  also  help develop a more flexible way of  thinking

and   a  creative  bent  among  our  students.   The  new

curriculum's stronger multi-disciplinary orientation will

enhance  our  students' capacity to synthesize  knowledge

across   different  subject  areas  and  appreciate   the

interconnections between disciplines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, and importantly, the new JC curriculum will

place added emphasis on developing the personal qualities

that  our  JC  students  need  to  be  good  leaders  and

committed  citizens.    Our  education  system  seeks  to

nurture a balanced and holistic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1564</b></font><br><br>



human being and citizen.  A comprehensive education  must

aim   not  merely  at  academic  achievement,  which   is

important, but also at developing qualities of  mind  and

motivation,  and  the  cultivation of  sound  values  and

enterprise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The non-academic curriculum plays a critical role - through participation in co-curricula activities, such as

sports,  uniformed groups or the arts, students learn  to

work  with  each other to achieve common goals  and  lead

with  confidence even in adversity.  Tough  training  for

competitions  nurtures endurance and  ruggedness  in  our

students.   They  learn  to be good  team  players,  take

risks,  think  on  their  feet  and  exhibit  initiative,

resolve and resilience in the face of setbacks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, under the new JC curriculum framework,

students  will need to meet minimum requirements  in  co-curricula  activities and Character Development Programme

participation to complete their JC education.  A holistic

certification  will be introduced, with CCA  achievements

and  academic  grades reflected on  the  same  `A'  level

certificate.



<br><br><i>A more diverse education landscape</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond curriculum, the recommendations of the JC

review  will also bring changes to the upper secondary/JC

education landscape.  There will be greater diversity  in

the types of programmes, mix of schools, and pathways  to

university  education.  We will allow for new Specialised

Independent   Schools  in  areas  like  Mathematics   and

Science; integrated programmes for upper secondary and JC

education; alternative qualifications, like the IB; and 2-3 privately-funded schools to be established.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more diverse education landscape is desirable for

two reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, a more diverse education system allows us to

do  more to cater to the different interests and needs of

our students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our current Upper Secondary/JC system with `O' and

`A'  levels  is  an  excellent system for  ensuring  that

students have a strong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1565</b></font><br><br>



structural   framework  within  which  to   acquire   the

fundamental   knowledge  and  skills  they  need   before

proceeding to the next phase of education, whether it  be

JC,  polytechnic  or university.  And our  students  have

done well with this structured system, with high rates of

completion and achievement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there will be students who do not need such

a strongly structured system to acquire the fundamentals,

and  can  benefit  from  a  less  structured,  integrated

programme   for   upper  secondary  and  Junior   College

education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen this working very well at top high

schools  in  the  United States.  They  run  4-year  high

schools from Grade 9 to 12, schools such as Bronx High or

Stuyvesant  High  in New York City, or  Thomas  Jefferson

High  School  in the Washington DC area.   These  schools

have   very  good  integrated  programmes  in  the  upper

secondary, in the last four years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The review therefore proposes that we introduce

different pathways. Some students will benefit more  from

a  structured education with clear intermediate goals and

benchmarks  along  the way.  They can pace,  measure  and

prove themselves as they progress.  Others will thrive in

a   less  structured  learning  environment  provided  by

schools offering integrated programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new broad-based JC curriculum will cater to the

needs of most students, whether they are in the JCs on  a

2-year  programme, or the Integrated Programme.   But  to

provide  more  diversity, JCs can also offer  alternative

curricula,  like the IB, or, as is likely  with  the  new

Specialised  Schools,  develop their  own  curriculum  or

adapt one to suit their needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, diversity in our system means that we will

have  different  ways, and not just one homogeneous  way,

for  preparing our young for an innovation-driven  future

characterised by rapid and continuous change.   Diversity

will  sow  the  seeds for vibrancy and creativity.   With

diversity,  there is greater opportunity for rejuvenation

and strength.  We need a pool of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1566</b></font><br><br>



diverse  talents  with different educational  experiences

and  outlook, who are able to offer different  ideas  for

Singapore  to  be a truly vibrant country, adaptable  and

responsive to the varied challenges of the future.



<br><br><i>Challenges and concerns</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, while I have outlined the reasons

for  this  review, and why it will serve our  people  and

country well, I am mindful that there are challenges  and

concerns.   There are likely to be concerns that  a  more

diversified  system will lead to greater  differentiation

and elitism.  Sir, we all do want a system that can offer

programmes  that  are more appropriate to  the  different

abilities  and aptitudes of our students, and  this  does

mean  that  we  will need a more diversified  system  and

differentiation in order to achieve this.   By  providing

the   greater  opportunities  that  such  diversification

offers,  our students, our society and Singapore will  be

the better off for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in so doing, we must continue to adhere to two

important principles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, that our education system is meritocratic and

provides equal opportunity.  Our Integrated Programme and

Specialised  schools  will  therefore  continue  to  have

transparent  and merit-based criteria for  entry.   There

will  also be no reduction in opportunities for deserving

students to join our top institutions.  In that regard, I

see  more  opportunities and choices for Singaporeans  as

they  will have the opportunity of not just going to  JC,

but  also for Integrated Programmes, Specialised  schools

in  Mathematics and Science, Sports, or the Arts, and  to

enrol in schools that offer alternative qualifications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, and perhaps more importantly, those students

who  will  benefit  from the greater educational  options

being  introduced must not forget that the  opportunities

they  enjoy are ultimately justified only by the  quality

of  their  commitment and service to our nation  and  the

general social good.  If our JC students leave the system

very   bright,  very  creative  and  innovative,   having

benefited from the best



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1567</b></font><br><br>



that  our  system has to offer, but without  a  sense  of

commitment  to  country  and  obligation  to  his  fellow

citizens,  then  all  this  effort  would  have  come  to

nothing.  But this is not something that we can  do  only

within   the   education  system.   This  is   a   shared

responsibility.    Parents,  teachers   and   the   wider

community  all share in the task of imbuing in our  youth

responsibility  to  family,  consideration   for   fellow

citizens,  loyalty to home and country, that lie  at  the

very core of being an educated and cultured person, and a

committed  and  loyal  citizen.  This,  all  of  us  must

continue to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

implementation of these proposals will take a  number  of

years.   The JC curriculum will be introduced from  2006.

The  benefits  will  not be seen till some  years  later.

Implementation will not be without its challenges.  There

will be curriculum to be written, teachers to be trained,

new assessment methods to be devised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will need the support of the public, parents,

teachers,  students  and, not  least  of  all,  the  hon.

Members  of  this House, to see these reforms through  in

the  coming  years.  The debate in this House  will  help

Singaporeans to understand the issues involved,  and  the

importance of making these reforms.  As we debate these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1568</b></font><br><br>



reforms, let us fix our eyes on the future, and build  an

education system that will help our country and our young

to be ready to meet that future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to take the opportunity to

hear  from  hon.  Members their  views  on  the  proposed

changes to the JC and Upper Secondary Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br>3.58 pm



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  report  on  the  JC curriculum  contains  two  major

recommendations - firstly, to revise the  JC  curriculum,

broadening  the  content as well as emphasising  thinking

skills   and,  secondly,  to  introduce  the   Integrated

Programme in secondary schools.  These proposals  aim  to

introduce  improvements as well  as  address  some  basic

problems in our education system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For years, the Ministry has steadfastly asserted the

virtues  of our education system.  Therefore, I  consider

this  Motion significant for the Ministry to  admit  that

there  are shortcomings in the system and, secondly,  for

the  Ministry to accept the recommendations of  a  Review

Committee established not so many months ago with members

from outside the Ministry.  Admittedly, by accepting  the

recommendations of the Review Committee, the Ministry  of

Education  has  taken  a giant step  in  resolving  these

systemic  issues.   In fact, these proposed  changes  are

considered   so   fundamental  that  the   Minister   has

recommended to the Prime Minister that the Whip be lifted

so that PAP Members of Parliament could debate the motion

thoroughly without restraint.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, every parent with a child in our

school  system  has  an opinion on  how  to  improve  our

education system.  However, to be able to come out with a

comprehensive  overhaul requires courage  to  admit  that

there  are problems, an exceptional ability to grasp  the

gist  of these problems, and the clarity of mind to  come

out with the solutions.  I believe that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1569</b></font><br><br>



the  Review  Committee,  under the  chairmanship  of  the

Senior Minister of State, Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,  has

managed to achieve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One regrettable aspect of the report is that it

contained so many new initiatives that the reader may not

see  the  forest  for the trees.  To me, Sir,  two  major

thrusts  - the JC curriculum and the Integrated Programme

-  could  have  been better clearly de-linked  and  their

merits considered separately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a way of setting the stage, let me list out

the  shortcomings  of  our existing  secondary  education

system,  and then look at whether the reform proposed  in

the  report  has addressed them.  What are the  generally

perceived  issues regarding our upper secondary education

at  the  moment?  In simple terms, they can be summarised

as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the overall workload is high, in fact, very

high.   The workload of a typical student is around 1,700

instruction hours for the "A" level programme  comprising

the  General  Paper,  mother  tongue  language  and  four

principal  subjects.   For individual  subjects  such  as

Science  and  Mathematics, our workload is  heavier  than

equivalent  programmes  in the  United  Kingdom  and  the

United States by at least 15%, sometimes more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, life as a student in Singapore is very

stressful.  Our students strive to take as many  subjects

as  possible and to score as many As as they can achieve.

They  also  choose  more deterministic subjects  such  as

Science  and Mathematics and to shy away from humanities.

One  of  the  factors  in driving  our  students  is  our

emphasis  on meritocracy and transparency. When it  comes

to scholarship applications and university admissions, we

primarily  look  at  the  examination  results   of   the

applicants.    And  given  that  the  examinations   test

primarily the mastery of these content-based subjects, it

is  possible for those with the mental ability  to  score

better  and better grades just by spending more and  more

hours  memorising the facts and honing their  examination

skills by practising on the 10-year series.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1570</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, our education system overwhelmingly favours

discipline  and  the  ability to  apply  oneself.   As  a

result,  our students learn too much fact and not  enough

abilities.   In  particular, we  are  short  in  thinking

skills as well as social skills.  In effect, our students

become  very  good in solving known problems using  known

solutions  but become hesitant and unsure when confronted

with new problems, a behaviour regularly observed by  our

university and polytechnic lecturers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these observations are not new. But what

prompted  MOE to set up the Review Committee?  I  surmise

that  there  are  two  reasons. First,  we  have  painted

ourselves  into a corner as far as the evolution  of  the

education  system in the secondary schools is  concerned.

Evolution in the natural world has taught us that  it  is

important  to continuously evolve to adjust  to  changing

circumstances.  In my opinion, Sir, our JC education  had

made a wrong turn many years back into a cul de sac.  Why

do  I  say  so?   Our  teachers have become  so  good  in

tutoring their charges in scorings and our students  have

become  so  good in honing their examination skills  that

the  only way to segregate the outstanding students  from

the  mere  excellent is to make the subjects  harder  and

harder.   And as we crank up the ratchet one  turn  at  a

time  over the years, we lost sight of what we are trying

to achieve in education.   The ranking of schools and the

students became the proxy measurements for success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, our typical "A" level students are required

to  spend  about  330  hours in one  subject  versus  the

equivalent  280 hours in the United Kingdom's "A"  level.

It  is  even  more when we compare to the United  States'

equivalent of 240 hours.  Our students are so  far  ahead

when they are admitted to the United States universities,

even  into the very best US universities.  They are given

exemption   for   many  first-year   subjects   such   as

Mathematics and Sciences.  Furthermore, in the  last  "A"

level  examinations, the number of students  scoring  4As

has  once again broken the record.  The end of better and

better  scholastic results is not in  sight.   I  do  not

think we have somehow managed to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1571</b></font><br><br>



manipulate  our  children's genes so that  they  are  now

brighter and smarter than the previous generations.  What

happens is that our children just have learnt a whole lot

more  in the process of preparing for the "A" level.   If

we do not transform our education system, the only way to

provide  some  differentiation among top students  is  to

crank  up  the  ratchet one more time, so  much  so  that

perhaps one day in the future, our students will be given

exemption  from  even more senior level classes,  perhaps

the  sophomore year classes in the United  States.   This

shall  be obvious to all, lay persons and experts  alike,

that  to continue this path is not what education is  all

about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason that the Minister has already

touched  on  is that the Singapore economy in the  future

requires a very different type of workforce than what our

education  system is geared to produce  and  our  current

severe recession has driven home this key point.   Up  to

now,  our  economy  has done well by adopting  production

techniques  from  the  developed countries  and  we  will

refine  them so that Singaporeans are more efficient  and

effective  in performing those jobs.  And the  output  of

our education system is well-suited for this task.  As  a

result,   our   economy  has  grown  since   independence

spectacularly.   However, as we try to upgrade  ourselves

into  a  knowledge-based economy, we  discover  that  our

engine  sputters  as we step on the accelerator's  pedal.

What  happened?  Some say that we did not develop  enough

intellectual  property  ourselves  that  the  others  are

willing  to pay for.  Others say that we are not creative

enough.  In other words, our workforce basically does not

know how to leverage the knowledge we have in our systems

and  processes into goods and services that the world  is

prepared to pay for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect of a rapidly changing economy is

the  rapid transformation of job skills.  As we no longer

could predict the job skills that will be required in the

future,  it  is  better  to train our  population  to  be

flexible and adaptable instead of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1572</b></font><br><br>



being  channelled into specialised areas too  early.   To

fix  these two problems, the whole education system  must

be   transformed,   and   some   part   of   which   very

fundamentally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that the JC curriculum is

the  first  step in a complete overhaul of our  education

system to be more like the United States' system compared

to  the  United  Kingdom's system.  It puts  emphasis  on

thinking  skills  and  avoids early  over-specialisation.

Our  local universities have already recognised the  need

and  have taken the step to transform themselves from the

British system to the American system.  Thus, the changes

in the JC curriculum will remove the disjoint that exists

today  between the JCs and the universities. This  change

is  welcomed  by  everyone that  the  Feedback  Unit  has

consulted with regard to the White Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what the new curriculum does not

address  is  the  workload  and  the  stress  of  the  JC

curriculum.   Yes,  we  know our students  can  take  the

stress.  Yes, they can take the load.  But why should  we

subject  our  children  to this  very  trying,  tempering

process?   The  White Paper did not address the  question

whether  it is necessary to impose such a heavy  workload

on our students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only that, Sir, on the contrary, the new

curriculum,  by  requiring the  need  to  take  a  cross-discipline subject, would probably increase the workload.

It  is true that through the new classification of H1, H2

and   H3,  the  Ministry  proposes  to  keep  the   total

instruction  hours  the  same.   But  by  increasing  the

emphasis on project work, thinking skills and the need to

take  a  new subject in a different discipline, I believe

students will need to spend more time instead of the same

amount  of  time.   It  is regrettable  that  the  Review

Committee  did  not  delve into this area  and  take  the

opportunity  to  make the necessary adjustment  to  bring

down the total workload.  I would request the Minister to

monitor   the  workload  very  carefully   in   the   new

implementation and to make necessary adjustments,  if  so

required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another impact on students that we have to watch out

for will be their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1573</b></font><br><br>



response  to  the  new  emphasis on thinking  skills  and

project work.  These are harder to do well in, especially

for  those  who are not so strong in the command  of  the

English   Language,   in  writing   and   in   expressing

themselves.  It is likely that these students will prefer

the  old approach and I believe that they will aim to  go

to the universities via the polytechnic route after their

"O"  level.  Thus, it is likely that some years down  the

road  after we implement the new JC curriculum  that  the

pressure  to allow more polytechnic graduates beyond  the

now top 10% into our universities will intensify.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, some of the respondents to the

Feedback  Unit  feel  that the JC curriculum  would  only

impact the top 25% of the cohort and is therefore not  of

major  interest to the majority of our students.  I think

this  view  is mistaken as the influence of  this  change

would  be felt all the way down the school system to  the

primary   level.   Parents  would  recognise   that   the

attribute that would enable their children to do well  in

the  new  "A" level examinations has got to be inculcated

for  many years in the lower secondary as well as in  the

primary  levels.  Contrary to public perception,  the  JC

curriculum  would  touch  the  life  of  every  child  in

Singapore  and  this is all the more so  because  of  the

integrated programme or the "through-train" concept to be

introduced concurrently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the "through-train" concept has been floated

for  many  years  now.   A number of  JCs  and  secondary

schools  have  already  signed up  to  the  concept.   It

targets  the top 10% of the cohort so that they could  go

straight to the "A" level without having to sit  for  the

intermediate "O" level examinations.  Since  25%  of  our

cohort would move on to the JC, 10% would be the top two-fifths  of this group.  We could be quite confident  that

the drop-out from the Integrated Programme (IP) would  be

few  and far between and naturally most of the GEP pupils

will be enrolled into the IP programme.  In my mind, Sir,

IP is, in essence, an extension of the streaming exercise

that started way back in the primary level.  Is this good

or bad?  This is, in fact, a very fundamental



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1574</b></font><br><br>



question and indeed the more troubling proposal  in  this

White Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it should be obvious that by skipping the "O"

levels,  the  IP  confers  significant  benefits  to  the

students  in  the  programme.  Just by looking  from  the

angle  of  time  utilisation, these students  would  have

close to six months for other development activities that

the  "O"  level  students  would  spend  at  Secondary  4

preparing   for  their  examinations.  Furthermore,   the

Ministry proposes to introduce the single admission to JC

1  concurrently  to  solve the  problem  of  churning  of

students  after their "O" level examinations.  Thus,  the

new  JC  1  intake will enroll as late as in March  after

their "O" levels in the following year.  And during  this

period,  Sir,  I  do  not think the students  in  the  IP

programme will stay at home marking time.  I am sure that

they  will be back in the schools, being nurtured.  Thus,

the IP students would have as much as up to eight months'

interaction time more than a student who took the  normal

route  or the Express stream.  Sir, bearing in mind  that

the IP students are the top 10% of the cohort in terms of

intelligence and abilities, I believe these students will

end  up having a very measurable advantage over the other

students  in the Express stream or in the Normal  stream.

They  would probably be so good that they might be  given

the label "super-express stream".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IP programme illustrates once again the tensions

between  two  different and opposing views in  education.

Do  we  strive for an egalitarian system catering to  the

majority  and  leaving  the  bright  ones  to  fend   for

themselves  or  do we provide the best to the  brightest,

nurturing  them to their fullest potential?  If  we  take

the  first  approach,  we would  not  be  maximising  the

potential of our very best, which could make a difference

between  growth  and  stagnation  for  Singapore  in  the

future.  If we take the second approach, in other  words,

the   IP   approach,  will  we  generate   a   sense   of

disenchantment  among our young who are  not  in  the  IP

programme,  that  the system is stacked against  them  if

nature  does not endow them with the genes to do well  in

our system?  How do we deal with the frustrations that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1575</b></font><br><br>



come  with the realisation that determination, discipline

and  other  human  qualities come second,  while  natural

endowment becomes most important?  How do we address  the

rootedness of Singaporeans when some of us are dealt with

a lousy deck of cards, and the Government reinforces this

in our education system?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly speaking, Sir, I am torn between these two

poles.   In  my  mind,  I  think  IP  is  necessary   and

appropriate,  and  would  bring  great  benefit  to   the

students  in the stream.  In my heart, I feel  that  this

will  intensify  the angst and stress  in  our  education

system  and  make for perhaps a less harmonious  society.

In  view  of  the Singapore economy which  will  be  very

dependent  on the creativity of our people,  my  mind  is

winning this tug of war but my heart wishes that it  need

not be so.  Nonetheless, I would urge the Ministry to  be

cognisant of this when implementing the IP.  This  should

give the assurance that the non-IP students will continue

to  get the attention and the resources allocated to them

currently.   I  am  glad  to note that  the  Minister  is

cognisant  of this and has already reassured  us  in  his

speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, both of these concepts look good on paper.

Whether  they  will bring the benefits we  envisage  will

depend  on the implementation.  There are many issues  of

implementation - and there are 31 speakers after me.  The

key  one, in my mind, is the preparedness of the teachers

by  2006.   The  question is:  will these  few  years  be

sufficient  to get the system ready?  I believe  that  in

implementing  the IP, only a number of  schools  will  be

involved  initially.  I understand that  this  number  is

less  than  the number of schools currently offering  the

GEP.   So,  do  we also admit non-GEP students  into  IP?

What would happen to the GEP students in schools that are

not  implementing  the  IP?  How  do  we  deal  with  the

aspirations of the GEP students in these schools if  they

could not be transferred to the IP?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also other recommendations in the White

Paper,  such as the establishment of private schools  and

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1576</b></font><br><br>



ability   of   some  schools  to  offer  other   academic

programmes such as the IB.  These are meant to bring  out

greater  diversity in the education system  to  meet  the

specific needs of the student population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe it is reasonable to experiment with

the  concept  of  private  secondary  schools.   In  this

respect,  I  am  glad  that MOE has insisted  that  these

schools must meet the minimum criteria of 50% Singaporean

students  in  the  population and must  comply  with  the

National  Education guidelines.  I have  no  great  issue

with the private schools, except that we must address the

concern  of  the public about the exclusiveness  of  such

schools.   Already, there are public comments  about  our

students   not  interacting  enough  between   those   of

different  ethnic backgrounds.  We need  to  ensure  that

such  independent schools do not become institutes  where

only  the  sons and daughters of the rich and the  famous

intermingle and build networks for the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the recommendations of the White

Paper   will  bring  about  fundamental  and  significant

changes  in our education system.  I would like to  thank

Senior  Minister of State Tharman for steering his Review

Committee to come out with these comprehensive and  well-considered  policy  recommendations  and  to  thank   the

Minister  for  accepting  these  recommendations.   These

changes  will  affect every Singaporean.  For  some,  the

change  will  be beneficial.  For others, it  will  bring

about  greater  anxiety  and  stress.   To  me,  what  is

important is that the motivation of the MOE is a positive

one,  and I am glad to hear that the Ministry is prepared

to   do  what  is  necessary  to  ensure  that  the   new

initiatives would succeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to break through the present mindset

and  to  bring the education system in Singapore  to  the

next  higher level of performance.  I support the changes

but  urge caution and continuous monitoring to remedy any

negative impact.



<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, I am delighted

that far-reaching changes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1577</b></font><br><br>



are   now  being  proposed  to  the  system  of  JC/Upper

Secondary School education.  The present system  has  not

had  a  major  revamp  for  30 years.  Like  so  much  of

Singapore Inc., it is highly efficient and accomplishes a

great  deal  with  minimum fuss.   But  the  accompanying

litany of complaints is long and familiar.  And my fellow

Parliamentary colleagues before me have given details  of

some of these.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students and parents bemoan the undue stress the

system  has  imposed from intense rote learning  and  the

cookie  cutter approach.  Significantly, by  agreeing  to

the  reduction  in  the number of  hours  per  'A'  level

subject,  the  MOE  seems to implicitly  admit  that  the

present   system,   by  international  comparison,   over

teachers  in  terms  of  content and  subject  hours,  is

generating an enormously stressful learning experience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;University educators and employers find our students

wanting,  because they are adept at knowledge acquisition

but  not  knowledge application or creation.  They  often

bemoan  the  failure of the system to inculcate  critical

thinking and communication skills.  It is well known that

Singaporean  students are reticent and poor communicators

in comparison with foreign counterparts.  These anecdotal

observations have thus far not been negated by statistics

that  many  Government departments are fond of  using  to

demolish arguments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, they are reinforced by a recent study by the

Ministry of Trade and Industry which shows clearly  that,

compared  to the advanced economies, Singapore is  pretty

strong  in  acquiring  knowledge,  but  is  less  so   in

creating,  disseminating  or applying  information.   The

report  further notes that it is in knowledge application

where  Singapore  lags  furthest  behind  and  here,  the

weakest link is entrepreneurship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, please let me state categorically at the outset

that  I  do see the value of a rigorous education  system

that  stretches students, and stress per se is indeed  no

reason  to  relax  the rigour of the  JC/Upper  Secondary

education  system.   The estimated  25%  of  each  year's

cohort that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1578</b></font><br><br>



enter   Upper   Secondary/JC,  one  can  safely   assume,

represent the best of the crop and nothing beats  a  good

solid  education to prepare them for either a  university

education  or alternative learning pathways to  a  useful

career.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without any question, the changes taking place all

around  us  call for new responses. We urgently  need  to

build  up a pool of trained manpower with the skills  and

the  aptitude  to  tackle the economic  challenges  of  a

highly  competitive globalised, knowledge and innovation-driven economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst the tirade of recommendations made by the

ERC  sub-committees,  the need to  revamp  our  education

system   to  foster  entrepreneurship  stands  out   very

strongly  as  a  common and central  recommendation.   In

fact, one of the strongest advocates comes from the  Sub-committee  on  Enhancing Human Capital,  chaired  by  the

Minister of State for Manpower and Education, Dr  Ng  Eng

Hen, himself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Minister of State Ng Eng Hen's recent ERC

sub-committee  report begins where the White  Paper  also

begins   -   the pressing need to inject more flexibility

and diversity into our education system.   The goal is to

enable  the  system  to perform optimally  its  equipping

task,  and  make  our schools, to use  the  ERC  report's

memorable  words,  "creators  of  knowledge,  engines  of

innovation and cradles of enterprise."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, there are, I believe, three

underlying core principles enunciated in the review:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. greater breadth - with focus on thinking and

higher   order  skills,  not  just  academic  or  subject

content;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. greater flexibility - to accommodate

preference for different types and depth of subjects; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. greater diversity - to allow different

pathways  of education to accommodate different types  of

students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support these broad principles and aims

enunciated.  But in my assessment,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1579</b></font><br><br>



they  have  still not been applied widely  or  rigorously

enough  to the vision for a new education landscape.   In

what  follows, I will explain my reasons by  highlighting

five major concerns arising from the review.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first concern relates to execution. While the

principles  are sound, the execution can and should  take

on  different hues.  Thus, a key concern would be in  the

manner  of  implementation of the  recommendations.   For

instance,  how can existing teachers, who are  themselves

products  of an era where education is largely  knowledge

acquisition, as well as new teachers, be equipped to help

students  develop conceptual thinking, knowledge  process

skills, independent thinking and communication skills?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the changes that must be made to the

recruitment  of  new  teachers and their  training?   How

should  the syllabus, teaching and assessment methods  be

shaped  to  ensure they achieve the aims of  the  review?

What  needs  to  be  done for existing  and  often  older

teachers to help them grasp the issues?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry

and  Education, Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who chairs the

Review  Committee,  himself  had  acknowledged  that  the

success  of the revised curriculum hinges on  how  it  is

executed, particularly in the curriculum design  and  the

training of teachers.  As they say, the devil is  in  the

details.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most enlightened and exquisite curriculum or

programme  is  only as good as the way it is implemented.

Here, I quote the editorial of the Straits Times of  16th

November 2002:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Where the education system is concerned, it is not

just  a  matter  of  rearranging  chairs,  building   new

schools,  but  changing the insides of people,  including

the  people  tasked  with making the changes.   Who  will

teach the teachers?'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, from the feedback I have received, I suspect

that  there  is  little disagreement  among  Singaporeans

about the noble intentions of the changes, but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1580</b></font><br><br>



the  "How" will need to be carefully crafted and conveyed

to all stakeholders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that MOE involve educators

and  other relevant stakeholders in the design of the new

curriculum  and  make  the process  more  transparent  to

parents  and  students.  Before actual implementation  of

the  revised  curriculum, MOE should widely expose  these

for comments by the stakeholders so that any kinks can be

ironed out before implementation.



MOE,  in  accepting this report by the Review  Committee,

should  also follow up with a subsequent report regarding

how   the   curriculum  has  been  revised  and  trimmed,

additional new teaching and assessment methods that  need

to  be  adopted to achieve the aims of the report.   This

could  be  presented  to the public  and  Parliament  for

feedback.  And at this juncture I would like to thank the

Minister for noting that some of these would be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second concern relates to the need to take at

least   one  contrasting  subject  and  implications   on

workload.   I  fully subscribe to the logic of  having  a

contrasting subject, so as to expose students to subjects

outside their core content knowledge, and help them think

in   inter-disciplinary  terms.   Increasingly,   complex

problems   we   are  facing  call  for  multi-dimensional

responses that a broad-based education can elicit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the execution of this could leave much to be

desired.   Specifically, except for perhaps a handful  of

students, the majority do not possess the aptitude to  be

more  or  less competent in every subject.  Most students

have  preferences  and  aptitude  for  one  category   of

subjects - eg, science or arts.  To accommodate a broader

based  enhanced  curriculum,  the  Review  Committee  has

proposed  trimming curriculum content and  time  of  each

subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even though the number of hours per subject

is reduced, the need for a contrasting subject brings the

total  tally for a typical "A" level student to a minimum

of 7 subjects, up from the existing minimum of 5.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1581</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may mean greater stress as students are taxed

beyond  the comfort zone of the subjects around the  core

areas  that they prefer.  The aim of broadening students'

horizon  beyond  the academic would be defeated  if  they

have  to  struggle  unduly in their contrasting  subject,

leaving them with precious little time for anything else.

In fact, whilst there would be a 10% reduction in overall

curriculum  time under the proposed system, for  existing

triple  Science students doing 4 "A" levels, the  overall

curriculum  time  for  Humanities students  doing  3  "A"

levels will remain unchanged at about 1,300 hours.   This

means  that  the  weaker students in the  cohort  may  be

unduly  stretched as they now have to take more  subjects

and  on  top of this, at least one subject outside  their

specialisation in the same overall curriculum time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the typical "kiasu" Singaporean

parents  would  want their children to  do  well  in  all

subjects,  as  long  as the subject  contributes  to  the

admission  criteria  of our local  universities.   Hence,

additional  pressure may also emanate from  this  source.

Once  again,  the  recommendations could  falter  at  the

execution stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To alleviate this problem, it must be ensured that

the   reduced  hours  genuinely  reflect  correspondingly

reduced  content, that does not somehow creep  back  into

the system by way of after-class teaching.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third major concern relates to the through-train

education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the proposals to have through-train

to  accelerate the learning pace and offer  the  brighter

students time to pursue their interests and enrich  their

own educational experience without having their attention

diverted by two major examinations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As only the brightest crop of students - the top 10%

-  will  be permitted to participate, the risk  of  these

students being left without completing at least  the  "O"

levels should they fail the through-train will be remote.

In  some  ways, the through-train is thus another version

of the GEP, and yet another form of streaming.  I know of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1582</b></font><br><br>



many  parents who desire that their children be  able  to

enter the GEP.  Additionally, the perception is that  the

best   resources  are  also  devoted  to  grooming  these

students, perhaps more so on a per capita basis than  the

rest  of the crop.  The fact that this programme and  its

successor,  the through-train, falls within the  national

school  system  raises the prospect  that  this  is  like

officially sanctioned Darwinism at work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully accept that we are all made differently

and  abilities  likewise vary.  I also subscribe  to  the

idea  that bright students with exceptional aptitude  are

better  off  developing other skills  and  pursuing  non-curriculum-related  work  for  character  and  leadership

honing  than taking two major examinations.  But I  would

like MOE to consider steps to ensure that the creme de la

creme  of  Singapore's  student population  entering  the

through-train  programme  do  not  develop   isolationist

tendencies,  but  integrate into the mainstream  and  not

look down at their lesser brethren.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is comforting to note that schools and JCs

planning  to run the integrated programme will set  aside

or  offer additional places to ensure that students  from

non-affiliated schools are not shut out of the JC.  These

secondary  schools  would  also  continue  to  offer  the

standard  "O" level track which would allow  students  to

stay on the traditional route, if they are assessed to be

unable to make the mark, say, at secondary 2.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1990, the percentage of P1 cohort who passed

"A"  levels has been above 20%.  Hence, I would  like  to

urge the Ministry to monitor the progress and performance

of  the  through-train cohort with the view of eventually

making  it accessible to a higher percentage of students,

from the targeted 10%, who can benefit from the system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fourth concern relates to the setting up of

private schools.  The Review Committee recommends  adding

a few privately-run and funded secondary schools and JCs.

Such schools are to add diversity and choice in education

as well



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1583</b></font><br><br>



as  to  provide  an added source of ideas and  innovative

practices in education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee acknowledges that such a move would

however  introduce  some  degree  of  elitism  into   the

national  education system, since admission would  depend

in  part on ability to pay.  Nonetheless, the need for  a

more varied education landscape is becoming inevitable in

the  face of globalisation and an increasingly mobile and

informed citizenry that demands choice.  Privately-funded

schools are likely to appeal to a minority of parents who

are  at  odds with the national school system and believe

that  their  children could fit better in  a  less  rigid

alternative system.  Private schools can provide  greater

variety  and choice of alternative school systems,  which

can  meet  the  needs of such families, and perhaps  help

stem the outflow of Singaporeans arising from unhappiness

with the education system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one Douglas Koh quipped, in response to the

Review  Committee's proposals, "For  years  I  have  been

thinking of emigrating because of the lack of alternative

school systems.  Now I may be spoilt for choice."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, privately-funded schools can cater

to  the children of returning Singaporean expatriates who

may  prefer an alternative curriculum which they are more

familiar with or prepared for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore support this proposal and in fact

would  like  to urge MOE to allow private schools  to  be

open  for  all  levels  instead  of  confining  this   to

Secondary  and JC levels so that the diversity in  choice

can be complete.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My final key concern relates to widening the

benefits,  downwards and upwards.  Firstly, widening  the

benefits  downwards.  The recommendations  in  the  White

Paper  would  benefit the most able of each cohort.   For

instance, the JC review would benefit the top 25% of  the

cohort, whilst the proposed through-train system is aimed

at the top 10%.  But what about the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1584</b></font><br><br>



other  75%  of  the  cohort?  What  about  those  further

upstream  in  the  lower secondary and  primary  schools?

Should  not the new education roadmap of greater breadth,

greater  flexibility and greater diversity be  also  made

available to them so that all will be using the same  map

to navigate effectively together?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits of diversity, flexibility and choice in

education and the nurturing of a thinking culture  should

spread  to  the rest of the cohort so that the less  able

will at least receive some preparation to equip them  for

the  challenges of the KBE.  For surely the goal  is  not

merely  to  have  a thinking elite, but also  a  thinking

nation.   We  need thinkers at all levels of society  and

not  just  at the top, and to level up the weak,  without

dumping down the strong.  The White Paper has allowed for

greater   customisation  or  streaming  with  concomitant

diversity  and choice at the top end of the  cohort  with

the   through-train  and  specialised  school  proposals.

Greater  diversity, choice and customisation should  also

be  accorded  to  the  rest of the  cohort  and  in  this

respect,  I support the following ERC Human Capital  Sub-committee's recommendations:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, to allow secondary students to have wider

access  to subjects beyond their particular stream.   For

instance, students in "N" level could take a few subjects

where they are strong in at "O" level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, to allow selected students a longer period

to  complete their examinations by taking fewer  subjects

in  more  sittings,  so  that they  can  pursue  external

interests  such as sports and the arts, which they  excel

in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These would then reduce some of the rigidity in the

system,   which   though  efficient,  may   hamper   late

developers.   In  fact, the answer to  the  much-maligned

streaming  system could thus paradoxically  lie  in  more

streaming   or   greater   customisation   of   learning,

particularly  for the exceptional, the  wayward  and  the

just different.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is obviously a great deal of administrative

clumsiness, and some loss of efficiency may  have  to  be

initially



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1585</b></font><br><br>



tolerated   but  fundamentally  -  allowing   even   more

diversity should - in this regard be seen as part of  the

maturation process in our education system.  The MOE,  by

accepting  the  White  Paper, is  already  allowing  some

"messiness" to creep into the currently highly  efficient

system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, widening the benefits upwards. There is

also the need to start grounding critical thinking skills

from  the  echelons of lower secondary and  even  primary

school, so that they will not start on the wrong footing.

Again,  as  noted by the Human Capital ERC Sub-committee,

we  need  to  inculcate new traits such as  thinking  and

communication skills early in the education process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referring to tertiary students, I remember coming

across  a T-shirt worn by an undergraduate that  had  the

words "I is a university student."  There is some reality

behind this tongue-in-cheek humour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an ex-University lecturer, I can testify to the

poor   command  of  English,  a  significant  number   of

undergraduates   suffer  from,  as   a   consequence   of

inadequate  grounding during their primary and  secondary

school days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One cannot go far back enough, as psychologists will

tell  you, habits of the mind are formed at a very  young

age.  This laying of foundation is especially crucial for

the dysfunctional families where the home environment may

not  be  conducive for learning and school  is  the  only

avenue for learning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE announced the "Thinking Schools, Learning

Nation"  initiative  in 1997 and curriculum  content  was

trimmed  by up to 30% in 1999.  However, by all accounts,

and  as  noted earlier, students and parents continue  to

remain  stressed by the workload, leaving  students  with

very little time for critical thinking and analysis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MOE should thus also review the curriculum

content  and  workload of students  in  the  primary  and

secondary  schools  to  see if  content  can  be  further

trimmed just like in the case of the JCs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1586</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper notes that the current academic

curriculum  load  in  JCs is heavy  compared  to  foreign

education systems like the "A" levels in the UK  and  the

IB.   This  is  despite the fact that the curriculum  was

trimmed  in  1999.  By the same token, we  may  still  be

overloading  and over-teaching our primary and  secondary

students.   This,  I submit, could place  incoming  upper

secondary/JC  students on the wrong footing and  diminish

the  gains they could make from the very revisions we are

now debating in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the saying goes, we are the product of what we

eat  and this is true, whether it is food for the stomach

or fodder for the brain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arguably, our education system is superior to those

in  many countries, and has largely met the needs of  our

economy  and citizens.  However, with the rapid  pace  of

globalisation, there is growing evidence that the system,

as  it stands, would not be able to meet the needs of the

future workplace and economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Prof Edison Liu, Head of the Singapore Genomic

Programme notes, "Yes, the Singapore education system  is

good.   Yes, it is considered among the best in the world

in mathematics and the sciences.  But the question is not

what  Singapore needs now, but what the country will need

10 years from now."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enable us to compete effectively in the global

economic  arena, we need creative and critically thinking

workers,  not  compliant workers.   International  Survey

Research  recently reported that based  on  its  employee

surveys,  Singapore's chief executives tend  to  be  good

stewards rather than leaders.  This is corroborated by  a

recent  conversation I had with a PR from China who  runs

trading companies in Singapore and China.  He told me  he

spends more time in China than Singapore, not because his

family is in China - his family is in fact in Australia - but because he knows that the Singaporean manager can  be

trusted to run his company according to his instructions.

He  says  that  if  he  were to leave  his  China  office

unattended  for too long, he fears one of  his  employees

may set up a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1587</b></font><br><br>



rival firm, just across the road, to compete against him.

He  remarked that Singaporean managers are very competent

and  compliant.  Ethics aside, Chinese managers are  also

very  competent, but they are also always looking at ways

to be their own boss.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suspect that our famously rigid education system

has  no small part to play in shaping the current mindset

of  Singaporeans.   In  order  to  reform  our  education

landscape  to  produce creative workers,  innovators  and

entrepreneurs, there needs to be a mindset change for all

-  students,  parents,  teachers  and  the  MOE.   It  is

heartening   that  the  MOE  has  accepted   the   Review

Committee's   recommendation  to  reform   the   JC/Upper

Secondary  system  to  better prepare  students  for  the

unpredictable future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing the curriculum to allow for more broad-based education and nurturing thinking skills for JC and

bright  upper secondary school students as well as giving

them more options are first steps in the right direction.

But the system would also have to be changed upstream and

for  the  rest  of the cohort in order to allow  all  and

sundry - the exceptional, the normal, the wayward and the

just different - to have a chance to survive and prosper.

Until this is done, the Sim Wong Hoos and, if I may  add,

the Olivia Lums would continue to remain elusive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore urge MOE not to delay but look into the

equally  needed  reforms  for  those  upstream  and   the

remaining   cohort  outside  the  ambit  of   the   upper

secondary/JC  system.  This is a call  not  only  by  the

public  but  by many from the ERC Sub-committees.   I  am

sure  that,  with  determination, MOE would  be  able  to

marshall resources to look at these areas simultaneously,

as  it  is looking into the implementation of the changes

for the JC/upper secondary system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, it is very comforting to note a recent

example  of MOE's eagerness to act decisively.  Proof  of

this  is  in the recent change in the choice of secondary

school available to pupils after their PSLE results,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1588</b></font><br><br>



instead of before.  Additionally, MOE has also now agreed

to  a  single JC intake.  As one principal remarked, this

single intake of JC has been fed to MOE for more than  10

years  and had remained unchanged.  With MOE's new  added

willingness to change, as seen in the acceptance  of  the

Review Committee's Report, I have high hopes (and I  hope

I  would  not  be proven wrong) that MOE would  seriously

consider  and  implement many of the other  proposed  and

much needed changes in the education system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, Sir, I support the motion.



<br>4.50 pm



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  parents and some MPs in this  House  have

been highly critical of our education policies.  This  is

not  at  all surprising considering the importance Asians

place  on  education.  Unfortunately, some of us,  indeed

many  of  us,  have a tendency to claim  credit  for  our

children's  success  and  blame  the  system  for   their

failure.   But children do not fail until we  think  they

have.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly in any society, there are slow learners,

there  are fast learners.  Education, Sir, is not a race.

Education  is  a  journey, and not a  destination.   Yes,

there  are  intermediate stops along the way - PSLE,  'O'

levels, 'N' levels, and so on, and so forth.  It does not

really matter whether a child takes a slightly different,

if  longer,  route  to reach his own objective,  his  own

destination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education, Sir, is not about how fast we reach our

own  destiny, but how far we can do so.  MOE, in the last

decade  or so, has become a convenient punching  bag  for

society's distorted definition of success.  Really, a lot

of  the noise we hear in this House and the media do  not

do  justice to our system here.  They are both unfair and

without basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our system is not perfect. I think there are

defects.  But the system is not broken.  The way we  hear

it in this House is that it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1589</b></font><br><br>



is  almost  broken.   But I say that the  system  is  not

broken  and this is saying plenty about our system versus

the  systems elsewhere.  Dr Wang mentioned the  standards

in  the  States and Britain.  I will come back to that  a

bit later on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many countries, including the States and Britain,

are  revamping their systems because scholastic standards

have  fallen  to disastrously low levels.  Here,  we  are

fixing a problem that does not exist.  It is a successful

problem.  Our students do well.  There are lots of As  in

the  'A' levels and we say that there is something  wrong

in  that system.  Here, the MOE is revamping the  JC  and

upper  secondary  school system  for  quite  a  different

reason  from that now going on in the States, in  Britain

and in Japan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the new system, many parents have the

perception that the system is going to be easy  on  their

children.   There is hope that more students in Singapore

under  the  new system will be better off.  I think  they

will  be.   But  there will also be a lot of  heartaches.

Because under the new system, there is a higher degree of

differentiation, as Dr Amy Khor mentioned.  It  is  in  a

way  another level of streaming, if you put the  students

through a through-train system, if the students went into

the   specialised  school  of  Mathematics  and   Science

(something which I will talk about a bit later on).   MPs

and  educators  cannot be oblivious to the events  around

the  world.   And  we seem to be very focused  about  the

system  in Singapore when we talk about the problem.   We

all know the problems.  But if you look around elsewhere,

the  problems  we  have, the problems we  face,  are  not

serious.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only two years ago at the 2000 Presidential election

campaign  in  the  States, education was  what  Americans

called a "hot button issue", in other words, something so

hot,  it  would  decide who would be the next  President.

Why?   Because  an  employers' survey  showed  that  two-thirds,  that  means,  more  than  60%  of  high   school

graduates  (we  call it 'A' levels,  they  call  it  high

school)  did not have the skills necessary to succeed  in

the workplace.  Indeed, Americans have decried, debating



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1590</b></font><br><br>



the  declining standards in schools for over two decades.

So has Britain, so has Japan.  And on balance, I think we

have done well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The media, the press and academics should know

better.   How do we know we have done well?  I think  the

best  test  is  to  benchmark our system  versus  systems

elsewhere.   And I think the best objective  benchmarking

is  the International Mathematics and Science test  which

is  culturally  neutral.   It  does  not  depend  on  the

person's  language or his upbringing, and the  system  is

totally  objective.  The sample sizes are  large  enough.

The  number  of countries participating is representative

enough.   But  therein  lies the problem.   Parents  cite

competition and, here, we have heard two speakers  before

me  saying  competition is a major fault of our education

system.   I think in particular, parents and many  of  us

here  are against ranking because they think that ranking

engenders   a   culture  of  what  we  call  "destructive

competition".  The real reason, if we touch  our  hearts,

is   not  competition  or  ranking,  but  the  fear   and

disappointment  that our sons and daughters  do  not  get

into  a ranked school.  I think that is the heart of  the

problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If all of us want to send our sons and daughters to

schools  that can only take in 10% of every cohort,  then

by  definition 90% of the parents of that cohort will  be

disappointed.  But is this necessary?  The hysteria about

not  getting  into a ranked school like RI, RGS,  Chinese

High,  is totally irrational.  All our secondary  schools

are not bad.  It is just that, if you have a spread of  a

few  hundred  schools, there must be some better  schools

and some not so good schools.  But the real test is if  a

student  that does not get into a ranked school, does  he

measure up to international scholastic benchmarks?  If he

does, I think it is not a problem.  If he does not,  then

there is a problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please remember, as Dr Wang correctly pointed out,

that our students are held in high esteem when they go to

British  or  American  universities,  many  of  them  get

exemption.   Every student here does well  in  very  good

universities  anywhere in the world.  It will  of  course

make parents



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1591</b></font><br><br>



happy,  if  MOE does not rank schools.  But I think  that

would  be  a  retrograde step.  Competition and  ranking,

using  examination  results, are part  of  the  education

landscape  everywhere.   I  think  Singapore  is  a  late

starter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, critics equate ranking using examination

results as destructive competition.  But, elsewhere, they

have   changed   euphemism.    They   call   examinations

accountability.  You might ask: accountability  to  whom?

To  taxpayers who fund public schools, or to parents  who

want  to know which private schools are good so that they

can  spend a lot of money to send their children to these

schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All around the developed world, there is an urgency

to  get scholastic achievements up.  In Chicago, you read

not  long  ago  in  the Straits Times, the  authority  is

giving  away  cash grants of US$10,000 to  schools  which

improve  on  their  grades.  Some schools  in  Texas  are

cutting  down on play time and recess time  to  focus  on

core  examinable  skills.  In Japan,  educationists  have

found that years of education that give children room  to

grow, what Japanese call "the zest of life", in the  last

12 years have left a serious gap.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have just distributed a paper which, according to

the   opinion   of  four  Japanese  scholars   in   Tokyo

University,   is   called  "The  Truth  About   Declining

Scholastic Achievement", a long paper, but just read  the

introduction  and the conclusion and you  will  know  the

message.  There is a simple Mathematics test inside  here

and  you  are expected to score 90 marks.  The conclusion

of  these  four Japanese scholars is that 12  years  ago,

they did a survey, they found that the students, like our

students  today, spent a lot of time studying.  They  got

good  grades,  but the parents were not  happy.   So  the

Ministry of Education then changed the system towards the

American system, more broad-based, more electives and the

results  had  not been welcomed at least  by  these  four

scholars.   Their  argument  is  that  basic  Mathematics

scores  had  fallen by up to 10 points.   Where  students

used to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1592</b></font><br><br>



get  70-80  marks for the test shown inside  here,  today

they  are  getting 50-60 marks.  Their argument  is  that

standards had fallen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I go on to America which many of you have more

knowledge.  Now, after years of laissez-faire and falling

academic  standards,  the  state  of  Massachusetts   has

mandated that all public high school graduates must pass,

what  they  now  call,  the  Massachusetts  Comprehensive

Assessment System in order to get a High School  Diploma.

Before  that,  there  was no examination.   Every  school

graduate,  they take the SAT, then they go to university.

But  now,  in  the state of Massachusetts,  they  want  a

standardised testing on core subjects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nature abhors a vacuum. If Singapore Government

does  not  rank  schools, somebody or  some  organisation

would, because the public is hungry for information.   In

Singapore,  the Ministry of Education ranks schools.   In

the  state  of  Massachusetts, they do not rank  schools.

But they publish the results obtained by the students  in

different  schools.  And what happens?  The  local  media

fixes up these results, does the analysis and publishes a

ranking list.  The Financial Times publishes an education

supplement  every  year,  ranking  all  the  schools   in

Britain, sometime around August/September before the term

starts.  It is a special pull-out, by the way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, although MOE ranks schools, it does

not  publish detailed results - RI gets how  many  As  in

History,  how  many As in Mathematics.  In the  state  of

Victoria,  you might be surprised, and in many states  in

Australia,  detailed  subject  results  are  published  - Melbourne High get so many As in Mathematics, so many  Bs

in Science.  Although they did not rank schools, one look

at  the  results you will know which is the best  school,

which is the not-so-good school.  So ranking is universal

by  different  names, if you like.  And  we  should  keep

ranking  and competition in its proper perspective.   The

competition  we  face in Singapore is not  internal,  but

really  external.  By that, I mean it is not  competition

between an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1593</b></font><br><br>



RI  boy and a Chinese High and an ACS boy, or between RJC

and  Hwa Chong and ACJC.  Sure, we want them to have some

friendly  competition so that they have sparring partners

and  benchmark  each other.  But the real competition  is

between  us  and foreign systems.  It is  only  when  the

entire  local  system is levelled up and  superior  to  a

foreign  system that we collectively stand  a  chance  of

making ourselves relevant in the brave new world, in  the

new  economy.   To put it bluntly, collectively,  are  we

better  off  than our neighbours?  Collectively,  are  we

better  off than the world?  If the answer is no to  both

these  questions, we would not arrive in the new economy.

We will arrive somewhere between here and Timbuktu.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents also take issue with the unforgiving and

elitist system which streams students according to  their

learning  abilities.  We have heard a lot in this  House.

Many think that the solution is to do away with streaming

and  follow the example of, say, the USA where  everybody

happily travels on the same education train from Grade 1,

which  is Primary 1, to Grade 12, or JC 2.  But  this  is

not  utopia.   In  fact,  the  US  is  trying  to  fix  a

fundamental problem of failing schools in what they  call

this  one-class, one "slow train" system, where everybody

goes on one train - no First Class, no Business Class, no

Economy - and travels on the same train from Grade  1  to

Grade 12.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if you will give me a few minutes,

I  shall  trace  the  short history  of  the  US  system,

starting  from 1986, so that we get a better appreciation

of  the  work of the Ministry of Education and understand

why,  when we compare ourselves to America, the  students

there have a lot less homework and content.  The question

we want to ask is: do we want to travel that way?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US system has undergone fundamental changes. Up

until  the 1950s, the school system in the US was  a  bit

like ours - maybe not so competitive, but a bit like ours

-  they had examinations, core subjects and few electives

in  high  schools.  Then, in the 1960s and 1970s,  hippie

culture took over, America went to war,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1594</b></font><br><br>



the   public  demanded,  and  the  state  provided,  more

choices.   By  the 1980s, parents and educators  realised

that  it  could  be  a  mistake.   Choices  and  lack  of

examinations had eroded standards seriously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did they know? American students' score in

their  standardised  tests  on mathematics,  reading  and

sciences  became  lower and lower.   At  the  same  time,

college  professors and administrators  began  to  notice

that  high school graduates could not read, write  or  do

basic  arithmetic.   In  short, a large  number  of  high

school graduates were intellectually incompetent in  what

they call the 3Rs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a survey in 1980, 99% of Americans told the

census  takers  that they were literate.   In  fact,  the

educators knew they lied.  Based on the 1989 survey,  12%

of  America's  high  school graduates were  "functionally

illiterate".   What does that mean?  It means  that  they

could not understand printed instructions and could not - would you believe it - fill out a job application!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were many reasons for the sad state of

affairs.   Among them were the abolition of core courses,

proliferation of electives and very few examinations.  In

fact,  many  schools had no examinations, and those  that

had examinations had simple examinations - what they call

a  "dumbing down" of the curriculum.  If you  go  to  any

bookshop today, you will see that some of the bestsellers

in computer and lifestyle books are in what they call the

"dummy series".  A lot of these dummy series books became

very popular, because the system was levelled down to the

lowest  common  denominator so that everybody  could  get

very good grades, go home with the feel-good factor,  and

every  parent could pat his/her child and say, "Son,  you

have done well.  Congratulations!"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all of us know of children with average grades

in  Singapore  who  have suddenly blossomed  in  overseas

schools.  Obviously, this could not have happened in just

a few months or years.  Yet, such experiences are common.

Why?  Perhaps, we have levelled up a lot while they have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1595</b></font><br><br>



dumbed down a lot.  So, when you cross over, you are like

a  leopard  cat which suddenly becomes a leopard!   These

experiences  vindicate the success  of  the  Ministry  of

Education  and speak volumes about the high standards  of

our system here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US, the issue of falling standards became an

issue.  Ex-President George Bush and the Governors of all

the 50 states moved for a root-and-branch change - unlike

the review we are talking about today, which is tempering

at  the edges.  The changes are substantial, but I do not

think  it  is  a root-and-branch change.  In  America  in

1989,  Ex-President  George Bush  and  the  50  Governors

decided  to  do  a root-and-branch change  of  the  whole

system,  and  Congress gave effect to what  is  known  as

"Goals  2000"  - not football but education.   And  Goals

2000  was  given teeth when Congress approved Goals  2000

and  gave  additional federal grants for  all  states  to

reach  six objectives.  Perhaps we should look  at  these

six objectives and measure them against what the Ministry

of Education is trying to do today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goal 1: That all children must start school, ready

to  learn.  We must ask ourselves, do Singapore  children

start school ready to learn?  The answer is yes;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goal 2: That 90% of all high school students will

graduate;   it  does not matter what age, but  they  will

graduate;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goal 3: That all students will achieve competence

in core subjects at certain key points in their progress.

In  other words, when you have a high school diploma, you

are  supposed  to  reach  the standards  set  by  certain

authorities, and not a diploma that means nothing;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goal 4: That American students will be the first in

the  world in mathematics and science achievement.   That

was  a  key goal, because they think that for America  to

lead the world, American students must be the first - not

second,  not  third  - in the world  in  mathematics  and

science achievements.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1596</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goal 5: That every American will be literate and

have  the  skills  to function as a citizen  and  worker.

Here,  we talk about thinker, innovator, creator.   Their

goals  are very simple - every American will be  literate

and have the skills to function as a citizen and worker - in other words, be functionally literate.  A simple goal;

and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goal 6: This goal is something we have no problem

with:   That  all  schools will  be  free  of  drugs  and

violence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move from 1986 to the year 2000, when

President  George  W Bush ran for elections  and  was  so

disillusioned with the system.  His father,  Ex-President

George Bush had set Goals 2000.  In 2000, George W  Bush,

Jr,  ran  as a candidate and said that he was  not  happy

with  the  system.   It had achieved  some  but  had  not

achieved a lot.  His key quotation was: "I would shine  a

spotlight  of  shame on failure".  The Americans  do  not

like  to shame students.  They always tell their students

how good they are, that they have done well.  But he says

that  that  is  not good enough.  If the student  is  not

good,  better  shame him.  That is the only  way  to  get

standards up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation got quite bad, and the American

politicians, both Gore and Clinton, engaged on the issue.

They were particularly displeased perhaps that it was not

Americans who were the first in mathematics and  science,

but  that it was tiny little Singapore that was first  in

mathematics  and  second in science.  I think  we  should

congratulate our students, parents and educators for this

singular   achievement.   Clearly,  forgiving  everybody,

making the syllabus simple, putting everybody in the same

coach  class  travelling  in the  same  slow  coach,  and

dumbing  down  the curriculum is a choice we  should  not

venture  into.  It will make parents happy if  we  rename

the  schools  and have, say, 20 Raffles Institutions,  20

Raffles  Girls Schools, 20 Chinese Highs,  etc.   We  can

fool ourselves, but the world will not be deceived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The correct approach is that taken by the Ministry

of  Education.  Differentiate the students not because we

condemn them but because we want to help them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1597</b></font><br><br>



Different students have different needs.  They come  from

different   backgrounds,  with  different   talents   and

interests.  We should put them into different trains  and

drive at a speed that they are comfortable with, but when

they  reach  a certain destination, they are expected  to

achieve   the  kind  of  results  that  that  destination

demands.   However,  overall, if we take  the  sum  total

speed  of  all the trains, that train must  travel  at  a

speed fast enough for us to enter the new economy.  There

is  a  break-through speed.  If we are too slow, we  will

never arrive, because the world has moved on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slow learners need help. They do not need help by

adults stigmatising them.  There is nothing wrong with  a

slow  learner arriving at "O" or "A" level a  little  bit

later.  The fact that they have arrived is something that

we  should  applaud and not condemn.  If we  put  a  slow

learner  on  a fast train, he or she would fall  off  the

train.  If we drive a slow train for a fast learner,  the

passenger would fall asleep.  A slow train which  arrives

late is better than one which arrives empty.  But can  we

put everybody on board and drive a slow train?  Then,  we

will have the American problem, which they are trying  to

fix, and we should not move ourselves into that system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for slow learners, I think the Ministry of

Education  has  found  a solution.   If  we  support  the

Ministry  of  Education and the students  who  have  some

difficulty learning, I think they will be all right.   If

we keep talking about it, the stigma that the students in

the "N" stream and the 3-year Pre-U classes feel today is

largely  imposed by society.  Who comprise society?   You

and I, parents.  Collectively, we are at fault.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For slow learners, I think the Ministry of Education

has the solution.  It is more difficult to coach the most

talented,  and  there are very few  of  these  people  in

Singapore.  I always hope that the Ministry of  Education

could do a little bit more for the most talented, not  by

teaching them more - because probably they know more than

the  teachers - but by giving them the right  environment

and creating



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1598</b></font><br><br>



the  right  mood.  Those extraordinary men and women  who

are  good in academic work, sports, dance, music and  the

arts, they need a different kind of education altogether.

You  might ask, "Why do we need to help them?   They  are

already  so good."  The answer is: because they  are  our

hope.  They are our salvation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I am very pleased with the recommendation of

the  Committee  to establish these so-called  specialised

schools.  However, I would like to counsel, like the  two

hon.  Members before me that, in a way, this is a  higher

form  of  streaming,  a higher form  of  differentiation.

Children  who get into these specialised schools  may  be

few,   and   children  who  cannot  get   in   may   feel

disappointed.  This should not be the case.  But I  think

there is a need for such schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Education mentioned two of these

schools  -  Bronx High School of Science  and  Stuyvesant

High School.  Maybe I can just mention a little bit about

these  specialised schools in New York  City,  which  are

really in a class of their very own.  Among the ruins  of

the state high school education system in New York, there

are jewels in the squalor.  When we drill deeper into the

American  system, we have to recognise that  the  average

student is an academic laggard, but there is a tiny slice

of  the community which is exceptionally brilliant.   But

because they have a big population base, that tiny  slice

is enough to pull America forward to be the most powerful

nation  today.  This is not surprising, where you have  a

large  pool  of  laggards and a small  number  of  highly

talented people because, if you had been to a desert, you

would  understand that it is only in a desert that  there

are oases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New York City Specialised High School System is

something  in a class of its own.  In fact, in  New  York

City,   there  are  three  of  these  schools   and   one

specialised high school in dance and music.  New  Yorkers

call  these "specialised schools", but actually it is  an

euphemism  for very elite schools.  These  are  the  best

schools.  They are also public schools.  Students who get

in, get free tuition.  It is in these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1599</b></font><br><br>



schools - three mathematics and science schools, and  one

music  and  dance  school - that the future  captains  of

industry in New York City are being groomed for tomorrow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think a specialised school, not just for

mathematics  and science but also maybe  for  sports  and

music,  is  an  idea whose time has come  for  Singapore,

precisely  because  our talent pool is  very  thin,  even

though the average standard of the student population  is

high.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Education mentioned that the

specialised  schools have the Integrated  Programme  that

starts  from  Grade 9 all the way to Grade 12,  ie,  from

Secondary  3  to  JC 2. The schools are  prohibited  from

taking  in  students  on any other basis.   So,  sometime

around  October, the New York City Council will set  what

they  call the Specialised Science High Schools Admission

Test  (SSHSAT) - SATS is too easy for these  kids  -  and

students  who  score  the  highest  will  be  ranked  and

streamed to these four specialised high schools.  Neither

wealth,  prestige nor power will open the door  to  these

schools for the child.  The child must get in on  his  or

her own merit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would think that these three high schools in New

York  City  -  at least the mathematics and science  high

schools  - get their cream from all the states.  This  is

not  the case, not even from the whole of New York State.

They  only get the cream from New York City which, as  we

know,  consists  of  five boroughs.   So  the  population

catchment  of  New  York  City  is  something  like  9-10

million.   In  other words, each specialised high  school

only  gets from a catchment of three million.  In a  way,

it  is  like  Bronx Science getting from  three  million,

similar  to RI getting from the whole of Singapore.   But

if  we  were  to  benchmark  RI's  academic  achievements

against  Bronx Science's, then we are comparing  a  dwarf

versus a giant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bronx Science alone has produced five Nobel Prize

winners.   Stuyvesant High has produced two  Nobel  Prize

winners and one Field Medallist.  A Field Medal is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1600</b></font><br><br>



Nobel  Prize for Mathematics.   Brooklyn Tech,  which  is

the other specialised high school, has produced two Nobel

Prize  winners.   So, together, they have  produced  nine

Nobel  Prize and one Field Medal winners.  Just  imagine,

1.3  billion  Chinese have produced only six Nobel  Prize

winners!   So,  these three schools are  outstanding  and

they  are  not  that old.  The oldest is only  about  100

years old.  Bronx Science is about 70-80 years old.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we need to give our brightest students the

best  environment.   If we can create  a  Bronx  Science,

Brooklyn  Tech  or a Stuyvesant High in our  backyard,  I

think Singapore has great hopes for the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standards in these schools are extremely high and

the  standards and the hours spent in the schools are  so

high that Singapore parents will scream for mercy if  any

of   their  children  went  there.   Brooklyn  Tech,  for

example, sets the passing mark at 65 marks. That is  only

the  passing mark.   The average mark is 75 marks.   That

is what they call the recommended grade.  Brookyln Tech's

graduating class last year (2001) won scholarships to Ivy

League,  to all the good universities, totalling  us  $36

million worth of scholarships.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to graduate from Brooklyn Tech, you need 44

credit  points,  versus 40 credit points across  the  New

York  State system.  But most Brooklyn Tech students take

50  credit points.  It is an outstanding school where the

pressure is so great that no Singapore school, I believe,

and  I  am an RI alumni and I am ashamed to say  that  RI

does  not  measure up to Brooklyn Tech or  Stuyvesant  or

Bronx Science.  The focus that we are asking students  to

spend too much time on the curriculum is not wrong but we

have it in focus, because in America, the very best spend

a  lot  more time on the core subjects.  When we  measure

against them, we are just out-classed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I strongly recommend the establishment of a

Specialised  High School of Mathematics and  Science  for

the  reasons that I have enumerated.  But whether  it  is

best supervised by NUS is something I am not sure.  Bronx

Science  is  not  under  the  supervision  of  New   York

University (NYU)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1601</b></font><br><br>



or  Columbia  University but it had a dedicated  founding

principal, Dr Morris Mester.  I think the champion agency

is  important  but it is not the over-riding  importance.

The  most  important  factor is  a  champion  himself  or

herself,  the  principal must be totally  passionate  and

dedicated to the cause of specialised education.   In the

Specialised  High School of Mathematics and Science,  the

curriculum  should  not  just focus  on  Mathematics  and

Science alone.  As in the three specialised high schools,

they do a broad spectrum of other subjects and there  are

people  who  come  out from those schools  who  are  non-scientists,  for  example,  William  Safire  from   Bronx

Science - he is a writer.  Then you have got people  like

Lucy Liu of Charlie Angels fame.  She is from Stuyvesant.

These  are  people  who  did  not  pursue  a  course   in

Mathematics  and  Science  and  become  Nobel   laureates

material.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also agree with the recommendation to set up

a  Specialised School of Music and Dance.  But  here,  we

have  to  be realistic.  We may not have enough  critical

mass  to  start here.  If we can have the critical  mass,

there  is  no harm because it is an area that  we  should

pursue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many high schools in the developed countries have,

what  the  media calls, the through-train  system.   That

means  you start from Secondary One and finish at  JC  2.

The  Australians  call it Year 7 to  Year  12.  But  this

approach  is premised on the fact that when  you  are  on

this through-train, you want to enter university, in  the

sense that the JC 2 examination, the Year 12 examination,

is  a university entrance examination.  But some students

may  not  want to travel this train.   Therefore,  it  is

correct  that  there is no necessity for all  schools  to

implement this system.  Some students may not want to  go

to  university.   They may want to pursue sports,  music.

Some may want to change train after Secondary 4 to go  to

the  polytechnic.  Some may want to go overseas.   It  is

useful to keep the "O" level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suspect that in our system, some of the students

on the through-train might quietly sit for the "O" levels

also.  There



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1602</b></font><br><br>



is  a  good  reason  for it because today,  a  small  but

growing  number  of "O" level students  are  sitting  for

their SAT and they are proceeding to good universities in

America  to  finish off their degrees.   We  should  give

students  more choices.  Choice is always  a  good  thing

provided  that  it does not dumb down the curriculum,  it

does not trim the content of the core subjects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The review also recommended, in a quite substantial

way,  on broadening the syllabus to provide more choices.

This  is a good recommendation.   If the "A" level has  a

chink in the armour, it is that it is too narrowly based.

It  is all right for good students who want to specialise

in  the universities and make up their minds at 18  years

old.   But if you are not very sure, and you are  groping

around,   then   the  broader  base   system   would   be

recommended.   As  in many systems in the  past  in  many

countries, when you move from a core system to  a  broad-based  system,  contents are inevitably  diluted  because

there  are  certain  fixed  hours  that  students  attend

schools  for.  It is important that when we move  from  a

core "A" level today, with four or five principal levels,

to  a  broad-based  system we should not  trim  down  the

content  of the core subjects too much. Core subjects,  I

would  say, on the academic side, are languages,  English

is  a  must.  For mother tongue, not many of us  will  be

able  to  grasp  the  two languages but  those  who  can,

should.  Mathematics and Science are a must.  With  these

three core subjects - language, Mathematics and Science - you  can branch into most electives.  Most electives  are

knowledge-based and if you are good in language, you  can

do  English Literature.  If you are good in logic and you

can  understand  a  lot of things and the  foundation  of

these  is  Mathematics, Science and Language.  The  right

mix  between  core  and electives is a bit  difficult  to

achieve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have mentioned the Japanese experience. They

moved  from core to broad-based, the dumbing down of  the

Mathematics curriculum.  I would like to urge MOE to be a

little  bit  careful  here.  Whether  the  "A"  level  is

superior to the International Baccalaureate, opinions are

divided.  I think there is no harm trying



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1603</b></font><br><br>

both  systems  and let students have a choice.   Whatever

system, I hope we will achieve excellence either  in  "A"

level or in the IP system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On balance, I commend the Ministry of Education for

moving ahead.  I believe that this review is not premised

on  the  basis that the present system has problems.   In

fact,  we  are  moving from a very strong platform  to  a

higher level.



<br>5.22 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support

of the motion standing in the name of RAdm Teo Chee Hean,

Minister for Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I recently returned from a trip to China.

There is now a very popular phrase in China, and that is,

"yu  shi ju jin" - progressing with time.  Sir, the world

is  changing very fast, much faster now than before,  and

the  education system must also change for us to keep  up

with the changing times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initiatives and proposals contained in the

report  of the Junior College and Upper Secondary  School

Education Review Committee are bold and wide-ranging.  If

implemented, they will significantly change our  approach

to  education.   Historically, our education  system  has

been  based  on a highly structured approach.   Over  the

years, we have sought to gradually open up our system  to

allow for variety and some experimentation.  Now, we  are

ready  for  a  major quantum leap.  The impact  of  these

proposals  before  us  will  be  far  reaching  and  long

lasting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I agree with the overall concept and

approach  proposed by the White Paper, I  would  like  to

make  several observations and I hope the Ministry  could

take  them  into  account  when  implementing  these  new

measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of the proposed changes depends

critically  on the implementation process.   Firstly,  we

need  to  prepare our teachers, students and parents  for

these  major changes in the JC curriculum that have  been

proposed.  The broadening of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1604</b></font><br><br>



the   curriculum  will  undoubtedly  better  prepare  our

students  for the university education and  to  meet  the

challenges  of the fast-changing world we  now  live  in.

However,  as  these changes are quite significant,  there

may  be a need to prepare the students even during  their

upper  secondary  school days so  that  they  are  better

prepared  for the broader curriculum.  In this regard,  I

am  glad  that  the report has recognised  the  potential

upstream  impact on the secondary schools.  I would  like

to  urge  the  Ministry  to  also  look  into  the  upper

secondary  school  curriculum and make adjustments  where

necessary to help students adapt to the new system in the

JCs.   For  example,  some modules of the  Knowledge  and

Inquiry could be introduced to the students in the  upper

secondary schools so that they will be more familiar with

the subject when they enter into the JC.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality, some students, especially the slower

ones, may find the broadened curriculum more difficult to

handle.  These difficulties may be more acute during  the

transition  period  when  the  new  curriculum  is  first

introduced  as  it  would take some time  for  things  to

settle down and for the students and teachers to get used

to the new system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help them cope better, additional time and

attention  may need to be provided to coach them  and  to

help them catch up. The schools could help identify these

weaker  students  and  consider providing  some  form  of

learning support.  This is particularly useful during the

first  one  or two years when the changes are introduced.

It  will also help assure our parents that their children

will be able to benefit from the new approach rather than

to suffer from it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers, on the other hand, will need time to

adjust  to a more skilled based system.  As new  subjects

such  as  the  Knowledge and Inquiry will be  introduced,

teachers  will  need to understand the new  requirements.

Some  may  need  to  change their  teaching  methods  and

acquire  new  teaching skills.  They  may  also  need  to

develop  new  ways  of  assessing the  students.   It  is

therefore crucial that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1605</b></font><br><br>

Ministry prepares and trains the teachers so that the new

curriculum can be implemented effectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers at the upper secondary levels also have a

vital role to play as a bridge to help advise and counsel

their  students  so that they in turn can  make  informed

decisions  on  the  subjects  they  intend  to  take  up.

Parents,  in  particular, may also need to  be  similarly

briefed and counselled beforehand.  It would therefore be

helpful  if  the  Ministry  could  consider  providing  a

briefing for the secondary school teachers and principals

in addition to those in the JCs.  They will then be in  a

better  position  to offer advice to their  students  and

parents.   This way, I believe that it will help smoothen

the implementation of the new curriculum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to suggest to the Ministry to

consider  including some elementary management components

in  the  new  curriculum.   This  could  comprise  people

management  skills, communication skills, decision-making

process, basic business and management principles.   This

is  in  line  with  our  move to  promote  and  encourage

entrepreneurship.  In fact, no matter what  our  students

end up doing in future, they will invariably benefit from

some basic management know-how.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some project work in the new curriculum could also

include  development  of business  ideas  and  this  will

foster  innovative  thinking among our  students.   There

could  even  be  vacation attachment programmes  to  give

students  an  opportunity to see first-hand how  business

corporations  work and the issues involved in  running  a

business.    Schools   who  wish  to   offer   management

components may be able to draw on the resources from  the

management  schools  in  the  universities  or  from  the

private   sector.   This  way,  we  can  inject   greater

professionalism in our courses.  Hopefully, over time, we

can  produce more entrepreneurs to spearhead our economic

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, on the proposed integrated programmes, it

is  important  for  us to carefully explain  the  various

models  to the students and the parents so that they  are

in a position to make informed decisions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1606</b></font><br><br>



with  regard to the route they are taking, so  that  they

can reap the maximum benefits.  To provide diversity,  it

is  good  to allow JCs and secondary schools to  come  up

with creative ideas on integrated programmes.  So far, we

have  seen  quite a number of schools submitting  a  wide

variety  of  proposals.  I am sure more  variations  will

emerge  as time goes on. Even the university is  keen  to

operate a specialised school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid confusion, it would be useful for the

Ministry  to  explain in layman's terms  how  the  system

works  and  how  parents and students should  make  their

decisions and the implications of their decisions.  Annex

N  of  the  report provides a very good overview  of  the

proposed  education landscape, but it is not easy  for  a

layman  to  fully  understand what it  means.   Once  the

models have been finalised, it would be opportune for  us

to  explain  in greater details.  We could also  simplify

the  models and pilot perhaps just one or two as a start.

Once   we  have  gained  more  experience,  we  can  then

experiment with greater variations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, on the proposed setting up of privately

funded  schools, I think it is a welcome  initiative.   I

would  like to urge the Ministry to proactively encourage

internationally renowned private schools to set up  their

branch  here.   These well-run private schools  will  not

only  provide variety and choice for our students.   They

could  also  bring  in innovative teaching  methods  that

could  benefit our schools here as well.  Given that  the

number  of such privately funded schools is going  to  be

limited  to only two or three, I would like to  urge  the

Ministry  not  to  be too restrictive on  the  conditions

imposed  on them.  The key criteria should be the quality

of their system and the quality of their output.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mdm Deputy Speaker (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua) in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br>5.32 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fifth point relates to the 3-year pre-university

programmes which are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1607</b></font><br><br>



currently  provided  in  the two centralised  institutes.

Most  of the proposals in the White Paper are focused  on

the   objective  of  maximising  the  potential  of   our

students,  especially those who are in the upper  end  of

the cohort.  This invariably gives rise to the impression

that  the lower end of the cohort, especially those  that

are  pursuing  the 3-year pre-university programmes,  are

being  neglected.  There were few proposals, if  any,  to

improve  the system to also maximise their potential.   I

would  like to urge the Ministry to also look  into  this

aspect  so  that these students would not feel left  out.

Perhaps  some  of them may be suitable for  the  proposed

specialised independent schools if they possess  specific

talents.  A system could be put in place to allow them to

switch to these specialised schools where appropriate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, communication is vital. Whatever changes we

want to make to the education policy, it is vital that we

take pains to explain them to the teachers, students  and

parents.   This  is crucial in garnering  acceptance  and

support for the policy changes and for the new policy  to

be  effective.  For this reason, I would like to urge the

Ministry  to  continue to engage the various stakeholders

through public media, dialogue sessions and other avenues

to  explain to them and to solicit feedback from them  as

we  refine  the  proposals.  It may  even  be  useful  to

produce an easy-to-understand booklet to explain the  new

system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is a vital part of our Government policy

as it affects the entire population and it determines our

future.  It is also one of the most difficult part as its

effects  are  usually  not immediately  obvious.   Madam,

there  is no perfect system, although every parent thinks

and  believes  that he alone knows the perfect  solution.

We  must  continuously review and improve  our  education

system to keep up with the times, so as to give the  best

to  our  children.  I sincerely hope that this report  is

not  the end but a turning point.  I hope that the review

process  will  continue  and our  future  generation  can

benefit from an ever improving system.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1608</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I support the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker,

thank  you  for  allowing me to speak on today's  motion,

which has far-reaching and long-term implications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to state that this is a

courageous  and  responsive  move  on  the  part  of  the

Ministry  of Education.  There has been so much  talk  in

homes,  schools  and  debates in the  newspapers  on  our

school  system   -  the pressure on the school  children,

the perceived rigidity and, of course, its strengths.  As

some of the earlier speakers have said, after all is said

and done, we do not have a train wreck!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feedback has been taken into account and many

opinions  sought.  I applaud the efforts of the Committee

to  tap  a  wide spectrum of views.  The fact  that  this

motion  is  tabled today is a reflection of our  system's

true   responsiveness  and  swift  action  on   feedback,

resulting in a timely and better solution for the  future

of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that we have the courage to make changes

to  our system when we feel there is a true need for  it.

In  many aspects, this also reflects the true strength of

our people, the willingness to make changes even ahead of

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To revamp the education system is not an easy

matter.    It   will   involve  changes   in   processes,

methodology, systems and, more importantly, mindsets.  It

will  not  happen  overnight and it will be  painstaking.

The impact will be far-reaching.  Many, those already  in

school  as well as our future generations, will feel  the

impact.   So,  why are we doing all this?   In  order  to

ensure that our only key vital resource - our people - is

nurtured  and  developed to be able  to  compete  in  the

global  arena.   That our people are economically  active

and in the passage through life enrich the well being  of

both themselves and their fellow citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While changes are being proposed to our education

system,  this is not to say that our current system  does

not  have its benefits.  Many of us have gone through the

current or even the older system,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1609</b></font><br><br>



depending  on our ages.  We all have benefited  from  it.

It   has   produced   high  levels  of   achievement   by

international    comparisons.     Our    students    have

consistently done well overseas, courted and  admired  by

foreign  centres  of learning.  So, at this  juncture,  I

would  like to reiterate some of these benefits  which  I

hope would not be lost in the revamped system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our current system produces outstanding Science and

Mathematics students.  Other countries have evaluated our

approach   and   adopted   our   syllabi   and   teaching

methodology.  Perhaps it is the rigour of the system, the

disciplined approach that has generated this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other important aspect that must be retained is

the continuous effort to integrate our people; to build a

society  that is multi-racial, multi-cultural and  multi-religious.  My early memories of school is the recital of

the  Pledge before the start of each school day.  We must

preserve this at all costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on to the proposed revised education framework

and education system.  I particularly like a quote that I

read  recently  which, I believe, is appropriate  in  our

discussion today.  By theologian, T. Edwards,  who  lived

in the 19th century, it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The great end of education is to discipline rather

than  to furnish the mind; to train it to the use of  its

own powers, rather than fill it with the accumulation  of

others.'



This,  I  believe,  is the thrust of  what  our  proposed

system aims to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have succeeded in imparting knowledge to our

students.  They, in turn, are like sponges soaking in all

the  information  that is fed to them.  Too  often,  they

accept the knowledge imparted without question.  This may

stem from our traditional respect for teachers and people

in authority and therefore not questioning.  As a result,

we  have  often  heard our students are  too  reliant  on

teachers  to  feed them with information that  they  lack

questioning minds and initiative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lack of these qualities is glaringly noticed

when they enter the workforce.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1610</b></font><br><br>



Anecdotal examples from friends and colleagues illustrate

this  point.   Let me just share one.  A  foreign  senior

manager, whom I had the chance to speak with, is  from  a

major   disk  drive  manufacturer.   He  heads   a   team

responsible  for  Asia and draws talent from  around  the

world.   Among  his  10 senior managers   -   the  people

mapping  strategies, formulating solutions and responding

to   challenges   -   he  has  a  wide  range  of   Asian

nationalities  but no Singaporeans.  Why?   "Singaporeans

are  not  innovative enough" was his response. They  need

checklists  and  a guiding hand all the time.   And  they

play  it  safe.   However, his middle management  is  all

populated with Singaporeans who he can trust because they

are great executors of plans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This and other anecdotes may be symptomatic of the

issue  -  rote  learning.  To survive  well  in  an  ever

changing  and more globalised economy, we must equip  our

younger  generation to question and think on their  feet.

They will then be able to adapt to different environments

and be able to face challenges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if one remembers that the great bulk of the body

of  knowledge had been amassed in the last hundred  years

and  fast accelerating, what we learn today may  well  be

obsolete in our lifetime.  Hence, we need to pay heed  to

how  we impart knowledge in this very modern world; where

the  information highway makes available at the speed  of

light  a  whole cache of information through the Internet

and other modern media.  There is a wealth of information

and  knowledge  out  there waiting to  be  harvested  and

turned into useful, commercially viable know-how.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new emphasis on project work, research and

inquiry-based   search for knowledge at  an  early  stage

would develop and hone the questioning spirit and nurture

inquisitive minds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, self expression must be encouraged.

Multi-way  communication must be buoyant.  The  classroom

must  be  turned  into a forum.  The  flow  of  thoughts,

questions and ideas should not be linear.  A matrix  flow

must be encouraged



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1611</b></font><br><br>



between  students and teachers; among students and  among

teachers.   Teachers  must relish the  challenge  and  be

trained  to  draw  out  the  more  reserved  among  their

students.   The  Socratic method of  teaching  -  drawing

answers  from questions posed, getting students  involved

and excited about the material being taught - is one form

of doing this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diversity is our strength. Hence, I also support

the  flexibility of the new system to allow for  academic

and non-academic specialisations.  The approach of having

sports  and arts specialities in dedicated schools  would

open  up  new avenues for our young who are endowed  with

these talents.  We have to persevere or we would not have

a  continuous  stream  of badminton, bowling,  ping-pong,

playwrights  and violinist stars to stand proud  for  us.

We redefine what is success for our young.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the key to the success of the

proposed new system rests on two points revolving  around

implementation.  One, to ensure that there is an adequate

pool  of  teachers  who can switch from  the  traditional

approach  to teaching.  No longer must there be just  one

way  or  a  fixed  way to approach a problem.   Students'

curiosity  must be aroused, and they must  be  guided  to

figure  out  complex issues with their own  thinking  and

insights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encouragement must abound. Remove the fear of

failure,  of giving wrong answers.  At all ages, students

must be encouraged to experiment, to fail, understand why

they  failed, nudged to pick up and try again.   Teachers

must establish that rapport with the students, create  an

intellectually uninhibited environment in the  classroom;

unfreeze  the students psychologically from the paralysis

that stems from the fear of "messing up".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point on implementation is priority and

pace.   I  believe the approach is correct.  We must  not

fail  because we do not apply the adequate level and type

of resources in the execution.  Hence, while



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1612</b></font><br><br>

the changes proposed are bold, we may have to prioritise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal of creating even greater diversity in

courses  and new pathways is, in my opinion, not an  area

of  immediate  urgency.   We  must  allow  time  for  the

students  to reorientate to these new educational  skills

and  priorities.  Introducing too many changes all at the

same time may, in fact, cause saturation, heavy workload,

and  may  result  in  disruption and confusion  for  both

students  and  teachers.  A phased  approach  will  be  a

better way to introduce such evolutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal is comprehensive in many aspects.

However,  I hope the Committee would consider three  more

factors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, it is a system that is unforgiving; one

that  does  not allow repeated failures.  The flexibility

and  diversity of the new proposal involve some  form  of

risk  taking  by  the  students  too.   They  are  making

decisions  at  a tender age and we must be prepared  that

some  make mistakes in judgement.  Here is the only  area

where  I think the proposal has not gone far enough.   We

must  have a structure in which they are given  a  second

chance;  and even maybe a third.  For if we subscribe  to

life-long learning, then we must allow students to unwind

earlier  choices  and start anew.  Like what  the  Senior

Parliamentary  Secretary said,  "as  long  as  the  train

arrives, it does not matter if it is late."  So along the

way,  maybe we may create the entrepreneurial environment

that we all yearn for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point is that the new proposal should

increase  emphasis on National Education.  This has  been

introduced  in  schools  and  it  must  continue  to   be

emphasised.   I  have  heard from a  fellow  MP  that  he

detects  that  younger people in the upper secondary  and

post-secondary  exhibit  less  of  an  identification  to

Singapore than those in their mid-twenties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is this so? Should not this sense of identity

set in earlier rather than later?  Hence, I hope that the

Committee  will  look  into  more  aspects  of   National

Education.  Beyond textbooks, bring National Education to

life, eg, visits to military



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1613</b></font><br><br>



camps,  exposure to our war heroes, our journey to  water

sufficiency, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a young nation; our people are always looking

ahead  and  perhaps spending too little time  remembering

the  past.   We must do more to commemorate and celebrate

the sacrifices of those that had made nationhood possible

for  us.   The achievements, sacrifices and contributions

of  the  many notable Singaporeans must be made known  to

the young.  Hence, why not make National Education one of

the  KI or PW topics?  Rather than suffer the fate  that,

if  imposed  upon, some youngsters feel  they  are  being

brain-washed; let them go on a journey of self-discovery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point concerns stress and pressure. This

comes  up  often  whenever the subject  of  education  in

Singapore  is  discussed.  Could the  Committee  consider

more  emphasis  on continual assessment  and  reduce  the

frequency  of  examinations?  With  less  rote  learning,

there   should  be  a  correspondingly  less   need   for

examinations that we know today.  Learning should be fun.

The  KI approach could be extended to even more subjects.

Examination   pressure  may  actually  paradoxically   be

mitigated by incessant and continuous assessments.   And,

through life, we are continually assessed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond my earlier suggestions on some adjustments to

the  proposals, I am totally supportive.  Especially,  in

the  new school environment, emphasis must be on students

presenting  and convincing other students.  Communication

skills  must be brought to the forefront.  From a  tender

age,  they  must  learn  to stand up,  speak,  be  heard,

convince and defend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have just returned from a short trip to Israel and

one  thing  I  heard is that when you  put  two  Israelis

together you will get three opinions.  Why not?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we hope to turn out generations of more inquiring

Singaporeans, we may also have to handle the  possibility

of a more chaotic, challenging, vibrant and unpredictable

environment.   But  this is exactly  the  strength  of  a

pluralistic society, tapping the wisdom and experience of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1614</b></font><br><br>



everyone.   We  just  have to be prepared  for  this  new

environment,  stay  the  course  and  not  waver  in  our

resolve,  for  it could get uncomfortable for  the  older

people used to more compliance.  It is a journey that  we

must see through.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I reiterate that I am in favour of

the  proposal  to revise the education  system.   In  the

process,  we  must  bear in mind not  to  put  additional

pressure  on  our students.  Hence the recommendation  to

trim  curriculum content to create space for enhancements

to  other areas in JC education is applaudable.   Parents

have  consistently been complaining that  their  children

are  stressed and do not have time for recreation and  to

pursue other interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While aiming for a more flexible curriculum and to

develop thinking generations of Singaporeans, the  stress

factor  must  not  be increased.  The new  system  should

allow  for  students to learn at their pace, provide  for

those who may be late developers and for those with  non-academic  talents.  And they should be  given  additional

chances as they explore; to fail and try again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want multi-faceted Singaporeans who will

contribute to the economy and add vibrancy to  our  young

nation.   We  want  thinkers,  creators,  sportsmen   and

artists.   Is  it a tall order?  Perhaps, but  we  are  a

nation  known not to wallow in discussion,  one  that  is

quick on our feet.  We act on solving our issues and that

is what we are doing right now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being examination savvy is no longer enough. Our

young  must  be  equipped with the best  hi-tech  fishing

rods,  nets  and spear-guns to go fishing and not  merely

provided with fishes.  They must have the ability  to  do

lateral and vertical thinking, to think and question  the

fundamentals, to achieve understanding rather  than  just

knowing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mdm

Deputy Speaker, first of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1615</b></font><br><br>



all,  I  would like to thank you for this opportunity  to

join  in  the debate on this motion.  There are 27  other

colleagues  who would like to speak on the motion  and  I

will try my best to make my speech short and brief.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, in this new economy era, in

order  to   survive,  our people must  be  able  to  make

changes,  be flexible and adjust ourselves   to  keep  up

with  the times. As such, this proposal to reform our  JC

education is very apt and appropriate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This report of the Junior College/Upper Secondary

Education Review Committee has been carefully deliberated

upon  and  presented  by a panel of  experts.  All  these

recommendations  are  based on very  solid  grounds.  The

purpose  of the reform is to broaden the scope of studies

of  our  students and to give them more space to  develop

their  potentials and talents to the fullest.   They  are

very creative and challenging.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have discussed with many parents and teachers on

the  recommendations  of the Review  Committee,  and  the

feedback I have is mainly positive. Here, I would like to

make three points concerning the proposed reform.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on the "through-train" method. The Committee

is  recommending  that  some students,  particularly  the

better students, be allowed to go straight from Secondary

One to the "A" level without having to take the "O" level

examination,  and  from  there proceed  straight  to  the

university.   This  is a break-through  and  a  watershed

decision in the reform of our education system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this aspect, I would like to ask what criteria

will MOE take to decide who will be exempted from the "O"

level examinations and take the through-train to the  "A"

level examinations. Will MOE simply designate a number of

schools  to be the "through-trains", and all the students

on  board will go straight to the "A" level examinations?

In  my  opinion, this method will lead to some  problems,

because in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1616</b></font><br><br>



this  way, would not all the students who score  well  in

the  PSLE  be concentrated in these "elite" schools,  and

all  the  other students who could not make the grade  to

these  elite  schools would be deemed to be  second-class

students, and their schools become second-class  schools?

The  teachers in these schools will then feel  that  they

are  given the second-class students to teach. They  will

naturally  be  demoralised, and  the  standard  of  their

teaching,  and consequently the standard of  the  schools

would be lowered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When MOE decides on the "through-train" system,

would  it  be  compulsory for all the  students  in  this

system  to  skip  the  "O'" level examinations?   Do  the

students  have  a choice?  As a matter of fact,  students

who  are  good  in  their  studies  are  not  afraid   of

examinations,  because the examinations  can  only  prove

that  they  are strong in their studies.  So,  would  the

students  be  given  an  option to  take  the  "O"  level

examinations if they decide to do so?  I have  spoken  to

some parents and they are worried that this through-train

system  may  yield unpredictable results. The new  system

will  take  some  time before the result can  be  clearly

seen.  They  are  afraid  that in  the  event  that  some

students  could not cope with the new model of  study  in

the  reformed JC curricula, and could not do well in  the

"A"  level  examinations, they would have  no  "O"  level

results to back them up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With no good "A" level certificate in their bags,

they  would  have  nothing but a PSLE  certificate.  They

cannot  qualify  for  admission to the  university.  Even

looking  for  a  job  would be a big  problem.   Can  MOE

consider  granting some sort of "Certificate of Standard"

for  these  students so that they would have at  least  a

certificate  to show that they have progressed  over  the

years in this "through-train", and has been exempted from

the  "O" level examinations?  This may help them to  seek

admission  in the foreign universities or to show  it  to

their prospective employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to talk about the teaching

resource.  Under this new system, we need to be  able  to

accurately



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1617</b></font><br><br>



assess  the  potential of the students, and to  customise

the  teaching  accordingly, so that  the  students  would

derive the optimal benefits from the system.  I think the

teachers  will play a very important part.  I would  like

to   know  whether  we  have  enough  teachers  who   are

adequately    equipped   to   take   on    this    higher

responsibility.    Let  me  give  you  an   illustration.

Teaching  is like cooking.  If you have some high-quality

abalone, but you do not have a good chef to cook it,  you

would  not be able to serve out a delicious abalone dish.

On  the other hand, if you have the best abalone, and the

best  chef  from the famous abalone restaurant from  Hong

Kong  to  cook it, then I am sure you will  have  a  very

delicious  and well presented abalone dish which  is  fit

for the king.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE will only start this new system in 2006. We

have  a window of  some three to four years before  that.

Can  MOE make use of this period of time to identify some

good  teachers, send them overseas for special  training,

so  that  they will be able to cope with the  demands  of

this  new curriculum, and the students would benefit from

their teaching?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, during my visit to the world-renowned

Qinghua  University in Beijing, I was invited to  tour  a

subsidiary  primary school of the university.    While  I

was  there, the teacher was teaching these young students

about yi sheng (physician).  I observe that many articles

relating  to the medical profession, such as stethoscope,

clinical  thermometer, syringes, etc, were  exhibited  in

the classroom. The teacher made use of this apparatus  to

demonstrate  how  a  physician went about  examining  his

patient  and diagnosing his ailments.  The students  were

invited  to ask questions, and many questions were  asked

by the young children. It was indeed a highly interactive

session.    The students were also invited to participate

in   role-plays  whereby  some  took  the  part  of   the

physicians  and  the  others  played  the  part  of   the

patients.  The  whole  lesson was  conducted  in  a  very

relaxed  and informal manner. No pressure, no  stress.  I

could   see   that   the   students  thoroughly   enjoyed

themselves,  and I am sure they must have  learnt  a  lot

from this kind



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1618</b></font><br><br>



of exercise. This is what I call creative teaching!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night, I had dinner with the Principal of a

Junior  College and he was telling me that  the  teaching

method in Singapore was also very creative.  Perhaps,  we

have left school for too long a period.  In the last  few

decades,  we can clearly see that the school premises and

facilities, or the hardware aspect, have improved a  lot.

But,  we  really do not know about the software aspect  - the  teaching methods, contents and style.  A few  months

ago, I had the opportunity to visit the ITE, and it was a

real eye-opener for me.  I would like to ask the Minister

whether some arrangements can be made for our MPs and our

grassroots leaders to visit the junior colleges  and  the

schools,  to  see  for  ourselves whether  this  software

aspect  of  our  education system could  match  the  vast

improvement in the hardware aspect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We often hear in this House that schools in the

other  countries  are  better. For  what  you  know,  our

schools  may well be better than theirs.  If our MPs  can

have  the opportunity to visit the junior colleges,  they

will have a better understanding of these colleges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, under the new system, how will MOE evaluate

the  performance of the junior colleges?  If we  want  to

attain  good results, the teachers must have the  support

of  the  principals for them to apply their  talents  and

creativity in their teaching.  But, if MOE still  insists

on  using   examination results as the basis to  evaluate

and  rank the junior colleges, then this new system  will

turn  out  to be just an ideal, and will not be practical

at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should evaluate the teachers on their creativity,

not just on the examination results.  In a restaurant, if

the  owner restricts the chef to just a few dishes in the

menu, no matter how creative the chef may be, he will not

be  able  to dish out more delicious cuisines to  attract

more  customers.  I hope that MOE would  also  take  into

consideration  the creativity of the teachers  when  they

rank the junior colleges.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1619</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should use the 6/2/2 system, that means 60% based

on   the   results  attained  by  the  students  in   the

examinations and 20% based on the teaching method of  the

teachers.   We should send out inspectors to  schools  to

evaluate  the  creative level of the  teachers.   If  the

teachers  are  very creative, we should  give  them  more

points, more incentives.  So this will make up 20% of the

total   evaluation.  The remaining 20% will be  based  on

the   creativity  of  the  students.    We   are   always

encouraging the students to be creative, to make full use

of  their talents. The performance of the students can be

reflected  by their linguistic capability, the  way  they

express  themselves  and the way  they  communicate  with

others.   Merits   should  also  be  awarded   to   their

participation  and contributions in the  field  of  arts,

sports   and  community  service.   I  think  we   should

encourage our students to give full play to their talents

and their potential.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my sincere hope that MOE would move away from

the  existing system whereby the ranking of  schools  and

colleges  is  weighted  heavily on  examination  results.

More  emphasis  should  be placed on  the  creativity  or

innovations of the teachers and the students. I think  in

this way, the principals, teachers, students and even the

parents  will put in concerted efforts and work  hand-in-hand to raise the overall standard of the schools, to the

benefit of the students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that MOE would consider the three suggestions

I  have  made. Finally, I would like to thank Mdm  Deputy

Speaker for giving me this opportunity to speak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.



<br>6.12 pm



<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Hong Kah):</b> Mdm Deputy

Speaker,  some  13 years ago, when I first  entered  this

reputable Chamber, I commented that our education  system

produced  many students who were "exam-smart",  extremely

capable of only scoring very many As.  I questioned



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1620</b></font><br><br>



then  whether this was what our nation wanted to achieve.

Now, 13 years on, I am very glad to note that at last the

problem is being addressed in a substantial way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with many points made in the White Paper.

While  our  system has been efficient in  mass  producing

trained  and  skilled  workers for  our  early  years  of

industrialisation, it is no longer good enough to take us

into  the next 30 years in this information era.  In this

new  age, we must be capable of not only producing  goods

and  services,  but also new knowledge  and  intellectual

property.    Unlike  the  traditional  industrial   goods

producing economy, the new winners of the information age

are  companies  which  own significant  IPR  like  CISCO,

Microsoft and Pfizer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are our top students creative enough and

enterprising  enough to fit into this  new  era  to  take

Singapore into the brave new world?  We must address this

problem  now.   Otherwise, like many other countries,  we

may  get caught in the sandwich class: trapped in between

the  newly industrialising, low cost countries like China

and  India, and the western countries who own and produce

most of the world's IPR.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the problems we have to address in our

education  system?  Please let me comment on some  points

from  the Report.  Firstly, many of our schools  and  JCs

adhere   strictly  to  the  syllabus  published  by   the

Education  Ministry.  This leads to a homogenous  student

population  with  little variation - hence  the  lack  of

diversity.  But, parents are also to blame.  If you are a

bright  student scoring many As, try telling your parents

that  you  want  to  go into drama school  to  do  acting

instead of taking up the place offered to you by RJC!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is an over-emphasis on knowledge per

se.  Classes become information download sessions.  Often

neglected   are  the  skills  associated  with  learning,

thinking  and  research.  This leads to poor  ability  to

critique, rigidity, poor reasoning skills, low creativity

and  a spoon-feeding attitude, in which the students (and

later our workers) invariably



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1621</b></font><br><br>



await   instructions  and  information  from  the  higher

authorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, these problems are compounded by "short-termerism", ie, study only for the examinations! Try

asking a student something about what he has studied  two

months  after his final 'A' level paper.  Or  try  asking

him  to read up on something which is interesting but  is

not  in the syllabus.  This problem arises from the  fact

that   our   examinations  are  very  poorly  structured.

Questions   can  be  "spotted".   Answers  are  memorised

wholesale,  sometimes without real understanding  of  the

subject  matter.  Indeed, even students from our top  JCs

memorise  GP,  essays or economic analysis,  hoping  that

their  "spotted"  topics will "come  out"  in  the  final

examinations!   Is this what we want from  our  education

system?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I must commend CHIJ Katong for being

brave enough to make Literature compulsory for their  'O'

level  students.  Literature is sometimes a much  dreaded

subject.  It is difficult to score an A1.  There  are  no

good  "standard"  solutions - no model answers  are  ever

good enough, no DS solution, as we say, in the Army.  And

everything can be argued from different points  of  view.

Further,  it  is  also very difficult to  teach  properly

because  a  teacher has to be good enough  and  confident

enough to accommodate many different points of views from

the students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CHIJ Katong believes that the study of Literature

teaches  their students life-long skills that will  serve

them  well  during their lifetime and it is not  for  the

benefit  of scoring A1s during examinations.  If the  A1s

do not materialise, so be it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what are the skill sets which we should try to

impart  on  to our students?  There are four basic  skill

sets  which  our students should learn by the  time  they

leave  the  JCs.  They are (1) ability to think,  reason,

self-learn,   research  for  facts,   probe   by   asking

intelligent   questions  and  critique.    Without   this

capability, whatever our students learn in their JCs will

soon  become  outdated, if it has not  faded  from  their

volatile memory before that.  They will certainly not  be

able to produce new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1622</b></font><br><br>



knowledge nor lead in any R&D activity.  Hence,  I  would

suggest that As and distinctions should not be given  for

various subjects until a student has clearly demonstrated

his thinking and reasoning capability.  It is too easy to

get  an  "A"  if  all it requires is the reproduction  of

lecture and tutorial notes given by the teachers as model

answers.  Even a dumb photocopying machine can do this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Communications, ie, writing, presentation and

recording.  As pointed out by the Review Committee,  this

is  a  major  area of weakness for many of our  students.

Inventions  and  discoveries can  be  useless  if  nobody

understands  your  achievement.  The best  business  plan

will  fail  from  day  one if you  cannot  convince  your

investor  or  your potential customers of the superiority

of   your  product.   Apart  from  the  formal  classroom

environment,   more  student  activities  like   debates,

seminars  (where the presenters are students themselves),

oratorical  competition and student workshops  should  be

organised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important skill which is somewhat lacking is

the  ability  to keep proper (by proper, I mean  detailed

and precise) records of scientific work.  This stems from

the  over-emphasis  of  getting  the  job,  such  as   an

experiment,  done  rather than paying  attention  to  the

proper  procedures and recording of the  conduct  of  the

experiment.   Teachers must be also made to realise  that

laboratory sessions are not only for teaching the  basics

of  the  subject matter.  They are also to teach students

how to conduct and record an investigative procedure in a

proper  manner.   This  is  an important  aspect  as  R&D

activities,   especially  in  the  biotech  field,   will

necessitate such skills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Teamwork. This has already been addressed in

the  White  Paper.   However, I would like  to  add  that

students should not be participating in CCA because it is

compulsory, or merely for the CCA points which  can  help

in  university  admission.  There is  much  that  can  be

learnt  from  being a committee member of  a  society  or

representing  your  school  in  swimming.   Participation

should come from interest and enjoyment, not CCA points.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1623</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Decision making. This point may not have been

addressed  in  detail  in  the Report.   However,  it  is

related,  yet different, from the first point on thinking

skills.   Decision making goes beyond ability  to  think,

reason  and fact finding.  It involves a certain  measure

of  courage, confidence and leadership.  Some will  argue

that  this  cannot  be  formally taught.   However,  like

teamwork  skills,  we can create the correct  environment

for students to acquire this ability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go through a few other interesting points.

The  Report  suggests  "A Broader and  More  Flexible  JC

Curriculum".   I  support increasing the breadth  in  our

education  system.  However, this should be done  through

"moral  suasion"  and  education rather  than  by  strict

rules.   Imposing breadth upon the student's choices  may

lead  to mechanistic rote learning in order to achieve  a

good  result in a subject, taken not because the  student

loves  it,  but  taken  in order to fulfil  a  government

requirement.   Is  this education?  The very  thought  of

imposing such a requirement runs directly counter to  the

main  idea  of  flexibility.  (In a way,  diversity  also

suffers  because you are eliminating the  possibility  of

generating  some  students who  would  do  well  in  pure

Science or pure Arts.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore urge the Education Ministry to

consider very carefully how we produce breadth in our  JC

student's  education.   Ideally, it  should  be  done  by

convincing  the majority of the students that  this  will

serve  them well.  It will suffice that a large  majority

of  the  students, say, 80% accept this.  If the Ministry

still decides to impose it as a rule, we should still try

to  convince the students and their parents of the merits

of  such  a rule.  In addition to this, I would urge  the

Ministry   to  consider  allowing  an  all-Science   (and

Mathematics) or an all-Arts option for exceptional cases.

In  such  cases, students may be asked to show that  they

are  highly  committed  to this very  specialised  track.

This  commitment could be shown through, say, doing  some

of the subjects at the H3 level or special project work.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1624</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giving students more flexible options is a good

thing.   However,  many students are  not  well  informed

enough  to  appreciate these options.  Their interest  in

the  various  subjects has not been fully  developed  and

cultivated.  Many make choices due to peer group pressure

and by what they hear from the media and their friends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools should provide better advice and counsel to

students making such choices.  This should be done  on  a

continuous  basis  through career talks,  visits,  career

guidance, and other such activities.  This process  is  a

long-term  one,  and  should not be  done  over  a  short

period,  just before such choices are made.  It  is  such

interest,  developed and cultivated over the years,  that

becomes  a  passion.  Such passion is a seed of  possible

greater things in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JCs should be asked to allow more subject

combinations.  Ideally, students should be given  freedom

to  choose their own subject combinations.  This will  in

turn   produce  diversity  through  the  diverse  subject

combinations.   Although there may be  an  administrative

and resource problem, we should allow, whenever possible,

students  to study subjects that they love.  I understand

from  feedback  that it is not possible to  do  "strange"

combinations  like Literature and Biology.   Should  this

not be allowed?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that giving absolute freedom of choice

may   also   have  its  undesirable  effects.    In   our

achievement-oriented  society,  many  will  go  for   the

combinations that will maximise their chances of  getting

the  most  As, rather than taking subjects that  interest

them.  This brings me to the topic of examinations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have touched on the weakness of our examinations

earlier.   I  would like to discuss this in  more  detail

here.   While the main examination paper can continue  to

test   for  knowledge  and  standard  applications,  some

questions that test the students' understanding,  ability

to  think and reason, and the ability to draw conclusions

in  non-standard situations should be included.  This  is

to encourage developing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1625</b></font><br><br>



knowledge   skills,  in  addition  to  merely   absorbing

information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that certain subjects also produce a

disproportionate number of As.  The Ministry of Education

may  want  to check this out.  Surely, it is possible  to

equalise this by adjusting the difficulty of level of the

examination questions, and by some moderation.  We  ought

to  try  to  remove any incentive for choosing a  certain

subject  due  to  the  ease  of  getting  an  A  in   the

examinations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another cause of passive students that we have today

is  due  to our teaching methods.  I think there  is  too

much  spoon-feeding in our schools and  JCs  at  present.

While  this  may be a very efficient way to scoring  high

marks in the examinations, it is like a drug.  It deadens

the  mind  and the processes of thought, and the  student

will be nearly all lost once this is removed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we should continue to provide lecture notes,

but  students  should be made to refer to some  text  and

reference  books.  I know of JC students who relied  only

on  lecture notes and never read a book for their Physics

paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students should be made to look for facts and

details by themselves.  They should also be taught how to

collate,  process and present these facts.  There  should

be  more  student  interactions  and  discussions  during

tutorial classes in JCs.  The teacher could merely  chair

the discussions instead of doing most of the talking.   I

strongly  recommend  more  activities  like  peer   group

teaching,   student   seminars,   debates,   forums   and

workshops.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to touch on the subject of

university entrance requirements.  I find that the  local

universities  are  rather  rigid  in  their  methods   of

selecting  students for entry, and for most  departments.

Generally,  points  are assigned for  various  "A"  level

grades,  and  these are summed.  If you meet the  cut-off

mark,  you are in.  Otherwise, you are out.  I find  this

much  too clinical.  How many points would you give  Remy

Ong for his three Asian Games Gold medals?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1626</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years back, I appealed on behalf of a national

level  badminton  player for admission to  NUS  to  study

engineering.  He missed the cut-off mark by  one  or  two

points.   I  appealed  several times,  right  up  to  the

highest  level at the university, because I believe  that

it  is good for NUS to accept such a student.  But, alas,

the  appeal  was  rejected, citing  the  need  to  adhere

strictly to the rules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, borderline applicants ought to

be  given a chance.  An interview could be conducted  for

these  cases.   Consideration must be given  for  special

circumstances   and  achievements  outside   the   normal

curriculum.   After  all, if more effort  and  time  were

spent  on  his "A" level subject instead of his badminton

activities, much better "A" level results might have been

obtained.  On the other hand, some other applicant may be

able  to show during his interview that he is far  better

in a certain subject than his "A" level results indicate,

and  his lower mark could be due to an illness during his

examination paper.  Surely, such cases deserve a chance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to comment on the use of Project

Work  (PW) for university entrance requirements.  I  hope

this  will  not  add to the stress and  workload  of  our

already  over-taxed JC students.  Assessment  of  Project

Work  is also rather subjective in nature, and this could

lead  to  accusations of unfairness.  I suggest that  the

universities  use a pass/fail requirement for  PW  rather

than  taking into account the actual PW grade  for  their

entrance consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the White Paper's recommendation for

Integrated  Programmes,  private schools  and  specialist

schools.   This  is  because  they  bring  about  greater

diversity for the system and more flexibility and  choice

for the students.  I also support keeping open the 3-year

pre-university centres for students who would  prefer  to

take  more  time  to do their "A" levels.   I  hope  that

transfers  between these different types of schools  will

be   possible,   so  that  students  will   have   better

flexibility to pursue their intended goals.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1627</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to mention that more resources

will be needed to truly achieve the goals of this reform.

Teachers   themselves  need  to  be   retrained.    Their

knowledge  of  the subject may need to be far  wider  and

deeper  than  just the syllabus, because the  better  and

more intelligent students may bring up such issues during

discussion  sessions.  I have no doubt  that  the  reform

will be difficult for some.  However, I think that it  is

beneficial  and  that it can be done.  I agree  with  the

White  Paper's  recommendation  for  more  teachers   and

teaching   resources   in  order   to   facilitate   this

improvement in our education system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to caution that all will be in

vain  if schools and JCs pay lip-service to these changes

without  truly  understanding  and  accepting  the  basic

philosophy underlying the reform.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, the White Paper has provided the

right concept and framework for reform.  It remains to be

seen whether and how we can implement it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the motion.



<br>6.20 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Minister of State for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Defence (Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I have had the benefit

of  chairing a sub-committee for Remaking Singapore.   We

have engaged many people and, from their feedback, I know

that  Singaporeans  take  a keen  interest  in  education

issues but remain divided about the many features of  our

education system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's debate is on a motion of great import. It

will  determine, in no small part, whether  our  children

will lead fulfilling lives.  Once we set our compass  and

decide  on  the course, cohorts of Singaporeans  will  be

headed  along this course, and it will take us  years  to

change our bearings or to steer them back.  Therefore,  I

commend  the  Ministry of Education  for  subjecting  its

report to robust debate here,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1628</b></font><br><br>



and the Party for going a step further, to lift the Whip.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to have a meaningful strategic

conversation  on education until we settle the  score  on

the  merits  of  the different approaches  to  education.

There  are,  I think, two basic approaches to  education.

Let  us  call  the  first approach the `syllabus-centred'

approach, and the second the `learner-centred' approach.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first and more traditional syllabus-centred

approach in education defines the purpose of teaching  as

ensuring  that  students acquire  a  prescribed  body  of

knowledge  and a set of values as determined by  society.

This  is  so that they will grow up to meet the needs  of

the  future  society, namely, what  is  required  of  our

citizens and what is required of our workforce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What follows from such an approach are didactic

teachers,  top-down  teaching, well-behaved  learners,  a

carefully  designed  curriculum and  a  very  disciplined

environment.   The  characteristics of such  a  syllabus-centred approach are sequential preparation for the  next

educational  level,  tests at  the  end  of  each  stage,

grouping  learners of similar abilities  (or  streaming),

and  competition among students and among schools, so  as

to boost performance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second approach is what we may term as the

learner-centred  approach.  Here, the starting  point  is

the  learner,  the student or the child,  rather  than  a

prescribed  body  of knowledge.  The attributes  of  this

approach are different.  Here, a 12-year-old is seen as a

12-year-old, and is to be developed to his  or  her  full

potential.   The 12-year-olds are not seen as future  13-year-olds  and  to be prepared as such.   The  curriculum

takes on an open-ended and enquiry-based orientation, and

they  are  taught experientially and through  activities,

and not taught facts just to be stored.  The values to be

inculcated  are  not made to conform to a  certain  mould

that   society  has  pre-determined.   Every   child   is

accepted.  In fact, every child is celebrated for who  he

or  she  is.   The  role of teachers here  is  merely  to

facilitate  and ensure that the lid to the brain  remains

open and not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1629</b></font><br><br>



to  attempt to fill it up.  Cooperation, as an underlying

social trait, is emphasised over competition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, let us consider each of these

approaches and see if we can determine the right approach

for our time and place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strongest critic of the syllabus-centred

approach can be traced back to Charles Dickens.   In  his

novel  Hard Times, he said that children subject to  such

an  education system are like "little vessels arranged in

order,  ready  to have imperial gallons of  facts  poured

into  them until they are full to the brim." This  system

requires  precise  recall of the  lessons  learnt,  great

reliance   on  memorisation  -  often  without   actively

engaging  the  student  in  the  learning  process.   The

assumption  that  knowledge  is  static,  something  that

already  exists, runs counter to the bewildering pace  at

which knowledge is constantly being reshaped.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are also proponents of the syllabus-based system, and they have also argued, equally

passionately, about the merits of such an approach.  They

assert that the results of a syllabus-based approach  are

more  quantifiable,  so  that  weaker  students  may   be

identified  for remedial lessons and weaker  schools  put

right.   Students are introduced to competition early  in

life.  They learn to face adversity squarely and to  cope

with  failures and labels.  They develop a practical view

of  the world and are not lulled into believing that  our

world  begins with `Once upon a time .' and ends with  `.

live happily ever after'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider now the alternative learner-centred

approach.   For all its strengths and its  appeal  as  an

avant-garde  and progressive approach, it is not  without

critics  either.   Some said it is like  allowing  growth

without  direction and, in the extreme, as we have  heard

from  Assoc  Prof  Koo  Tsai Kee,  it  is  like  allowing

children to decide when, how and what they want to learn.

The  results  of  such an approach are  also  not  easily

measured, and students or schools who are down the  wrong

track cannot be identified early and cannot be put right.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1630</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, which is a better approach? Rather, the

relevant questions are:  Do we need to settle for one  or

the  other  approach?   Do we need to  make  that  binary

either/or choice?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would contend that the optimal choice to prepare

most  students  lies somewhere in between  the  syllabus-centred  and  the  learner-centred approaches.   We  must

preserve the rigour of our current system of education or

risk  structural failure in our schools, as again pointed

out  by  Assoc Prof Koo Tsai Kee.  We must not throw  out

the baby together with the bath water.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible to modify Singapore's predominantly

syllabus-centred  approach to  incorporate  some  of  the

finer  features of the learner-centred approach.  Such  a

hybrid  approach is one that would produce  an  education

system  with  the  teacher still in authority,  with  the

rigour  of  a challenging curriculum, yet with time  left

for  inquiry  and  active engagement of students  in  the

learning  process.  And because of the shorter shelf-life

of knowledge, the subject content, the choice of subjects

and,  in  fact,  the whole syllabus itself,  need  to  be

reviewed more frequently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The JC/Upper Secondary education review report does

not   discuss   the  various  approaches   to   education

explicitly,  but  implicit  in  its  recommendations   to

broaden the JC curriculum is a well-calibrated shift away

from  the  "syllabus-centred" approach more  towards  the

"learner-centred" approach.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of Knowledge and Inquiry as a new

inter-disciplinary subject in Junior College will require

students  to  question the bases of knowledge;  to  apply

what  they  have  learnt,  both inside  and  outside  the

classrooms,  and  to  defend their  positions.   It  will

provide  a good counter-weight against the other content-heavy subjects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, rather than making Knowledge and Inquiry

an  alternative  subject  to GP,  I  would  propose  that

Knowledge and Inquiry be offered in lieu of GP.   In  the

International Baccalaureate programme,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1631</b></font><br><br>



a similar "Theory of Knowledge" subject is compulsory for

all  students and is said to be the "glue" of the  entire

diploma programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new emphasis on Project Work will challenge the

students'  resourcefulness, their organisational  ability

and  their presentation and communication skills and this

is to be applauded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report recommends that all JC students offer at

least  a H1 contrasting subject plus GP (also at  H1)  or

Knowledge  and  Inquiry at H2. On that  basis,  the  time

spent  on the contrasting subject is 16% to 21%.   Whilst

the  direction  is correct, it is worthwhile  to  further

increase the time spent on contrasting subjects  once  we

gain some experience with the reforms.  After all, JC  is

not a tertiary education and there is sufficient time  at

university  to specialise. At many liberal arts  colleges

in  the  United States, every student takes a broad-based

curriculum  leading to a Bachelor of  Arts  degree.   The

American system sees it fit to avoid specialisation  even

at   undergraduate  level.  Here  we  are  beginning   to

specialise at Junior College level although relaxing  the

specialisation  with the introduction of the  contrasting

subjects.   The  United  States  system  only  begins  to

specialise at graduate school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also welcome the Ministry's intent to update the

existing  subjects offered and to introduce new  subjects

to  JC  students.   But I would like to suggest  that  we

introduce   topics   like   Management   of   Technology,

Entrepreneurship,  Cultural  Studies  and  Communications

Skills  either as components within existing subjects  or

as  new  subjects altogether.  These are  essential  life

skills  if  our  young are to thrive in  an  increasingly

inter-connected  world  shaped  by  rapid   technological

change.  In my 17 years of work in the private sector, no

one has ever asked me to solve differential equations but

I  have often been expected to understand technology,  to

be  entrepreneurial,  to appreciate cultural  differences

and to communicate and defend my ideas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1632</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taken together, Knowledge and Inquiry, Project Work,

a  contrasting  subject  and  the  updating  of  existing

subjects  -  the  new JC curriculum is  refreshing  -  it

retains the robustness of the "syllabus-centred" approach

(challenging and rigorous) and adopts the finer  features

of  the "learner-centred" approach (research, inquiry and

a broad curriculum).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, the other major recommendation

of  the report is the creation of alternative pathways in

the  upper  secondary and JC sector.  This new  diversity

will   include   an  integrated  programme,   specialised

schools, alternative qualifications and private schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These new routes provide choices to meet the needs

of different students.  Yet, each of them is challenging,

robust   and   internationally  recognised.   Ultimately,

graduates  of  such  diverse  range  of  programmes  will

approach  problems  differently and  will  come  up  with

alternative solutions to a problem.  They will provide an

array  of perspectives that will make for a more vibrant,

resilient and successful Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Integrated Programme will do away with the GCE

"O"  levels  for  students deemed to be university-bound.

This leaves more time for project work, CCA and character

development programmes.  However, it would be  better  if

the  IP  can  be  extended to more students  and  not  be

confined to the top 10% of a P1 cohort since about 22% of

the P1 cohort who took the "A" level examinations in 2000

is  eligible  for  a local university.   If  we  consider

admissions to foreign universities, that figure  will  be

even higher.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing schools to offer the IB and other

internationally  recognised  programmes  will  cater   to

returning students.  This is in keeping with the trend of

Singaporeans working overseas at some point during  their

careers.   The  IB will also cater to those students  who

prefer  a  more "learner-centred" approach and I  welcome

that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing private schools is another change that I

welcome  but it would also be good for the Government  to

encourage



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1633</b></font><br><br>



or  partly-fund  scholarships that are  tenable  at  such

private  schools.  This would support those who  may  not

otherwise  have the financial means to enroll  into  such

private schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would like now to move on to

discuss specialised schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to plot the distribution of our students

along the single dimension of scholastic ability, we will

always  get some form of "bell-curve".  There will  be  a

small  group  of  students who are weak  academically;  a

small  group  who are very capable and a large  group  of

average performers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the attractiveness of specialised schools is

that they will cater to students who may be deemed to  be

mediocre  on  this bell curve plotted along  academic  or

scholastic ability.  However, these same students may  be

uniquely   capable  if  we  measure  them   along   other

dimensions  like sports, arts or music.  This  broadening

of  the  definition  of  success  by  MOE  is  indeed   a

"watershed".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specialised schools could also afford students

longer  time  to  complete their programmes  and  also  a

modular  testing  system as opposed to  age-based,  high-stakes examinations.  This will allow such students  time

to  prepare and participate in international or  national

events.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that these specialised secondary schools

succeed, we need a system to identify talents at an early

age.   Our  primary  school pupils  should  have  greater

access  to  qualified counsellors who will profile  their

strengths  and  weaknesses, including giftedness  in  the

arts, music and sports and also learning disabilities, if

any.   As such counselling resources may be hard to  come

by,  schools  can strike up partnerships  with  community

groups,  voluntary welfare organisations,  school  alumni

and  parent  associations.  In addition, the twinning  of

JC/higher    secondary   schools   with   their    junior

counterparts  -  the primary schools -  during  CCAs  and

Community Involvement Programme - would also provide much

needed opportunities for student leadership and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1634</b></font><br><br>



character development.  Investing in counsellors to spot,

either  talents or learning disabilities  of  pupils  and

intervening  early  in  their  formative  years  will,  I

believe, yield handsome long-term returns to society as a

whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, for the educational reforms to

succeed, we would need more than a broad curriculum, more

than  a diverse upper secondary/JC education sector.   We

would need a complete change in the skills and styles  of

lesson delivery, nothing short of some form of a cultural

transformation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to illustrate my point with some of my own

experiences.  He summoned a student to the front  of  the

class,  blindfolded him and placed a heavy book onto  the

open  palm  of  his outstretched arm.  Then  he  abruptly

removed the book and the hand shot right up. He declared,

"For  every action  (the force of the book); there is  an

equal  and  opposite reaction (the force of the  hand)  - this  is  Newton's third law of motion and our topic  for

today's lesson", declared Harry Tan of St Andrew's.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I once also attended a class at MIT where Franco

Modigliani  and  Lester  Thurow were  both  in  the  same

classroom   as   instructors.    Both   are   illustrious

economists   but   each   espousing   views   that    are

fundamentally  opposed.  The students  must  decide  whom

they want to believe.  There were no model answers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless more of our teachers are inspired to excite

our students, the curriculum reforms will not bring about

the  full desired outcomes.  But our teachers have raised

a  valid point. They told us that they often have to rush

stoically through the syllabus as their performances  are

not  measured  by  the creativity of their  delivery  but

whether   or  not  they  complete  the  tight   syllabus.

Therefore,  something has to give.  We  cannot  have  the

cake and eat it.  I would like to suggest that we cut the

size  of  the syllabus further so that teachers may  find

time to be creative and students will find permanence and

meaning with the knowledge that they acquire.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1635</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reduction in syllabus is not aimed at reducing

stress,  as  suggested by MPs like Dr Wang Kai  Yuen.   I

believe  that,  by and large, our students are  resilient

and  unless  we constantly challenge them, as the  Senior

Parliamentary Secretary, Prof. Koo Tsai Kee pointed  out,

they  will  be inadequate to face the highly  competitive

world awaiting them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am reminded of a story. In fact, it is a true

story.   Jack  Welch  once received a  report  about  his

executives  at  General Electric. Someone highlighted  to

him  that  95%  of  his  executives are  feeling  heavily

stressed  and he retorted, "What is the problem with  the

other 5 percent?" Do we want to be the GE's of the world?

If  so, then we must maintain the rigour of our education

system.    After  all,  we  are  talking  here  about  JC

students who are our best and brightest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Challenge the faculties of our students we must, but

not  by sheer quantity of the workload at the expense  of

the quality of the learning experience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not deprive our students the joys to

savour the intrigue of the unfamiliar, the excitement  of

discovery and the fulfilment of lasting knowledge. As  an

education  goal, we must encourage our youths to  develop

an  inquisitive mind so that they will continue  to  seek

out  whole  new  worlds  of knowledge  years  after  they

complete their formal studies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dr Amy Khor pointed out, for the Triple Science

student offering four "A" levels, the report suggests the

reduction  of  curricular time by 10% and for  humanities

students, the curricular time remains unchanged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students currently offer subjects that reflect their

forte.  The  new  contrasting  subjects  will  take   our

students  out of such forte. Hence, the time required  to

establish  a  basic foundation will be disproportionately

more  and  we  have to take cognisance  of  that.  If  we

coordinate the curriculum to be covered at JC level  with

the universities, as the report suggests,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1636</b></font><br><br>



we  should  have  no problem cutting the curriculum  down

further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also concerns that the reforms are not

going  to  happen early enough in a student's educational

journey. I am confident that in time, MOE will look  into

introducing  reforms  into  our  primary  and   secondary

schools  as  I  am sure that such efforts  will  be  most

welcome and will yield similarly good results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, let me pay a tribute to all teachers

in  Singapore. Many have laboured tirelessly  to  educate

our  sons  and daughters. They will also be charged  with

the   responsibility  to  carry  out  these   educational

reforms.  I wish them well and I am confident  that  they

will continue to do Singapore proud!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the motion.



<br>6.42 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Mdm Deputy

Speaker,  I  would  like to express  my  appreciation  to

members  of  the  JC/Upper  Secondary  Education   Review

Committee led by SMS Tharman for their work and in coming

up with some recommendations on the challenges pertaining

to JC and upper secondary education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to see that a broader and more flexible

JC  curriculum  to  cater for greater  diversity  in  our

education system has been recommended.  I am certain that

if  these measures are successfully implemented, it would

lay  the  foundation  for our children  to  compete  more

effectively  in  a  globalised  economy  which   requires

breadth  of  knowledge and applications instead  of  rote

learning and specialisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the proposed changes will also shift

the emphasis of education from one of content mastery  to

learning  skills  and  from  knowing  to  thinking.    In

particular, a greater emphasis towards project  work  and

the  offering  of  elective subjects like  Knowledge  and

Inquiry,  besides the General Paper, would  work  in  the

long-term interest of our students.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1637</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the objectives and end results of the

proposed  JC  education seem laudable, I  feel  that  the

means towards these ends are just as important and should

be  adequately addressed.  Whilst the report goes a  long

way  in addressing the practical needs and qualifications

our  students ought to achieve and also the future  needs

of  the  economy,  like many speakers  before  me,  I  am

concerned  that  it does not address  many  of  the  root

concerns  of our education system as it stands today.   I

refer  specifically to the "pressure cooker"  environment

that  has  arisen,  from the focus of  achieving  success

based mainly on academic excellence or qualifications  or

indeed  what goes into the report card that our  students

receive   today.   Indeed,  as  MPs,  whenever  we   meet

residents,  be they students, parents or teachers,  their

common  complaint  is that our education  system  is  too

stressful  and  pressurising.  Our  current  emphasis  of

rewards  for  students  and  teachers  based  largely  on

academic performance is partly to be blamed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed changes will result in a broader-based

education through additional broader qualifications in H1

or   H2  level  subjects.   However,  if  the  underlying

structure  of  our education system is not refocused,  we

might  just  end  up  with students  with  broader  based

qualifications and scoring a lot more 'As', this time  in

both    the   Mathematics/Science   and   Arts/Humanities

subjects,  but still the same by-product of our education

system  -  rote  learners, good  in  mastering  contents,

knowledgeable   but   lack   thinking   skills,    little

independent thoughts, with less enterprise and initiative

or little interest in the world around them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I am concerned that this scenario could be a

real  possibility  if  we do not  change  our  system  of

rewarding  our  principals and teachers.  The  Ministry's

criteria of success in ranking JCs and secondary  schools

by  academic  results, and the performance evaluation  of

principals  and  teachers  whose  career  advancement  is

based,  to  a large extent, on the deliverance  of  these

results,  are  fundamental to the pressure  cooker,  high

stress, rote learning environment we have today.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1638</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principals and teachers have incentives to prepare

model  answers to enable students to be examination smart

and get top grades  -  at the expense of a real education

per  se, since it is in the interest of their own  career

development  to  do  so.  With the  continuance  of  such

incentive  structures for our teachers and principals  in

our education system and the ranking of JCs based largely

on  competitive quantitative criteria, I am doubtful that

the  high  ideals raised in this JC Report can  be  fully

realised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At worst, we might merely create additional subjects

or  subject  areas including project work, CCAs  and  the

lot, where students will be pressured to compete for  the

sake  of  competition, and not enable them to be thinking

individuals,   capable   of  independent   learning   and

enterprise.   The  end  result is a  JC  education  where

students and teachers become more stressed out and we end

up  with  the  same  products, this  time  with  students

scoring  As,  not  just  in  Mathematics/Science  or  the

Arts/Humanities subjects, but both, and end up  none  the

better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I would therefore like to recommend that the

Ministry  review the need to rank JCs and relook  at  the

reward  system  for our principals and teachers  when  we

implement  measures to improve our JC  education  system.

There  should  also be less emphasis on  examinations  or

using  examination results as a sole criterion to measure

the  performances of our students, as well as  principals

and  teachers.   Unless we do this, our  best  intentions

behind the proposed changes may not be realised.  The new

reward  system should be based on how well our JCs  train

our  students  to achieve a broader based  education  and

master learning and thinking skills, and not just on  the

number of As obtained in H1 and H2 level subjects in  the

'A' level examinations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, still on the subject of incentives and

rewards for our teachers and principals, I would like  to

raise  the  issue  of  teaching resources.   In  the  new

environment  envisaged, teachers would  need  to  acquire

expertise in teaching and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1639</b></font><br><br>



assessing  students in the areas of thinking  skills  and

innovation.   They would need to both set challenges  and

structure  courses  to  bring out  these  skills  in  the

students, as well as assess students in these new  areas.

This  is  indeed  a fundamental change  in  much  of  our

traditional education philosophy.  Our existing  teaching

resources may not be suitably equipped to meet these  new

challenges.   We therefore need to retrain  our  existing

teaching  staff  to  re-equip them to implement  some  of

these  ambitious plans.  I would like to ask the Minister

if  he  could elaborate on any special training plans  to

cater for these changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report has indicated that additional teaching

resources would be required to tide in for the period  up

to  full  implementation of the new JC education  system.

Would these new teaching staff resources replace existing

ones?   I  would  like  to seek the  assurance  from  the

Minister  that  opportunity  be  given  to  the   current

teaching staff to fully enable them to adapt to  the  new

regime.   I  agree that, in the interim, we may  have  to

import  foreign talents to help implement these  changes.

If  so,  I  would  hope  that specific  plans  for  local

succession, after skills have been acquired and  nurtured

by  our local teachers, be put in place so that we do not

create  a dependency effect on foreign talents in our  JC

education system in the long term.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to raise a suggestion that the

mother tongue criterion could be broadened to include any

second language.  With Singaporeans expected to study and

work  overseas for long periods of time, as part  of  the

economic   changes  anticipated,  returning   Singaporean

families have found that the mother tongue criterion  for

local  schools  too restrictive for  them.   This  is  an

additional source of stress for both students and parents

returning from overseas.  If we can broaden the criterion

to  other  languages, making exception for this group  of

Singaporeans  returning  from  overseas,  we  might  even

enhance   Singapore's  future  as  a  globalised  economy

plugged into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1640</b></font><br><br>



the world.  It would also encourage Singaporeans overseas

to return and contribute positively to our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I support the motion moved by the

Minister  for  Education.  I agree that we should  change

our  JC  curriculum to achieve a broader based  education

and  to  develop  thinking,  communication  and  learning

skills.   However, I call on the Minister to  review  our

teaching methods, to place less emphasis on examinations,

to  do  away  with  ranking of JCs,  and  to  reward  our

teachers in many other ways.  Examination result  is  but

only  one of the ways.  Whilst the desired ends  for  our

education  system are well intended, I fear that  we  may

not  achieve them if the means towards these ends are not

properly addressed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Mdm Deputy

Speaker, may I start by congratulating Senior Minister of

State  Tharman and his Committee on a very  well  written

report   and   one  that  should,  in  general,   receive

widespread support; who would oppose after all  injecting

more  breadth and flexibility into the JC curriculum  and

the proposed education landscape, painting such a picture

of  options and variety of pathways as to warm the hearts

of  parents  and students alike.  But the recommendations

do  raise  some areas of concern and some questions  that

could  do  with some clarifications.  As so  many  of  my

parliamentary  colleagues also  have  their  comments  to

contribute,  I  shall  restrict my observations  to  just

three areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a start, the first question that actually came

to  my mind when I read through the report was whether we

have,  in  fact, got the process upside down  -  back  to

front,  focussing all of our attention on  JC  and  upper

secondary  education, the last four years  of  our  young

Singaporeans' education, thinking that we can  spend  the

first  most  formative and impressionable  years  of  our

children's  lives,  grilling them and  grinding  away  at

their  self esteem, and then in the final years of  their

schooling education, we expect to turn them around  on  a

pin and blossom with this new curriculum, albeit it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1641</b></font><br><br>



is  a  very attractive proposition, and to develop  their

thinking skills at this very late stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior Parliamentary Secretary Koo Tsai Kee gave us

a  very thorough account of the Bronx Science High School

and  of the five Nobel Laureates which they created.  But

I  would dare say that the Bronx Science High School  did

not  create these five Nobel Laureates out of  thin  air.

The  question  for  me  is,  in  fact,  how  these  Nobel

Laureates'  minds  were  moulded  when  they  were   much

younger.   For me, that is an important question.   While

it is certainly important to look at the finishing stages

of their education, who is, in fact, looking into what we

are   going  to  do  with  our  pre-school  and   primary

education, to prepare our children for the new world?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, broadening the curriculum is certainly, I

think, heading in the right direction.  It will give more

exposure to our students to more fields of knowledge  and

allow  them  to  be more well-rounded individuals,  allow

them  more opportunities to find areas in which they have

special interests, skills and talents.  The Committee has

recommended that this broadening be achieved  in  balance

with cutting down on content, and I am all for that.   It

has been inexplicable to me all this time in recent years

that we have been preaching to the adults on the need for

life-long learning, because of the rapid obsolescence  of

knowledge, that we have kept, at the same time,  stuffing

the  heads of our school children with content.   So  the

acknowledgement that we can and should in  fact  ease  up

here  is good news indeed.  However  - and this is a  big

however  - how will the Ministry of Education ensure that

in developing the new curriculum, we will in fact lighten

the  content  load?  Because lightening and  reducing  of

curriculum load is not a new story for us.  In  fact,  we

are   supposed  to  have  already  lightened   curriculum

previously  by  as  much as 30%.  In fact,  the  Minister

himself this afternoon has spoken with conviction that we

have  trimmed down on content, and yet it would seem that

only  the  Minister  and his senior  officers  have  this

conviction,  because just about everybody else  that  you

speak to in the system  -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1642</b></font><br><br>



parents,  students and teachers alike  - do not  seem  to

have experienced any lightening of the curriculum load.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question is: how will the Ministry ensure

that  this shift of the curriculum from depth to  breadth

does,  in fact, happen and does not result in added load,

that  the implementation of the new curriculum will  stay

true to the intent?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third and final question that I want to raise

relates  to the most diverse JC/Upper Secondary education

landscape.  I applaud the recommendation.   Alas, it will

only be for the top 10% of our children.  Contrary to  Dr

Wang Kai Yuen's anticipation that parents will respond by

recognising that different skills will be needed now  for

success and prepare their children accordingly, I am most

fearful  that  the  result will  be  even  more  fearsome

pressure  on  our  children sitting for their  PSLE  each

year,  to  make  it  to that top 10%, so  that  they  can

benefit  from  the  new  integrated  programme  in  their

secondary education.  As usual, we are focusing  so  much

of  our attention, effort and resources on the few at the

top.  Why should this diversity of approaches be reserved

only  for the top 10%?  We are grateful that the kind  of

resources  and  opportunities that were previously  given

only to the top 1% in the Gifted Education Programme will

perhaps  now  be available to a wider 10%.   But  is  the

focus  on this elite group, in fact, justified?  The  GEP

has been in existence now for many years.  Has there been

an  assessment,  in  fact, of its  outcomes,  other  than

perhaps the number of President's Scholars that they  may

have  produced?   What contributions  have  previous  GEP

cohorts  made  to  Singapore society?   What  skills  and

spirit  and values have they developed?  Similarly,  with

the  recommendation to establish specialised  independent

schools  to  cater  to students with special  talents  in

arts, sports, mathematics and science, these schools will

again cater only for the very few.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I served recently on the Economic Review Sub-committee on Enhancing Human Capital and co-chaired the

Work Group on Arts, Culture, Sports and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1643</b></font><br><br>



Recreation.  Our Work Group recommended, not  elite  arts

and  sports schools, but making arts and sports education

widely available to our children in schools so that  more

of  our  children will imbue the spirit and  values  that

come  with these disciplines.  And also, so that we  will

lose  less  of those who have the skills and  talents  in

these areas who would otherwise be left by the wayside in

our traditional education system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at our workforce today, the problem we

have  is  not with the top 1% or the top 10%.   They  are

more  than able to fend for themselves in the old  world,

and  in the new, and indeed to contribute to our national

development.  The enormous challenge that we face is with

the   massive  400,000  workers  at  the  bottom  of  the

spectrum,  whose world is far removed from the  corridors

of power and wealth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask who is looking into the

educational needs of the future equivalent of this  large

group  of  Singaporeans, who will also have to deal  with

the  new challenges and the new demands that will be made

on them in our new and globalised economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I do support the

motion, but I would urge Government to further review the

whole education system, particularly addressing the needs

of  our younger, pre-primary and primary school students,

to  ensure  that the broadening of the JC  curriculum  is

indeed matched with a decrease in content so that  it  is

manageable and to avail the improvements to a much  wider

population of students.



<br>7.03 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani (Hong Kah):</b> Mdm

Deputy Speaker, I am in full support of the motion mainly

because  I  was a member of the Committee  that  did  the

review.  In that light, I had actually tried to place  my

speech somewhere at the end of the debate by calling  the

Whip



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1644</b></font><br><br>



quite  late, just before the deadline.  To my  horror,  I

was  placed  at  No. 12 and to speak on  the  first  day.

Apparently  my  creativity is not good  enough.   I  hope

after  the review, future MPs would be more creative  and

innovative in manipulating as to when they would speak in

Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I would like to touch on a few points and

then  later  also touch on the points raised by  my  hon.

Friends before me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just some background to this review. I see three

important  factors that played in the minds of  both  the

Ministry and the Review Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the demands of the new economy - which is

innovation  driven.   This new  economy  places  a  great

premium  on  creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship.

With  these  great new demands placed upon  our  economy,

upon our future, what do we do with our education system?

If  we  are  just to look at the JCs and upper  secondary

education, what do we do about it?  This topic  has  been

dealt  with and touched upon by my colleagues before  me.

I will deal with them in a short while.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we have this syndrome, which we in the

Committee  called the "Coca Cola" syndrome.  We  have  at

the  lower  secondary education level a very broad  based

curriculum,  where students take eight to  ten  subjects,

covering both the sciences and the humanities, one or two

languages  in addition to that.  Then, at the  university

level,  the first one or two years, it is also  similarly

broad based.  Students in the science faculties are  made

to  take one or two humanities subjects.  Students  doing

humanities  are also made to take one or two non-humanity

subjects.    But   at  the  pre-university   level,   the

specialisation is more pronounced.  We have about 40%  of

our  science students at pre-university who do  not  take

any humanities subject.  Yet, when they go to university,

as  most  of  them  do, they have to take  at  least  one

humanities  subject.  So we have to  correct  this  "Coca

Cola Bottle" syndrome.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1645</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the questions that we have to look at here,

Madam,  is how then do we broaden the curriculum  without

compromising depth.  All of us agree that the  rigour  in

our  system, the standards that we have achieved  in  our

educational  system are good, we wish it to  remain,  but

yet  we also want to broaden the curriculum to enable our

students to cover as many subjects as possible.  But  how

do  we  achieve this without compromising depth?  So  the

Committee came out with this system of having three tiers

as opposed to the present two tiers in depth.  Presently,

we  have the "AO" and the "A" levels, now we have H1, H2,

H3, or rather this is the proposed differentiation as far

as  depth is concerned, so that we can achieve a  greater

amount of breadth without compromising depth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third factor in the background is the high

percentage   of  our  top  10%  of  our  student   cohort

qualifying for university.  In other words, for them, the

"O"  level is more or less a formality.  Yet, as we  have

heard  earlier on, if we are to free these students  from

taking  their  "O" levels, which also means freeing  them

from  taking  or preparing for preliminary  examinations,

they would have an additional eight to ten months of free

time  -  eight to ten months where they can benefit  from

other enhancements or enrichment projects and programmes.

So  the  question then is:  can we do away with  the  "O"

level examinations for them, and if we are to do it,  how

do we manage the fall out?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, when we consider the new

demands,  the  demands of the new economy,  and  when  we

speak  of  innovation, creativity, entrepreneurship,  and

when we try to look at the education system where we  ask

ourselves, "So what do we do with the education system in

order  to meet these new demands", among the things  that

first strike my mind is how to improve the curriculum  in

terms  of  enhancing thought process skills over  content

mastery or accumulation of information.  I think this has

been  discussed.  We see there are efforts being made  to

enhance  the value of project work, highlighting  thought

process skills over



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1646</b></font><br><br>



content  mastery  in  pedagogy or  teaching  methodology.

These ideas had been dealt with by the Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect in relation to innovation and

creativity is to develop within the curriculum a means by

which  students are able to draw knowledge from different

disciplines.   In other words, it is not  sufficient  for

them  to merely learn.  When it is already not sufficient

for them to learn from one particular body knowledge, now

it  is  also  not  sufficient  for  them  to  learn  from

different  bodies  of knowledge, but we  would  encourage

students to be able to draw lessons from different bodies

of knowledge at the same time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, one of the most known icons of

our  time  are  the producers of the Star  Wars  Trilogy,

Steven Spielberg and George Lucas.  The Star Wars Trilogy

is  very  captivating, partly because I think within  one

show   you  see  different  bodies  of  knowledge  coming

together.   It has, well, this may be controversial,  but

to  my mind, high literature value because it has a  very

identifiable theme or themes.  It has simple  plots  that

criss-cross one another.  It has lots of wit and  humour.

That  is  the  literature aspect.   Then  it  deals  with

science  and technology, whether futuristic or  fictional

sometimes.  You have, for instance, the three-dimensional

recording  of Princess Leah talking to whoever  that  may

be.   In  the first show it was Luke Skywalker, I  think,

receiving the message that he was supposed to see  Obiwan

Kanobi.    Then  we  have  this  fantastic   Death   Star

construction,  which was Darth Vader's headquarters.   We

have  fancy flying machines.  We have flying saucers that

can  presumably travel at the speed of light.  Well, that

is the science aspect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have the aspect of politics and governance.

We  have  the clash between the Empire and small planets.

We  have  the  knighthood of the Jedi.  This  is  another

element  of the Star Wars Trilogy.  We have the marketing

part.  Besides advertisements, they have toys, they  have

games,  they  publish books and comics.   In  short,  Mdm

Deputy Speaker, that movie, or that trilogy of movies  is

a multi-faceted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1647</b></font><br><br>



industry,  and  to  my mind the producers  were  able  to

captivate the imagination of the world because they  drew

from  various bodies of knowledge, put them together  and

came out with a solid product that nobody else could have

done.   If local producers are to be capable of similarly

captivating the imagination of the world, then I  believe

they  have  to  develop  that  capability  to  draw  from

different bodies of knowledge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ability to draw from different bodies of

knowledge  must  mean  that they  have  a  grasp  of  the

different bodies of knowledge to begin with.  So it  must

mean a broadening, at some point in time, the curriculum.

I  am afraid it has to mean a certain degree of workload.

It will have to mean that students must be able to study,

and  must have to undertake the rigour and the difficulty

of   studying  different  types  of  subjects,  including

subjects that they may not be totally happy with  because

it  is  a bit different from what their aptitude is  best

at.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members spoke of the need to lighten the load.

I think what is more crucial here, Mdm Deputy Speaker, is

not  so much to have a lightened workload but to have  an

enlightened  workload.  An enlightened workload  means  a

workload that takes into account the need to prepare  our

students for the future as opposed to simply helping them

go through the present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of the review, Mdm Deputy Speaker, is

communication  skills.  We have heard just  now  from  my

fellow Members that Singaporeans somehow are not able  to

communicate  well.  This was in fact one  of  the  points

raised  by some of the Review Committee members and  some

of  the feedback that we received.  So here, I think  the

Committee tried to overcome this problem by enhancing  or

emphasising the need for project work, where they have to

develop  teamwork  and then in the  presentation  of  the

project  work  they  will have to  develop  communication

skills.  So in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1648</b></font><br><br>



presentation of project work the students will then  have

to  develop  skills in communication so as to impress  or

convince the examiners of the worth of their project.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is, the General Paper is a subject that is

feared by most students.  When we introduce project work,

there  is  a general reaction among students and teachers

that  this will increase workload or stress.   I  do  not

think  any  of us will want to increase the  workload  or

stress  for the fun of it.  I do not think any of us  are

morbid enough to have that kind of sense of humour.   But

it is something which we need to do based on the comments

that  we  get very often from the public and  Members  of

this  House  that Singaporeans are not good at  speaking,

not good at communicating, or not articulate.  So we have

to  do something about it.  We have to improve our system

and  among  the things that we can do is to  enhance  the

quality  of teaching GP as well as project work.   And  I

believe that, in the long term, this will have the effect

that  all  of  us  desire.  We would be able  to  produce

Singaporeans  who would be able to market their  products

better,  who  would be able to articulate and communicate

better and, hopefully, make life in Singapore as a  whole

much better too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just two more points, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I do not

wish to be long because I wish to break my fast also.   I

agree  with  the  points  raised by  my  colleagues  that

teachers  play a very important role in this.   In  fact,

teachers have told us that looking at the recommendations

and  reviews,  they  are  very concerned  as  to  whether

teachers and principals are ready for the review  because

they  realise,  just as everyone here also realises  that

the  method of teaching has to be kept in line  with  the

substantive  recommendations.   Indeed,  the  method   of

teaching,  if  not rightly aligned, might even  undermine

the  recommendations.  So, as stated by  MOS  Cedric  Foo

just  now,  the teachers would have some  way  to  go  in

making  the necessary changes, and I have full confidence

that our teachers will do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, we have already received feedback that the

teaching profession is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1649</b></font><br><br>



under  stress.   What more with the new  recommendations!

But,  again, I reiterate that it is no fun adding  stress

to  the  lives of teachers, as it is no fun adding stress

to  the  lives  of students.  But looking  again  at  the

future  that  we  are facing, the new  demands  that  are

before  us,  what choice do we have?  Something  that  we

have to do for our children, for our country, what I  can

just say here is that I have full confidence the teachers

too will align themselves with the new recommendations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, as regards parents, Mdm Deputy Speaker,

they  will  find the changes quite painful and  sometimes

quite bewildering.  I think parents would need great help

to understand the changes.  I do not think it is possible

for parents to be able to grasp all the changes in one go

and  it  may not be necessary for them to do so too.   So

here,  there  will  be a need for stronger  collaboration

between  parents and schools so that they will  be  given

the  right dosages of information at the right  point  in

time.   In this respect, I believe schools will take  the

necessary measures to have contact points with parents as

their children progress in school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will touch on some of the points raised by my

colleagues before me as regards the Integrated Programme.

One concern was whether or not this is a higher level  of

streaming.   The first response to that is: is  streaming

by  itself  a problem?  If it is not, a higher  level  of

streaming  is not a bigger problem.  But even  if  it  is

something  that  we  ought  to be  concerned  about,  the

response to that would be to weigh the benefits of having

the Integrated Programme as not having it.  Here, we have

the  opportunity to free up about eight to 10  months  of

the  time of our best students when they do not  need  to

take their 'O' level examinations.  If you can do it, why

not?   Sure,  we are concerned with the others.   But  in

this  respect, there is nothing much that we can do about

the  others.  In this particular aspect, must we  deprive

the  best from something which they otherwise could  get?

In fact, we get feedback from everyone that our system is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1650</b></font><br><br>



too  rigid, too book-centred.  So perhaps these eight  to

10 months are perfect for them to go out and do something

else,  like fire fighting perhaps, as what some  students

do in the United States, and community work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was this concern that the IP programme would

also  widen the gap between the very best and the not-so-good.   Perhaps, we can use these eight to 10  months  to

inculcate  among  the top 10% students the  values  that,

even  though  they can fly high, they must remember  that

when  they  nest, they must nest on solid  ground.   When

they  land,  they must land on firm feet.  They  must  be

true  Singaporeans,  good citizens, good  sons  and  good

daughters,  that they have to respect their  parents  and

love their neighbours and help those who are in need.  So

we  can  use  these eight to 10 months to do that,  which

otherwise  they  may not have the time if  they  have  to

prepare   for  preliminary  examination  and  'O'   level

examination.  So as far as they are concerned,  they  are

valid  ones.  But I think on balance it is better  if  we

can  do away with the 'O' level examinations, we do  away

with it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall not prolong everyone's agony any further. I

stand in support of the motion.

<div align="center"><b>LEARNING SUPPORT PROGRAMME</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</b> asked the Minister for

Education  (a)  what  is  the number  and  percentage  of

children  entering primary 1 each year who are identified

for  the  Learning  Support  Programme  (LSP)  since  the

Programme  was  introduced; (b) how  are  these  children

assessed  to  determine  if  they  need  to  attend   the

Programme;  (c)  what is the standard against  which  the

primary 1 children's reading abilities are benchmarked to

determine if they need to attend the Programme; (d)  what

is  the  duration of the Programme and; (e) how effective

has the Programme been.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Learning Support Programme (LSP) (English) is an

early  intervention language and literacy programme.  The

programme  was  started in 1992 and  implemented  in  all

primary  schools  in  1998. The need for  this  programme

arises out of the complex home language background of our

students, resulting in their entering Primary 1 with very

different  levels  of  literacy skills  in  English.  The

programme provides additional support to pupils in P1 and

P2 who do not have the pre-requisite English Language and

literacy skills to access the curriculum. Pupils  in  the

LSP  are identified through a screening test administered

to  all  P1  pupils at the beginning of the school  year.

Each  year, about 12% to 14% of P1 pupils, or some  7,000

pupils, are supported in the LSP.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effectiveness of the programme is measured

through   gains   in   children's  reading   levels   and

performance in school-based assessments.  P1  LSP  pupils

start school reading at levels equivalent to children  of

less  than  5  years of age, on average. After  about  10

months  of  intervention in the LSP, the average  reading

age  of LSP pupils is 7 years, reflecting a reading  gain

of  28  months.   They are thus comparable  with  the  P1

cohort in terms of their reading levels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improvements in reading have helped the pupils do

better  in  their English tests.  For example,  in  2001,

less  than half (45%) of P1 LSP pupils passed English  at

the  mid-year  Semestral  Assessment  (SA1).  By  SA2  in

November, the pass rate was 64.9%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duration of the Learning Support Programme is 2

years. At the end of P2, a small proportion of LSP pupils

(about 15% of those originally identified at P1) continue

to  have  difficulties in the English Language.   Schools

will  determine the most appropriate mode of support  for

these  pupils  after  the 2 years in the  LSP  programme.

These  pupils  are  put  through  customised  remediation

programmes  conducted  by  the  school,  or  the   ENABLE

(ENcouraging   Achievement  and   Better   LEarning),   a

specialised   intervention  programme  in   English   and

Mathematics for pupils who are underachieving.

<div align="center"><b>TAXI SECURITY DEVICES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for

Transport  whether he will consider making it  compulsory

for  taxi companies to install security devices in  their

taxis to give protection to taxi drivers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, taxis are privately operated. There

are  4 taxi companies.  The safety of taxi drivers  is  a

key  concern  of  the  taxi companies.   They  have  been

working  closely with the Police on crime  prevention  on

board  taxis.   Among other measures, the companies  have

installed security systems in taxis.  One such system has

distress alarms in the taxis.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1655</b></font><br><br>



The  alarms are linked to a vehicle location system  that

uses   the  satellite  Global  Positioning  System  (GPS)

technology  to  track down the location of  any  taxi  in

distress.  Once an alarm is triggered, the Police will be

notified immediately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The taxi companies will continue to work with the

Police  and  their  drivers to prevent crimes  in  taxis.

Hardware installations are only part of the answer.  Very

often, simple preventive measures like educating the taxi

drivers  on  some dos and don'ts are more effective.  The

taxi  companies and the Police have jointly  published  a

handbook  providing tips on prevention of crimes  against

taxi  drivers.  The taxi companies and their drivers have

the greatest interest in this issue and are competent  in

responding to it. There is no need for the Government  to

intervene.

<div align="center"><b>SPEED LIMIT SIGNS NEAR SCHOOLS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. <b>Mdm Cynthia Phua</b> asked the Minister for

Transport  in  view  of the recent  accident  at  Tanjong

Katong  Road, if he will consider displaying speed  limit

signs,  for  example,  40 km/h,  on  roads  near  schools

instead of the current practice of displaying the 'school

zone' signs so as to remind vehicles to slow down.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mdm Phua that there should be traffic

signs  to  remind  motorists to slow  down  when  driving

within a school zone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, as a rule, LTA will put up prominent "School

Zone"  and/or "Slow Down" traffic signs on all  roads  in

the vicinity of schools.  These signs warn motorists that

they are entering a school zone and should slow down  and

be alert, especially during the school peak hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unfortunate accident referred to by Mdm Phua

took  place  at around 1 pm, along Tanjong  Katong  Road,

just outside the former Ngee Ann Primary School, next  to

Geylang Methodist Primary School.  Along that stretch  of

the road, there are several "School Zone" and "Slow Down"

signs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tanjong Katong Road has a speed limit of 50 km/h.

But  where  it  enters  the school  zone,  motorists  are

expected  to slow down to below 50 km/h and be  ready  to

make sudden stops, if necessary.   That is the purpose of

the  school  zone sign.  School zone signs are  preferred

because they carry a fuller meaning than what a 40 or  50

km/h speed limit sign can convey.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unfortunate accident at Tanjong Katong Road and

a recent one at Ang Mo Kio Ave 6/Ave 9 junction are sober

reminders  to all motorists to be mindful at  all  times,

especially when they approach a school zone or a  traffic

junction.   Road  accidents can be  prevented,  but  that

requires all motorists and road-users to play their part.

<div align="center"><b>FOREIGN DOMESTIC WORKER HOTLINE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam</b> asked the Minister for

Manpower  (a)  what  is  the  number  of  distress  calls

received  in  a  year by operators manning its  toll-free

telephone  line  to  assist domestic  workers;  (b)  what

training  is given to these operators; (c) whether  these

operators can speak different languages; (d) what are the

follow-up support services given to the domestic workers;

and  (e)  how  many  domestic workers  have  been  helped

through this service in a year.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labour Relations Department of my Ministry set

up  a foreign domestic worker hotline in 1997. This is to

enable  domestic  helpers to call in  to  seek  help  and

advice   on  issues  relating  to  their  employment   in

Singapore. The availability of this service was  conveyed

to all foreign domestic workers in a letter detailing how

they  could contact the Ministry if they need help.   The

service  has  been well used by the domestic  workers  of

different  nationalities.  On average some 600  calls  by

foreign  domestic workers are answered a  year.  Officers

who  are deployed to man the help-line have several years

of  experience  handling employment disputes.   They  can

speak  at  least 3 languages - English, Tamil and  Malay.

When  calls  lead to follow-up conciliation meetings,  my

Ministry will engage interpreters if necessary to  ensure

that the foreign nationals are not misunderstood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally foreign domestic workers seek the advice

on  salary-related problems, general work environment and

issues  such as whether the foreign domestic workers  are

entitled  to  a  gratuity after working in Singapore  for

several years.  If the advice is over salary payment, the

help  line officers will record the complaint and arrange

a  conciliation  meeting  with the  employer  to  seek  a

resolution of the dispute with her employer. In regard to

complaints  of  physical abuses,  the  MOM  officer  will

record the details and refer to the appropriate authority

for investigation.

<div align="center"><b>MEDICAL DEGREE PROGRAMME AT NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam</b> asked the Minister for

Education (a) what are the criteria used by the  National

University  of Singapore  to admit top student applicants

into the medical faculty; (b) what is the composition (by

profession  and  gender) of members of  the  interviewing

board;  (c) what criteria are used to match top  students

with  the  various  disciplines under the  initiative  to

spread Singapore's top talents among various disciplines;

and  (d)  what  is  the   extent an individual  student's

preference for a discipline is taken into account in this

matching process.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students who wish to apply for the medical degree

programme  at NUS must meet its basic admission  criteria

for   university  studies.   From  AY2003  onwards,   the

university admission criteria for students will  comprise

both  their SAT I scores and their GCE `A' level results.

In  addition, these students have to attend an  interview

to assess their aptitude and suitability to be a doctor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interview team comprises a representative each

from  the  Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of Dentistry  and

the  Ministry  of  Health. The members of  the  interview

teams   are   either  medical  doctors  or  dentists   by

profession. These members are appointed on the  basis  of

their  professional experience and expertise, and not  by

gender.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1659</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the spreading of top talents among various

disciplines, there is a cap on the number of top students

admitted into Medicine. The basis for this policy is that

Singapore  also needs good minds to be trained  in  other

disciplines. Top students who could not get  a  place  in

Medicine  will  be  given a place in another  faculty  in

their  list  of  preference stated in their  application.

They will be admitted based on merit if they meet all the

additional requirements of the faculty, if any, over  and

above the basic university admission criteria.
