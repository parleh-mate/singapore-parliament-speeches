  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A site has been reserved at Ang Mo Kio Street 61, Neighbourhood Six of Ang Mo Kio New Town, for the building of a new community centre. It is scheduled for construction in FY 82. However, pending the construction of the new centre, the People's Association has rented from the Housing and Development Board a shop unit at Block 151 in Neighbourhood Six for conversion into a temporary community centre. As soon as it has been converted, the centre will be open to the residents.

  <!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
  <b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee</b> asked the Minister for Labour, in view of the substan-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1503</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> tial rise in wage level arising out of the accumulated NWC wage increases in the past few years, whether he will consider raising the present wage ceiling of $750 p.m. to a higher ceiling for workers covered by the Employment Act.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to inform the hon. Member for Toa Payoh that the $750 per month wage ceiling laid down in Sections 33, 35 and 144 of the Employment Act will be raised with effect from 1st December, 1980, to $1,250 p.m. in view of the substantial increase in the level of wages since the ceiling was fixed 12 years ago.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members may wish to know that section 35 of the Employment Act stipulates that Part IV of the Act applies to non-manual employees whose salaries are not more than $750 p.m. However, Part IV applies also to manual employees irrespective of the amount of their monthly salaries. Part IV lays down conditions of service like rest days, holidays, hours of work and payment for overtime work. On the other hand, section 33 provides that where the property of an employer is sold, or any money due to such employer is garnished on the application of a person holding a mortgage, charge or lien or of a person who has obtained a judgment or decree, the court ordering the sale or garnishment shall not distribute the proceeds of such sale or such money unless the salaries due to all employees of the employer have been paid. In the case of section 144, it empowers the Commissioner for Labour to enquire into and decide on any dispute between an employee and his employer relating to matters arising out of any term in the contract of service or any provision of the Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wage ceiling of $750 p.m. was fixed in 1968. Since then the level of wages has increased substantially. The median monthly income of all employees, according to CPF records, rose by 138%, from $175 in 1968 to $416 in June 1980. In terms of occupational groupings, the median monthly earnings of sales and service workers based on the Singapore Sample Household Survey, 1966, and the Labour Force Survey,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1504</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> 1979, increased by about 94% and 88% respectively between 1966 and 1979.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following consultations with the National Trades Union Congress and the Singapore National Employers' Federation, the Government has decided that with effect from 1st December, 1980, the wage ceiling in sections 33, 35 and 144 of the Employment Act be raised to $1,250 p.m. The wage ceiling will in future be adjusted at regular intervals to take into account rises in the level of wages.

   <b>(Deterrent effects)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether capital punishment for certain drug offences has had the desired deterrent effect, and, if not, whether he will consider introducing amending legislation to make the law more effective.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the enactment of the death penalty in 1975, 20 major drug traffickers have been arrested and prosecuted. Eighteen have been tried in Court and sentenced to death. Six of them were executed after they failed in their appeals to the Privy Council. With vigorous and sustained enforcement, the organised drug trafficking syndicates have been smashed. The deterrent effect of enforcement, convictions and executions is reflected in the declining number of major drug traffickers arrested for such offences after the introduction of the death penalty. In 1976, 11 major drug traffickers were arrested. The figure dropped to six in 1977, one in 1978 and one in 1979.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is even more significant is that the pattern of trafficking has changed to ant trafficking. The ant traffickers smuggle very small amounts of drugs from Johore Bahru into Singapore. With strict enforcement action at our checkpoints, not much could get through. As a result the addicts are finding it difficult to get their supplies from the street pushers and they have to pay a high price for the drugs. This scarcity has
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1505</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> resulted in an increase in the price of heroin at the street level from $35 per gram in 1977 to $333 per gram in the first half of this year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the foreseeable future, I have no intention of introducing amending legislation. There must, however, be no relaxation in enforcement so that distribution networks which have been smashed are not rebuilt or new ones created. This together with the deterrence of the death penalty will continue to keep the drug problem in Singapore under control.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng (Khe Bong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Minister whether there is any difference in the number of cases of capital punishment between 1979 and 1980.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, to date, in 1980, we have not arrested any drug trafficker for an offence that entails the death penalty if he is prosecuted and convicted.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, I would like to know whether there has been any conviction of a drug trafficker that entails capital punishment in 1980.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> The answer is none.

  <!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
  <b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs, that since 1st January 1980 up to the latest convenient date, how many gang fights have taken place in hawker centres and shopping complexes and how many foreigners were involved in those fights; and what plans he has to curb such incidents in the interests of the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there was only one gang fight at a hawker centre but none at shopping complexes between 1st January, 1980, and 25th October, 1980. The fight which took place at the Bedok South Hawker Centre on 18th January, 1980, was between 12 members of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1506</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> two secret societies. They are all Singaporeans and five of them were charged and convicted in court for rioting.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, during the same period, there were 153 fights at hawker centres and 201 fights at shopping complexes. These fights were between individuals or small groups of persons and had no secret society connection. Most of the fights resulted from arguments over minor issues, such as prices and seating arrangements at hawker centres. A total of 12 foreigners, namely, 10 Malaysians and two European boys, were involved in 11 of the fights.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police will continue to take preventive measures, including visits by its uniformed officers on patrol, to curb such incidents. Where the situation warrants, detectives or plainclothes officers will also be deployed.

  <b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as both the Members for Delta and Moulmein have raised questions on implementing the NWC recommendation for the payment of the additional wage increase to above-average performers in the public service, it would be convenient if I could answer their questions together.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, my Ministry, in close consultation with other Ministries and their statutory boards, is still in the process of finalising a suitable scheme for implementing, in the public service, the NWC recommendation. From the way in which they pose their questions, the hon. Members appear to have appreciated the difficulties created by the size of the public service and the multiplicity of grades among the officers involved. It will take some time yet before appropriate instructions with the necessary uniformity and flexibility can be issued to Ministries and statutory boards.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible at this stage to indicate the probable percentage of officers who will be paid the additional wage increase. The number of officers so paid will ultimately depend on the assessment of the performance of officers by their supervisors in the various organisations of the public service. There should, however, be no automatic award to any categories of officers. It would indeed offend the principle of greater rewards for more meritorious workers if too high a proportion of officers were awarded this second tier payment.

   <b>MASS RAPID TRANSIT SYSTEM</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Decision)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Communications and Acting Minister for Culture whether a firm decision has been made by government with regard to the proposed Mass Rapid Transit System.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Minister for Communications and Acting Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Communications and Acting Minister for Culture (Mr Ong Teng Cheong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has not as yet made a decision on the MRT. I would, however, like to take this opportunity to elaborate on the developments that have taken place and how we intend to proceed from here.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members are aware, the Hansen Review Team which was recently asked to examine all previous MRT-related studies has finished its task. They have disputed the findings of earlier studies. They state that an MRT is not inevitable and that we will be able to manage quite well in the 1990s and beyond with buses - provided we redesign our bus system in the radical manner that they have proposed. But they have not been able to substantiate their views in a con-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1509</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> vincing manner. Serious operational implications, such as high-boarding volumes in the Central Area, have not been considered.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has therefore been decided to do further quantitative work to settle, conclusively, this issue of whether an all-bus system will be able to cope. This will be done as part of the Comprehensive Traffic Study to be undertaken by the Provisional MRT Authority.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Study, which is scheduled to start in January, will be conducted in two phases. Phase A, which will take about 6 to 9 months to complete, will examine in detail the Hansen Team's proposed all-bus system to see if it can be implemented, and if so, with what consequences. Other all-bus systems thought to be comparable or superior to the Hansen Team's system will also be evaluated. In addition to looking at the operational details such as commuter travelling times, bus fleet size and so on, the Study will do an economic benefit-cost analysis that will rank the various all-bus alternatives in their order of merit.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phase B which will be done concurrently with Phase A will take about 2 1/2 years. It will do a refined analysis and examine the basic MRT system established in Phase III of the Mass Transit Study to see how it compares with the all-bus system. In addition, at least two other limited but possibly more cost-effective MRT configurations will also be analysed. All these systems will then be subjected to a benefit-cost and financial analysis and ranked in order of merit.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding all that I have said, we should not forget that the MRT is more than just a transportation issue. Its implementation has wide implications, and a decision can only be taken after all factors have been carefully considered.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, whilst the House appreciates the due care and caution taken by the Hon. Minister before making a decision on the proposed Mass Rapid Transit System, however the study has taken a period of not less than
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1510</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> eight years. And it will be longer than that because the Minister disclosed to the House just now that another Comprehensive Traffic Study will be carried out in two phases, Phase A and Phase B, which will take some 30 months or so. In short, can the Hon. Minister indicate to this House how much more money will have to be spent on such further feasibility studies on the MRT? And when a firm decision on the MRT has been reached, how much will it cost Singapore, not forgetting the fact that by that time, the cost of setting up the MRT would have doubled, if not trebled?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at this stage, I am afraid I am not able to tell the hon. Member what the cost will be with regard to the Comprehensive Traffic Study that will be conducted over the next 30 months. The proposal has yet to be submitted by the consultants. When the consultants have made their submission, the Provisional MRT Authority will have to evaluate the proposal and negotiate before actual work on the Study could be implemented. Therefore, it is not possible at this stage for me to give any indication.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the quantum or additional cost involved in the delay on the decision of the MRT, this again is something which is difficult to quantify. We do not know at this stage whether there will be any technological breakthrough in respect of construction techniques, in rolling stocks and other control systems. This is something that no one can tell at this stage. Who knows, maybe by waiting for another year or two, there could be some technological development that would lead us to control systems or construction methods which are cheaper than what we have or are available today. So this question is one that I am not able to answer now.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> What is the cost of the study?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> I mentioned earlier that it is too early for me to tell him the cost of the Study. Maybe I will be in a better position to tell him after the consultants have made their submission.

  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, the MRT is a service to the people of Singapore. If at all consultation is necessary, why not consult the people of Singapore instead of the experts, so that the Government need not have to pay for the consultation!
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, I think I have answered the same question by the hon. Member some months ago. No doubt the MRT is an essential service and that in the long run it may have to be provided whether we like it or not. But it is a large-scale investment, and therefore we have to ensure that the money is wisely spent so that the maximum economic advantage is achieved.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, I am still not convinced. The funds come from the people. Therefore, we should consult the people. If the people say, "Yes", then we spend the money. What is wrong with that?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a Government, we have a duty to safeguard the money of the people.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mountbatten):</b> Sir, bearing in mind that, as a Government, we have a duty to perform, can I ask the Minister this question. If he decides to go ahead with the MRT, what is the biggest thing that can go wrong that is holding him back from making such a decision? On the other hand, why is he taking so long to decide on the all-bus system? Is there anything that is very attractive that is holding him back from making a definite decision?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, the decision is not merely whether we should have an MRT or we should not. It is more a question of when do we need an MRT. If we do, in what configuration the system should operate? As Members have been exposed to the public debate on the issue, I am sure Members will appreciate the complexity of the subject. It is not just whether we need an MRT or we do not, but a series of issues or factors which are involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng:</b> Sir, the Minister seems to be afraid of making up his mind whether to go ahead with MRT or not.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1512</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> So there must be something that is holding him back. Can we just know what it is?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we ourselves also would like to know what it is all about. As I have said, this is a complex subject and I myself have expressed in this House some months ago that my personal view is that it is inevitable that we will need an MRT in the long-run. But it is a question of when do we need an MRT, and as Members have expressed concern, the longer we delay the higher the cost will be. On the other hand, technological advancement may achieve a breakthrough in certain aspects of the system, and that may save us money or give us a better system that we do not know at this stage.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, most of the facilities required for the operation of Changi airport, like runway, control tower and navigational aids, will be completed by early 1981. The last and very important project to be completed is the Passenger Terminal Building. The construction of the Terminal Building has been slightly delayed because of shortage of building material and manpower. We are trying to complete the construction of the Terminal Building in early 1981. After a few months of debugging and familiarisation, we hope to be able to have Changi airport operational on 1st July 1981.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Changi is an airport with two runways. While the first runway will be operational next year, the second runway will only be completed in 1983. For the period from 1981 to 1983, Paya Lebar airport will be used to cater for any overflow of civil aircraft traffic which could not be handled at Changi with just one runway. A new direct express road has been built to link Paya
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1513</b></font>

  <br> Lebar airport to Changi airport. This will provide a speedy link between the two airports. After all civilian aircraft operations have been transferred to Changi, the RSAF squadrons now operating in Changi Air Base will be transferred to Paya Lebar airport. Paya Lebar will also serve as a supplementary airport to Changi for non-scheduled and chartered commercial flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, since the Hon. Minister has informed this House that there has been a slight delay in completing the construction of the Passenger Terminal Building at the Changi International airport and that he is hopeful that the airport will be operational on the 1st of July next year, can he indicate to this House that definitely by next year - not necessarily the 1st July, just in case we cannot have the first aircraft land at the Changi International Airport on the 1st July - that sometime next year Changi International Airport will become operational?

  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1514</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> commuters who have to make several transfers to and from work. The difficulty, it seems, is not that these passes cannot be provided, but at what price.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBS shareholders and school children who currently enjoy the use of such passes do so at a concession rate. They pay much less than what they would normally have to pay, i.e. they are subsidised. Since SBS is a privately-owned company, this subsidy must come from bus fares paid by other commuters. It is therefore not possible to extend these concession passes to ordinary bus commuters without somebody having to pay more.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teo Chong Tee (Changi):</b> Sir, may I ask the Hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications whether he would further request the SBS to look into other measures to lighten the burden of these bus commuters who not only suffer from the inconvenience of having to change two or more buses for a single trip but also have to pay a high cost in bus fares as a result of the several changes which they have to make for a single trip?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> Sir, as far as the service is concerned, I would say that the SBS would look into the matter and improve the service.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Teh Cheang Wan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the opening in the divider at New Upper Changi Road and Bedok South Avenue 1 junction was closed recently as it was hazardous for motor traffic to turn right from Bedok South Avenue 1 to New Upper Changi Road, in view of the heavy traffic along New Upper Changi Road. The installation of traffic signals at this junction was not recommended as it would reduce the traffic capacity of New Upper Changi Road, considering the fact that there were already four sets of traffic signals between Bedok South Road and Bedok Road. After the closure of the divider, traffic wishing to turn right from Bedok South Avenue 1 can still do so at two other signalised junctions at Bedok South Road and Bedok South Avenue 3.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bus services 31 and 401 have not been curtailed. The closure of the divider has only resulted in the rerouting of bus services 31 and 401 from Bedok South Avenue 1 to Bedok South Road.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The congestion presently experienced along New Upper Changi Road between
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1516</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Bedok South Road and Siglap Road is not due to the closure of the central divider at Bedok South Avenue 1. It has come about because the traffic volume has exceeded the capacity of the two-lane dual carriageway road. There are plans to widen this stretch of New Upper Changi Road, including improvement to its junction with Bedok South Road, to increase its capacity. Construction work is expected to commence early next year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making an opening in the central road divider along New Upper Changi Road opposite Apartment Block 24 is not recommended as it will interfere with the free movement of vehicles along New Upper Changi Road. It is also hazardous for vehicles to turn right from New Upper Changi Road into the car park, or to make a U-turn.

  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Public Works Department has a plan to build an overhead pedestrian bridge at New Upper Changi Road near the Bedok Sports Complex. Construction is scheduled to commence in April 1981, subject to the availability of funds.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our field observations show that pedestrians can cross without difficulty New Upper Changi Road in the vicinity of Changi Theatre, as there are gaps in the traffic flow along this stretch of New Upper Changi Road, which are created by the traffic lights

  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1517</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> at Bedok South Road and Bedok North Road, A signalised pedestrian crossing at this location is therefore not recommended, as it will only reduce the traffic capacity of New Upper Changi Road.

  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi</b> asked the Minister for National Development how many bus shelters were constructed or renovated during the past two financial years.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Sir, in FY 1978, the Public Works Department constructed 128 bus shelters. This number increased to 221 in FY 1979. For the first half of the current financial year, i.e. from April 1980 to September 1980, the Department has been able to maintain its momentum and has constructed a total of 107 bus shelters.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi (Kampong Kembengan):</b> Sir, could the Minister inform the House whether his Ministry is satisfied that the design of the bus shelter is such that it provides adequate protection for commuters, for example, from rain, and more importantly, from the possibility of commuters failing into the path of buses which drive into the bus bays? Could his Ministry consider the construction of safety railings at the bus shelter, if there is the possibility of such an accident occurring? Could he also investigate why in certain new bus shelters there is heavy leakage of rain water, thus wetting the seats meant for commuters to rest?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Sir, the design of the bus shelter is constantly being improved. Any shortcomings found in the old bus shelters will be rectified. So if we find that certain shelters have a leaky roof, they will be replaced with a better design.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> What about the safety measures to prevent commuters from falling into the path of buses which drive into these stopping bays?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Sir, this question shows the conflicting aspects in the design of the bus shelters. If the passengers are to got into the bus easily, we should not put up barriers at the bus shelter so that when a bus stops the passengers can get into the bus straightaway. On the other hand, when there are too many passengers at the bus stop, especially during the peak hour, they may scramble to get into the bus, and in pushing one another there is the possibility of an accident occurring, as mentioned by the hon. Member, i.e. a commuter may fall into the path of the bus and be run down.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PWD has always been bearing this safety aspect in mind. In fact, this safety barrier has been erected at some bus shelters where we expect a lot of passengers, as for example, the bus shelter in front of the Victoria Concert Hall, which is not very far from Parliament House.

  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the field next to Block 5 at Old Kallang Airport Estate is partly owned by the State and partly by the HDB.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer is yes. In fact, there are many areas where you can find that one part of the land is owned by the State and the other part is owned by the Housing and Development Board. This is, in fact, very common.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid this is not possible. I will quote a simple example. In a new town, you will find that the expressway runs through an HDB estate. All these expressways are owned by the State. In fact, the trees along the expressways are planted by the Parks and Recreation Department. But in the public housing estates, they are maintained by the HDB. So it is not possible for the HDB to take over all the functions of the Government department.

   <b>INFLATION IN SINGAPORE</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Targeted rate)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17.
  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what is the targeted rate of inflation in Singapore for the next 12 months; what factors will determine the rate of inflation in Singapore during that period; and what Singaporeans should do to ensure that they will succeed in maintaining a low inflation rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we do not target to achieve inflation in Singapore. We aim to minimize it. Ours is an open economy and inflation is mostly imported. The Government will, however, continue to keep domestic inflation down by improving productivity in the economy. Our inflation rate for this year is estimated to be around 9%. Barring any major oil price increase in the next 12
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1521</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> months, our inflation rate in 1981 should be lower than this year's.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further oil price increase is a major factor that will determine the rate of inflation in Singapore in 1981. Higher oil prices will mean that we have to pay more for our oil and other imports. Our inflation will therefore depend on the action of OPEC and the consequences of the Iraq-Iran war in the next 12 months. On the domestic front, higher cost of housing construction due to higher oil and labour costs will affect the level of inflation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the effect of any price increase in oil imports is to be ameliorated in the next 12 months, there must be a conscious effort by Singaporeans to conserve energy, thereby reducing our need for oil imports. They must also be more productive and use energy-saving devices so that higher oil import and wage costs are offset by productivity increases. As consumers, they must spend wisely and not excessively. With these efforts, we should be able to minimize the rate of increase in our inflation in the next 12 months.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> Sir, possibly, one effective way of combatting inflation is to help Singaporeans to increase their earning capacity. How would the Minister propose to help Singaporeans, especially pensioners who cannot earn enough wages, who cannot be trained, and who will not be spared from the effects of inflation?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not quite see the rationale of that question, i.e. increasing the earning capacity of people to combat inflation. I do not see the direct linkage or cause of inflation in that question.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> I am no economist, Mr Speaker, Sir. The Minister should be in a better position to clarify this. But let me explain. I go with the layman's understanding that if a person is able to earn more wages, he would possibly be able to withstand the effects of inflation. Therefore, I thought it would be logical for Singapore to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1522</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> use this as the main rationale rather than, for example, in some countries where they used to dole out subsidies or financial assistance. In so far as the healthy workers are concerned, it would be possible to train them with new and better skills so that they can take on jobs which can provide better wages. But in certain categories, for example, pensioners, we really cannot use this rationale of helping them to earn more wages. But, at the same time, we do not practise the giving out of doles or subsidies to pensioners. So how do we solve the problem of such a category of Singaporeans?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am now clear as to the import of the question and, that is, the effect of inflation on people who are unable to increase their earning capacity. That is quite different from the causes of inflation. If a person is a pensioner, it is true that he will suffer the impact of inflation and, frankly, there is no way in which the pensioner can be compensated for such pernicious effects of inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine H.H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine H.H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does the Hon. Minister think that the explanation for inflation given by Milton Friedman is applicable to Singapore?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know which part of Milton Friedman's arguments the Member was referring to because while in Singapore he touched on many things. But, in essence, if the Member is talking about the free-play of market forces as a means to check inflation, and that is generally the thrust of Dr Friedman's arguments, then we think that is applicable in Singapore. We are trying to use market forces to improve efficiency in the economy so that cost increases as a result of wage-cost increases and oil price increases will be offset by productivity increases.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am aware that Milton Friedman said many things, but is the Minister not aware that Milton Friedman blamed excessive supply of money as the basic cause of inflation? And does he not think that such a factor is also operative in Singapore at the moment?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1523</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in theory, I think excessive supply of money is a cause of inflation. Whether or not money supply is excessive in Singapore is best seen in the inflation rate which we have in Singapore, and I think an inflation rate of 9%, taking into account factors which have caused price increases, such as the oil price increase, would seem to suggest that money supply in Singapore has not been excessive.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, why does the Hon. Minister think that imported inflation is inevitable when we can change the exchange rate, i.e. allow the currency to float upwards and thereby mitigate the effects of imported inflation?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is true that one can mitigate the impact of imported inflation by allowing the currency to appreciate vis-a-vis currencies outside Singapore. But there are also other implications of an increase in the exchange rate and, that is, it would affect the exports.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, is the Hon. Minister not aware that by keeping the value of Singapore's currency down, this will lead to an increase in money supply and, at the same time, allow import prices to be filtered into the domestic economy and, on both counts, raise the rate of inflation?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am fully aware of the implications as mentioned by the hon. Member for Whampoa. However, the exchange rate determination comes under the Ministry of Finance.

  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question has been overtaken by events, and I am pleased to inform the House that I have this morning signed the Agreement between Indonesia and Singapore for Economic Cooperation in the Development of Batam Island.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Agreement focuses on the cooperative effort to promote the development of the Industrial Region of the Batam Island, which consists not only of Batam Island proper but also the group of islands of Janda Berias and Islands of Tanjung Sau, Ngenang and Kasem. The Agreement covers areas of mutual interest in trade, industry, banking, communication, taxation, customs and immigration.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Agreement will come into force immediately after the respective governments have fulfilled the constitutional requirements and notified each other. The Agreement will remain in force for five years from the date of implementation, after which it can be extended with the consent of the two governments.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19.
  <b>Mr P. Selvadurai</b> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if, in view of recent press reports to the effect that a superpower was establishing a military base in Cam-Ranh Bay, he will consider initiating moves, in concert with his ASEAN counterparts, to balance the said military presence in South East Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr S. Dhanabalan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member has raised a pertinent issue. There is evidence that the Soviet Union has obtained the use of naval and air facilities in Cam-Ranh Bay from its ally, Vietnam. This has enhanced Soviet strategic capability both in the Pacific and in the Indian Oceans and, if unchecked, will eventually tilt the power balance in Asia to Soviet advantage. Soviet intentions in the region are clear. As in so many instances in the past, they obviously hope to fill the vacuum left by the withdrawal of another super-power.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion of the Treaty of Friendship between the Soviet Union and Vietnam in November 1978 foreshadowed the granting of these base facilities by Vietnam to the Soviet Union. There are provisions for military cooperation in the treaty. Through this treaty and other friendship treaties between Vietnam and Laos and the Vietnamese-installed Heng Samrin regime in Kampuchea, the three Indo-Chinese regimes are locked into a de facto military alliance with Soviet military underpinning.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these, of course, do not augur well for peace and security in the region, especially since this treaty relationship has provided the Soviet Union an opportunity and a treaty
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1526</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> obligation to intervene in South East Asia as they consider necessary. It would be ideal for the peace and stability of the region if big power rivalry is kept out of the region.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is an unrealistic expectation. It is in the nature of things that big powers will seek to extend their power and influence wherever they can and to exclude the other contending powers from these areas. This is why Singapore has consistently argued for a multi-power presence in the region. A multi-power presence is the best guarantee. No single big power will then be in a position to dominate the region. Singapore has publicly enunciated this and has called on friendly powers to play a role in the region. As the hon. Member knows, we have repeatedly urged the US and the West to play a part in this region as it is so much in their interest as well as ours for them to continue maintaining an active interest and presence in the region.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member is aware that ASEAN is primarily a socio-economic organization. This is prescribed in the Bangkok Declaration of 1967. However, in the recent past ASEAN has increasingly played a political role, as evidenced by its action to mobilize world support to deny legitimacy to the Vietnamese occupation of Kampuchea. ASEAN has no intention of pursuing a military role unless this is forced upon ASEAN by others. Although ASEAN does not have a military dimension, this has not precluded individual ASEAN countries from instituting bilateral defence cooperation among themselves to enable them to better withstand external threats to their security.

  <b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Chai Chong Yii) (for the Minister of Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1527</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> during the last two fiscal years, that is, FY 79 and FY 80, 84 school fields were repaired. According to records, none of them were completed and commissioned for re-use within eight months after repair work began. According to the Public Works Department, the average length of time required for the repair work is between 12 and 14 months.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would the Senior Minister of State inform us which section of the PWD says that it will take between 12 and 14 months for the repair work? I have got information which says that in normal cases it would take about six to eight months to repair a standard-sized school field.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Sir, our school fields are repaired by the PWD (Schools Division) which looks after school fields. If the Member has that information, may I know from which particular PWD officer he obtained it, so that I can check it up?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> Sir, I will make my own investigation. But may I ask the Senior Minister of State whether he considers it desirable for such prolonged delay in repairing school fields? I feel that the pupils have been unduly deprived of the use of school fields.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wonder whether the Senior Minister of State is aware that certain school authorities have issued stringent instructions to the children not to play in the field during periods of consolidation of the field. In some cases students have been penalized and reprimanded for playing in the school field.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the time taken to repair school fields, whether that is too long I cannot judge it as I am not an engineer. But the information given to me shows that there are four major factors which govern the length of
  <br>

  <br>
  <br> time for repairing and reconditioning school fields. The size of the field is one factor. The other factors are the availability of materials, the efficiency of the contractors and, of course, the supervision of the work involved. I am, therefore, not in a position to say whether the time taken to repair school fields is too long or too short. But from the Ministry of Education's point of view, I definitely agree with him that we would like to have the fields repaired, if we can, within one or two months. But that is obviously not possible because grass takes time to grow and then it will have to be trimmed before the fields can be made suitable for re-use.

  <!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> Sir, I am grateful to the Senior Minister of State for his comments and clarification. But can he give an assurance that he is as concerned as many other parents about the prolonged time taken to repair the school fields? But more important is the fact that some children, and because they are children they need to play in the field, have been unduly reprimanded for using the school field during the period of consolidation.

  <b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong</b> asked the Minister of Education (a) how many primary and secondary schools will be convened to full-day schools in 1981; (b) whether and when the teachers and parents of the pupils in those schools will be informed; (c) to what extent the curriculum and ECA load for the pupils will be increased and will be different from those in the two-session schools; (d) whether the teachers' teaching load will be increased; (e) whether principals and teachers will be given flexibility in implementing the full-day school programme; (f) how the additional hours will be utilized; and (g) whether adequate facilities, including proper facilities for lunch, will be provided to meet the increased demands of a full-day school programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam (Minister of Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister of Education (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, full-day schools will be introduced as a pilot scheme in three secondary and two primary schools next year. The three secondary schools are the Anglican High, Chinese High and Nanyang Girls' High. The two primary schools are Broadrick Primary and Parry Primary. Details of the scheme will be released to the parents and teachers concerned, in the first week of November.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curriculum and ECA workload will not be increased. The extended school hours from 7.30 a.m. to 2.30 p.m. for Lower Primary classes and 7,30 a.m. to 3.00 p.m. for Upper Primary and Secondary classes will allow a more relaxed pace of teaching and learning, and much of the homework and assignments given by the teachers can be completed at school.

  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1530</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the extended school day, teachers will have to stay on in school until dismissal time in the afternoon for a few days each week but it is not intended that their teaching load will be increased unduly. No activities will be carried out on Saturdays. Principals and teachers will be given flexibility in implementing the full day programme. The schools will be provided with adequate facilities for teaching, quiet study, rest and recreation. An organised lunch programme is unnecessary and impractical. However, school tuckshops will be upgraded to meet the needs of teachers and pupils.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I know from the Minister whether in planning for the full-day schools, consideration has been given to pupils from a certain section of the population who may have to fulfil certain religious obligations. By virtue of the full-day school scheme, secondary school children especially cannot go home to fulfil their religious obligations. Will there be facilities for such purposes?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Sir, I have already informed the House that principals and teachers would be given flexibility in implementing the full-day programme.

  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23.
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Acting Minister for Social Affairs what is the rationale for stopping payment of public assistance allowances to recipients who are also receiving financial aid from friends or relatives, and whether he is aware that the dole paid is inadequate for the recipients to make ends meet unless they can supplement their dole by some other means.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng) (for the Acting Minister for Social Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may take
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1531</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the second limb of the hon. Member's question first. My Minister has stated in this House before that public assistance allowances are not enough to meet all the basic needs of the recipient. Indeed, it is not intended that they should be. The Social Welfare Department does not see its role as the mere handing out of public assistance allowances. If a public assistance recipient is physically able to work, the Department will find him light work or part-time work so that his earnings, together with his public assistance allowance, will be adequate for subsistence. In the case of the less fortunate ones who are unable to take on any kind of work, the Department will arrange supplementary assistance from privately administered charitable funds.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of public assistance recipients do, of course, receive financial aid from friends and relatives. It is not true to say that a recipient will lose his public assistance allowance if he receives any aid from friends and relatives. On the contrary, as I said earlier, the Social Welfare Department recognises that the public assistance allowance by itself is not enough for subsistence and needs to be supplemented.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grant of public assistance allowance will be stopped if the Social Welfare Department is satisfied that a recipient has close relatives, for example, children or nephews and nieces or brothers and sisters, who are in a position to support him. In each case, the Department will make extensive investigations to ascertain the financial circumstances of the relatives. I can assure the hon. Member that the recipient will not lose his public assistance allowance if the relatives, who are in difficult financial straits themselves, can only give him occasional help.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the Senior Parliamentary Secretary assure me that he will look into the matter if I can refer him to cases of recipients whose doles have been withdrawn on the ground that they are receiving financial aid from their friends?

   <b>SINGAPORE FIRE SERVICE</b>

  <div align="center">
   <b>(Fire-fighting in high-rise buildings)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24.
  <b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok</b> asked the Acting Minister for Social Affairs whether the Singapore Fire Service is sufficiently and adequately equipped to fight fires in high-rise buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chan Chee Seng (for the Acting Minister for Social Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the equipment needed to fight fires in high-rise buildings is basically the same as those used to fight other fires. The Singapore Fire Service has the necessary equipment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the tallest mechanical ladders have a maximum height of 30 metres, fires which break out on the upper floors of high-rise buildings cannot be fought through exterior-based operations. They have to be fought from within, using built-in fire-fighting facilities such as internal fire water main systems, fire lifts, pressurised or ventilated staircases and fire-fighting lobbies. The local fire codes require the provision of these facilities in high-rise buildings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Fire Service practises high-rise fire-fighting procedures every week. Officers and men are sent to high-rise buildings on these occasions to practise fire-fighting and rescue drills and to familiarise themselves with the layout of the buildings. The High-rise Fire-fighting Unit, which was formed in 1976, carries out periodic inspections of fire-fighting, detection and protection systems in high-rise buildings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Fire Service has a Search and Rescue Squad consisting of 108 men who have undergone intensive training in the rescue of trapped victims of fires in high-rise buildings. They have been sent for specialised training with the Commando Battalion and Helicopter Squadron of the Singapore Armed Forces. In addition, there is a contingency plan for obtaining the assistance of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1533</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> RSAF helicopters for carrying out aerial evacuation of trapped victims and for lowering fire-fighting equipment onto the rooftops of high-rise buildings. Three-quarters of the efficacy of these fire practices depend on constant co-ordination and rehearsals of what to do in an emergency. If these practices are not being taken seriously by occupants of high-rise buildings, they will be repeated until the Singapore Fire Service is thoroughly satisfied.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to assure the House that the Singapore Fire Service keeps abreast of technological advances in the fighting of high-rise fires. Wherever practicable, the Service will adopt proven fire-fighting techniques.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta):</b> Sir, that is all fine for completed high-rise buildings. Are the facilities of the Singapore Fire Service adequate enough to fight fires in high-rise buildings which are under construction?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I suppose fighting a fire in a building which is under construction is almost the same as fighting a fire in a building which has been completed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok:</b> Sir, I do not think so because uncompleted high-rise buildings are not equipped with localised internal fire-fighting equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is true that an incomplete high-rise building is without ventilated staircases and fire-fighting lobbies. But in fighting a fire in an incomplete highrise building, we still need to fight it from within and not from above or from anywhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok:</b> Sir, how do the firemen go up from the lower floors to the upper floors when the building is not completed?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that depends on the mate of the building and the situation of the fire.
  <br>
  <br>

  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Teh Cheang Wan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing provisions in the Professional Engineers Act, 1970, restrict registration of engineers to those who have passed the pro-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1536</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> fessional practice examination set by the Professional Engineers Board, after they have obtained two years' professional practical experience. This requirement of passing local examinations may have deterred good foreign engineers from seeking registration in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment Bill therefore seeks to provide for the registration of engineers without the need of passing a professional examination if the engineer has at least -
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) five years' post-qualification professional experience, of which two years are in Singapore; or
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) 10 or more years' post-qualification professional experience of such a standard as may be recognised by the Board.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore can then better attract good foreign engineers to augment the local pool of engineering talents to meet the needs of our construction and other industries. In addition, the Bill also seeks to provide for the registration of a person holding a degree of Bachelor of Engineering from the National University of Singapore which was recently incorporated.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to make a number of amendments to the Jurong Town Corporation Act, mainly to Part IV of the Act which deals with the sale of flats, houses and other buildings owned by the Corporation. The
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1537</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> amendments made to the Act are based on similar amendments made to Part IV of the Housing and Development Act which deals with the sale of Housing Board flats and buildings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, an applicant or owner of a Jurong Town Corporation flat, his spouse or authorised occupier is not allowed to own any other property. The Bill seeks to allow such applicant or owner, his spouse or authorised occupier with the written consent of the Corporation to purchase any commercial property not exceeding $250,000 in value, or such higher value as the Minister may allow, if he uses it to carry on his own business. The amendment is similar to that made to the Housing and Development Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently amendments have been made to the Housing and Development Act to enable the Housing and Development Board, through its authorised officers, to act for parties in the resales and in other transactions of Housing Board flats in cases where the parties are not represented by any solicitors. The Bill seeks to empower the Corporation to provide similar services for owners of Jurong Town Corporation flats in the resale or other disposition of their flats. This is to help the flat owners to reduce legal costs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act allows the Corporation to acquire a flat sold by the Corporation if the owner contravenes certain provisions of the Act. However, for less serious offences, this penalty is considered too harsh and can cause considerable hardship to a family. In line with the Housing and Development Act, the Bill seeks to enable the Corporation to impose penalties on the owners who contravene the Act, instead of acquiring the flats, where the offences are not serious.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing rules of the Corporation, a person cannot apply for a Jurong
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1538</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Town Corporation flat if he owns a property during the 30-month period before the date of his application for such flat. He is also prohibited from owning another property after the date of the purchase of a flat. The Bill seeks to extend this prohibition to cover the period between the date of application and the date of purchase of a flat.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also empowers the Corporation to take enforcement action where the flat is misused by the owner or any other occupier of the flat. Under the existing law, the Corporation can take such action only if the owner has misused the flat.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect of the Bill is to make clear that any notice or document sent by the Corporation to the owner of a flat by registered post or affixed to some conspicuous part of the flat shall be deemed to be of good service. This will enable the Corporation to serve notices on owners of flats who try to evade service of notices by locking up their flats and staying away.
