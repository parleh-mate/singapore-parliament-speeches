<div align="center"><b>NUMBER OF PIRATE TAXIS CONFISCATED</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for

Defence  how many vehicles used illegally  to  ply

for  passengers  have been confiscated  since  1st

July, 1966.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah) (for the Minister for Defence):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, during the period

1st  July,  1966, to 6th July, 1968,  the  Traffic

Police  impounded a total of 1,306  vehicles  that

were  used  illegally to ply for  passengers.  The

court   ordered  confiscation  of  918  of   these

vehicles.

<div align="center"><b>INCREASE OF SECOND CLASS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>HACKNEY CARRIAGE LICENCES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for

Communications whether he will increase the number

of  Second  Class  Hackney  Carriage  Licences  to

enable  drivers of vehicles plying  illegally  for

passengers  the  opportunity  to  apply  for   the

licences and to operate their vehicles legally.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I regret to inform the

Member  for  Anson that there is no  intention  at

present to increase the number of taxi licences so

that those now operating illegally as pirate taxis

may  thus  apply to operate as licensed taxis.  It

should  be  noted that there are at present  3,800

licensed taxis



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>



of  which  3,500, or more than 90  per  cent,  are

owned  by  taxi drivers themselves. These licensed

taxi  drivers are already having quite a difficult

time  earning  a reasonable living. The  situation

has   been  worsened  by  the  activities  of   an

estimated number of 10,000 pirate taxis. To  allow

the  free issuance of another 10,000 taxi licences

will  mean  that the present 3,800  licensed  taxi

drivers  will be put in a worse situation than  at

present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as the problem of pirate taxis has

partly  arisen through the present inadequacy  and

inefficiency  of  the  bus  transport  system  now

operating   in  Singapore,  I  have   decided   to

establish  a  Transport Advisory  Board  with  the

following terms of reference:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, to study ways and means of how to

improve  the  present  public  transport  service,

i.e., buses, taxis, etc.; and, secondly, of how to

reduce  congestion in our streets,  including  the

possibility of introducing staggered working hours

for  Government as well as for business firms  and

even of schools in the city areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The membership of the Transport Advisory Board

will  include  representatives from four  sectors.

Firstly,  workers, the majority of whom  would  be

associated  with road transport. Secondly,  owners

of  bus companies or taxis. Thirdly, organisations

or   individuals   who  are  interested   in   the

improvement  or  safety  of  road  users.  Lastly,

Government departments representing the  Registrar

of  Vehicles, the Traffic Police and the State and

City  Planning  Office respectively.  I  shall  be

making an official announcement of those appointed

to serve on this Advisory Board soon.

<div align="center"><b>EMPLOYMENT BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Question

[10th  July, 1968], "That the Bill be now  read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  when  we  rose yesterday,  I  said  that  in

looking at the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>



development  process  of backward  and  developing

countries, the factors which stood in the  way  of

the  necessary  social change are  a  compound  of

outmoded   usages  in  production  and  historical

survivors   which  in  any  event  the   political

leadership are not either capable or strong enough

either  to eradicate or sublimate. The second  one

is,  of  course,  corruption on the  part  of  the

political  elite. Fortunately for us, Sir,  we  do

not  -  mercifully, in fact -face this problem  in

Singapore. I think, institutionally, we are poised

to bring about the necessary change to usher in an

industrial society. This must be the whole purpose

of this Bill. And if this Bill does not ultimately

bring  about this change, then, of course, it  has

failed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is curious about our present organisation

and  economy  is  this. We have a tertiary  sector

which  is,  in fact, the social apparatus  of  the

secondary  sector.  We  have  a  tertiary   sector

without  a secondary sector and, curiously enough,

we will have to reverse the process of development

for  the purpose of creating an industrial sector.

Studies  have been made on the growth of societies

changing from one state to another. I think it  is

recognised  by most critics that the  change  from

one  stage  to another is not a continuous  simple

change,  but  that it is a mutation,  which  means

that in order to make the grade, you will have  to

take, in fact, some giant strides and leaps.  This

can only he brought about, as I have said earlier,

by changes in attitude on the part of our citizens

and  workers  who would be vitally concerned  with

this  change. Here, I would like to say  that  the

responsibility of the employers and  the  captains

of industry is indeed great, to devise a system of

incentives that would bring out the best in  every

worker  and  produce the necessary  attitudes  and

responses so that the change is made on the  basis

of   representative   parliamentary   institutions

which, historically in most societies, was made on

the basis of dictatorship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>2.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Employment Bill has aroused

much  public interest since its introduction,  and

many  have  criticised it.  If  we  analyse  these

criticisms carefully, it is not difficult to  find

out   that  generally  they  support  the   common

principle, namely, that when our country is facing

major  problems  and difficulties  in  the  coming

years, the spirit of the Employment Bill is  worth

supporting.  This is necessary for and  beneficial

to  the  implementation  of the  industrialisation

programmes in our existing social conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the viewpoint of our history and our

geographical  position, we need  foreign  capital,

managerial  expertise and technical  know-how  for

the  industrial  development of our  country.  Our

merchants have all along been used to the entrepot

trade and other commercial enterprises. They  have

all along felt that it is easier to make money  by

this   means.  They  are  not  keen  to  go   into

industries  which  need  more  capital  and   more

attention, because they dare not venture into  the

unknown.  The point we must recognise is  that  we

must  march towards industrialisation. We have  to

attract   foreign   capital  and   expertise   and

managerial skills to assist our economic  progress

and  growth.  We cannot achieve all this  just  by

giving  some  talks. It is not that  simple.  Many

developing   countries  are   making   intensified

efforts to attract more foreign capital into their

countries. In this respect, we will be faced  with

rather keen competition from other countries.  The

capitalists are most interested in making profits.

They prefer to invest in countries where they  can

make  huge  profits.  So we  must  create  a  more

favourable investment climate in order to  attract

foreign   capital  and  make  them  believe   that

Singapore  is more suitable for their  investment.

We  have no other alternative but to achieve this.

We have to make adjustments in the distribution of

profits  so that the capitalists may reinvest  the

profits earned here to create more employment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>



opportunities for our workers. This will  help  us

to solve some of our employment problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we are still firm in the belief of the

pro-labour stand of the P.A.P. Government  and  if

we  care  to  make  a study of  the  crux  of  the

problem,   we   will   have   no   difficulty   in

understanding the Government's real  intention  in

introducing  the Employment Bill and  its  aim  to

make it a success. The main purpose of the Bill is

to  ensure the long-term interests of our workers,

to  prepare us to overcome the coming problems and

difficulties,   and   to  maintain   our   present

prosperity.  In a nutshell, this is in  the  long-term  interest of our people. It is not  meant  to

deprive  our workers of their hard-earned  rights.

It  is  not  meant  to make their livelihood  more

difficult or to sacrifice their interests to  make

the  rich  richer.  I think it  is  necessary  and

important  to  make the workers  understand  these

points, because in the past they have shown  their

patriotism  which  has  contributed  much  to  our

favourable  investment climate, which  is  one  of

stability and peace. If the workers can understand

that the sacrifices expected of them are meant for

the  long-term interest of the people and not  for

just a handful of capitalists, they will surely be

able  to  respond and contribute their  effort  to

raise productivity as they have done in the past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From events happening in foreign countries, we

realise that we must not permit the episodes  that

have  taken place in France and England to  happen

here.  Due to short-sightedness, the workers there

have  taken actions which have led to the economic

deterioration   of  their  respective   countries.

England   was  faced  with  the  depreciation   of

sterling and France was faced with a crisis caused

by the depreciation of the franc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at Japan. After the end of the

Second World War, Japan was a defeated country and

its  economy was ruined. Every enterprise  was  in

ruins. But in the short period of 20 years,  Japan

has  been able to revive its economy and even make

it the best and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>



most  active economy in Asia. Its living standards

have become the highest in the whole of Asia.  All

this  has  come  about from the  people's  energy,

sacrifices,  understanding  and  efforts,  it   is

important for us to have all these qualities. With

all these facts before us and from the experiences

and lessons gained from elsewhere, we must get our

people  to  understand the realities of  life  and

tell them that we must work hard if we are to face

successfully the difficult challenges ahead of us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment Bill is both necessary and

realistic. I support it as a whole. But  I  cannot

agree with certain provisions therein because they

are not realistic enough to meet our situation. If

they  are  compulsorily implemented, I  am  afraid

they  may not achieve what the Government  intends

them to achieve. It may lead to results which  are

contrary to what the provisions are meant for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most important clauses is clause 15

which provides that a worker, on reaching the  age

of  55,  should retire. According to the  Minister

for  Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour, this

provision  is  to  ensure  that  those   who   are

inefficient  and incapable of further productivity

will   not   be  engaged  so  that  more  capable,

energetic   young   people  capable   of   greater

productivity  may  be engaged.  According  to  his

explanation,  it  seems that  he  is  telling  all

workers  reaching  the age of 55  that  they  will

become   unproductive   and  decrepit.   Generally

speaking,  there  are  many  instances  of  people

reaching  the  age of 55 who are not senile;  they

are actually in their prime. On reaching this age,

they will have accumulated a lot of experience and

will  be  more skilled in their respective trades.

To  do away with the good workers who have reached

the  age of 55 just because of a few bad cases  is

not  quite  fair.  The Minister  for  Science  and

Technology has said that we must make full use  of

all  available human resources in the  process  of

our   economic  growth.  This  shows  that   human

resources  are one of our treasures.  In  view  of

this, we must not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>



allow  this provision to be passed Un-amended.  If

this  provision is implemented without  amendment,

then  when  higher paid workers retire, the  lower

paid  workers will be engaged, and this  will  not

solve  our  unemployment problem because  an  "old

hand"  is  replaced by a "new hand" and this  will

decrease  efficiency in the work concerned.  There

are  other  more realistic problems. For instance,

in  the  smaller  commercial firms  which  do  not

provide  pension and where the productive  workers

on  reaching  the age of 55 must retire,  to  whom

will  the  members of their families  look  for  a

living  and on whom should they depend  for  their

livelihood? Therefore, the amendments that will be

moved  by  the Member for Bukit Ho Swee are  worth

our support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also other unsatisfactory provisions.

Members  of  Parliament  have  earlier  in   their

speeches referred to them. Since I have no  better

views to add, I will just make my stand known when

we  come to the clause-by-clause consideration  of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst Parliament is debating this Bill, we have

been trying our best to explain the naked facts of

our situation to our workers, and that the Bill is

intended  for  their long-term interests.  On  the

other  hand, we must make the employers understand

that  the  tolerance and sacrifices  made  by  the

workers  are  meant for the welfare of  the  whole

country, so that the employers may not abuse their

rights and exploit the workers. This is the  worry

we have when the Bill is passed and implemented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Minister for Culture and the

Minister  for  Foreign Affairs  and  Minister  for

Labour, there are certain short-sighted and unwise

employers  who have already taken steps to  reduce

the  workers' wages and are trying to threaten the

workers by referring them to certain provisions in

the  Bill. This is like trying to fish in troubled

waters. I appreciate the timely revelations by the

Minister  for  Labour of the ugly faces  of  those

employers who have been warned severely by him and

that the Government will not stand idly by to  see

them exploit their workers and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>



destroy the industrial peace and stability that we

have  taken  so  much  pains  to  build  up.  This

assurance by the Minister for Labour is sufficient

to  allay  the doubts the people are  having.  The

sincere  co-operation of labour, employer and  the

Government  in the process of economic development

is the very factor of our economic growth. The non-cooperation of one party will damage  not  only

our  economic growth but also the interests of our

people.  It  is  hoped  that the  Government  will

supervise closely the implementation of  the  Bill

when it is passed.



<br><br>2.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, we understand that the new Employment Bill is

introduced  by the Government in order to  achieve

increased  productivity, to attract new  investors

and to create more jobs for the unemployed and the

school-leavers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment Bill increases the working hours

from  39  to  44  per week for the  non-industrial

white-collar workers, reduces the number of public

holidays   to  11  days,  and  makes   bonus   not

negotiable. It may be noticed that a few of us  in

this  House  who  are closely connected  with  the

trade    union   movement   in   Singapore    have

deliberately   refrained   from   sloganising   or

uttering   platitudes  in  advancing  constructive

criticisms   on   certain   provisions   of   this

Employment  Bill. On the other hand, it  has  been

the  Hon. Minister for Culture's role to sloganise

against the organised workers and the trade  union

movement in Singapore. It is a fallacy on his part

to  think that before we advance arguments against

an    encroachment    of   certain    well-defined

principles,  we must go and unionise  everyone  in

Singapore. A trade union cannot be judged in  this

way  by  its  numerical strength.  A  trade  union

movement,  worthy of its name, must be  judged  by

the  responsible manner in which it puts forth its

views.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never has it been suggested by any one of my

colleagues from the trade



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>



union  movement in the course of this debate  that

the   employers,  or  better  still,  the  foreign

investors,  should make one-way traffic sacrifices

merely for our benefit. On the other hand, we have

put  forth closely reasoned arguments only on  the

undesirability of certain provisions of the  Bill,

while accepting the tenor and purpose of the  Bill

as  a  whole.  Therefore, the  Hon.  Minister  for

Culture's observation of how workers are demanding

work  on  Sundays and public holidays, and  go  to

sleep   on   Mondays  and  Tuesdays,  is   utterly

irrelevant  and highly objectionable, to  say  the

least.  If  he  is  referring  to  Government   or

statutory board workers going to sleep on  Mondays

and Tuesdays, he has only himself to blame for not

providing adequate supervision to see that they do

not  shirk  their  duties. How on  earth  can  the

Minister,  who  has had dealings with  the  labour

movement in Singapore for so many years, make ill-founded   statements  like  that  is  beyond   our

comprehension.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On medical leave the Minister refers to $2

medical certificates of dubious validity. If  this

practice is indeed widespread, what has he done to

the  doctors who, in the first place, issue  these

so-called  dubious certificates? We in  the  trade

union movement do not quarrel with the maximum  of

14  days' intermittent sick leave as provided  for

in  clause 44 (1) (a) . But we have pointed out the

gross   inadequacy  of  28  days'  hospitalisation

leave.  Why  has  the Minister for Culture  neatly

side-stepped that issue? We would like to ask  him

about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unions, through many years of struggle, have

managed to obtain various fringe benefits and  now

they  are requested to sacrifice several of  them.

The  workers  naturally prefer to retain  all  the

benefits  they  are enjoying. It is ridiculous  to

deprive them of their annual bonus which has  been

a   practice  in  Singapore  for  so  many  years.

Depriving  them of their annual bonus  will  never

help to increase productivity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are quite concerned that the employer may

take advantage of this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>



Bill especially to increase the working hours from

39  to  44  per  week. With so  many  extra  hours

available  for the employers, they may  reorganise

their company and reduce the number of workers  by

retrenchment  under various pretexts.  However,  a

representative  of the Employers'  Federation  did

mention  in the Press that employers would respond

positively  to  Government's efforts  to  generate

more jobs and that the Employers' Federation would

see  that no employer would take advantage of  the

new   provisions  in  the  Employment   Bill.   We

sincerely  hope  that  the  Employers'  Federation

would keep their promise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The N.T.U.C. and the workers in Singapore are

fully  aware of the coming crucial years  and  the

great  task and difficulties we have to  face.  We

have  about 70,000 registered unemployed and every

year  25,000 school-leavers are seeking jobs. With

the  final  withdrawal  of  the  British  military

forces  in  mid-1971, another 30,000 workers  will

lose their jobs and indirectly thousands of others

will  be affected, like shop-keepers, amahs,  taxi

drivers,  etc. In addition to that, the Government

has  to  spend  millions of  dollars  on  military

equipment to build up our national defence  so  as

to  preserve our independence. This expenditure is

necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of these circumstances, it is necessary

that workers should co-operate with the Government

to   find   ways  and  means  to  attract  foreign

investors  to  build more factories here  so  that

more  jobs will be available. It is necessary  for

workers  to  work harder and make  some  temporary

sacrifices,  as a result of the enactment  of  the

Employment Bill into law, for the sake of national

survival  and economic stability. Employers,  too,

must  come forward and give their co-operation  by

not  taking advantage of the provisions of the new

Bill.  They must expand their business and  engage

more  workers. Workers, especially in  established

firms,  must be allowed to enjoy all the  benefits

which they have obtained by negotiation. The  best

way  to  achieve increased productivity is to  see

that workers are well



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>



treated, happy and contented in their work and  to

reward them with a productivity bonus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, several speakers have already expressed their

criticisms and views and made suggestions  on  the

Employment  Bill,  and  in  this  debate  I   have

observed the following:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) All agree that we are going to face a lot of

problems  and  difficulties in the coming  crucial

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) All agree that with the complete withdrawal of

the  British forces in mid-1971, the problems will

become more acute and serious.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) All agree that plans must be made now to solve

these problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) All agree that the Government, employers and

workers  must  help to create a  good  climate  to

attract more investors to build more factories  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) All agree that the objective of the Employment

Bill  is to attract more investors to create  more

job opportunities and increase productivity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) All agree that some amendments to the

Employment Bill are necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) All agree that employers must not make use of

this  Bill  as  a legal licence to  abuse  and  to

retrench workers under false pretences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) All agree that the Government, employers and

workers  must co-operate to achieve the  objective

of the Employment Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The N.T.U.C. has studied the Bill and I am

directed to move the deletion of clause 15 on  the

employment of a person after the age of 55  years,

and amendments to the following clauses: clause 44

on  sick leave; clause 46 on retrenchment benefit;

clause  47 on payment of bonus; and clause  53  on

offences. During the Committee stage, when  moving

these  amendments,  I shall give  my  reasons  for

doing so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, I consider it

very  necessary  that before the passing  of  this

Employment  Bill,  the  Government  must  give  an

assurance to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>



the N.T.U.C. and the workers in Singapore that  it

will review the Bill whenever it is necessary  and

when  further representation is made by us  should

there  be abuses or exploitation by the employers.

On our part, we will give our full co-operation to

achieve the objective which will be beneficial  to

the Government, employers and workers.



<br><br>3.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  in  the wake of the British withdrawal  from

Singapore completely by the end of 1971, Singapore

must  forge ahead in economic development  in  all

fields, particularly in industry, in order to meet

the challenges in the crucial years ahead. Labour,

therefore, becomes an important factor in economic

activities.  There  is  an  urgent  need  to  make

modifications  in our existing labour  legislation

so  as  to  help  accelerate  the  development  of

economic  growth  to ensure industrial  peace  and

stability and to create more job opportunities for

our   unemployed  citizens.  Both  employers   and

employees  should  not have any misconceptions  in

their  minds that the enactment of the new  labour

law is designed to favour any party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers should bear in mind that under the

provisions of the Employment Bill, they have  more

opportunities  to expand their establishment  with

their  accumulated profits. They should  not  take

this  as  an  opportunity to exploit or  victimise

their  employees  under any  pretext.  Though  the

employers  have openly pledged their  support  and

have promised to co-operate with the Government to

achieve  the ultimate aim of the Employment  Bill,

the  Government must see to it that their word  is

honoured.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees, on the other hand, must be aware that

economic expansion will bring more revenue to  the

Government.  This  will help to  provide  adequate

security  which, in turn, will encourage more  and

more investment from local and foreign industries.

If  more  industries are set up in  our  Republic,

more and more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>



job   opportunities  will  be  created   for   our

unemployed   citizens.   Employees    must    also

understand  that  the  sacrifice  of  some  fringe

benefits  on  their part will be compensated  with

facilities   to   own  homes,  additional   C.P.F.

benefits, better education for their children  and

other  social  benefits which the Government  will

seek to provide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will agree with me, Sir, that a nation's

well-being is, in effect, inevitably tied  to  its

economic growth and the high productivity  of  its

people.  The  emphasis  now  is  on  the  need  to

increase our labour productivity to accelerate the

economic growth of our Republic, especially in the

industrial  field.  It  must  be  remembered  that

labour represents the largest input of all factors

of  our  economic  productivity.  An  increase  in

labour productivity means a reduction in the  cost

of goods and services. This is vital and essential

if  Singapore is to meet competition in the  world

market for our export-oriented industries. This is

what the Employment Bill hopes to achieve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Singapore is to survive and progress as an

industrialised  nation, there  must  be  concerted

effort by labour, management and the Government to

steer  the  country through the crucial  years.  A

nation's  advancement depends on the determination

and the will of its people to live as a nation. We

have to adapt ourselves to changes if such changes

are  for the good of the whole nation. It  is  the

long-term interest and not the short-term interest

of  a  country which should be given a high degree

of  consideration. It is the national interest and

not  the  personal  or  sectional  interest  which

should be given consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should look to Japan and its people as our

example.  Japan's  enterprises  experienced  rapid

economic   growth  through  its  industrialisation

which  started  in the Meiji era.  The  growth  of

Japan's  economy  played  an  important  role   in

Japan's modernisation. Though the country  was  in

ruins  at the end of World War II, it has  made  a

great  recovery in the post-war era. It  has  made

great   advances   in  all  fields   of   economic

development and has now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>



become  one  of the world's leading industrialised

nations.  What has made this possible? It  is  not

only  because of the foresight and able leadership

of  the Japanese Government, but also because  its

people  take  pride in building their nation.  We,

the people of Singapore, should emulate them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with the exception of a few new

clauses,  the  bulk  of  the  provisions  in   the

Employment  Bill  are merely  a  re-enactment  and

modification  of the provisions contained  in  the

three existing labour Ordinances. I do agree  that

there  are  shortcomings in the  Employment  Bill,

such  as  the clauses relating to retirement  age,

payment of bonuses, sick leave, annual leave, etc.

I  understand these will be given re-consideration

when  the  Member  for Bukit  Ho  Swee  moves  his

amendments at the Committee stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole and although unpopular, the

Employment Bill is by far the most important piece

of  legislation  which the P.A.P.  Government  has

ever  introduced since it came to power  in  1959.

But this piece of legislation has to be introduced

not  to enhance the popularity of the P.A.P.,  but

because  the nation's economy and the survival  of

its people are at stake.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I end by expressing my support for

this  Bill in the hope that the amendments of  the

Member  for Bukit Ho Swee will be accepted by  the

Government.



<br><br>3.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the reasons why we called

earlier  General  Elections was that  we  have  to

adjust  'our  plans  to  meet  the  military   and

economic  consequences of the British Government's

decision for an earlier withdrawal from her  bases

in  Singapore and Malaysia, i.e., by  the  end  of

1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall objective is simple enough: to

attract   expertise,  know-how,   enterprise   and

capital,  to use Singapore's domestic capital  and

her   workers   to   greater  advantage   in   the

manufacturing,  assembling and servicing  sectors.

We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>



must   also   stimulate  expansion  of   existing

industries and enterprises and encourage  them  to

new  lines  of  business, all with the  accent  on

export.  We  must  get  our young  men  and  women

trained  and skilled in the techniques  of  modern

industry,  so  that the quality and costs  of  our

products  are  competitive on the export  markets.

This  will  increase our Gross  National  Product,

give  us a higher standard of living, and pay  for

the ever-increasing cost of our own defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are ample funds in Singapore, as every

banker  can  tell hon. Members. Every sound  share

issue  put on the market has been over-subscribed,

sometimes  by more than four times. But  until  we

have   enough  industrial  expertise,   managerial

talent and export promotion know-how, this capital

will  not  be used effectively to give  meaningful

jobs  to  our ever-increasing numbers of  educated

but not technically trained workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective can be vividly illustrated if hon.

Members   will  allow  me  to  over-simplify   the

problem.   Given  what  we  have  at  present   in

Singapore,  the total performance,  the  value  of

goods  and services produced per annum, the  Gross

National  Product could treble if our two  million

people  were  made up of people  from  the  highly

developed countries, like workers from Japan  with

their   intensity  of  purpose  and  high  skills,

technicians and engineers from Germany with  their

efficient and specialised apprenticeship training,

scientists  and  technologists from  Britain  with

their sophistication and imaginative research, and

executives  from America with their well-developed

disciplines   in   business   administration   and

management with their "hard-sell" approaches. Such

a  two  million people would not be just repairing

ships. They would be building ships. They would be

running   their  own  merchant  fleets  like   the

Norwegians, and deep-sea fishing fleets  like  the

Japanese.  They  would be running  a  full-fledged

round-the-world international airline. They  would

be  a centre for the maintenance of airframes  and

aircraft



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>



engines in the region. They would be a centre  for

computers and computer servicing for the whole  of

this region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem, therefore, is how to educate and

train  our people to reach the standards of  these

technologically  advanced  countries  as  soon  as

possible. First, we must ask if our people have it

in  them,  for otherwise this will be a  vain  and

futile exercise. From the record of the last  nine

years  since we started to manage our own affairs,

I  believe that nearly all our people have got the

stuffing in them to make the grade. What they need

are the opportunities and the training. One way to

educate  our  young  people to higher  degrees  of

technical skill is to send them abroad.  But  this

is  only possible for the relatively few, since it

is costly. The more practical, the more economical

and  the  more productive way is to import outside

expertise  to manufacture or assemble, or  set  up

the  servicing organisations for which there is  a

demand. With in-service training, our workers will

develop higher and higher skills. However, this is

what a few other countries are also trying to  do.

Some  have  more attractive inducements with  non-unionised  and cheap labour and a bigger protected

domestic market to offer these industries a chance

to   get   established.  But   they   often   have

disadvantages and disabilities, like  workers  who

are  less  educated, not so striving nor  trained,

nor  disciplined, and less stable  and  favourable

political, social and economic conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must put to maximum advantage the capacity of

our   workers   for  intense  effort   and   rapid

acquisition of skills. Their readiness  to  learn,

an   almost   irresistible  impulse   to   improve

themselves, when combined with politically  stable

and  socially  healthy conditions, make  Singapore

attractive  to  those manufacturers  who  can  get

either   a   freight  or  a  wage   advantage   to

manufacture   or   assemble   in   Singapore   for

Singapore's consumption and for export.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me illustrate this point in another way.

Given the same Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>



but   substituting   the   present   two   million

Singaporeans  for some other two  million  people,

more pleasure-loving, less hardy, less willing  to

work,  and  less willing to learn;  compound  this

with  inept administration and corrupt government;

then  I  say overnight Singapore's Gross  National

Product  could be halved or reduced to a third  of

what  it presently is. This should illustrate  how

much  the  final  performance  depends  upon   the

ability, stamina, skills, knowledge, expertise and

discipline of our population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are testing times ahead. Details of

British  withdrawal plans have been made known  to

us.   They   show  an  ever-increasing   rate   of

redundancy  of  both  local civilian  workers  and

repatriation  of  British  service  and   civilian

personnel.  The heaviest blow will fall  in  1971.

From  the  experience of the Economic  Development

Board,  we  know that it takes two to three  years

from  first discussions on a project, through  its

planning   and  construction  stages,   to   first

production.   Therefore,   unless    we    attract

manufacturers  on  new projects  now,  there  will

neither  be  the factories nor the jobs  in  1970,

1971  and  1972 when the pressure of  unemployment

will be heaviest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first major task of this new Parliament is

to   take   through  this  series  of  legislative

amendments  that  will put our working  population

into  better trim. This is a package which is both

fair and attractive. These amendments are designed

to  make  everyone  put in a  greater  effort  for

higher  performance  to bring in  higher  rewards.

This, coupled with the home-ownership plan for the

mass  of  our  workers  and not  just  the  higher

salaried groups, will enable more and more of  our

working  population  to have  a  growing  personal

stake  in  the continuing prosperity and stability

of our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some enterprises that can profitably

work round the clock for every day of the 365 days

in  the year. They should do so. The harbour,  the

dockyards, the airports, and some factories  whose

export orders make this worth while will do this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must cut out unnecessary stoppages of work.

Over  the years, each cultural and religious group

has  had holidays added on to our annual list.  We

were  well on the way to having the highest number

of  public  holidays per year for  office  workers

anywhere in Asia. Now we shall go back to 11  paid

public holidays a year which is what it has always

been  and still is for industrial workers. In  the

essential  services work will carry  on, holidays

and  Sundays notwithstanding, providing more  jobs

for  our unemployed. Singapore will be kept  clean

and  green.  Shops  and restaurants  can  open  on

Sundays and public holidays - the whole year round

if  they  find  it profitable - so that  they  can

better cater for their customers and for tourists.

But  workers will get one rest day per  week,  and

double  pay  for a public holiday if the  employer

wants them to work. But if it is the employee  who

wants  to work on a public holiday, then  he  gets

only single pay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assumptions made in the 1950s and 1960s by

the trade unions and their advisers, of whom I was

one, were that our workers wanted more leisure  to

enjoy  their pay. These assumptions were based  on

British  practices which were and  are  completely

irrelevant  to  our social conditions.  Every-body

knows  this. Our workers want work, and more  work

for  more  money - not more leisure to  spend  the

inadequate sums they earn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the vast majority of workers, over three-quarters of whom are not in any unions at all, the

new  legislation  means an  improvement  in  their

working  conditions.  It  is  only  the  minority,

probably  less than one-tenth of our  work  force,

the  better  unionised clerical groups,  who  will

have  to  make  some adjustments in their  working

hours  per week before being entitled to overtime.

This  is a helpful change, for it will bring blue-collar  workers  into line with  the  white-collar

workers.  And we need more blue, and  less  white,

collar  workers. This is a legacy of the education

policies  of the past when it was never  envisaged

that  we  would  be other than a dependent  people

assisting in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>



the  lower  ranks of a trading and  administrative

capital of one part of a vast empire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we accept all the amendments which are being

sought  by  the Member for Bukit Ho  Swee,  nobody

will  lose  anything  either in  wages  or  fringe

benefits.  In other words, all existing agreements

between  unions and employers will continue  until

they  expire.  We are seriously considering  this.

Because we know that when these agreements expire,

unless we have succeeded in creating new jobs, the

redundancies  that  are  taking  place,  plus  the

annual  inflow  into the labour  market  from  the

schools,   will  alter  the  supply   and   demand

situation  so radically that the wages  and  other

fringe  benefits being re-negotiated are bound  to

be  fundamentally different. So unions  and  their

members  have  a  vested interest to  help  create

conditions   under  which  more   industries   and

enterprises  are established creating more  demand

for  workers and reducing the supply of unemployed

workers.  We  are  also checking the  tendency  to

increase  labour costs, not by wage increases  but

by  fringe  benefits, hidden costs  which  can  be

easily  abused,  like casual sick leave  which  is

taken  whenever  a worker feels like  a  day  off,

often when he is not sick.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot over-emphasise that what we have

not  attempted  to  do  is to regulate  agreements

between  unions and employers on the wages  to  be

paid.  We  have not fixed maximum or minimum  wage

levels.  That  wage  will  depend  upon   what   a

particular  industry  or  enterprise  can  afford,

taking  into consideration the rate for that  kind

of  job. The performance of a particular company's

workers  and  the profits of that  enterprise.  In

other  words, with less hidden benefits  and  more

open  rewards  with higher incentives  for  higher

performance   when  industries   and   enterprises

prosper, so wages will go up. So will bonuses also

go  up.  The legislation is also designed to  help

improve  management  discipline  and  establish  a

sensible    relationship   between   unions    and

management.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes without saying that as new and better

management    techniques   are    introduced    by

subsidiaries  of the large international  concerns

who  go into partnership with our citizens, so our

own  established  enterprises must  modernise  and

improve  work methods, machinery, organisation  to

keep  up  their own productivity, or they will  go

under.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the earlier stages of our labour movement,

the trade union often became a place of refuge for

the inefficient, the slack, the lazy and the anti-social.  As has happened elsewhere, these are  the

first to join the union to seek protection against

the  natural desire of any employer to be  rid  of

bad  workers.  When some Russian  trade  unionists

were  in  Singapore several months ago, they  told

our   trade  union  leaders  that  Russian   trade

unionists report to and require of management  the

dismissal  of  inefficient  workers  and   thereby

increase  productivity. I am not asking our  trade

union  leaders, in an open democratic  society  to

take  on  the role of management. But  I  do  urge

them,  with  the help of these new laws,  to  stop

giving  cover  to  those who  do  not  pull  their

weight.  We  must avoid slipping into a  situation

where trade unionism is the practice of protecting

the  weakest  and  the slowest  worker  and,  with

everybody  being paid the same wage,  nobody  will

have  the slightest incentive to work harder  than

the weakest and the slowest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But just as there are bad workers, so too there

are  bad  employers. From my discussions with  the

various  employers' organisations and Chambers  of

Commerce,  it  is  clear  that  the  old-fashioned

family  type businessman has no conception of  the

wider   and  longer  term  relationships   between

management  and labour in an age of  educated  and

organised  workers  who  are  conscious  of  their

indispensable part in the production of the wealth

of  the whole community. These employers will have

to be educated and taught the facts of present-day

industrial life.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We call upon everyone for improvement and

effort. This is our duty as a government.  No  one

is  asked  to  sacrifice for the  benefit  of  the

privileged  and the corrupt, nor will  revenue  go

into  wasteful  and extravagant expenditure.  With

higher performance and greater output, there  will

be  more  industries and more jobs, better trained

artisans,  technicians, engineers, and executives.

From  the higher Gross National Product will  come

greater  revenue.  From  this  revenue  will  flow

improved  standards of education, health services,

social amenities and housing for all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all human beings. The Government does not

expect  workers to put in more effort for nothing.

So we are putting more into the kitty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the private sector the higher Central

Provident Fund benefits mean that workers  getting

less  than $200 per month will still not  have  to

contribute  to  the  Central Provident  Fund.  But

their   employers  will  have  to  contribute   an

additional  5  per  cent.  The  increase  will  be

implemented in three annual stages by increases of

1½  per  cent,  l½ per cent and  2  per  cent.  At

present  the maximum contribution an employer  has

to  make  for workers earning more than  $200  per

month, without special pensionable schemes, is $25

per month. This is also the maximum the worker has

to  pay  to  the Central Provident Fund.  Now  the

maximum  contribution  will  be  $150  per   month

instead  of  the present $25 per month.  So  if  a

young executive is earning $1,500 a month, he will

contribute  $150, and his employer will contribute

$150  every month for his C.P.F., whereas formerly

each contributed only $25.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Present C.P.F. balances can be set off against

down  payment  for  Housing and Development  Board

flats,  not  privately  constructed  houses.   The

present employer plus worker total of 10 per  cent

monthly  contributions will go up to 13 per  cent,

16  per  cent,  and 20 per cent  in  three  annual

stages. These monthly contributions can be set off

against   monthly  instalments  of   Housing   and

Development Board or privately constructed  homes.

The distinction is crucial,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>



because  in  one  case  the  money  already

accumulated in the central Provident Fund has gone

into  public works expenditure, and with a Housing

and  Development  Board  flat,  it  means  a  book

transfer. But with a privately-built home it means

an  actual  payment  out by the Central  Provident

Fund  of  a  sum of money to a private  developer.

Legislation  will  also  be  introduced  to  allow

workers  to  authorise their employers  to  deduct

monthly  sums from salaries direct to the  Housing

and Development Board or private developers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to stress that nobody is getting less; in

fact, everybody is getting more. What we have  the

right  to  expect is that everybody puts in  more.

Only  then  can we have better social, educational

and  medical services. And I want to stress  again

the  ever-growing  annually  recurring  costs   of

defence.  It  is  not  just a question  of  buying

aeroplanes. Having bought them, we need  to  train

our pilots to fly them. We need the ground crew to

maintain  them for flying by our pilots every  day

of  every year so that both planes and pilots  are

in  top  form all the time. Again, it is not  just

buying fast patrol craft. We have to maintain them

and  re-fit them. And our sailors have to man them

all  the  time.  Then every so many  years  a  new

generation  of  weapons  have  to  be  bought  and

obsolete  aircraft, vehicles and weapons discarded

or sold second-hand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me briefly recapitulate. Our plans are to

put  our  capital and labour -to greater  use.  We

must  attract more capital and more expertise from

those who know how to use capital in a place  like

Singapore  to maximum economic advantage.  Several

factors   are  in  our  favour:  stable  political

conditions  for  the indefinite  future,  a  sound

currency, clean, heal-thy living conditions.  Most

important,  we  have workers who are  intelligent,

industrious,  resourceful and  positive  in  their

approach  to life. In the end, it is the  combined

effort  of the Government, workers, and management

that will accelerate the growth of our economy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we will be judged as a government by

results. These results depend, among other things,

upon the morale and enthusiasm of the people,  and

the  pace  set by their leaders in Parliament  and

outside.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were a soft community, then the temptation

would  be to leave things alone and hope  for  the

best. Then, only good fortune can save us from the

unpleasantness which reason and logic tell  us  is

ahead  of us. But we are not an easy-going people.

We  cannot help thinking, calculating and planning

for  tomorrow, for next week, for next month,  for

next  year,  for the next generation.  And  it  is

because  we  have restless minds, forever  probing

and  testing, seeking new and better solutions  to

old and new problems, that we have never been, and

I trust never shall be, tried and found wanting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask hon. Members to consider their

responsibilities in the context  of  this  sombre

perspective  of  the  1970s  when  they  come   to

deliberate   at  the  Committee   stage   on   the

amendments  to all the legislation. They  together

comprise  what  I  have stated a not  unattractive

package.



<br><br>3.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

may  I crave the indulgence of this House to  take

the  debate  off the profundities of detailed  and

analytical  scrutiny  on to less  deep  waters  of

generalisation which it may still be useful for us

to  negotiate?  I  do not propose  to  cause  hon.

Members   needless   anguish   by   going    over,

unnecessarily, points already made in  this  House

by  others  who  have spoken  on  this  Bill.  But

certain  fundamental emphases  must,  I  feel,  be

driven relentlessly home. I have, therefore, risen

to  make a few observations on the Employment Bill

and  the  circumstances of its general design  and

intention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour has already painted a

graphic picture of the compelling necessities that

face  us all in Singapore. He has referred frankly

to the grim possibilities of widespread



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>



unemployment unless rigorous measures are taken to

enable   us  to  fight  ourselves  out   of   this

situation.  Various  economic measures  have  been

mentioned,   including   more   industrialisation,

further  encouragement of tourism,  ship-building,

ship   repairing,  all  of  which  will  certainly

require  the  investment  of  public  moneys.  The

imperatives resulting from the need to generate  a

defence credibility have also been dwelt upon.  As

has  been pointed out frequently, the cost of this

will  be quite formidable. But our problems  come,

not apparently in single spies, but in battalions.

For  I  would like to add somewhat to the picture

that  has been drawn of the stern demands  of  our

circumstances.  While we have  to  work  hard  and

build  up our defence sinews, we have at the  same

time to strive mightily to maintain the extent  of

our   social  provisions - health,  education   and

recreation.    These   are   indeed   inextricably

associated with what we are trying to  do  in  the

sphere  of  industrialisation  and  defence.   Our

workers  and citizen soldiers must be well trained

and  in good physical condition. Our society  must

be  geared, in the fields of education and health,

to  the challenges ahead. Our education system  is

already  receiving  a firmer and  more  definitive

orientation    to    the   manpower    needs    of

industrialisation and technical  development.  The

echelons  of the Health Ministry, under an  almost

military  direction,  are  intent  on  making  our

morale  even  more tidy. The Minister for  Health,

while  not  allowing the grass to grow  under  his

feet,  will  certainly  be able  to  confirm  that

health  measures cost money. So, too, with  regard

to  education, will the Minister for Education  be

able to testify. His concerns are multifarious, as

I  am  sure the Member for Serangoon Gardens  will

agree.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, in addition to the demands of our urgent

industrialisation  programme and  defence  on  our

financial  resources, there are also demands  from

other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>



sectors  which we can elude only at  the  cost  of

defence and industrialisation themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to draw the most serious and sober

attention  of  the House to the  fact  that  these

conditions add up to the inevitable picture  of  a

forbiddingly  taut  survival  situation   as   our

prospect for the immediate future. In the face  of

this  prospect, it may well be a sterile  academic

exercise  to  expatiate on rights, incentives  and

the  like. The main thing about the philosophy  of

survival  is  the right to survive. The  principal

point  about  the  psychology of survival  is  the

incentive  to survive. This message  must  be  put

across  with  all possible vigour and appeal.  The

misunderstandings  that have prevailed  about  the

purpose  of  this  Bill must be cleared  with  all

possible despatch not only within but without  the

House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to lay down the minimum

conditions for a worker to operate in and, at  the

same  time,  to  set  the  right  conditions   for

productivity.  The continued enjoyment  of  better

than  minimum  conditions in  the  case  of  those

sectors which enjoy these better conditions is not

precluded by this Bill. The ventilation  of  views

during  this  debate and the forthright  statement

from   the   Minister  for  Labour  have   clearly

indicated the consensus of the House that it is in

the  enlightened self-interest of  employers  that

they interpret this Bill both wisely and well. The

support of labour has been promised provided  that

their  views, incorporated in the various proposed

amendments, are given full consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has shown its goodwill by

undertaking  to  give deliberate consideration  to

the  amendments  proposed by the N.T.U.C.  Indeed,

the  Government may well ask our people  to  judge

its  intentions by its example in  the  past.  The

Government's integrity and skill in socio-economic

diagnosis may be amply demonstrated by the  record

of  its  widely acknowledged achievements. If  the

Government's  current prescription  is  plenty  of

hard work and a spartan fare, then it is good



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>



that this prescription comes when our body politic

is  in a healthy condition. While I agree with the

Member for Moulmein that our remedy should not  be

unnecessarily  bitter, the cure will  have  to  be

even  more drastic if we allow our body to  become

sick. Indeed, prevention is better than cure, if I

may quote the Member for Telok Blangah.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I make a final point which

I  do  not think is too peripheral to this debate.

It  is this. We may consider it necessary to leave

no  stone unturned to bring home to our people the

meaning  of this Bill, coupled with the Industrial

Relations  (Amendment) Bill and  the  new  Central

Provident  Fund (Amendment) Bill. From  the  long-term view, we should also do our best to encourage

the  emergence of our workers' education  movement

based within the trade union movement itself.



<br><br>3.51 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is acknowledged that workers do not need to

adopt   an   outmoded  militant   stance   towards

employers. A clear sight of the true objectives of

the labour movement can be obtained if the workers

organise  their own further education to  keep  up

with the tremendous changes in our environment and

in  the  world  around us. At the same  time,  our

managers, especially those who are controllers  of

enterprises  in the sense of being the proprietors

or  part proprietors, should be encouraged to keep

up  even more readily with the latest developments

in   management   technique  and  philosophy.   We

acknowledge  that the manager and the entrepreneur

make profit for the country while they make profit

for themselves. But the businessman should not  be

merely  a  profit-maker.  He  is  not  simply   an

economic man. He is also, we hope, a wise man. And

a  truly wise businessman will also try to operate

within  the  human context of moral, national  and

social objectives. The long view, Sir, is the only

view for the wise businessman



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>



educated  in  the  dynamics of our  survival.  The

Employment Bill has my support in principle.



<br><br>3.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong):</b> (In Mandarin): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the last few days, my

colleagues  have  spoken with  enthusiasm  on  the

Employment  Bill which will affect the  future  of

our   country.  They  have  given  their  opinions

freely. I would like to give my views now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like my colleagues, I support this Bill in

principle.  I  think  all  reasonable   men   will

appreciate    the   Government's   intention    in

introducing it. It is not to satisfy the  personal

interests and welfare of the Ministers. It is also

not  to  exploit the workers. The main concern  of

the Bill is the future welfare of our country. Its

aim  is  to  build  a  strong foundation  for  our

society.  All  reasonable men should support  this

objective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been independent for almost three years.

Under  the  able leadership of the Government  and

with  the co-operation of the people, we have been

able  to  overcome many difficulties  during  this

period. The people are now enjoying a secure and -prosperous life. Some people think that  by  their

not  affording economic co-operation, we  will  be

doomed  and  we  will  have  to  submit  to  their

demands.  In  fact, the effect  has  been  to  the

contrary.  Some Singaporeans have, on  their  own,

tried  to  develop various fields of  industry  so

that  our  economic productivity will be increased

year  by  year.  Our  housing,  education,  social

welfare and public health services are the best in

Southeast Asia. If we have the opportunity  to  go

overseas and compare the social conditions of  our

country  with  those of other countries.  We  will

understand the situation. We will be surprised  to

find  that  Singapore  is,  after  all,  a  lovely

country.  Indeed,  our country is  a  paradise  in

Southeast  Asia. It is a place where people  would

like to stay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a Chinese saying that what is good will

not stay long. The implications in defence and the

effects on our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>



economy  are  very serious with the withdrawal  of

the  British  troops. At this stage,  we  have  to

assess calmly the problem in great depth. We  have

to  plan  and make provision for the future.  With

the  withdrawal of the British Forces, the  annual

Forces'  expenditure of $450 million  will  be  no

more.  We  will have to look for other sources  of

revenue, otherwise our country will experience  an

economic  recession. Moreover, the 20,000  workers

at  present  working  in the  British  bases  will

become unemployed. This number, together with  the

existing  number  of unemployed  plus  the  annual

number of school-leavers who will be entering  the

labour  market, will be increased to an  estimated

figure  of 120,000 unemployed - a total of 20  per

cent unemployed. This is a very big percentage  in

our economically active population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last few years we have tried our best to

industrialise  to create employment opportunities.

The  Jurong  industrial  estate  was  started   in

September 1961. Seven years have elapsed and there

are  now, in all, 116 factories. The total  number

of  jobs  created is 12,000. The  number  of  jobs

created  each  year  is only 2,000.  However,  the

population  density  in  Singapore  is  8,000  per

square mile. According to statistics, from 1963 to

1967 the average number of babies born yearly  was

55,000,  but  the  number  of  deaths  yearly  was

10,000.  The net increase in population is  45,000

per  annum. With this rate of population increase,

our population will soon reach the figure of three

million.  The average population density  will  be

12,000  per  square  mile.  Men  have  to  eat  to

survive. We do not have any natural resources.  We

have  no  land for planting food crops. Unless  we

plan properly now, we will not be able to meet the

demands  of  the future. If our economy stagnates,

then  in  a  few  years'  time  our  society  will

degenerate  into unimaginable chaos  and  trouble.

These  examples  are found in many newly  emergent

countries. If we do not wish chaos and trouble  to

occur here, we have to plan and resolve



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>



to  utilise fully our human resources. We have  to

learn from the more advanced countries, especially

Japan  and  Germany. Only 20 years ago, these  two

countries  were defeated in the Second  World  War

and  were in ruins. But today, they are among  the

highly  industrialised countries.  If  we  analyse

carefully   the  reasons  for  their  growth   and

prosperity,  we will find that their  peoples  are

willing to learn all the time. They are willing to

work hard and persevere. These are the reasons for

their prosperity today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must industrialise rapidly. Only then

can  our  country have a future.  As  many  of  my

colleagues  have  pointed  out,  to  attain  these

objectives,   we  have  to  create  a   favourable

investment climate. In order to achieve  this,  we

must  have  political stability, good  labour  and

employer  relations  and  other  factors  such  as

export incentives and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the P.A.P. came to power, the relationship

between  employers  and  employees  has  gradually

improved. With the establishment of the Industrial

Arbitration  Court, many industrial disputes  have

been  settled  peacefully and  strikes  have  been

reduced  in  number. Quite apart from good  labour

and    employer   relations   locally-manufactured

products must be of good quality and cheap if they

are to compete in overseas countries. In order  to

achieve this, we have to increase productivity and

lower  production costs. As we do not have natural

resources or raw materials, we have to import them

from  other  countries. The cost of raw materials,

therefore,  will be higher than that obtaining  in

other countries. The only way to lower the cost of

production is to try to increase our productivity.

To   increase  productivity,  we  require   modern

machinery,  skilled  workers and  the  spirit  and

willingness to work hard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Employment Bill provides ways and means

to  raise  productivity.  The  intention  is  most

commendable. However, there are certain provisions

in  the  Bill  which are not clear  or  convincing

enough  to dispel some of the fears of the people.

Some provisions are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>



not  clearly drafted. This Bill has given rise  to

some  controversy, especially in regard to  bonus,

annual  leave,  retirement age and  so  on.  These

provisions will have to be carefully considered by

the  Minister for Labour. If we are to pass  these

provisions  as they stand, it is doubtful  whether

our  objectives  will be attained.  On  the  other

hand,  if  the workers become depressed  and  lose

interest  in  their work, I do not  think  we  can

increase productivity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some provisions in the Bill allow the employers

to  control the fate of the workers. I think these

provisions will be easily abused by some employers

who  may  take  advantage  of  the  situation  and

exploit  the workers. If this happens,  I  do  not

know  what  the  Government  intends  to  do.  For

example,  the Minister for Labour and the Minister

for Culture have mentioned that a certain employer

who  owns a local newspaper took advantage of  the

situation when the Bill was introduced to fish  in

troubled  waters. I would like to know what  steps

Government proposes to take to check employers who

exploit  workers. If the Minister for  Labour  can

look  into this problem, I will fully support this

Bill.



<br><br>4.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, one fact that has emerged from the

debate  on the Bill is that even the most critical

Member of the House agrees with the essential aims

and  broad principles of the Bill - and it is  this:

employer - employee relationship must have  as  its

primary  and over-riding concern the promotion  of

economic  growth  and economic  expansion  without

which  ruination faces both workers and  employers

alike.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criticisms have been in regard to some

details  of the Bill though some of these  details

are  of  major importance and could, if  radically

modified, substantially hinder the achievement  of

our major economic objectives. Other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>



criticisms    derive,    I    think,    from     a

misunderstanding of the provisions  criticised.  I

would  like, therefore, to deal with some  of  the

relevant criticisms and offer either clarification

or explanation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First a matter of clarification. The Member for

Anson,  for  example,  said  that  he  could   not

understand  why this Bill should seek  to  prevent

employers  from engaging employees except  through

the   Employment  Exchange.  He  pointed  out  the

difficulties and hardships it could cause to small

establishments which have members  of  the  family

working or in cases where it may be necessary  for

the employer to have someone whom he can trust  on

the basis of his personal knowledge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this, I would like to say that Part XI of the

Bill,  especially clause 112, enables the Minister

to make regulations to require employers to notify

vacancies  in their establishment and  to  prevent

employers  from engaging or re-engaging  employees

except through the Employment Exchange.



<br><br>4.10 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the provisions of this part of the Bill

will  not be invoked until the necessary machinery

and  regulations are ready. One of the reasons why

this provision has been included in the Bill is to

make  it  easier for us to find jobs for  national

servicemen on their discharge. No one will quarrel

with the principle that those of our young men who

have   gone  through  national  service  and   are

committed to defending with their lives, the lives

and  property  of employers as well,  should  have

preference in the matter of jobs - provided they can

perform  these jobs. Let me, however,  assure  the

Member  for Anson that in making these regulations

the   points  made  by  him  will  be  taken  into

consideration,   It  is  not  the   intention   of

Government  to  direct employment  in  all  cases.

Employers  will still be free to engage  employees

through other sources.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kapor has pointed out

that before this provision can be implemented  the

Employment   Exchange  must  be   reorganised   to

implement this provision effectively and fairly. I

fully agree with him. This would also involve  the

availability of trade-testing facilities and  this

matter  is  now  being looked into in  conjunction

with  the  Technical Education Department  of  the

Ministry of Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also wanted to know why the

provisions   on   maternity   benefits   are   not

applicable  to female employees other than  female

workmen.  The  existing Labour Ordinance  confines

payment  of  maternity  benefits  only  to  female

workmen and no cogent arguments have been advanced

why   we   should  depart  from  this  established

practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked whether the definition of

"employer"  in  clause  2  of  the  Bill  includes

corporations    and    associations.    For    his

information,  I  would point out that  in  keeping

with the Interpretation Act, the word "person"  in

the  definition of "employer" should be  construed

to  include any company or association or body  of

persons, corporate or incorporate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of definitions, the Member for

Kallang   has  asked  why  seamen,  watchmen   and

security  guards are excluded from the  definition

of  "employee". The reason is that the  nature  of

the  duties of this category of employees  is  not

amenable   to   regulation  by   ordinary   labour

legislation. For instance, the normal working  day

of   8  hours  for  the  average  employee  cannot

possibly  be applied to the working conditions  of

seamen, watchmen or security guards. The nature of

their  duties  requires them, as  a  rule,  to  be

"attached"  to  their place  of  work.  Under  the

circumstances,  it  is  best  that  conditions  of

employment for this category of workers be left to

be  determined by mutual agreement. Moreover, hon.

Members   will  note  that  seamen  watchmen   and

security guards are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>



already  excluded from the definition of "workmen"

in  the  Bill. It is therefore logical  that  they

should   be   excluded  from  the  definition   of

"employee".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now to deal with criticisms in

regard to major provisions of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear that clause 15, relating to

retirement at 55 years, has attracted considerable

criticism.  The sum total of these criticisms  has

been  to convey the impression that once a  person

has  reached the age of 55, this Bill would ensure

that  he is consigned to the dungheap - including,

as  one  hon. Member not unkindly pointed out,  me

and the Minister for Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is, of course, to misread the intentions of

the Bill, because clause 15 gives the Commissioner

powers  to  approve persons over  55  to  continue

working.  This  means that the  Commissioner  will

make  his  decision  on each  case  on  individual

merits  - whether the person is medically  fit  to

continue working, whether his skill and experience

persist  unimpaired despite advancing age; whether

his  employer finds him useful for his  enterprise

and  so on. Since the purpose of this Bill  is  to

promote  economic  expansion and productivity,  it

would be illogical to retire workers who, whatever

their   age,   can  still  contribute  effectively

towards this goal. What this clause seeks to do is

to  give the Commissioner the power to review  the

continued employment of older persons so that  the

inefficient   and   the   unproductive   do    not

indefinitely  block  job  opportunities  for   the

vigorous and productive and skilled young men  who

yearly enter the labour market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next most controversial provision is clause

47  on  bonus.  Here again the criticism  of  hon.

Members, though understandable, seems to have been

mis-conceived. It is apparent that bonus has  been

regarded not as incentive payment, which it is  by

definition and should be in regard to purpose, but

as  part  and  parcel of wages. The  Minister  for

Culture  did  in his speech point out convincingly

the  prevailing confusion between bonus and wages.

The essence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>



of   bonus  payment,  he  noted,  is  that  it  is

discretionary. It has to be discretionary  if  its

character   as   incentive  payment   is   to   be

maintained.  This  was  what  the  Government  was

trying to achieve in providing that the payment of

bonus  shall  not be a matter for negotiation  but

that  it  should  be  tied  to  productivity   and

performance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point our trade union officials appear not

to  realise is that through the course of the last

decade  or so trade union pressure on the employer

has  succeeded in elevating the payment  of  bonus

into  something  payable as of right.  It  is  the

contention  of  the Government that  in  order  to

achieve the common purpose of accelerated economic

growth, trade unionists should, in future, clearly

recognise   the  distinction  between  wages   and

incentive payments like bonus. Wages are  what  is

regarded  as fair reward on the basis of  what  an

average worker can command in the labour market. A

bonus is incentive payment to induce the worker to

do  more than what is normally expected of him  in

return for his ordinary pay. In this Bill there is

nothing  to  prevent workers from negotiating  for

better  wages if they feel they have  a  case  for

better  wages.  But it is not going  to  help  our

objective  of economic expansion if the  incentive

element  in bonus is maintained in theory but  not

in fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of sick leave, the provision in

the  Bill  was primarily intended to regulate  the

malpractice  of malingering. On this subject,  the

Member  for  Telok  Blangah relapsed  into  heart-rending  melodrama about whether the Minister  had

miraculous powers to command broken legs  to  heal

within   the  period  prescribed  by   the   Bill.

Unfortunately,  I  have none but  I  have  a  near

substitute   for   it.  This  is   the   Workmen's

Compensation  Ordinance. The  hon.  Member  should

know that injuries sustained in the course of work

are governed not by this Bill but by the Workmen's

Compensation  Ordinance. I would strongly  suggest

that  in  the  case  of  broken  bones  and  other

injuries, trade unionists



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>



would do well to invoke this Ordinance and not the

non-existent miraculous powers of the Minister  to

heal the sick and the maimed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, some Members appear to have forgotten

that the existing labour legislation provides  for

only  28  days' sick leave irrespective of whether

hospitalisation is necessary or not, and therefore

the total number of days provided in this Bill  is

no  different  from  the  provisions  in  existing

legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, we are a reasonable

Government.  We  have no wish to railroad  through

those  provisions  of  the Bill  to  which  strong

objections  have been taken by some  hon.  Members

and   to  which  they  have  proposed  their   own

amendments.   I  refer  to  the  four   amendments

proposed  by the Member for Bukit Ho Swee - namely,

to clauses 15, 44, 46 and 47. What I propose to do

with  your  permission, Mr Speaker, is to  debate

these  4  clauses and the amendments at  Committee

stage  but  move to postpone voting on them  until

the next sitting of Parliament. This will give the

Government   time  to  consider  fully   all   the

implications  of  the proposed  amendments  before

accepting, rejecting or modifying them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Ho Swee has also moved an

amendment  to  clause 53. Hon.  Members  are  also

aware  that subsequent to the hon. Member's notice

of amendment, I have also given notice that I will

move an amendment to that clause. I will deal with

this  matter  when  we  discuss  this  clause   in

Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill has, not unexpectedly, provoked

considerable debate and has, no doubt,  helped  to

dispel  the  imaginary fears and unfounded  alarms

based  largely on misconceptions and  ill-informed

rumours.  I am not denying that this Bill  demands

painful  adjustments on the part of some  workers,

but  for  the  vast  majority  of  them  and,   in

particular,  the blue-collar workers,  it  confers

rights and opportunities which they did not  enjoy

before. However the major objective of the Bill is

to enhance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>



prospects for rapid economic growth and with it  a

political   and  economic  stability  capable   of

resisting  the  buffetings  Singapore   could   be

subjected to in the next few years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am convinced, Mr Speaker, that even those who

are  now  critical  of  this  Bill  will,  in  the

nineteen  seventies, be thankful that as a  result

of  the inoculation administered through this Bill

our economy will have acquired sufficient immunity

against such calamities as it may be exposed to in

the years ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the negative aspect of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Positively, whether there are calamities or not,

this Bill will accelerate economic growth and make

more  certain not merely Singapore's survival  but

also  its  capacity to prosper and  advance  as  a

modern  technological, industrialised society.  We

would  not be merely a society struggling to  keep

afloat  in a twentieth century world but we  would

be   of   the  twentieth  century.  We  would   be

intellectually  and  technologically  equipped  to

move  smoothly  and  confidently  with  the  other

advanced societies into the twenty-first century.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is only one of the many planned long-term measures to prepare our people to face the

ever-changing future. We have repeatedly said that

our purpose is not to encourage our people to join

our  ancestral past; to rummage in the dustbin  of

the  past to find models for our future; to revive

the  real  and  imagined glories of our  ancestors

because  we have not the capacity to build glories

of our own. Only a people without talents of their

own  and  without a creative spirit of  their  own

live with the dead, are overwhelmed by the present

and decimated by the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill should therefore be read in conjunction

with the other long-term changes we are making  in

the  social,  cultural, educational and  political

fields to infuse our people with new ideas and new

spirit  so  as  to enable them to  cope  with  the

problem  of  existence in the world of  today  and

tomorrow.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rapid economic modernisation cannot be achieved

on  the  basis  of  an unending ruthless  conflict

between  workers  and  employers,  for  this  must

eventually end in economic stagnation and chaos in

which all, including employers and workers, become

the tragic victims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill gives a new basis for employer-employee relationship. It seeks to ensure the

prosperity of both in one common goal -  sustained

economic  expansion  and rapid industrial  growth.

The   sectional   interests  of   both   must   be

subordinated to this central goal. Conflict  there

always  will  be, but workers and  employers  must

realise that conflict must not be carried  to  the

point where the economy as a whole is immobilised.

There  must  be acceptance of the fact that  wages

and  profits  can increase only  so  long  as  the

enterprise on which both are dependent  grows  and

expands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill tries, in so far as a Government can,

to  give  legislative encouragement  to  this  new

outlook.  But  legislation,  by  itself,  is   not

enough.  Workers and employers must themselves  be

imbued  by  this outlook. Only then can this  Bill

produce the results expected of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

committed to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Rajaratnam].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps for the guidance of

Members,  I  may  indicate what I propose  to  do.

Where  there  are groups of clauses  to  which  no

amendments  have been tabled, I will  merely  call

the numbers of the clauses out. If any hon. Member

wishes  a  debate on a particular  clause  I  have

called, he will have to give me some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>



indication of his desire. I will pause and propose

a separate Question on that clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 1 stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> The Short

title  and commencement of a Bill do not  commonly

come up for debate. I cannot think of any occasion

when it did.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment Bill repeals and re-enacts, with

amendments, the Labour Ordinance, 1955, the Clerks

Employment   Ordinance,   1957,   and   the   Shop

Assistants Employment Ordinance, 1957.  I  support

the introduction of a unified employment Bill. For

the  interest and benefit of hon. Members  of  the

House  who  were then not even in their  political

cradlehood, I wish to say that nine years ago,  in

1959,   leaders  of  the  Singapore  Trade   Union

Congress,  the  predecessor of the  N.T.U.C.,  did

recommend the unification of the labour laws. From

the  speeches  of some hon. Members,  I  have  the

impression  that  the N.T.U.C. is criticising  the

Employment Bill because of vested interests.  This

is not true. The N.T.U.C. fully supports a unified

employment  Bill, but it opposes some of  the  new

provisions in this Employment Bill in the interest

of workers at large, whether they are organised by

the  N.T.U.C. or outside the N.T.U.C. fold.  The

N.T.U.C. itself had recommended the  introduction

of a unified employment Bill on several occasions.

But its plea went unheeded until now. This is many

years too late.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do agree that the Bill, when

passed by the House, should, with the exception of

certain parts, come into effect immediately in the

national  interest. For example, I  would  suggest

that  the  Government should put into  effect  the

provisions of clause 47 after it has directed  all

employers   and  trade  unions  to  work   out   a

productivity bonus scheme. That is all I  wish  to

say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, line 40, after "include", to insert

"any seaman, domestic servant, watchman or

security guard or".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this amendment is to exclude

seaman,  watchman,  or  security  guard  from  the

definition of "employee". The reason is that, as I

have  said  earlier  in reply to  the  Member  for

Kallang,  the  nature of the duties  performed  by

these categories of employees are not amenable  to

regulations by ordinary labour legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment is to provide for an omission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 4, line 5, to leave out "steel" and

insert "steam".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment is to remove a clerical error.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2, as amended, ordered to stand part of the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 to 8 inclusive ordered to stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 8, to leave out lines 4 to 6 inclusive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this amendment is to remove the

proviso  to  sub-clause (1) of  clause  9  of  the

Bill. The proviso to this sub-clause (1) of clause

9  lays  down  that a contract of  service  for  a

specified  period of four weeks or less  shall  be

deemed to be a contract for an unspecified period,

and  in  sub-clause (2) of the same clause  it  is

provided that a contract of service for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>



an unspecified period shall be deemed to run until

terminated by either party in accordance with  the

provisions  of  the Bill. Such a  contract  would,

therefore, under the provisions of sub-clause (2) ,

have to be terminated by notice even though it is,

in fact, a temporary contract of service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would mean that if a labourer was engaged

and  told  he  would  be  employed  for  one  day,

nevertheless, an employer would have to  give  him

one  full day's notice under paragraph (a) of sub-clause  (3) of clause 10, even before the employee

began  to work. Moreover, the employee in  such  a

case  would be getting two days' pay for one day's

work. This would be absurd and the deletion of the

provision  of  sub-clause  (1)  of  clause  9   is

designed to rectify this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There will be a consequential

amendment:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 8, line 3, to leave out the colon and

insert a full-stop.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9, as amended, ordered to stand part of the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 10 and 11 ordered to stand part of the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 9, line 9, after "service", to insert

"as an employee".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing clause 12 of the Bill enables a

minor,  that  is, a person below  the  age  of  21

years,  to enter into a contract of service either

as  an  employer or as an employee,  and  it  also

provides  that  no  contract of service  shall  be

enforceable  against a minor  and  no  damages  or

indemnity shall be recoverable from such a  person

in  respect of such contract of service unless  it

is for his benefit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst it is reasonable to protect the interest

of  a  minor  when he enters into  a  contract  of

service as an employee,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>



it  is considered unjustifiable to treat him in  a

different way from other employers when he  enters

into  a  contract  of service as an  employer.  In

fact, such unnecessarily favourable protection  to

the  minor in his capacity as an employer may well

lead  to  his  abusing his legal position  to  the

detriment  of his employees. The purpose  of  this

amendment is to confine the protection granted  by

this Bill to minors in their capacity as employees

only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12, as amended, ordered to stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 13 and 14 ordered to stand part of the

Clause 15 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 15 stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move the deletion of this clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With due respect to the explanation given

earlier  by  the Minister for Foreign Affairs  and

Minister for Labour, I still consider it necessary

to  delete  this clause. After all, employers  are

intelligent enough and it is up to them to  decide

whether to continue employing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>



employees who reach the age of 55. If an  employee

reaches  the  age of 55 and is of no  use  to  the

employer,  I  doubt  whether  the  employer  would

continue to engage him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 of the Bill is a new provision and did

not  exist  in any of the former three  Ordinances

which  this Bill consolidates. If this  clause  is

allowed to remain in the Bill, its effect will  be

to enforce compulsory retirement of persons at the

age  of 55. Sir, the ill effects of this provision

have  been severely criticised by most Members  of

the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst I concede that most of the collective

agreements  existing today contain  provisions  to

retire  employees at the age of 55,  I  feel  that

legislative  powers to achieve  the  same  purpose

will  put  fetters on both employer  and  employee

where  it  is  mutually  agreed  that  the  worker

concerned  should, at the request of the employer,

continue  to  render his services for any  special

reason.  I  understand that in Singapore  a  man's

economically active life stretches well  into  the

seventies.  Therefore, it is extremely  unwise  to

introduce compulsory legislative measures to see a

man out of job at the age of 55.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): The main objective of the Bill has

been  repeatedly stated by the Ministers and Back-benchers   to  be  an  increase  in  productivity.

Therefore,  employees who have  worked  long  must

necessarily  have  acquired a lot  of  experience.

With   this  experience  behind  them,  they   can

discharge  their duties efficiently. But  if  this

clause  is  passed, they will be forced to  retire

when  they reach the age of 55. How then  can  the

Bill attain its main objective? Although there  is

a  clause  to  retire workers at the  age  of  55,

employers  can  still make use of such  people  if

they so require. For instance, if the employee  is

still  useful  to  the  employer  because  of  his

experience and skill, he can continue to  work  by

being paid a salary of more than $750 a month,  as

stated  in  the  Bill. However, the employer  can,

with  the concurrence of the person concerned,  be

saved from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>



paying  income  tax. Therefore, I cannot  see  how

this provision can be implemented.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in my view, 55 years is not an old

age  to retire from work. I support the Member for

Bukit  Ho Swee for proposing the deletion of  this

clause.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

when I spoke on the Second Reading of the Bill,  I

said  that there are certain clauses which require

amendment. For example, I consider this  amendment

moved  by the Member for Bukit Ho Swee is  one  of

the  most important amendments, and I give him  my

full  support  on the following grounds.  Although

the  Government has already taken a long  time  to

consider  this  provision in the interest  of  our

nation  and in view of the difficulties  ahead  of

us,  we  are trying to solve this problem legally.

In  my  view, if this clause is passed, I  do  not

think  the  Government will get any  good  results

because there are certain problems on the question

of   age   which  require  careful  consideration.

Firstly, at the age of 55, a person is still  full

of  energy. In European countries, this is the age

at which people begin to get prosperous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that in Singapore, there is

a  law  to retire employees, especially Government

servants,  at  55 compulsorily. After  retirement,

many  of  these Government pensioners go into  the

private  sector for employment. If  we  pass  this

clause, these pensioners will not be able to enter

the private sector for further employment. In some

cases,  these people got married at a  rather  old

age  and their children are too young to take over

the  responsibilities of looking after the family.

So  if  workers are asked to retire at the age  of

55, at a time when their children are not able  to

shoulder the responsibilities of the family,  then

what  will happen to the family? We do not  expect

them  to live on water. Even if they have to  live

on  water, they have to pay 20 cents a gallon  for

it. So this is a very important factor to consider

in the context of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>



our society. Clause 15 affects not only individuals but also

the families of the persons affected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that at the present moment, the

Government has already stated that the citizens of Singapore

will in future be able to get the benefit of pensions or

their Central Provident Fund contributions to buy Housing

Board flats. This is , of course, very encouraging to the

workers. But if a worker should retire at 55 and live on his

C.P.F. contributions or pension, he will have no funds left

to pay for his house or flat. For example, if I begin to pay

instalments on a flat at the age of 45 and continue paying

for it for 15 years, and if I retire at 55, then I have only

10 years of working life. How am I going to pay the

instalments on my flat after my retirement at 55? This is

another factor that we should consider.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of all this, I think the Government should

accept our views.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary of the Minister for

Labour(Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Mr Speaker, sir, just to correct a

mis-statement of fact. I think a gallon of water does not

cost 20 cents!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am quite prepared to

accept the assurances by the Member for Bukit Ho Swee. But

people at the age of 70 obviously relapse into a second

childhood. However, I have already indicated that there are

certain clauses on which the Government needs time for

consideration, and this is one of them. Sir, may I formally

move?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Before the Minister moves postponement of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 38 -

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<pre>

                 In page 17, to leave out lines 11 to 23 inclusive

             and insert -

                 "(2) Any employee who at his own request works

             for an employer on a rest day shall be paid for that

             day at not less than the ordinary rate of pay for one

             day's work.



Ord. 26           (3) Any employee who at the request of his

of 1955.      employer works on a rest day shall be paid an extra

             day's salary at the ordinary rate of pay for one

             day's work in addition to the ordinary rate of pay

             for that day.



                  (4) Subsection (3) of this section shall not

             apply to any employee who is employed by the

             Government or a statutory body in any of the

             essential services as defined under Part V  of  the

             Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance, 1955,

             but any such employee who at the request of his

             employer works on a rest day or part of a rest day

             shall be given a day or part of a day off, as the

             case may be, in substitution of  such a rest day or

             par thereof.".

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this amendment involves two points.

Firstly, as a matter of wording, the amendment is clearer

that the existing corresponding working of the Bill. The

main objective of this new wording is to avoid using the

expression "double the ordinary rate of pay" because, as

Members are aware, it is this expression which has in the

past led to the triple pay situation which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>



this Bill, among other things, is designed to abolish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point involves employees who are employed by

the Government or a statutory body in any of the essential

services as defined under Part V of the Criminal Law

(Temporary Provision) Ordinance, 1955. In respect of  to sub-

clause (3) of clause 38 of the Bill provides that if such

employee works on a rest day, whether it be for only one

hour, tow hours or any part of a rest day, then the employer

is bound to give the employee a full day off in substitution

for the employee's work on that rest day. The purpose of the

amendment is to provide that if such an employee works only

on part of a day, then the time off in substitution for his

work on a rest day shall be proportionate to the  period of

his work on that rest day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would emphasise, for the information of hon. Members,

that this latter amendment only affects employees employed

by the Government or statutory bodies in the essential

services defined by the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions)

Ordinance, 1955.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to comment on the proposed amendment by the Government

to clause 38 of the Employment Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 38 provides that employees of the government and

the statutory bodies are not to receive overtime payment for

working on a public holiday but to receive, instead, another

day off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendment by the Government goes further

by providing that such employees who are required to work

for one hour on a public hoiliday would be given one hour

off instead. This particular provision affects members of

the various statutory bodies, especially the daily-rated

employees who at present do not seem to be in  good standing

with the public because of their ill-considered and

irresponsible conduct in the past. But I am  most



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>



concerned that their interests might be unnecessarily

prejudiced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of the debate on the Employment Bill in

this House, I have the impression that Members approached

the question of overtime payment  compensation for overtime

work. But there is another aspect of overtime payment which

is equally important and that is, overtime payment as a

penalty on an employer against his making his employees work

overtime. The object of overtime payment in this respect is

to ensure that  an employer does not necessarily require his

employees to work late in the evenings on rest days and

public holidays. In the context of Singapore's economy, the

Bill not only provides for overtime payment but also

restrict overtime work to 48 hours per  month in order that

more employment opportunities may be created through an

employer obtaining more staff rather than making his

employees work more overtime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My objection, therefore, to the proposed amendments is

based on the following two grounds. Firstly, the Employment

Bill presupposes, in so far as overtime payment is

concerned, that the managerial and executive staff of

private establishments should be able to draw up a work

schedule in the establishments in such a manner as o

minimise over-time work. If such managerial and executive

staff fail to make sufficient  allowance for unforseen

contingencies or to engage sufficient workers, then the

penalty of overtime payment is incurred. But the Government

does not seem to have any confidence that similar grades of

employees may be able to discharge their administrative

function s without causing the Government servants and the

statutory board employees to incur unnecessary overtime

payment. The position becomes more ridiculous when it is

realised that the public daily-rated employees are entitled

to 11 public hoilidays both in the past and under the

present Employment Bill. A most pertinent question that may

be asked is, why does the Government find it necessary to

make such a provision for itself



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>



when it considers that the vital export-orientated

and  tourist  industries can  do  without  such  a

provision?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other ground of my objection is that the

provision  of the proposed amendment  is  patently

unfair  to  the  Government  and  statutory  board

employees  who  come  within  the  scope  of   the

Employment  Bill. An employee who is  required  to

work  one  hour or even ten minutes  on  a  public

holiday would find that the holiday is spoilt  for

him and his family. Giving him another hour or  10

minutes off on another day would never make up for

his  spoilt holiday. It is also true that overtime

payment for so working on a public holiday  cannot

make  up  for the spoilt holiday, but the overtime

payment  serves  as a compensation  which  can  be

utilised  by him and his family in many ways.  The

more  I  think  of  it, the  more  I  cannot  help

concluding that the amendment is intended to serve

as  an  easy way out for bureaucracy which is  too

lazy to provide, or is not up to the exacting task

of  providing,  for  unforeseen  contingencies  in

drawing  up  work rosters. For the  Government  to

move such an amendment is to compound the error of

bureaucracy that has gone crazy. May I request the

Hon. Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for

Labour  to  state categorically how this  time-off

during  holidays and public holidays and off  days

for one or two hours a day would be compensated in

the form of a day off in lieu of a working day?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already

explained  the main reasons for introducing  these

two amendments. However, the hon. Member for Telok

Blangah has raised one valid point, that it  would

be manifestly unfair to call upon a worker to work

during  a  holiday or on his day off  for  such  a

short  period  as  to nullify the compensation  he

might  have at some subsequent day of one  or  two

hours in lieu of his holiday. I would like to give

him  this  assurance, that my Ministry  will  give

administrative  directions whereby  employees  who

are  called upon to work on a holiday or rest  day

would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>



not be unreasonably made use of by asking them  to

come  to  work  for just one or two  hours.  Where

possible, and in fact in every case, it  would  be

that  they should work for a considerable part  of

the  holiday or part of the day on which they  are

called upon to work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the hon. Member that in

implementing  this provision, due regard  will  be

taken  to  ensure justice and fair  play  for  the

employees.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to speak about the

difficulties  in implementing this  provision,  as

has   been  explained  by  the  Member  for  Telok

Blangah.  For instance, in the Singapore Telephone

Board, workers are required to work on off-days or

public  holidays  for the whole day  in  order  to

repair technical faults. When they report for work

at 8.00 a.m. on a rainy day, the engineers at Fault

Control  may decide that it is useless  to  retain

them  up  to  5.00 p.m., because the repairing  of

faults cannot be carried out on rainy days.  These

workers  who have turned up for duty on rest  days

or  holidays are then asked to go home. Since they

have  been asked to wait for only two hours,  they

will   therefore  be  given  two  hours   off   in

substitution, which is unfair. There was also  one

occasion  where the Board employees were exploited

and  they were asked to work. How are such matters

to  be  rectified?  Can the Minister  for  Foreign

Affairs  and  Minister  for Labour  clarify  these

points?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say that

I  missed the first half of the translation but  I

assume  that  the second half is the substance  of

what  the  Member for Kampong Kembangan wanted  to

say. I am not aware of the particular case that he

has  mentioned  just now. But as I  said,  if  the

facts are true



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi:</b> It is true.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - then naturally there has been a

case  of  unjust dealings in this matter. If  such

instances come to light, they will be looked  into

and if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>



necessary there will be directions to ensure  that

this  provision is applied fairly  and  justly  in

regard to employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 38, as amended, ordered to stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 39 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 18, line 6, to leave out "or on a

holiday".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The removal of the words "or on a holiday" from

clause  39 is designed to avoid a conflict between

that clause and sub-clause (3) of clause 42 of the

Bill. Sub-clause (3) of clause 42 provides that an

employee may be required by his employer  to  work

on  a holiday. This is also the position under the

existing three employment Ordinances. On the other

hand,  through an inadvertence, the existing  sub-clause  (2) of clause 39 of the Bill also provides

that  an employer may require his employee to work

on   a   holiday   only   in   certain   specified

circumstances. This was not the intention, and the

deletion  of  the  words  "or  on  a  holiday"  is

designed  to  enable  the  existing  position   to

continue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 18, line 14, to leave out "and which is

not of a recurring character".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of leaving out these words is to

make the existing paragraph (e) of sub-clause  (2)

of  clause  39 workable. Under this paragraph,  an

employee may be required by the employer to exceed

his  normal working hours or to work on a rest day

or  holiday where there is an interruption of work

in   the  work  establishment  which  it  was  not

possible  to  foresee  and  which  is  not  of   a

recurrent   character.  This  might  well   create

difficulties. For example, an interruption of work

can  be due to a breakdown of machinery, and while

the  breakdown  cannot be foreseen,  it  may  well

recur. The removal of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>



the   words  specified  in  the  amendment  would,

therefore,  make  the provision of  paragraph  (e)

more practicable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 18, line 24, to leave out "this section"

and insert "paragraph (f) of this subsection".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this amendment is to provide that

the  proviso to sub-clause (2) of clause 39  shall

only  apply  to  paragraph (f) of  the  same  sub-clause. Paragraphs (a) to (f) of sub-clause (2) of

clause 39 set out the circumstances under which an

employer  can  require his  employee  to  work  in

excess of normal working hours or to work on  rest

days or holidays. The proviso provides that in the

event  of any dispute, the Commissioner for Labour

shall have the power to decide whether or not  the

employer  is justified in calling the employee  to

work  in the circumstances. It is considered  that

the circumstances set out in paragraphs (a) to (e)

cannot be made subject to the proviso.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the examples of the circumstances set

out  in  paragraphs (a) to (e) are work  essential

for  defence or security, work to be performed  in

the event of accidents, urgent work to be done  to

machinery or plant. Such work has to be done on an

urgent  basis  and cannot await the Commissioner's

decision  on whether the employer is justified  in

calling  upon  the  employees  to  work   in   the

circumstances.   Furthermore,  the   circumstances

listed  under paragraphs (a) to (e) are  also  not

restricted by such proviso in the existing  labour

legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph (f) of the same sub-clause provides

that  the  employee may be required by an employer

to  work  outside normal working hours or on  rest

days or holidays if the work to be performed is in

respect of any industrial undertaking essential to

the  economy of Singapore or any of the  essential

services  as defined under Part V of the  Criminal

Law (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance, 1955. It  is

obvious  that such circumstances can be determined

well in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>



advance if there is any dispute to that effect.

Hence it would be in order for the proviso to

apply to paragraph (f) .

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 44 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 21, line 37, to leave out "twenty-eight"

and insert "sixty".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 44 (1) (b) curtails the entitlement

of  paid sick leave of a worker to 28 days in each

year  in cases where hospitalisation is necessary.

Once  again,  I  must draw the attention  of  this

House  to  the  undesirability of this  particular

provision. Hospitalisation in the event of illness

is  not  a fringe benefit but a necessity for  the

proper care of a worker's health. The need  to  be

hospitalised is never at any stage determinable by

the  worker concerned, but by a competent  medical

authority   appointed   by   the   Government   of

Singapore.  Besides, as my various  colleagues  in

this   House   have  rightly  pointed   out,   the

accommodation facilities in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>



hospitals  in  Singapore are such  that  only  the

seriously  ill cases are admitted. The  length  of

stay   in  the  hospital  also  depends   on   the

seriousness of the illness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any provision in this Bill can be described

as harsh beyond imagination, I, for one, would say

that  it  is  this particular provision.  Even  in

freely  negotiated agreements,  I  have  not  come

across   any  employer,  whether  enlightened   or

unenlightened, foreign or local, who has  objected

to  a  longer  period  of  hospitalisation  leave.

Therefore, I urge the Government to give the  most

serious  consideration  to the  objections  raised

against  the  retention of this provision  in  the

Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already

clarified  at  length the justification  for  this

particular  provision. But, as  I  have  indicated

earlier, in view of certain points raised  by  the

Member for Bukit Ho Swee and other hon. Members, I

am  prepared to defer voting on this provision  to

give  the Government time to consider the Member's

proposal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok:</b> Sir, this will, of course,

include  consideration on  amendment  No.  (2)  of

clause  44  -  in page 21, line 42, to  leave  out

"fourteen"  and insert "forty-six" -  so  that  it

will be complete.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes. If the clause is postponed,

consideration   of   the   two   amendments   will

consequently be postponed. If you accept that, Mr

Seah,  will  you seek withdrawal of the  amendment

<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in order to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, "That further consideration of clause

44  be  postponed  to the first available  sitting

after 25th July, 1968." -- [Mr Rajaratnam].



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 45 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 46 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 22, line 36, to leave out "seven" and

insert "five".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 46 of the Bill states that retirement

benefits  arc confined to employees who have  been

in  continuous service with the same employer  for

seven years and more. We feel that this period  of

time is too long, particularly in view of the fact

that  employees in the private sector without  the

benefit of a collective agreement get nothing more

than    the   paltry   sums   saved   up   through

contributions  to the Central Provident  Fund.  No

doubt  the  Provident  Fund  benefits  are  to  be

increased  by  the  introduction  of  the  Central

Provident Fund (Amendment) Bill. Even then, it  is

felt  that  the  sum payable under the  C.P.F. on

cessation  of service is inadequate to sustain  an

employee   after  his  retirement.  Therefore,   a

reduction  in  the  period by  which  an  employee

becomes  eligible  for  retirement  benefit  would

necessarily  increase  the  quantum  by  a   small

margin.  I would urge the Government to  give  due

consideration  to  our views  on  the  matter  and

reduce the period to five years.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, in view of the statement I

have  made  earlier that this is  another  of  the

clauses  which  the Government  requires  time  to

consider, I would like to request that this clause

be  postponed  for consideration  at  some  future

time.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Seah, will you seek leave to

withdraw your amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok:</b> Sir, in order to enable further

up again for consideration.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, "That further consideration of clause

46 be postponed to the first available sitting

after 25th July, 1968." - [Mr Rajaratnam].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consideration of clause 46 postponed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 47 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 47 stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok:</b> Sir, I propose to move a new

clause.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Seah, the Question I have

proposed is that the clause do stand part  of  the

Bill. Obviously your intention is to speak against

the clause as it now stands. Perhaps you could for

the present confine yourself to the question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok:</b> Sir, I object to the clause

remaining as it is, because it is a well-known

fact that bonus is a matter that has been

negotiated between employers and employees. Taking

away the opportunity of the workers to negotiate

with the employers on the bonus issue, I think, is

most unfair and cannot be accepted by the workers

in Singapore, for the simple reason that the

payment of bonus is a traditional practice. Most

employers are quite willing to pay an annual

bonus. Therefore, I proposed that the clause as it

stands should be deleted.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Rajaratnam, is it your

intention to have consideration of this clause

postponed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In that event, I will withdraw the

Question and ask the Minister to move that further

consideration of the clause be postponed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, Mr Seah.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before the Minister moves that further consideration of the

clause be postponed, may I be allowed to proceed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>



further to give more arguments in support of  what

I have said earlier?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok:</b> Sir, in addition to what I have

already  said earlier, I would like  to  say  that

clause  47 is a provision dealing with the payment

of  bonus.  The clause, as it stands in the  Bill,

prohibits agreement on bonus payment in collective

agreements  though it makes it permissive  for  an

employer to grant a bonus or an ex-gratia  payment

commensurate  with the employer's  profits  as  an

incentive to an employee to increase productivity.

We  in  the  trade union movement, representing  a

class  of  employees whose contracts of employment

include receipt of a bonus or an ex-gratia payment

from  the  employer, oppose the provision removing

the   payment  of  bonus  from  the   purview   of

negotiability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonus has become an entrenched feature of the

salary  or wage structure of the employees in  the

commercial sector in Singapore. It has  been  made

payable  in the private sector not only  to  those

who  come  within the definition of "workman"  but

also  to  those who are categorised as executives.

Though  peculiar to this part of the world, bonus,

described as deferred payment of wages  or  as  an

incentive  payment related to profits, is  in  our

view    necessary   in   private   or   commercial

undertakings. If this is indeed the case, there is

every justification to say that bonus serves as an

incentive   to  higher  productivity   which,   in

reality,  would  mean  higher  profits   for   the

employers  and  overall economic  growth  for  the

nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general wage level in the private sector in

most  cases  is  lower than  that  in  the  public

sector. This, coupled with a high dependency ratio

of  population which is 1: 3, i.e, one worker has,

besides himself, to support three dependants,  the

payment  of  bonus is far from being  a  mere  ex-gratia concept. It is, in fact, part of a worker's

take-home  pay  which the employer should  not  be

allowed to vary at will.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides with the 1960 Price Index as a basis,

the Monthly Digest of Statistics now shows that in

1968  the  overall  increase  in  the  prices   of

essential  food  items  is  13.5  per  cent.   The

breakdown   percentage  increase   of   the   bare

essentials  to feed a family shows that vegetables

have  gone  up by 16 per cent in price,  fish  has

gone  up  by  25  per  cent, and  rice,  a  staple

commodity, has soared by a 31 per cent increase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If bonus as a deferred wage is made non-negotiable, how else can a worker ask for

adjustment  in wages to cope with the increase  in

the   cost  of  living  over  the  years   without

upsetting  agreed salary structures? If  bonus  is

not  to  be made negotiable, should it not in  the

circumstances,  at least, be incorporated  into  a

worker's  wages?  Even  the  Government,  as   the

largest  employer, has a cost of living allowance,

ranging  from  between 25 and 35  per  cent,  thus

increasing the quantum of take-home pay as opposed

to   basic  salary.  So  far,  our  experience  in

collective bargaining with the employers has shown

that  managements'  decisions  on  wages  or  wage

scales are made in terms of total wage costs which

include, among other things, bonus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other view on this matter is bonus as an

incentive  to higher productivity by  workers.  In

return  for  this  higher productivity,  they  are

given a share in the profits. Indeed, the trend in

Singapore over the last few years has been towards

the  emergence of a pattern consistent  with  this

proposition  of an equitable share in the  profits

of  the undertaking. In our representations to the

Government,  we have made it very  clear  that  we

subscribe,  on  the ground of social  justice,  to

their  idea  that  bonus be tied  to  profits  and

productivity  where this is indeed possible.  But,

for practical reasons, and to avoid indiscriminate

and  arbitrary  demand  of bonus  payment  by  the

workers,  the  Government has declined  to  accept

that proposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution is certainly not to remove the item

from   the   ambit  of  negotiability  altogether.

Indeed,  we  have thought of a formula  that  will

cause the minimum



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>



of  hardship  both  to  the employer  and  to  the

workmen.  Since  bonus is the key to  productivity

the  achievement of which is an important national

purpose, we suggest that a legislative maximum  be

fixed for bonus as a negotiable issue, leaving the

payment of the quantum over and above this maximum

to the goodwill of the employers based on profits,

productivity and incentive schemes.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,   I   have  some  doubts  on  the  N.T.U.C.'s

suggested amendment to the provision on bonus.  Is

there   any   difference  between   the   proposed

amendment and the original provision in the  Bill?

It  appears  that  there is  not  much  difference

between  the two; to me, they are just  the  same.

According  to  the suggestion of  the  Member  for

Bukit  Ho  Swee,  the trade unions will  negotiate

with  the  employers on the payment of bonus  but,

ultimately, the employers will have the  right  to

decide  whether  or not to give a  bonus.  I  feel

there  is not much difference between the original

provision in the Bill and the proposed amendment.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

firstly,  I  wish  to express my regret  that  the

Government  is attempting to withdraw the  payment

of  bonus from the field of collective bargaining.

I have already fully expressed my views during the

Second Reading of the Bill, but now I wish to draw

the  attention  of the House to certain  important

facts regarding this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is that the Industrial Relations

Ordinance,   1960,  as  it  stands,   allows   the

Industrial  Arbitration Court to  make  awards  on

bonus  under  section 40. The law, as  it  stands,

allows  bonus to be a negotiable matter, something

which  you  can  dispute in court.  It  is  really

disheartening  to  note that  the  Government  now

proposes to withdraw this matter from the  purview

of  the  court. This proposal upsets  the  workers

very  much.  The  Industrial Relations  Ordinance,

1960, was drawn up and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>



introduced just after the Government came to power

in 1959. Surely the Government has not changed its

views since then.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In view of the Minister's

indication  that  he desires to have  this  clause

postponed, do I have the general assent of Members

to withdraw the Question that I proposed earlier?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, "That further consideration of clause 47

be  postponed  to the first available  sitting  of

Parliament    after    25th   July,    l968."-[Mr

Rajaratnam].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consideration of clause 47 postponed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 48 to 52 inclusive ordered to stand part

of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 53 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 25, after line 3, to add -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(2) The provisions of this section shall not

apply where the terms of service under which a

person is employed are provided for in collective

agreement entered into before the corning into

operation of this Act and while such collective

agreement remains in force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection

(1) of this section it shall not be an offence for

an  employer  to  grant to his employee  terms  of

service  relating  to leave more  favourable  than

those  contained in sections 43  and  44  of  this

Act."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention of the Government is to make the

terms  and conditions of service provided in  Part

IV   of  the  Bill  the  norm  of  conditions   of

employment  in  respect  of collective  agreements

entered  into  after the coming into operation  of

the  enacted  Bill.  After the Bill  becomes  law,

collective  agreements, other than existing  ones,

cannot deviate from the provisions of Part IV  in

respect of terms and conditions of service  except

to  the  extent provided under clauses 43  and  44

relating to leave.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention, in respect of sick leave and

annual  leave, is that it shall not be an  offence

for an employer to grant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>



more  favourable  terms than  those  contained  in

clauses 43 and 44. The purpose of the amendment is

to clarify this further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

comment  on  the Government's amendment  vis-a-vis

the  amendment tabled by the Member for  Bukit  Ho

Swee to clause 53 of the Employment Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's reason for making this

amendment  is  apparently to give  effect  to  the

intention  of the amendment. There is  no  denying

that  the  Government's amendment is  logical  and

valid in relation to what the Government seems  to

construe as the intention of the amendment  tabled

by the Member for Bukit Ho Swee. But our intention

is  not  so much to make clause 53 restrictive  to

the  application of Part IV of the Employment Bill

as  to ensure that an employer does not use clause

53  as  a  pretext for not granting his  employees

more favourable terms and conditions of service in

relation  to  Part IV of the Employment  Bill.  In

retrospect, it would appear that even the  wording

of   our  amendment  does  not  reflect  our  true

intention.  I  must admit here that to  a  certain

extent  we  have  been confused by the  widespread

publicity given in advance by the local  press  on

the  proposed  Employment Bill and the  Industrial

Relations (Amendment) Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time we drew up our proposed amendment to

clause  53  of the Employment Bill, we were  under

the   distinct  impression  that  the   Industrial

Relations   (Amendment)  Bill  would   contain   a

provision    cutting   across    all    collective

agreements, whether existing or otherwise. It  was

in  anticipation of such a radical provision  that

we  decided to move an amendment to clause  53  of

the  Employment Bill to ensure that in  two  areas

where  the collective agreements contain far  more

favourable benefits than are provided for  in  the

Bill itself, workers would still continue to enjoy

their  benefits  after  the  Industrial  Relations

Ordinance  has  been amended. But when  we  had  a

closer look at the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>



Industrial  Relations (Amendment) Bill  which  was

introduced on Wednesday, 10th July, 1968, we found

that  our amendment ran contrary to the Industrial

Relations  (Amendment) Bill by  being  unduly  and

unnecessarily restrictive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Industrial Relations (Amendment)

Bill  provides that collective agreements covering

workers in specified industries established  after

1st  January,  1968, shall not contain  terms  and

conditions of service more favourable than Part IV

of  the  Employment Bill. But the  effect  of  our

amendment to clause 53 of the Employment Bill  and

the Government's amendment vis-a-vis the amendment

to  be moved by the Member for Bukit Ho Swee is to

prohibit   all   collective  agreements,   whether

covering   workers  in  the  specified  industries

established after 1st January, 1968, or otherwise,

from  containing terms and conditions  of  service

more favourable than all the provisions, excepting

clauses  43  and 44, of Part IV of the  Employment

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the power of the Minister to approve

the  provisions  in  a collective  agreement  more

favourable  than  Part IV of the  Employment  Bill

seems to be exercisable only in cases where clause

7  of  the  Industrial Relations (Amendment)  Bill

applies. Such specific reference to the Minister's

power  to grant exemptions in relation to Part  IV

of  the  Employment Bill and to clause  7  of  the

Industrial  Relations (Amendment)  Bill  can  only

denote  that  the  over-riding  intention  of  the

Government in respect of the Employment  Bill  and

the  Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill  is  to

ensure  that  the  export-orientated  and  tourist

industries  in  Singapore are not hamstrung  by  a

continuously   increasing  level  of   terms   and

conditions of service of the employees engaged  in

such industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Government by its subsequent notice of

amendment finds it desirable to give better effect

to  our intention as expressed in the amendment to

be  moved by the Member for Bukit Ho Swee, I  wish

to  avail myself of the opportunity to clarify the

correct



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>



intention underlying our amendment to clause 53 of

the  Employment  Bill. If the  Government  has  no

objection,  may  I  suggest  that  the  expression

"sections 43 and 44" appearing in the fourth  line

of  sub-clause (3) proposed to be added to  clause

53  of  the  Employment Bill be deleted,  and  the

expression "Part IV" be inserted in place thereof?



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such an amendment would give effect to the true

intention behind our amendment to clause  53  and,

at the same time, remove a clear and unintentional

discrepancy between the provisions of clause 53 of

the  Employment Bill and those of clause 7 of  the

Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill.

this  clause  is far more comprehensive  than  was

intended.  So  I am afraid that,  as  far  as  the
