<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>



which he delivered on behalf of the Government at the Opening

of  the  First Session of this Parliament.". - [Mrs Lim  Hwee

Hua].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Health and the Environment (Dr Balaji Sadasivan): Mr Speaker, Sir, I speak in support of

the Motion of Thanks to the President.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is at the crossroads in its history. The

crisis  we face is in part the result of forces that we  have

no  control over.  These forces were responsible for our past

success.  They are responsible for our present recession; and

if managed correctly, they will bring us future prosperity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first force is the force of the free market. In

historical  terms,  the  force  of  the  free  market  is   a

relatively  new force.  When kings and queens controlled  all

the  factors  of production, there was no free market.   Only

when  individuals  had  the right  to  private  ownership  of

wealth, no matter how little or how much the wealth was,  did

the free market emerge as a force.  Industrialisation and the

division of labour greatly amplified its power.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last century has shown us that the free market is

the   most  efficient  way  of  organising  the  factors   of

production and producing wealth.  The collapse of the  Soviet

Union  is  proof of the inefficiency of centrally  controlled

economies.  The recent rapid prosperity of China is proof  of

the  effectiveness  of free market principles  in  generating

wealth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people of a common culture are divided by an

accident  of  history,  and one half follows  a  free  market

economy  and  the other half a centrally controlled  economy,

the  free  market economy has always performed better.   West

Germany was more prosperous than East Germany and South Korea

is more prosperous than North Korea.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore by embracing the free market system and by

having one of the most open economies in the world has become

an  affluent nation.  However, the free market system is also

responsible for our current recession.  We can react in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>



two  ways.   The  first approach is to try and ringfence  our

economy and preserve the status quo.  Our economy will remain

preserved,  frozen  in  time, but the  world  will  move  on.

Twenty years from now, foreigners will find us quaint.   Just

as we often remark when we are in less developed countries  - this  is how Singapore used to be in the 60s - they will  say

this is how their country used to be in the 90s.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or we take the second approach and look at the recession

as  an opportunity to allow the free market to reorganise our

economy  so that we will be more efficient and will  enter  a

period  of  growth in the 21st century.  We must  not  expect

that  when we come out of this recession, things will be like

they  used  to  be in the mid-90s.  Our economy will  change.

Like the mature economies of the world, there will be a shift

from a manufacturing-based economy to a more service-oriented

economy.   Like  the  mature  economies,  our  dependence  on

construction must decrease.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the 1980s, I lived in the United

States  for  five  years in the State of  Michigan,  about  a

minute's drive from the World Headquarters of General  Motors

and  about  15 minutes' drive from the World Headquarters  of

Ford  Motors.  The output of these two companies  is  greater

than  the  GDP  of  Singapore.  The 1980s were  a  period  of

anguish  for  many Americans.  The Japanese economy  appeared

strong  and many contemplated a future where Japan  would  be

the premier country of the world.  A Japanese corporation had

purchased  that  icon  of New York - the Rockefeller  Center.

Many   thought  the  American  auto  industry  would  perish.

Instead  of  protecting  the auto industry,  the  US  allowed

market forces to restructure the industry.  The auto industry

was  forced to make better cars more efficiently and  by  the

1990s, the American auto industry was again the strongest  in

the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, it is the Japanese auto industry that is in

trouble.  Nissan required a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>



foreigner  to  restructure  and save  the  company.   Japan's

reluctance  to allow restructuring of its economy  after  its

bubble  economy  burst has hindered its  recovery.   We  must

avoid the mistakes that Japan has made.  To recover from this

recession, we must further deregulate and allow market forces

to make us more efficient.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second factor that we have no control over is

globalisation.  The search for profits has made globalisation

a  powerful  force.  It was the desire of Europeans  to  make

huge  profits from the spice trade that drove them to explore

the  world,  discover America and circumnavigate  the  world.

Since  then, the world has become inter-linked and we  cannot

escape globalisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider the fate of the African living in his village

in  the  17th  century.  European taste for sugar  fuelled  a

triangular  trade whereby trinkets from Europe were  sold  in

Africa  for African slaves who were then transported  to  the

Caribbean to be worked to death to grow sugar, which would be

sold  in  Europe for huge profits.  Whether globalisation  is

morally  good or bad is for philosophers to decide, but  like

the   African   in  the  17th  century,  we   cannot   escape

globalisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is new, however, is the degree to which the

political and economic fates of countries are becoming inter-linked   and   the  speed  at  which  globalisation   affects

countries.   Just  imagine, Osama sitting in  his  office  in

Afghanistan reviewing the videos of Yishun MRT and the  World

Trade Center in New York.  Because he chose to strike in  New

York,  we  were spared death and destruction.   On  September

11th,  I  was  watching CNN.  The first  plane  had  hit  the

towers.  The instant I saw the second plane hit the building,

I  knew it was a terrorist attack.  So did millions of others

across the world who viewed CNN.  This is the speed at  which

information moves across the globe today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Enron collapsed, dragging Arthur Andersen into the

controversy,  within  days, our honest Singapore  accountants

working under the Arthur Andersen



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>



umbrella had to consider merging with other firms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globalisation brought the electronics industry to

Singapore  because  it was efficient to locate  the  industry

here.   Globalisation is taking many of  these  factories  to

China  and  elsewhere  because it is  more  efficient  to  be

located there.  We cannot fight globalisation.  What  we  can

do  is to find a new niche in the global market where we  are

efficient and where we have an edge in competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third force is the progress in the application of

science.   Discoveries in science by themselves may  have  no

impact.   But  when  they are applied, they  can  change  the

course of history.  The Chinese discovered gunpowder but  the

application  of gunpowder to cannons by the Ottomans  brought

the  collapse  of Constantinople and changed  world  history.

Although the transistor was invented in the United States, it

was  Sony  and  other Japanese companies that  were  able  to

exploit   its   applications  and  have  dominated   consumer

electronics ever since.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last two decades have seen a revolution in applied

science  due  to  the mass introduction of computers  in  the

workplace  and  in  the home.  We must  be  thankful  to  the

Economic  Development Board for seeing the potential  in  the

computer  industry  and  bringing the  computer  industry  to

Singapore.  But as the computer industry plateaus, we need to

look  for  a  new niche where advances in the application  of

science will fuel growth.  The life sciences is an area  that

Singapore should consider.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Government cannot control the three forces

I  described,  the  Government must play an  active  role  to

complement  and  manage  these  forces  for  the  benefit  of

Singapore.   I  believe  there  are  three  areas  where  the

Government has a major role.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first area is with regard to the civil service and

the statutory boards.  Our civil servants and statutory board

employees  are men and women of integrity working  diligently

in the service of the nation.  But



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>



these  institutions are shielded from the forces of the  free

market.   Yet,  they  too must restructure  and  become  more

efficient or they may gradually become what Bertrand  Russell

called  "a  collection of officials, different for  different

purposes, drawing comfortable incomes", happy "so long as the

status quo is preserved."  It is Parliament's duty, those  on

the  Frontbench and those on the Backbench, who  must  ensure

that  the civil service and statutory boards remain efficient

and give the people the maximum at the minimum cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area where the Government must act is to

reduce  the  real  difficulties faced by our  citizens  as  a

result  of the recession and restructuring.  We must  do  our

best to help people through this period.  However, we must be

careful  not to create a welfare state and avoid  creating  a

dependency  culture  in  our citizens.   We  should  consider

Abraham   Lincoln's   advice:  "In  all   that   people   can

individually do as well for themselves, government ought  not

to interfere."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area where the Government should act is to see

how we can utilise the economics of QWERTY, spelt Capital  Q,

W, E, R, T, Y, to help us.  If you look at your keyboard, the

keys at the upper left corner are Q, W, E, R, T, Y.  When the

typewriter  was first invented, the machine would  often  jam

when  the  operator  typed too fast.   So  the  keyboard  was

designed  to be as inefficient as possible.  Today  keyboards

do  not  jam, but we continue to use the same format for  the

keyboard,  even  though it is inefficient.   Economists  like

Paul  David  call this, the law of positive  returns  or  the

economics of QWERTY after the keyboard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see examples of QWERTY all around. The IT

industry began in the Silicon Valley through the foresight of

Stanford University.  Today, all those interested in  the  IT

industry  still  continue to converge to the Silicon  Valley,

even  though  it is one of the most expensive places  in  the

United States.  Likewise, the entertainment industry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>



gravitates  to Hollywood.  Even Chinese films like  Crouching

Tiger,  Hidden  Dragon and Indian films like Lagaan  look  to

Hollywood for approval at the Oscars as this translates  into

millions of dollars in the global film market.  Patients from

around  the  world travel to a small town in  the  middle  of

wheat  fields  in Minnesota to see the doctors  of  the  Mayo

Clinic.   These  are examples of QWERTY where an  established

practice gives a place a competitive advantage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About a month ago, I was introduced to a former Indian

Minister  who  is  now a top lawyer.  He  came  to  Singapore

because an Indian company had a dispute with an Indian  State

government.  The arbitration was being conducted in Singapore

because  it  is  becoming  an established  practice  in  many

contracts  in  India to choose Singapore as  a  location  for

arbitration for disputes.  I was greatly encouraged by this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has a brand name. If we can create a pattern

where people within seven hours flying time come to Singapore

for  services in education, health, insurance, banking,  law,

research,   entertainment,  the  arts,  shopping  and   other

services,  these patterns will self-perpetuate and get  fully

established.   Then, even if we are a high cost  centre,  the

economics of QWERTY will work in our favour because  we  will

have  a  competitive  edge as established  patterns  tend  to

persist.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are at the crossroads. The people

of  Singapore  are pragmatic.  They know there  are  no  easy

solutions to difficult problems.  They do not pine for a lost

past  that  will  not come back.  We, Singaporeans,  are  the

children of tough and hardy immigrants.  Survival is  in  our

genes.   If we, people and Parliament, see the future not  as

one  full  of  problems  but as one  full  of  opportunities,

opportunities for us to seize for our benefit,  we  can  make

Singapore one of the greatest cities of the 21st century.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise in support of the motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President in his Address highlighted that as we

upgrade  the  economy  we must maintain  and  strengthen  our

social   cohesion.   Our  income  distribution   is   already

stretched  out.   At  the  lower end of  our  society,  those

without skills have difficulty raising their incomes or  even

finding jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the tasks of the Economic Review Committee is to

look  at how to lower business costs.  I think we pay greater

attention  to  business  costs  because  businessmen  are   a

powerful group and they power the economy.  I would urge  the

Government to go further and see whether the overall costs of

goods  and  services can be relooked in Singapore.   I  would

like to urge the Government to set up a committee to see  how

cost of living in Singapore can be reduced further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I meet and interact with many residents in

Singapore.  In my meetings with my constituents, it is  clear

that they are concerned with managing their lives on a day-to-day basis.  For many low income families, the daily challenge

is  not only about the cost of living, but actually the  cost

of  survival  in  Singapore.  Many are struggling  to  upkeep

themselves and their families.  I am confident that there are

many  areas in the provision of Government goods and services

where we can further lower our charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many areas of expenditure where we can

undertake a detailed audit of what is the real cost and  what

is  being charged by the various Government departments.  For

example,  I  was  pleasantly surprised when the  Registry  of

Companies  launched a new fees structure for registration  of

new  companies  from a minimum of $1,200  to  $300  recently.

Similarly, for a business registration, it has come down from

$55  per  year to $105 for three years.  I am sure there  are

many  other Government departments where there can be greater

transparency  on  what is the real cost  and  what  is  being

charged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, many statutory bodies must become more

transparent on what they charge and what is their true  cost.

Can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>



some  of  the  key  goods  and service  providers,  like  the

Ministry  of  Health, Ministry of Home Affairs,  Ministry  of

Trade  and  Industry, including the Ministry of  Information,

Communications and the Arts, become more transparent on their

costs  and  charges so that we can better understand  whether

the  Government  departments are recovering cost  or  whether

they  are  profiteering marginally or grossly?  This  becomes

even  more necessary when the goods or services are  provided

by  a monopoly.  In fact, Sir, I take on and support the call

by   the  Minister  of  State  who  spoke  earlier  that  the

Government  must  provide  services  and  goods  for  maximum

benefit  at  minimum  cost.  But  somehow  that  is  not  the

impression among many members of the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do hope that many statutory boards and Government

autonomous  bodies can adopt such accounting  disclosures  so

that the true cost and revenue picture is well understood  by

the public.  It will certainly help to restrain some of these

organisations and moderate what they charge the public.  I am

convinced  that some departments charge what the  public  can

pay  rather  than what is cost recovery or even a  reasonable

return.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently, IRAS sounded out getting charitable

organisations  to  disclose  their  income  and   expenditure

statement of charitable organisations.  It will also  require

disclosure  about the top three salaries of their  employees.

I  am  very  sure that it is a positive move as  many  donors

would like to know how their donations are being used.  If we

can  start  setting  benchmarks on how public  donations  are

being used, I am sure that the Government can set even higher

standards on the cost and revenue for each service and  goods

it provides to the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many who are keen to know how much does

Traffic Police charge for a police report as against the true

cost of providing such a service.  Some want to know how much

is  the cost of medicine to our hospitals as against what the

particular hospital charges the public.  I am confident  that

such public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>



scrutiny  about  our Government and quasi-Government  bodies'

income and expenditure will encourage them to be sensitive as

to  how they can charge the public.  I am concerned as  I  am

convinced that there are several Government departments  that

may  be profiteering in the provision of some public services

as against working on a cost recovery basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would similarly like to urge the NTUC, as the key

provider  of  many  services  to  the  public,  to  similarly

disclose  to the public where it is possible on what  is  the

cost  of their services and goods they provide to the  public

and  their  union members.  NTUC FairPrice, for example,  can

disclose to the public on how much they subsidise the  public

by  disclosing  the purchasing and operating  costs  and  the

selling  price.  Perhaps, such public disclosure would  allow

the  public to better appreciate the subsidy or profit  being

made by our Government department or NTUC in the provision of

goods and services.  I am confident that this is also an area

where  CASE can play a useful role in looking into the  areas

highlighted  and  work towards reducing the prices  of  these

goods and services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my hope is that the Government will not only lower

costs  for  businesses but also for all  Singaporeans.   This

will   certainly   go   a  long  way  in   helping   ordinary

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to my second topic on relations with

our  neighbours.   Sir, the President has  spoken  succinctly

when he stated that our own region has fundamentally altered.

Our two immediate neighbours are facing different challenges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia is still on the course of finding stability in

many  areas.  We have seen the change of three Presidents  in

three years and the emergence of hitherto hidden but powerful

forces.  Their foreign and economic policies will be strongly

dictated by a myriad of political parties and leaders and the

need  to  soothe an increasingly stronger Muslim  electorate.

Compounding the problem is the emergence of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>



media  as  a  new  power in Indonesia.  The  media  is  still

groping  on  the  markers between absolute  free  speech  and

responsible  journalism.  Important issues are commented  and

debated according to the political flavour of the day and the

political affiliations of the media.  Fortunately,  our  ties

are deep and our friendship network is extensive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am happy that we have helped and continue to help

Indonesia recover economically.  The participation of GIC  in

the  purchase of assets by IBRA, the government-to-government

loan  assistance package, and recently the idea of  including

Bintan as an export corridor to the USA under the proposed US-Singapore FTA are laudable.  The actions will help show  that

Singapore is indeed a friend in need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must continue to remain engaged in a big way in

Indonesia.   It is a big and very large neighbour.   Although

some  Singaporeans  have turned negative about  investing  in

Indonesia,  we  must  never take our sights  from  Indonesia.

Sir,  regional autonomy offers tremendous business and  other

opportunities  to Singapore businessmen.  I  have  spoken  to

many Indonesians and many have highlighted of new investments

from  Europe, Japan and China into the provinces.  I  am  not

hearing much of substantial private Singapore investments  in

the  provinces.   I do hope that the Ministry  of  Trade  and

Industry  will  study  ways  to  help  Singapore  businessmen

explore  and invest in Indonesia.  My fear is that when  real

economic recovery returns to Indonesia, Singaporeans  may  be

too  late to join the bandwagon.  Let us not ignore  our  own

backyard  where we have a distinct advantage and  concentrate

on faraway markets where the competition may be greater.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Malaysia, it is the same old story. The

season  for  Singapore bashing used to be spread out  over  a

longer period of time.  Recently, the time gap appears to  be

narrowing.  The several by-elections there could be a factor.

Well,  the bad news is that analysts are predicting an  early

general  election  next  year.  The  media  in  Malaysia  has

dutifully



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>



done  its  part in portraying Singapore as the bad  boy  down

south.   Much as we ignore the Malaysian media, we must  also

understand that there is a whole new generation of Malaysians

who  get a regular dosage of anti-Singapore articles and news

reports.   Many  have  come to believe  that  many  of  these

articles and reports are true.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the latest issue on the land reclamation is a case

in  point.  What started out as a comment by someone has  now

snowballed  as  a serious issue for them.  Interestingly,  no

report  has  been  disclosed by the state  of  Johor  or  the

Federal  government on what exactly is the damage done.   The

newspaper  reports  faithfully the comments  by  politicians,

businessmen, academics, bureaucrats and even fishermen on the

effects of reclamation in Singapore.  What is clear from  the

press reports is that there is as yet no comprehensive report

on the matter.  The various reports are still being waited by

the central government.  Sir, their own government has stated

that  they  are  waiting for the reports  to  come  from  the

various authorities.  It may become embarrassing if later  it

transpires  that  (a)  the  reclamation  does  not   infringe

Malaysian  territory (which we already  know)  and  (b)  that

there  is  no  substantial damage to  Malaysia  in  any  way.

Having  taken a stance that the reclamation is damaging  even

before  the official reports have come in, clearly shows  the

mentality  of our Malaysian neighbours - "Shoot  first  -  we

will   find  a  reason  later".   Fortunately,  neither   our

Government  nor  Singaporeans are  rattled  by  this  present

rhetoric or past rhetoric.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is puzzling to me is what are the intellects in

Malaysia  thinking?   Are they wondering  why  the  Malaysian

government has not done a proper study on the matter earlier?

Were  their government leaders, politicians, bureaucrats  and

diplomats so inept and inefficient that they were unaware  of

these  reclamation works?  Mind you, these reclamation  works

are   well  publicised  in  advance.   In  some  cases,   the

reclamation project has been completed some years ago, eg, at

Tuas.  What then is the latest agenda of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>



Malaysians?  To tell us what we should do and not  do  within

our  territory?   To  rally their ground for  their  domestic

politics?   I really do not know and it may not be worth  our

time pondering over it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more puzzling is the new style of diplomacy that

is  emerging  in  Malaysia.  Whenever there  is  a  bilateral

issue,  the  position  there is to  use  the  media.   It  is

elementary  diplomatic  convention  that  relations   between

states are conducted through diplomatic channels.  There  are

proper  and  a range of diplomatic tools to raise matters  of

concern  between nations.  While one can forgive  small  time

politicians, bureaucrats, journalists and businessmen for not

understanding  the art and use of diplomacy,  it  puzzles  me

that  the lack of understanding reaches the upper echelon  of

the  Malaysian leadership.  Perhaps, we can offer  them  some

scholarships  to undertake academic programmes  in  diplomacy

and international law at some renowned universities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To compound the matter, the Malaysian press has been

unhelpful in publishing the truth when explanations are given

on  why  the reclamation will not impact or affect  Malaysia.

In  fact,  it gets no coverage at all.  I recall the  article

put  out  by  the  Straits Times on 30th  March  which  reads

"Reclamation will not hit shipping lanes".  It has yet to  be

reprinted  or published in Malaysia.  In fact,  to  show  the

attitude  of  the Malaysian press, let me just highlight  one

case.   The  New  Straits Times just last  week  deliberately

omitted  a  crucial paragraph that refuted  the  "underclass"

claim  in  an article about Malays in Singapore.  Well,  that

certainly  helps us to know where the Malaysian media  stands

on matters concerning Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in fact, if you want a joke, I picked up one last

week.   Malaysia's Berita Harian ran a comment by an  unnamed

retired  navy rear admiral that our reclamation had paralysed

a  Malaysian  navy centre in the Johor Straits.  The  article

stated that the

narrow   gap   between   the  two   countries   would   cause

sedimentation  over the next few decades.  This  would  allow

Singapore's amphibious military vehicles



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>



to  cross  into  Malaysia with ease.  When I first  read  the

article, I thought, "What a brilliant planner we had  in  the

SAF who was able to think decades ahead" because they alleged

that  in  a few decades we will be able to cross the  straits

through  this  process of sedimentation.  Then, I  reflected,

"But  are  they not making it easier for Malaysian amphibious

vehicles to come to Singapore with ease?", in which case, our

reclamation will end up helping the Malaysian Armed Forces to

fix Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe this is a game of reverse psychology or even a

case  of  poor logic or poor argument.  I do not  know.   But

what  one  can  think for sure is that this "tak  ada  logic"

barrage  from  across the Causeway will  continue.   What  is

clear is that there are many voices emanating from across the

Causeway.   By  the time it reaches us, it becomes  noise,  a

noise  we  have  gotten  used to  just  like  aircraft  noise

generated from time to time over Singapore.  They are a pain,

but  we have got used to it.  Our destiny is here and we have

to  do  business  here.  Let us continue to be  friendly  but

firm, respect each other and not denigrate each other, let us

discuss but not be talked to or talked down.  Let us work for

our mutual benefit and not for our mutual detriment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our Government has been doing right in treating our

Malaysian neighbour fairly but firmly.  We demand respect  as

a  sovereign  nation and we give them respect as a  sovereign

nation.   We  encourage investments and tourism in  Malaysia.

We  have  many  relatives and friends on both  sides  of  the

border.  We wish them well, for their prosperity augurs  well

for regional prosperity, as does ours for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is a small nation. We have been

successful  in finding a place under the sun for our  people.

We  must  work as a team and look beyond these problems.   We

should  leapfrog  and  establish our economic  and  political

links everywhere.  But we must remind ourselves that our home

base is here and we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>



learn  to live in this tough neighbourhood.  We have done  so

as  a nation for the past 37 years.  I am confident that with

a  sound Government, united people and a strong SAF,  we  can

meet these challenges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support again the Motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  rise in support of the Motion moved by Mrs Lim  Hwee

Hua  in thanking the President for his Address at the Opening

of this Tenth Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's Address focuses on our need to be

pragmatic  in the light of a dramatically changed  world  and

the   challenges   ahead  of  us.   We  are   indeed   facing

unprecedented economic competition from all fronts, as we now

emerge from last year's recession.  This is placing us in  an

increasingly  tight spot as our neighbours and  many  others,

particularly China, eye for the same economic pie.   We  must

sharpen  our  pencils  to find new avenues  to  preserve  our

competitiveness  while also holding our social  cohesion,  or

risk   becoming  irrelevant  in  this  increasingly   harsher

globalised world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, as competition spurs on us, we must always

bear in our subconscious that it is not a zero-sum game.   As

countries  in the region and beyond grow their economies  and

raise   their  standard  of  living,  there  will   be   more

opportunities created.  Some degree of interdependence on one

another  will create collaborative opportunities for  win-win

situations rather than being at loggerheads with each other.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our context, Sir, whether we collaborate or compete,

at  the  core  of it is ensuring that our goods and  services

provide the best value to our customers at home and the  rest

of  the  world.  We cannot, therefore, afford to rest on  our

laurels.   We must continue to strengthen our infrastructure,

continually  upgrade the knowledge and skills of our  people,

and take a critical review of Government policies to keep  us

economically competitive.  I am glad, Sir, that we  have  the

Economic  Review  Committee  and the  Remaking  of  Singapore

Committee in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>



place,  in  the light of many significant events  which  have

occurred  in the recent past, to deliberate on the future  of

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our people are our key assets, and it takes people to

bring  about  the  difference  we  are  seeking  in  remaking

Singapore,  I  would like, Mr Speaker, Sir,  to  address  two

people-related issues in our continuing effort to unleash the

best out of our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Sir, is the need to educate our people that the

real  challenges  before  us are  not  getting  out  of  this

recession per se, but to remake and re-engineer the Singapore

economy,  so that we remain competitive as a nation  and  are

able to secure good growth in the next decade and beyond.  To

face  the  uncertainty and the China challenge,  we  need  to

create an environment in which individuals and firms are more

willing  to take risks and succeed on the strength  of  their

capabilities   and   efforts,  rather  than   dependence   on

Government  subsidies and direction.  We must find  ways  and

means  to  encourage individuals and our  SMEs  to  look  for

opportunities  in  this  area  of  perpetual  motion  and  to

experiment  with  new  approaches in return  for,  hopefully,

higher rewards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know much of this is already being promoted by various

Government  agencies to evolve an enterprise-eco system.   In

addition  to these agencies, Sir, I suggest that the  various

chambers of commerce and industry, and even self-help groups,

be  also used as vehicles to help create greater awareness of

this  direction  we  need to take, not only  because  of  the

changing nature of employment contracts between employers and

employees   but   also  the  need  to   quickly   evolve   an

entrepreneurial  culture so that a wider base  of  successful

home-grown, smart and innovative companies could  be  created

to  help  propel  our  economy in the  longer  term.   It  is

understandable that this will not be easy and will take  many

years  to  evolve,  but we must start somewhere,  and  sooner

rather than later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The China threat has been quite often linked to this

subject.  Allow me, Sir, to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>



share  my  own  experience in doing  business  in  China.   I

started  my  manufacturing operation in the  Singapore-Suzhou

Industrial Park, or now better known as SIP in short, in 1996

as  a result of Mr Chan Soo Sen's strong persuasion then when

he  was  CEO  of SIP.  Since then, he and Mr David  Lim  have

subsequently  come  and  gone, and I  am  stuck  there.   The

"Suzhou  GRC" has disappeared.  Sales of my company's product

were  initially  slow, but have more than quadrupled  in  the

last  two  years.  I studied the order pattern of my  Chinese

customers  and discovered that much of these increased  sales

are from four companies which did not even exist when I began

in  1996.   The  owners are young professional  managers  who

chose  to leave the comfort of their jobs in search of bigger

opportunities.  Each of them is a qualified engineer and  has

smartly  used  consultants to draw up viable plans  and  used

their  consultants' network to obtain capital  infusion  into

their  respective  companies.  There  must  be  thousands  of

similar  successful ventures out there which are quietly  but

surely contributing to China's GDP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has done plenty to prepare us for

the  innovation and entrepreneurial age, but we  need  to  do

more  to  get  the  spirit  of  innovation,  enterprise   and

tolerance  for risk-taking to sink into our people  and  help

this  to  take  off.   I  see this as an  opportune  time  to

encourage  and  assist  many  mid-level  executives  who  are

displaced  as  a result of the recession and, more  recently,

from  the  banking  and  service sectors,  to  take  up  this

challenge.  Job matching programmes by CDCs and job  listings

in  MOM's  Employment Town websites have  limitations.   Many

executives still need help and have expressed frustration  in

not  being  able to find jobs.  As a further alternative,  we

should  reach  out  to this group as well as  promising  SMEs

through the various Government assistance schemes, and assist

the   deserving  ones  to  become  entrepreneurs.    Wherever

applicable, we should connect such individuals and firms with

credible  consultants who could help them package  meaningful

business plans and lead them to appropriate sources of funds.

Successful entrepreneurs should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>



be  more  regularly profiled in the media to spur  others  to

follow suit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now turn to my next subject matter

which  concerns the importance of maintaining  strong  social

cohesion and enhancing the spirit of caring and sharing.   We

survived  in the initial years of independence and  prospered

through the later decades because of the existence of such  a

spirit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, our younger generation today is growing up in

the  face  of  a  different set of challenges.   We  are  now

feeling  the pressures of living in a fundamentally uncertain

world.   We  have  to  make our living in this  unprecedented

rapidly   changing  environment  that  may   even   be   more

unpredictable than at any time since our independence in  the

60s.   The  September 11th incident in the US and the  recent

arrest of the Jemaah Islamiyah radicalists are examples which

come  to mind, which have dramatically affected the lives  of

people  the  world over.  These are realities which  we  must

face, whether we like it or not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we struggle to get ourselves out of recession and re-engineer our economy, it is also essential that we continue

with  the  need  to  strengthen  our  racial  tolerance   and

religious  harmony in the light of the incidents I  mentioned

earlier.   The Government has shown sensitivity  to  this  as

evidenced  by the timely call by the Prime Minister  for  the

creation  of  Inter-Racial Confidence  Circles  or  IRCCs  to

foster  inter-racial and inter-religious  rapport  among  the

different   communities   by  having   them   interact   more

frequently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the IRCCs, individuals, families and our

grassroots  organisations can also play an  active  role  and

should  not wait for Government initiatives to be  in  place.

They can organise activities to bring neighbours together  to

get  to know each other better and to create mutual care  and

share  groups.  With many people still facing hardship  as  a

result  of  the recession, they can, for instance, work  with

the  CDCs  to  seek  out  people in difficulty  within  their

neighbourhoods,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>



and  also  link  up  with  schools  to  extend  help  to  the

unfortunate families and children.  Such acts will go a  long

way in fostering harmony and in enlivening the spirit of care

and  share,  and  will  readily  pave  the  way  for  greater

tolerance for one another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was recently invited to a temple function

attended by more than 6,000 people.  In response to the  call

for   greater   understanding  of   our   diverse   religious

backgrounds,   the  temple  invited,  among  others,   mosque

committee members from 12 different mosques in the east  and,

beyond  that,  also extended donations to  several  of  them.

Such  acts,  I  believe,  will go a  long  way  in  fostering

understanding   among  our  multi-ethnic   communities.    In

interacting  with some of the mosque committee members  after

the  event,  several of them are already thinking  about  how

they could reciprocate in similar fashion to their non-Muslim

counterparts.   These are developments that we must  continue

to  encourage  and nurture in our endeavour  to  enhance  the

understanding between the various ethnic groups in Singapore.

I call upon the Acting Minister for Community Development and

Sports  and the Minister in charge of Muslim Affairs  to  get

his Ministry to build upon and encourage such initiatives  as

we move forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the majority in the Muslim community are

aware  that the process of integration takes time and  effort

to  build.   Behind the challenges, as a result of issues  on

Islam  coming  to the fore, is this positive development  and

earnestness among our various ethnic groups to want  to  know

and  learn about each other's racial, religious and  cultural

practices  better.  Being in a multi-racial society  requires

every  member of society to exhibit rationality and  adopt  a

give-and-take  attitude  in order to  foster  stronger  bonds

between us.  While I am glad that the majority of Muslims  in

Singapore  are rational and understand the bigger picture  of

what  it  entails  in  living in a multi-racial  society,  we

should  also try to win over the radical few in the community

to   understand  this  so  that  we  could  collectively,  as

Singaporeans,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>



regardless of race and religious backgrounds, focus  on  more

difficult  issues of jobs and addressing our  competitiveness

which  afflict  our  communities.  Again, the  MCDS,  through

MUIS, MENDAKI and various community organisations could  help

in propagating this message.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the President has been frank in

presenting   us   with  a  potentially  more  difficult   and

challenging scenario ahead of us.  I believe Singaporeans are

a  pragmatic  lot and we have proven to be a  people  with  a

collective  will  to  succeed, and in doing  so,  have  shown

compassion  and  care  for  each other.   This  is  glaringly

demonstrated  when we sing Majulah Singapura collectively  at

the  National Stadium when we celebrate National Day  and  in

the recent General Elections when it comes to deciding who is

best to lead us for the future.  Although the future holds no

guarantee of success, we Singaporeans are spurred on  by  the

words  "Count  on  me,  Singapore"  and  the  knowledge  that

together we can achieve, and make Singapore the best home for

our future generation.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker Sir, I

support the Motion of Thanks to the President.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Address, the President stressed on the need to

maintain and strengthen our social cohesion.  I see  this  as

the most pressing issue facing us today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to highlight four insidious divides

that threaten us from within.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there is the nationality divide, as Singapore

pursues  its  policy  of attracting international  talent  to

sharpen  its  competitive edge in the global economy.   While

this  is  a  sound policy, some Singaporeans are increasingly

concerned that they would be treated as second class citizens

in  their  own country.  Many continue to harbour  misgivings

that  employers are hiring foreigners for jobs that they  can

do just as well themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there is the age divide, as older Singaporeans

find   themselves  left  behind  by  the  new   economy   and

increasingly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>



disconnected from the aspirations of the younger  generation.

Many  older  workers  complain of age discrimination  in  the

workplace and in the job market.  And this is despite all the

incentives  and  persuasion  by  the  Manpower  Ministry  for

employers to hire older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the gender divide. Despite making up 54% of the

workforce today, women earn only about 78% of what their male

counterparts  earn.   There  are  still  pockets  of   sexual

discrimination, such as unequal benefits for  equal  work  at

the  civil service.  While there have been advances for women

in  some  areas,  they have not kept pace  with  the  massive

influx  of  women into the labour market.  As a  consequence,

women run a much higher risk of being poorer than men.   They

are also more vulnerable to retrenchments.  Census 2000 found

that  women  in  their late 30s and 40s had relatively  large

increases  in  unemployment  rate  compared  to  their   male

counterparts.  The women's unemployment rate rose from  about

4%  in 1999 to above 6% in 2000.  The increase for their male

counterparts was lower.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the ethnic divide. While all ethnic groups

have  enjoyed good income growth over the years,  the  Malays

continue  to  lag behind the other races.  Still,  they  have

made tangible progress - more Malays are better-educated  and

better-skilled  today, and more are taking  on  professional,

managerial and executive jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, since the September 11th terrorist attacks,

there  has been some concern among the Malay-Muslim community

if  employers may now treat them differently because of their

increasing religiosity.  Their concern may well be unfounded,

but  still,  they persist.  We need to address these  divides

and these genuine concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meritocracy is one of our founding principles, so is the

principle  of  equality of treatment and  non-discrimination.

We  must  make  it clear that discrimination based  on  race,

religion, gender, age or national origin is not tolerated  in

Singapore.  We must give each individual and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>



each  group  the  confidence and hope that  they  have  equal

opportunities to realise their aspirations, even  if  unequal

outcomes are the result.  We cannot guarantee success, but we

must guarantee equality of opportunity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The progress may be uneven, each person or group

sometimes  gaining,  sometimes  losing,  sometimes  climbing,

sometimes  stumbling,  but always  treated  fairly  and  with

respect.   And above all, always given a fair hearing.   When

this  process  is  working, even those  who  have  the  least

success in realising their objectives will conclude that  the

system itself is fair, just and legitimate.  In this respect,

we  need to examine if our social structures and institutions

are adequate to ensure that our Constitutional principles  of

non-discrimination and equality are protected and promoted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a woman is discriminated at the workplace because she

is  pregnant, where can she go to seek redress?  If a company

discriminates  at the workplace in terms of  its  recruitment

and  promotion  by race, nationality or age,  where  can  the

aggrieved  workers  go to seek a fair  hearing?   Members  of

Parliament,  unions  and the Manpower  Ministry  can  and  do

occasionally take up such complaints.  But they  tend  to  be

piecemeal,  ad hoc affairs.  And let us face it -  they  lack

the time and resources to investigate each case thoroughly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment Act does give some protection to those

who have been sacked unfairly because of discrimination.  But

its  effect is rather like a band-aid plastered over a  crack

on  the wall when gaps are opening up from beneath our  feet.

The  right  to  equal  treatment and the  principle  of  non-discrimination  are  entrenched  in  our  Constitution.   But

Singapore  has yet to establish a body with teeth to  enforce

these  principles.  It prefers to use "the persuasion,  moral

suasion  and  promotional way'' to nudge employers  down  the

path.   I question if this is good enough, especially in this

increasingly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>



stressful environment.  If we do not give people a legitimate

avenue to seek redress, the gaps will become political traps.

Instead of working positively to find solutions, people  will

politicize  the  issues and political opportunists,  both  at

home  and  abroad, will jump on the bandwagon  gladly.   This

will do greater harm to our social cohesion in the long run.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time that we considered setting up an agency such

as the Equal Opportunity Commission (EOC), found in countries

such  as  the United States, Britain, Hongkong and Australia.

It  enforces all the laws prohibiting discrimination based on

race, religion, gender or national origin in their countries.

The   laws   include  the  Equal  Pay  Act,   the   Pregnancy

Discrimination  Act,  as well as the Age  Discrimination  Act

which protects individuals who are 40 years or older.  We  do

not have such provisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recommending a version of the Equal Opportunity

Commission for Singapore, I am not advocating that the  legal

whip be brandished at every opportunity.   Even in the United

States,  its EOC has placed increasing emphasis on mediation,

rather  than  taking employers to court.  In  Australia,  its

Commissioner for Equal Opportunity investigates and tries  to

conciliate   complaints.    The   Commissioner   refers   the

complaints  to the Equal Opportunity Tribunal only  when  the

conciliation  process  has  failed.   The  Equal  Opportunity

Tribunal is an independent statutory body in Australia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may be concerned whether this mechanism will

introduce job rigidities and affect economic growth.   It  is

an  unnecessary worry.  There is little evidence of  this  in

the  countries that have the equal opportunity laws.  Indeed,

one  can  argue  that it strengthens the  job  market  as  it

ensures transparency and meritocracy; the best person for the

job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having an EOC alone, I submit, may not be adequate

for  the  challenges ahead.  We need more.  We also  need  to

build institutional pillars for specific areas.  If I may,  I

would  like to focus on two areas: gender equality and multi-racialism.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women in Singapore have made great strides in Singapore

over  the years, yet they are still under-represented in  the

upper  echelons of power in society.  Women have a particular

interest  in  ensuring that our social and economic  policies

are sound. Women are often combining several jobs at one time

-  as  a  mother, a wife, a caregiver to elderly  parents,  a

volunteer in the community, and as a worker.  They know  that

issues like child care, access to healthcare services and  to

training programmes are closely connected to their ability to

participate on an equal basis in the labour market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that the voices of women are heard at all

levels  and that their potential is maximised, the Government

should  set  up  a  national  body  to  promote  their   full

participation in the economic, social, cultural and political

life of the country.  Why not set up a Women Affairs Ministry

or  department  for this?  Or at the very least,  a  National

Women's Council, on par with the National Youth Council which

is headed by a Cabinet Minister?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many countries have entire Ministries or departments to

promote  the status of women and their full integration  into

the national development process. These countries include the

United  States, Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia,  Malaysia,

Sri  Lanka,  Sweden and Fiji.  In Sweden,  its  Minister  for

Gender  Equality  Affairs works with  the  Equal  Opportunity

Ombudsman  to promote gender equality in working  life.   Not

surprisingly,  many of these countries have  produced  strong

women leaders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, it has been said that we are a patriarchal

society  and some of our policies have to reflect this,  such

as medical benefits for civil servants.  But the last time  I

checked the Constitution, Sir, I did not see patriarchy being

enshrined  as one of its founding principles.  The  principle

of equality and non-discrimination is.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may turn to multi-racialism. We stand for

multi-racialism  and gradual integration  but  presently,  we

lack national institutions to promote it in a coordinated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>



and  concerted  way.   We have the Maintenance  of  Religious

Harmony Act, but it is preventive.  It  prevents matters from

escalating  and  creating  tensions  and  conflicts   between

different religious groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have the Presidential Council for Minority

Rights.   Its role is also preventive.  It is to  review  and

draw  attention to any Bill or to any subsidiary  legislation

that,  when  put in practice, might discriminate against  any

racial   or   religious  community.   They  serve   important

functions,  but  neither is set up to promote multi-racialism

positively and to push the multi-racial agenda forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has recently set up a new National

Steering Committee on the Inter-Racial Confidence Circles  to

foster  confidence between the different races.   This  is  a

promising  step forward.  But I would argue that it  can  and

should  go  further.  We should build on this gradually.   In

time, it should be the umbrella body for all the ethnic-based

self-help groups and be the institution to promote  a  multi-racial  approach  to  solving  problems.    I  hope  we  will

eventually  also  see a Minister in charge of  multi-cultural

affairs  overseeing this crucial area,  just  as  we  have  a

Minister  in  charge of Muslim Affairs overseeing  the  Malay

community's interests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is important to institutionalise our founding

principles because they define who we are as a people and  as

a  nation.  Our founding fathers had fought long and hard for

these  principles  of equality and multi-racialism.   It  was

because  of  these principles that Singapore  separated  from

Malaysia and we are today an independent country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these principles strike a deep chord in me. I left

Malaysia  for  Singapore when I was 16 because  this  country

offered  me  the opportunity to live my life based  on  these

principles.   I became a Singaporean because I wanted to be a

part  of a country that upholds these principles.  Its ideals

have  become my own.  And I became an MP because  I  want  to

contribute  to a country that pursues these precious  ideals.

I know only too well that they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>



cannot  be  taken  for granted.  We need to  institutionalise

them.  Leaders may come and go, but institutions stay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Address, the President called on us to remake

Singapore  together, so that we will continue to  thrive  and

prosper  as  a  country.  Sir, the Government also  needs  to

remake  itself,  to  respond  more  readily  to  the  genuine

concerns  of  the people.  I have met too many  Singaporeans,

especially   younger   Singaporeans  who   wonder,   somewhat

sceptically,  whether  the Government really  listens.   They

say,  "Why bother to speak up when the Government has already

made up its mind?"  But to take this attitude is to throw  in

the  towel  even  before  the bell  rings.   "Why?"  a  young

Singaporean  might ask, "Why should I get  involved  in  this

difficult process of remaking Singapore?"  To answer that  it

is  for this country's survival is only begging the question,

because why is this country's survival so important?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth is a big place. When the going gets tough, we

can  disperse  and leave for other lands as  our  forefathers

did.  I would answer that Singaporean this way - because this

is  the  very  essence of being a Singaporean!  It  is  about

overcoming   adversity.   It  is  a  personal  and   national

investment  in a future that we hope to create for  ourselves

and  our children, with a national character we can be  proud

of  and  can call our own.  But more importantly, it must  be

because   we  want  to  realise  our  hopes  and  ideals   as

Singaporeans  -  one  united  people,  regardless  of   race,

language and religion, building a democratic society based on

justice and equality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I support the motion.

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise

to support the motion of thanks to our President.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Speech to this House, the President reminded all

Singaporeans that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>



"the  world has changed."  To me, this describes the crux  of

the challenge that we face.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, technology has bound all parts of our world more

tightly  together.   In this sense, it  has  made  our  world

smaller.   In  this  smaller  and  more  crowded  world,  all

countries  and  peoples vie constantly with one  another  for

resources,  opportunities and results.  Power  and  influence

are  also  peddled on a global scale by all kinds of  forces,

some  legitimate  and  others not.   In  this  global  stage,

winners  win  big.   Losers  also lose  big.   Societies  are

therefore  stressed  by  competition,  and  strained  by  the

accentuated differences in outcomes and increased dislocation

of people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid such whirling change, people seek relief, solace

and  expression  in solidarity with others  like  themselves.

Transnational  and  supranational forces of  race,  religion,

class, business and even iconic worship have become stronger.

While  they  may help bring comfort, hope and gain  to  their

supporters,  they  can  also affect  and  amplify  underlying

tensions  and  cracks in society, rendering the governing  of

nations ever more difficult.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my work as Mayor, as Member of Parliament and

with  the  trade union movement, I see these trends  and  its

forces  being played out in the lives of ordinary people.   I

think that it is important for Singapore to put in effort  in

three areas in the context of the world that we now face,  so

that we can continue to be successful.  And these are helping

the   individual   develop  and   deal   with   change,   the

strengthening of adjustment infrastructure and the  promotion

of social cohesion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for more than 30 years, Singapore has succeeded

against the odds through a combination of right policies  and

tight organisation.  In that time, we have moved from being a

cheap  operational  base to a high value-added  location.   I

believe  we  have moved ourselves as far as that formula  can

take  us.   From here on, we will have to contend  with  many

others  who  have much larger endowments of land,  population

and market, in an environment that is decidedly much more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>



uncertain  than before.  And in such a setting,  we  must  go

beyond picking winning industries to creating an overall more

conducive and vibrant business environment.  Our hope must be

that  the  life  force in such an environment  will  generate

innovation,  possibilities  and the  growth  of  winners  and

winning  industries, thereby creating more jobs and uplifting

the  living  standard of Singaporeans.  But my  concentration

today   is   on  the  individual.   How  is  the   individual

Singaporean, regardless of age, to be developed  so  that  he

can  fit well into such an environment, and thrive amid  such

change?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to highlight three factors that I

believe will drive successful outcome.  First, the individual

must  have  more understanding of the situation  that  he  is

getting into.  Although this seems obvious enough, I think it

cannot be presumed upon.  For many years now, the message  of

training for employability has been highlighted.  Yet,  there

remain  large  numbers  of  employees,  including  those   at

executive levels, who had not yet taken action.  Perhaps many

did  not get the message.  Maybe others did not believe  that

they   would   fall   prey  to  restructuring.    While   the

retrenchments   during  this  ongoing  recession   may   have

punctured  such  illusions of security for many,  more  still

needs  to  be  done.   And  the earlier  we  get  our  entire

workforce  to  understand the situation and its urgency,  the

earlier we start on the road to adjustment and adaptation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we must emphasise the importance of resilience

and  resourcefulness in individual development.   Traditional

training  has  concentrated on technical  skills.   This  was

partly  due  to the strong focus on the manufacturing  needs,

and  partly because technical skills tended to be  easier  to

gauge  and test.  While competence in technical content  must

remain  an  important and integral part of training,  support

for   training   that  improves  individual  confidence   and

flexibility   must  be  increased.   In  a   more   uncertain

environment, our people must not only be very good at scaling

ladders,  but  they  must  also be  quick  to  determine  for

themselves which are the right ladders



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>



to scale in the battlefield, given the overall mission.  This

adaptability is critical in maximising our capacity to  seize

opportunities  and  minimising  the  risk  of  premature   or

permanent dislocation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we must enable more individual-initiated training

to  take  place.   Looking at the jobs that  the  EDB-induced

investments create, we can say that some two-thirds to  four-fifths of them require skilled manpower, increasingly of very

specialised  kinds.  I think that mirrors the changing  skill

needs  elsewhere  in  the economy. With  growing  demand  for

skilled manpower, can we therefore assume that companies will

devote more resources to training their workers to meet their

own needs?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my view, this may not necessarily be so. Why?

Because  many  companies, especially SMEs, have traditionally

not  been able or not willing to send their workers for  much

training,  while  all companies will face rapidly  shortening

product cycles.  The end result might be a tendency to  "buy"

the  needed  skilled  manpower from the  market  rather  than

invest  directly  in training.  And when  that  happens,  and

where  there  is  a shortage of skilled manpower,  a  vicious

cycle  of  increased  cost, stunted company  development  and

dislocation  of  obsolete  manpower  will  form.   From   the

nation's  perspective,  we have  to  see  how  best  to  help

individuals    initiate   their   own    skills    upgrading,

complementary to how we help companies train their  manpower,

as  that  would enhance the employability of workers and,  at

the  same  time,  help  create a  supply  of  needed  skilled

manpower for industries' use.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, beyond what the individual must be motivated or

assisted  to  do,  there  is also the  need  to  enhance  the

transition  infrastructure.  Here,  I  am  thinking  of  such

capabilities  and  industries such  as  counselling  and  job

placement.   In  an economy that has seen almost  continuous,

strong  and  steady growth over 30 years, where  unemployment

has been effectively negative, there is no big need for well-developed   transition  infrastructure  or  expertise.    Put

simply, when jobs are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>



chasing   after  people,  there  is  little  need  for   such

assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road ahead is very different. Intermittent periods

of  unemployment caused by the restructuring of companies and

industries will become more common.  And this will happen not

only   during  recessions  but  even  when  the  economy   is

registering  good growth.  Old jobs will go,  never  to  come

back.   Those affected may be young or old, rank-and-file  or

executive.  Not all of them will find new work easily.   Some

may  be  at  real risk of becoming permanently dislocated  or

structurally unemployed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, experience on the ground has shown that when left

on their own, displaced workers tend to look for, or wait for

a  new  job  that is very similar to the one that  they  have

lost.   This  is  their  way  of  operating  within  familiar

territory,  hoping at the same time that relevant  experience

will help fetch a better pay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, as the economy restructures, the need to change

lines  of work, to retool for a completely new industry  will

become  part and parcel of the job search process.  The  need

to  facilitate the crossing of a proportion of the  workforce

from  one  job  to another, from one sector to another,  will

become  a standard feature of our landscape.  This capability

to  work with displaced employees at the technical, emotional

and practical levels to bring about acceptance and adaptation

does not happen on its own but must be developed.  And I hope

that  the  relevant Ministries can look into this  suggestion

and  see  how we can add to the further development  of  such

capability,  building  on  current  efforts,  such  as  those

championed  by  the  Manpower Ministry and  the  trade  union

movement.   This  is a capability, whether performed  by  the

public or private sectors, which the country will need on  an

ongoing basis from now on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third area of focus that I want to highlight is

the  promotion  of social cohesion.  Singapore  suffers  from

severe inherent constraints of land and population.  We  have

very little to play with,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>



and  we enjoy very little margin of error indeed.  Our people

are  literally  our  only resource.  If our  social  cohesion

erodes, our country cannot remain strong, regardless  of  our

systems  and  technology.  Our unity is  our  own  hope,  and

disunity will be our ruin.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fact must spur us to do all we can to promote

social  cohesion.  We must undertake a myriad  of  activities

regularly  to  nurture  a  sense of common  identity,  common

space,  common good and common destiny.  This can  only  come

about  through broadening the mutual understanding and mutual

respect   among   the   different   communities,   and    the

strengthening   of   national   education.    By    different

communities, I refer not only to the obvious ones of race and

religion  but  also  the less obvious ones,  such  as  income

strata  and educational levels.  We must do our best to  help

different segments of society reach out to the others, to get

the  more  able  to help the less fortunate,  the  strong  to

uplift  the  weak.  We must carefully consider  the  enhanced

roles   that   community,  clan,  religious   and   voluntary

organisations should play.  We must not forget the place  and

responsibility  for  good corporate citizenship.   We  should

also review the components of our social safety net to ensure

that  they are able to help citizens in a timely manner  amid

turbulence, and yet continue to motivate a strong work  ethic

and self-responsibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, despite our best efforts, there will

be  those who will not place national solidarity above  other

considerations.  I urge continuous vigilance  against   those

who  seek to undermine the basis for peaceful coexistence  of

all  in multi-racial Singapore.  We must always bear in  mind

that  we are not undertaking this task in isolation.  We  are

doing  so  in  the  context of a globalised  world  in  which

forces  tuck  at  primordial  instincts.   This  is  not   an

abstract,   academic   exercise  but  one   that   ultimately

determines our viability as a society and nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the world that we have to navigate in

has become much more complex and treacherous.  We have to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>



nimble   to  adapt  to  the  changes  and  swift   to   seize

opportunities and avoid disaster.  It will be difficult,  but

we  will  not be cowed.  Singapore has succeeded despite  the

odds   through  the  indomitable  spirit  and  grit  of   our

leadership and our people.  And I am sure that we will  again

rise to the occasion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I rise in support of the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is at the turning point. Rapid globalisation

has  posed  formidable  challenges to  our  country  and  our

people.  Globalisation will continue to impact the political,

economic  and  social dimensions of Singapore, and  push  for

changes  which are inevitable.  Singaporeans must  face  this

reality that we are living in a globalised world today.   Any

event or happening outside Singapore will have almost instant

repercussions  on  us,  be  it politically,  economically  or

socially.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent financial crisis and terrorist attacks are

clear examples of how global or regional events have affected

the   quality   of  life  of  Singaporeans.   We  experienced

political  brickbats, hollowing out of our economy,  loss  of

jobs,  and  threats  to  our security  and  social  cohesion.

Today, we live in a connected world.  Singaporeans must learn

how to be global citizens and cope with global challenges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, how can Singapore be a global player?

How can Singaporeans be global citizens?  What must we do  to

make  a  living  in the global market?  These  are  pertinent

questions which all Singaporeans must address.  It is not the

sole  responsibility of Government.  Every  Singaporean  must

play a role to make Singapore a global player.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To successfully position Singapore in the global market,

we  need to understand our strengths and weaknesses,  and  at

the  same  time the opportunities and threats in  the  global

marketplace.  We know our weaknesses.  Singapore has  limited

natural  resources.   We  also have a  small  population  and

talent base.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we do have certain unique competitive strengths. We

enjoy strong political and social stability.  We have a world-class infrastructure for our people and businesses.  We  have

a   hardworking   and  educated  workforce.   And,   finally,

Singapore is a beautiful country which receives accolades  of

admiration from people all over the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, how can we harness our strengths to spearhead

efforts  to cope with globalisation?  I would like to suggest

a  three-pronged strategy.  We should focus on  three  areas:

Integration, Teamwork and Quality.



<br><br><i>Integration</i>



<br><br><i>(i)  Integrating Government Ministries and Agencies</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the Ministry of Information,

Communications  and  the Arts' vision  to  make  Singapore  a

connected   and   creative  island.   With  the   advent   of

information  technology and modern communication devices,  we

can  easily  connect  the  Government,  business  and  people

sectors   of  Singapore.   We  must  remove  all  territorial

barriers among Ministries and Government agencies to  achieve

one integrated Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public sector must take proactive measures to

integrate  Government agencies and services to  provide  more

one-stop   service  centres  for  our  people  and   business

community.   For  example, the housing of various  Government

agencies  in the Woodlands Civic Centre provides a convenient

one-stop  access  for  residents and businesses.   We  should

develop  more  of  such centres, and also a one-stop  website

providing all Government services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eCitizen website is a good example of how Government

services and information can be integrated to provide a  one-stop   24-hour  service  centre.   We  should  expedite   the

integration  process,  and  similarly  set  up   a   one-stop

eBusiness   website  for  businesses.   The  integration   of

Government  agencies and services will definitely  provide  a

boost to higher productivity and better quality of services.

<br><br><i>(ii) Integrating our Universities and Research Institutions</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a small country with limited land area. We

should consolidate our resources instead of having many small

set-ups.   We  must  aim  to  be a world-class  learning  and

research   centre.    Instead  of  having   three   or   four

universities  and  several research institutions  engaged  in

local  competition, we should compete with other  world-class

research   institutions  to  attract  top-notch   talent   to

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should integrate all our universities and research

institutions  into a mega university.  In global competition,

size  does matter.  A mega university will be more attractive

to  talent.  It will help to spearhead Singapore's innovation

and  creative  efforts.   We should  build  one  world  class

university   which  can  provide  first-class  learning   and

research   environment  to  the  world.    The   quality   of

Singapore's education system does provide niches  for  us  to

provide world-class education and research services.  We must

aim  to  be  an innovation centre which produces  recipe  for

success, new products and services, and best practices.



(iii)     Integrating our construction industry



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction industry has always been a "low

productivity" industry.  Despite all efforts by the  Building

and  Construction Authority (BCA), productivity remains  low.

Why  is  construction productivity low in Singapore?  Let  me

explain  the phenomenon.  Almost every building in  Singapore

is  developed  by different teams of developers,  consultants

and  contractors.   A  building is a  complex  product  which

comprises  the  inputs  of  a  few  hundred  trades  such  as

concrete,   steel,  bricks,  tiles,  glass,  electrical   and

mechanical products, and many others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every building project, the developer will specify

different  design  and  building material  requirements.   As

such, there is always a learning curve for the designers  and

contractors  in  every  single project.   This  situation  is

further aggravated by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>



the  lack  of  standardisation and  modular  coordination  of

building  components.  Columns, beams, doors, windows,  tiles

and  fittings  all come in different shapes and  sizes,  thus

making   it   difficult  to  achieve  high  productivity   in

construction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we encourage creative design, there is an urgent

need to promote more standardisation and modular coordination

in  the  construction industry.  We must also  integrate  our

design  and  construction  teams through  design  and  build.

Developers must be encouraged to support standardisation  and

dry   construction  methods  such  as  precast  and  off-site

fabrication,  without  which construction  productivity  will

always be low.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another contributing factor to the low construction

productivity  is  the  lack of mandate of  the  Building  and

Construction  Authority.  BCA does not control the  provision

of  manpower and administer building regulations, which  come

under  MOM.   It does not implement standards  and  codes  of

practice,   which  is  the  responsibility   of   PSB.    The

Environment  Ministry  regulates  environmental  and   public

health matters on construction sites.  With so many different

agencies  acting  together with different  agendas,  how  can

building  projects progress smoothly on  site?   We  need  to

review   and   integrate   all  regulations   affecting   the

construction industry and encourage more self-regulation.  We

also need to remake BCA.



<br><br><i>Teamwork</i>



<br><br><i>(i)  Friends to all countries</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, no man is an island. Although

Singapore  is  an  island, we must work as a  team  with  the

international  community.  As a country, we  should  continue

our  foreign  policy to be friends with as many countries  as

possible.  We must be committed to ASEAN and be supportive of

international   organisations,  in  particular   the   United

Nations.   We  must  strengthen our  friendships  with  other

countries and forge economic partnerships where possible  for

mutual  benefit.   The pursuit of Free Trade Agreements  will

provide excellent opportunities for businesses to collaborate

and provide



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>



products and services to growing markets such as China, Korea

and Indochina.



<br><br><i>(ii) Building a Singapore Team</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back home, we should encourage our people to work

closely  as a team to compete globally.  We need to  build  a

Singapore  Team  and  brand our team.  Both  our  Government-linked  companies and local businesses must work as  partners

to provide global products and services.  We should work as a

team  to  develop  more  world-class  companies.   Thus,  the

Government  must  provide  more  support  to  nurture   local

businesses to be global players.  The public sector and  GLCs

should  also make concrete efforts to support local SMEs  and

provide opportunities for them to grow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GLCs should reduce its local market share and give local

businesses  opportunity to provide their  services  and  gain

experience.  We need the inertia from the private  sector  to

drive  our  products and services overseas.  We  should  also

reduce   the   stake  of  Government  in  GLCs  and   provide

opportunities  for  private  entrepreneurs  to  build   niche

businesses.   In addition, GLCs can support local  businesses

when venturing overseas.



<br><br><i>(iii)     Teamwork in Government Ministries and Agencies</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide quality services for both our people and

businesses,  we need teamwork from all Government  Ministries

and  agencies.  Staff from the public sector must  understand

the  macro perspective of policies and procedures.  They must

exercise more flexibility to safeguard the interests  of  our

people  and  business.   Top civil  servants  and  Government

agencies'  chiefs  must  adopt both horizontal  and  vertical

coordination  and  teamwork.  Physical  and  mental  barriers

across Ministries and Government agencies must be removed  to

facilitate workflows and better delivery of services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, top management in the public sector must

adopt  a  more hands-on approach in formulating policies  and

procedures.  While we do not encourage micro-management,  top

management



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>



must  constantly  be  in touch with their  ground  staff  and

customers to continually upgrade their operations.  A  hands-on  approach will definitely provide more support and impetus

in delivery of world-class services.



<br><br><i>Quality</i>



<br><br><i>(i)  Developing a quality culture and workforce</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve sustainable competitive advantage, we need to

focus  on the quality of our products and services.  We  must

inculcate  a  quality  culture in  our  workforce,  like  the

Japanese.   Workers  must understand and  be  convinced  that

quality will ensure the survival of their companies and jobs.

Although PSB has been spearheading the quality drive  through

the  ISO  9000 and Singapore Quality Award schemes, not  many

local firms have achieved world-class quality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, the retail and construction sectors

suffer  from the image of poor quality of services.  We  need

to  address  the issue of quality of services in  our  retail

industry.   Efforts by the Government to upgrade  the  retail

industry  will  not  succeed if  there  is  no  business  for

retailers.   The  constant  push by  PSB  to  upgrade  retail

businesses may suffer backlash, resulting in higher  business

costs and business failures.  Instead, we should focus on how

to  bring business to businesses.  This is especially  so  in

Singapore  where  we  have an oversupply of  retail  outlets.

When  there  is  business, businesses will  be  motivated  to

further improve their operations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the construction industry, our open tendering

system   has   severe   setbacks  in  ensuring   quality   of

construction.   The competitive nature and low profit  margin

in  construction do not provide much room for contractors  to

focus  on  quality.   Many developers, including  the  public

sector,  are  reluctant to pay a premium  for  quality  work.

Furthermore,   there   is  inadequate   independent   quality

assessment  and easily accessible information on the  quality

performance  of  developers, designers and contractors.   The

Building and Construction Authority



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>



should  develop  a web-based database on the  performance  of

developers,  designers and contractors.  We must also  review

the quality incentives for the construction industry.



<br><br><i>(ii) Developing a Quality Tourism Hub</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore aspires to be a tourism hub. Each year, we

attract  about  7  million tourists to  Singapore.   If  each

tourist spends $200 in our retail outlets, we should  have  a

billion-dollar  retail  industry.   Is  this  the   case   in

Singapore?   We may need to check whether the GST  rebate  by

tourists  indicates  the  size of tourist  dollars  spent  in

Singapore.   With so many countries competing  for  tourists,

Singapore must establish our niches to attract tourists  from

all  countries.  Presently, our tourist attractions, such  as

Sentosa,  Zoo,  Bird Park and Botanic Garden  are  facing  an

uphill  task  to  attract  tourists.   We  need  new  tourist

attractions and more aggressive marketing of our attractions.

We  have to market Singapore as a world-class city worthwhile

visiting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low crime rate and safe environment, coupled with

our  beautiful  garden  city, provide  excellent  niches  for

Singapore  to be a tourist attraction.  We should  capitalise

on  this  to organise or bid for more world leaders meetings,

international  conferences,  trade  exhibitions,  forums  and

gatherings.   We  can  be the "World Business  Centre"  where

political,  economic and social discussions take  place.   In

addition,  we  should develop Singapore into a food  paradise

with  a  wide  range  of international  and  local  cuisines,

ranging from hawker centres to fine dining outlets.  The East

Coast  Park  can be converted into a "World Food Paradise  or

Esplanade"  where the best food in Singapore  can  be  housed

together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to remake our Singapore Tourism Board

(STB).   Tourism can be a key driver of our service industry.

It provides many jobs which our older workers can do, such as

tour   guides,  housekeepers,  drivers,  customer   relations

officers, chefs, and so on.  We must be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>

more proactive to attract more tourists.  STB must reach  out

and  encourage tourists to spend money in Singapore,  instead

of   using  Singapore  as  a  transit  centre.   We  need  to

revitalise the Singapore Tourism Board, Orchard Road, and our

tourist   attractions.   I  am  sure  Singapore  can   easily

accommodate 10 to 12 million tourists a year.



<br><br><i>(iii) Quality of life.</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sad to say, Singapore has no quality of life index or

measure  to  monitor our efforts in improving the quality  of

life  of  Singaporeans.  Although many  Ministries  have  put

forward statements of vision and mission, no quality of  life

measures  were  stated to determine whether we have  achieved

our vision and mission.  Many countries have some measures or

benchmarks of quality of life.  To be a world-class city,  we

need  to establish our own set of quality of life indicators.

This  is to ensure that we utilise our resources properly  to

improve the lives of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me cite one example to illustrate the

importance  of having quality of life indicators  to  measure

the  performance of the public sector.  Every year, we  spend

billions  of  dollars  to  develop  and  maintain  parks   in

Singapore.  However, not many Singaporeans visit these parks,

especially the national parks.  The lack of accessibility and

supporting infrastructure has deterred many from visiting our

parks.   Not  many activities or programmes are organised  to

attract Singaporeans to the parks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, inadequate or paid car parking has always

deterred people from going to the parks.  Sir, I am surprised

to  learn  that you need to pay $1 for taking a walk  at  the

Sungei Buloh nature trail.  How many Singaporeans are willing

to pay $1 per walk?  The "pay as you use" principle or policy

must be reviewed to facilitate better usage of our parks  and

nature  reserves.  The Government must invest  in  the  well-being of our people.  The use of parks has proved to be  good

relaxation places for many people in other countries.   There

is  no point spending so much on parks when the utility is so

low.   Our  National Parks Board should be more proactive  to

bring life into our parks.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have a good quality of life, Singaporeans must learn

how  to  work hard, stay healthy and enjoy life.  Maybe,  the

Ministry  of Information, Communications and the Arts  should

set  up a Department of Enjoyment to help Singaporeans  enjoy

life.  To be a world-class city, we need to have a measure of

our quality of life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am confident that Singaporeans will

stay  united  and integrated.  We will work  as  a  team  and

provide world-class products and services.  Together, we  can

make Singapore a world-class city.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  in  support of the motion of thanks for the President's

Address.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I concur with the President's sentiments that we

are  standing at the crossroads, and for the next  few  years

will  be  confronted  with  the  most  severe  challenges  in

Singapore's history.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the changed environment we are in, there are

several  critical  stress  points  that  could  become   more

pronounced in the future.  I would like to elaborate on three

of  these  stress points and the need to provide  relief  for

them  so  that  they  do  not manifest themselves  into  more

serious ailments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first stress point relates to the people-Government

relationship.   There  is  a danger of  an  increasing  chasm

between the Government and its people which the President  in

his  Address  identifies broadly as the  need  for  political

renewal.  It is undeniable that the political leadership  has

over the last 36-37 years done much good for Singapore.  Most

Singaporeans  have  a  tacit  understanding  that  Government

policies  have good intentions.  It is just like the  boy  in

Jack  Neo's show "I Not Stupid" who said, "My mother is  like

the Government.  Everything she does is - for our own good."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's past successes have hinged on meritocracy

and  pragmatism.   Hitherto, economic issues drive  Singapore

and  rightly  so in view of her limited resources,  smallness

and  thus vulnerability.  Feedback from constituents suggests

that Singaporeans, especially the younger



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>



generation,  increasingly want to have a  say  in  Government

policies.   While  there  has  been  more  consultation   and

dialogue with the citizenry over the last few years, there is

still  a  feeling that there is some way to go with  the  new

consultative approach.  Out-of-bound markers must be  widened

in  order  to engage Singaporeans, harness their  energy  and

ideas and help them take ownership of the policies that  will

shape  Singapore's  future, thus increasing  their  sense  of

rootedness.   I  therefore welcome the President's  call  for

opening  up more space for Singaporeans to debate on national

policies and issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the engagement between the Government and the

people  must  go  beyond mere rhetoric.  The Government  must

show  that it values and takes its citizens' views seriously.

It  must  not be too quick to dismiss or put down  ideas  and

feedback  for,  after  all, no one can claim  a  monopoly  on

knowledge, experience or wisdom.  Wherever possible,  debates

on policies should precede their implementation so that there

will  be  maximum buy-in and support when these policies  are

put into practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government must take a proactive stance and respond

quickly  to feedback and suggestions.  Feedback should  be  a

two-way, not a one-way street.  Otherwise, the citizens  will

view the Government feedback mechanism - however elaborate or

sophisticated  - as a black hole, where under  the  force  of

gravity,  no light emerges.  As a constituent once  cynically

remarked  to  me  "Where is the Government's feedback  to  my

feedback?"    After  public  consultation  and  debate,   the

Government  should  take  pains to indicate  the  changes  or

refinements  made  to its policies arising from  feedback  as

well as the reasons for rejecting other proposals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must show that it will not hesitate to take concrete

action  and  change  its  policies,  where  it  benefits  the

majority of Singaporeans, even if it involves an about change

or about face of an existing policy, such as in the Chek Jawa

case.   Otherwise, many Singaporeans would continue  to  feel

that  dialogue  and  debate are mere  tokenism.   By  way  of

anecdotal evidence of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>



this  sentiment,  even  the  CEO of  an  established  private

company  in  Singapore who has taken part  in  many  feedback

sessions  and  sits on the Board of a GLC, told  me  recently

that  he himself is still very sceptical about the Government

listening  to concerns about the impact of its policies.   So

this  is not just the sentiment of the MP for Sembawang GRC's

daughter or young friends.  So what more the average  man-in-the-street,  most  of  whom have  chosen  to  be  the  silent

majority!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Sir, as the President has so rightly pointed

out,  no  policy  is so cast in stone that it  can  never  be

changed.  To ensure that policies remain relevant and enhance

rather  than  impede stakeholders' welfare,  as  the  MP  for

Sembawang  GRC  has so robustly argued, it  is  important  to

remind civil servants who are the face of the Government  and

facilitators  of  Government policies, that  they  must  show

compassion, be less rule-book bound and listen with a  heart,

not just with the mind.  In other words, be customer-centric,

in  form and substance.  Otherwise, they will not live up  to

their title of "civil servant" and will be considered neither

civil nor servant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is acknowledged that the civil service and statutory

boards have over the last few years improved tremendously  in

the  delivery  of  its  services to the  public.   My  recent

experience  as a private sector representative on  the  JTC's

Customer Services Panel and URA Concept Plan Review Committee

2001  have been positive.  In these instances, the Government

organisations concerned have been responsive to feedback  and

have  made  the  effort  to take into  account  some  of  the

suggestions  as  well  as  explain  why  others   cannot   be

implemented.   However, more can be done, so that  our  civil

service would be known not only for its incorruptibility  and

efficiency but also for being in-tune with the people and the

needs of the time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my second point relates to the need for

us to manage the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>



imbalances arising from an inevitable widening income  divide

among  the  have-nots, the haves, and  the  have-lots,  as  a

result of the inexorable forces of globalisation and IT.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we promote entrepreneurship and risk-taking, there

will be fabulous successes but there will also be spectacular

losses.   To  quote  the  New York Times  journalist,  Thomas

Friedman, there is no longer a First World, a Second World or

a  Third  World.   Only  a Fast World  where  the  forces  of

globalisation  are embraced and a Slow World,  where  nations

and communities who fail to do so are left behind.  Singapore

could  become more and more a winner-takes-all society.   The

rich  are  likely  to  get richer while the  poor  will  have

increasing difficulty to play catch-up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to venture two proposals

to  address the needs and concerns arising from this tendency

towards   greater  income  disparity.   Firstly,  as   income

disparity  becomes  more pronounced  and  as  job  insecurity

increases,  our  meritocratic  system  upon  which  much   of

Singapore's  success lies must be peppered with  a  lot  more

compassion  in its execution.  While we celebrate the  icons,

the  phoenixes, and the heroes of capitalism, we  must  never

forget  those who are left behind.  A group is only as strong

as  its  weakest member.  In a 4 x 100 metre  relay,  a  slow

start  by one runner, or a poor baton change by another,  can

cost  the  team  a medal.  We thus need to temper  capitalism

with compassion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing financial assistance schemes for the low income

groups,  the  handicapped,  the sick  and  at  risk  families

administered by grassroots organisations,  the CDCs and  MCDS

are  to  be applauded.  However, there is a need for constant

review of such schemes as regards, say, the qualifying income

ceiling and the quantum of such financial assistance as  well

as  the  criteria  and conditions under which  assistance  is

dispensed   in   order   to   ensure   their   adequacy   and

appropriateness.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feedback from some constituents is that the financial

assistance  rendered  by  the  Government,  while  very  much

appreciated,  is paltry at times and, in some instances,  not

commensurate with the stringent requirements imposed.   I  am

not  advocating  increased social  benefits  or  an  enhanced

welfare  system  per  se. Far from it,  as  I  wholeheartedly

support the promotion of self-help and the dignity of work, a

point  which the Minister of State for Manpower expounded  so

poetically yesterday.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there will always be a group of people where no

amount  of  resolve on their part is enough.  They need  help

due to their circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cite an example. A resident in my constituency

is an able-bodied odd job labourer.  He is now unable to work

as his wife is suffering from terminal liver cancer and he is

looking after her and their two sons who are still schooling.

It  is  this  class  of  people  that  we  must  continue  to

acknowledge,  remember and render help appropriately.   As  a

volunteer worker recently remarked to me, "While it is  right

for  the  Government to promote self-reliance and the dignity

of  work to avoid the development of a crutch mentality,  our

means  test  must  also  not  be  so  stringent  that  it  is

considered a mean test rather than a means test."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way to mitigate the income divide would be to

ensure that ample avenues are given to all to maximise  their

potential and level up.  Allowing the brightest and the  best

to excel economically and the worst off to receive assistance

will address the top and the lowest echelons of society.  But

there is a growing number of those who are just "getting  by"

based  on  our  current  pragmatic  economic  definition   of

success.   These  people might be frustrated  by  the  income

squeeze and become envious of the successes of the heroes  of

capitalism.  Sir, a tangible way to address this issue  would

be to provide them with ample avenues to level up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in relation to this, I subscribe to

the  President's argument that the key means  to  uplift  the

population



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>



is  to redouble our emphasis on education and training.  With

the  need  to  cope  with the demands  of  the  new  economy,

constant restructuring and, therefore, higher obsolescence of

existing jobs, opportunities for lifelong learning should  be

created  to cater to diverse groups of people. These  include

those  who need to prepare for a new area of employment,  are

planning  mid-career moves, are interested to return  to  the

workforce, particularly the women, are interested to  upgrade

their   qualifications  or  are  just  purely   looking   for

intellectual satisfaction.  The courses could be  offered  by

tertiary   and   recognised  professional   institutions   in

cooperation  with the industries.  They need not be  confined

to  new growth industries but also staple old economy sectors

which will continue to need employees, like teaching and even

in the field of property management.  Such staple old economy

sectors could hire mid-level middle-aged managers whose  jobs

have  been  made  obsolete by restructuring  or  the  changed

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over time, the provision of a wide variety of lifelong

learning  opportunities will help maintain a  highly  skilled

and  knowledgeable labour force which is able to adapt to the

changing job market and adjust to economic restructuring  and

downturns,  such as what we have just experienced.   In  this

respect,  I  am  pleased  to note  that  the  MOM,  with  the

cooperation  of MOE, has mounted many schemes to promote  and

encourage lifelong learning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To allow more to benefit from these lifelong learning

opportunities, subsidised fees could be considered  even  for

houswives preparing to return to work and low-income earners.

More Singaporeans, and not just the best and brightest, would

benefit from such lifelong educational opportunities.   Those

who  miss  the boat the first time can at least have  another

chance  to  reach  their  desired destination,  and  this  is

important since human capital is our most valuable asset.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my third point is the need to manage

ethnic  polarisation in our society.  This has always been  a

thorny



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>



issue  in  domestic politics.  One needs to bear in mind  the

context  of race relations.  The reality, whether we like  it

or  not, is this: Singapore as a Chinese dominated society in

a  region  comprising ethnic majorities.  There are sometimes

unspoken  concerns  that centre on where  the  stronger  pull

lies:   (1)  blood and kin and, increasingly, one's religious

faith; or (2) loyalty to one's country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, the problems are compounded by the socio-economic distinctions that exist among ethnic groups that

have led to the, at one time, controversial formation of self-help  groups  like MENDAKI and SINDA.  These issues  are  not

confined to our Malay compatriots, although they have,  quite

unfortunately,  borne the brunt of the most intense  scrutiny

because of recent events.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, notwithstanding all this, I do not forget that we

have  done  very  well indeed over the past  few  decades  in

building  racial harmony among the major ethnic  groups.   We

need   only  to  recall  the  major  strides  we  have  made.

Elsewhere, racial tensions are often resolved violently -  in

India, the Balkan republics and in Africa.  We are blessed to

have  an enlightened leadership that lived through tumultuous

times  in  our history and appreciates from bitter experience

how  racial  fault  lines  can ruin  everything  we  have  so

painfully built up over the years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now have racially integrated schools, racial limits

in  public  housing  to  prevent the formation  of  enclaves,

minority   representation  in  politics  through   GRCs   and

community-level  activities to bind people together,  in  the

words  of  our  pledge,  "regardless  of  race,  language  or

religion".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as the President has put it in his Address, "The

task  is  never complete."  The issue continues to  haunt  us

after  decades and continues to morph into new forms, whether

it  be  madrasahs, tudung or something else.  If we  are  not

vigilant, the cracks will widen and undo everything.  We must

never allow that to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>



happen.   This is more important than ever before not  merely

due  to  recent  events  but also due  to  the  international

talents  we  are trying to attract who are also from  diverse

ethnic groups and religious persuasions.  Indeed, the concept

of  a multi-racial, multi-religious society may be foreign to

our  foreign  talent, some of whom hail from ethnically  more

homogeneous  societies.  The issue of social integration  and

cohesion could take on an added dimension when the number  of

foreign  talent in Singapore becomes significant.  Hence,  we

must never let up on efforts to foster greater cohesion among

the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a nation, we should re-affirm multi-racialism as

a  creed,  as the only way forward.  Efforts continue  to  be

made  in  schools with the formation of the IRCCs and Harmony

Circles at the community level.  I applaud such moves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us not forget the adults, especially those in

their  early  20s and 30s, and the middle income  groups  who

tend to participate less in grassroots activities.  Adulthood

and,  sometimes,  affluence, rob us of  our  innocence.   How

often,  as adults, do we sing the national anthem or say  the

pledge?  Sometimes, we grow sceptical of the civic lessons we

learn  in  school and need to relearn them.  I remember  some

years  ago, watching on TV a memorial service for the victims

of  the  SilkAir MI185 crash.  The nation had already grieved

for  the victims and their families.  The service was a  grim

reminder  to  the  rest of us who are not  victims  or  their

family members.  While we will perhaps never fully understand

the   depth  of  pain  they  felt,  the  presence  of   other

Singaporeans   was   an   act  of  solidarity   with   fellow

Singaporeans and fellow human beings.  It showed  that  other

Singaporeans understand, care and, most of all, share in that

grief.   I  picture in my mind similar services the Americans

held   in  their  own  country  and  throughout  the   world,

commemorating the victims of the World Trade Centre collapse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a binding power to such "rituals". One needs

to  think  only  of the National Day parades that  in  recent

years have taken on a rather nationalistic tone.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>



While  some  may be sceptical, many others I know,  including

middle  income and successful professionals who have  watched

these  parades "live", often speak of how proud they felt  to

be Singaporeans.  Sir, when we stand side by side, hands held

high with that of our neighbours, the colour of our skin, the

language  we  speak at home, the type of cars we  drive,  the

houses  we  live in, the country clubs we belong to  and  the

things  we  do  on Friday or Sunday, do not  seem  to  matter

anymore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to suggest that we could have much

more  of  such national events - to re-enact our history,  to

celebrate our shared destiny - to instill this sense  of  our

common  humanity  and,  more importantly,  our  "Singaporean-ness".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are those who think such activities are

propaganda,  let them be.  We must think of ways of  bringing

such  events to reach adults in their communities, homes  and

workplaces.   Perhaps,  we  need to  form  a  National  Unity

Committee to coordinate all efforts to this end.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I echo the words of the President that "we must

move  beyond mere tolerance, in order to enhance appreciation

and  build  confidence  among  the  different  groups."   The

national  events  I  propose should,  hopefully,  "widen  the

common ground that all Singaporeans share".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have dwelt at some length on these three critical

stress  points, which could become more acute over  the  next

few  years  as  Singapore operates in a changed  environment.

These  stress  points,  in addition to  others,  need  to  be

managed  so that they do not fester and affect our political,

economic  and social health.  A little stress helps  to  keep

the adrenaline pumping and thus sharpen our competitive edge,

but  too  much stress could pose serious health  hazards  for

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the world today is not the same as before. It has

become  competitive, complicated and even controversial.   We

need to adjust and innovate in order to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>



progress  and  advance.  While we want to narrow  the  divide

between  the poor and the rich, we also want Singaporeans  to

be  self-reliant and independent.  While we want to  be  more

open  and  allow opportunities for dialogue and consultation,

we  also  want  to  ensure constructive and  useful  debates.

While   we   want  to  provide  more  space  for   individual

communities  to  grow, we also want to  build  consensus  and

common  grounds.   These are some of the S21  dilemmas  which

continue  to  challenge each generation afresh.  Nonetheless,

Sir, the healthy constitution we have built, in terms of  our

social, economic and political capital, should serve us  well

in  these  turbulent  times.  I am  sure  with  consultation,

cooperation  and  commitment, we can overcome  the  obstacles

ahead and advance as a nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore unequivocally support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  rise to support the Motion of Thanks moved by Mrs Lim Hwee

Hua, Member for Marine Parade GRC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past months since the election in November 2001,

Singaporeans  have been informed, persuaded and  warned  many

times  over of the challenges and difficulties that Singapore

is  facing  and will continue to face in the New Economy  and

the  ever-changing political and security  landscape  of  the

world.   In his Speech, the President has again reminded  us,

"Our  region  has  been  fundamentally altered  and  security

problems that arise in the region will inevitably spill  over

to  Singapore."  With this as the backdrop, let  us  remember

that  during the election we have given the people some  hope

for  jobs,  jobs and jobs, and they have shown their  support

for the PAP Government via the ballot boxes.  Similarly, this

support  was earlier translated in their unequivocal  support

for  the cost-cutting measures introduced to ensure Singapore

remains competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the burst of the Internet bubble, gone are the

days when everybody wants to be associated with "e" something

but,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>



now,  the buzzwords of the day must begin with "re":  remake,

reinvent, review and restructure.  I sincerely hope  that  we

do not get carried away by these fanciful words but, instead,

clearly  understand the reasons and implications of  each  of

them to our country and, especially, to the citizens that  we

serve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President has outlined the key challenges and how we

can  respond to cope with these challenges.  This is so  that

we  can continue to strive and prosper if the environment  is

right.  These challenges are real and we must face them head-on.

Sir, there are clear indicators that there is malaise in  the

economy.  I do not claim to be an economic expert but, on the

ground, we can observe more requests for financial assistance

arising  from  bankruptcy, business failures,  retrenchments,

job  losses and reduction in sales revenue.  It is  well  and

good  to  say things like "remake" and "reinvent"  Singapore.

But what does it all mean for the man-in-the-street?  Let  us

not  be  detached from the people.  Singaporeans are worried,

and  their concerns are basic bread-and-kaya issues.   I  can

assure  you, Sir, that many out there still do not understand

the  rationale for such drastic moves that have  resulted  in

the  loss of jobs for many Singaporeans.  I believe that  one

most important challenge for the Government is to ensure that

the  masses  are  with  us, they must understand  that  these

changes are necessary and that we have to do it no matter how

painful it is going to be.  It is just like bursting a pimple

on  our face.  The troublesome pimple becomes a red dot,  but

the red dot will soon heal to reveal healthy new skin.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A case in point is the recent major development in the

financial  sector that has resulted in the merger of  several

banks  and the introduction of new competition for our  local

banks.  Many people do not understand the rationale of such a

drastic  move and has resulted in the loss of jobs  for  many

Singaporeans.   These  retrenched  workers  are  key   family

members  and  many are sole breadwinners with many  financial

commitments.  Just this year, Sir, I had a resident



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>



who came to see me during my meet-the-people session.  He was

working for a local bank for seven years and he was earning a

decent salary, a father of three, in the prime of his life, a

typical  Singaporean  with the usual  four  Cs  to  maintain.

Almost overnight, he became jobless.  He could not find a job

for  several months and his savings are fast depleting.   How

is he going to feed his wife and three children?  It takes  a

lot  of courage and humility for someone like him to ask  for

help  but  he was at his wits' end and in despair.  There  is

only  so much that we can do to help him.  He is just one  of

many  such cases.  I am afraid, Sir, we may be creating  many

disgruntled  citizens who will be bitter, cynical  and  anti-establishment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the Government and its agencies must, in my

opinion,  take the lead in changing and adapting a  different

style  of governance for the new Singapore.  It must  not  be

seen  as  always giving directions and taking a paternalistic

role but rather, it must be a partner of the people.  We  can

tell the people to change their mindset but is the Government

willing  to  do  the same in its way of doing things?   There

must be clear indicators and not just lip service in the  way

our key institutions run their business.  They are well-known

for  their  efficiency and high standards.  It is  time  that

they  showed the same high level of compassion and  humanity.

If  not,  cynical remarks and views about the Government  not

being sincere will continue to persist and the able will  not

come forward to take part in this process of change.  Let  us

work  together to change this negative thinking  and  get  as

many able and willing citizens to participate in the process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's willingness to change its mindset will

be  a  bold  effort  but nevertheless, a necessary  one.   We

cannot  afford  to  have our strong and able  simply  sit  by

sipping   their  expensive  cafe  latte  at  Starbucks,   not

participating,  just  watching.   This  effort  in  our  long

journey  of  nation-building is essential and  all  concerned

members of our homeland should be part of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as we ponder upon the means and ways to

make these changes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>



and  adapt, there are several fundamental issues that I  hope

that  we  could revisit.  The first is our workers'  welfare.

Our  workers are constantly grappling with rapid changes  and

the  need  to  acquire  new skills and knowledge.   Many  are

struggling and some are resisting the change.  How  then  can

we  assist them to manage the change?  I have to commend  the

Ministry of Manpower, NTUC and the CDCs for their efforts but

more  can be done to make these changes less painful and more

meaningful for these workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burden of change should not just fall on the

employees  but employers should also ensure that workers  are

regularly upgraded and retrained even during the good  times.

Employers  should  consciously  make  provisions  for   their

employees  to  upgrade  and pick  up  new  skills.   In  this

respect,  I  would like to cite the examples of  SingTel  and

Mindef  for  their effort to upgrade their staff through  the

Skills  Redevelopment Programme and the  Specialist  Manpower

Programme.   If at any time, the staff of these organisations

were  to  leave  for one reason or another, they  would  have

obtained  qualifications or special skills that  would  boost

their employability.  The willingness and experience of these

organisations should be publicised so that more companies can

pick  up these good corporate practices and be good corporate

citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to highlight the importance of

education in this process of change.  From the feedback  from

my  residents  and grassroots leaders, I have concluded  that

many  parents  are  very  concerned  about  their  children's

future.   As  a parent myself, we worry whether our  children

can  cope  with  the extremely competitive education  system.

Yes, we parents are more kiasu than our children.  We are  so

afraid of our children not having enough to the point that we

appear kiasi.  Some cynics may say otherwise but the majority

does  agree  that  we  do  have a good  education  system  in

Singapore.  I believe that we can still fine-tune it to  make

it  even  better.   The education system should  prepare  the

future  generations for the rapid changes and produce nimble,

creative and innovative minds.  We know



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>



the  importance that the Government puts in education by  the

sheer   size  of  resources  that  have  been  brought   into

education.  This cannot be denied.  We cannot afford  not  to

invest in our people.  As we move into the knowledge economy,

we  need  to  have  more knowledge workers  that  are  multi-disciplined and can handle multi tasks at the same time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, we should have a more holistic approach

towards  education.  Academic excellence should  not  be  the

only  thrust  for education.  A child should be  nurtured  on

values  such as national education, community spirit,  social

services,  volunteerism and sports.  These  would  nurture  a

well-rounded   individual   with   strong   community   ties.

Ultimately, Sir, our education system should aim  to  develop

citizens  who are able to put Singapore and community  before

self.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose to the Ministry of Education to

seriously  consider  bringing the early  childhood  education

into the formal education system - put it directly under  the

purview  of  MOE.  This portion of our education  system  has

mostly  been left to the community organisations and  to  the

private  sector.  Is this wise?  As the pressure for economic

excellence  continues, we will see more dual  income  earning

families.   There are several developed countries  that  have

incorporated  the  pre-school  education  into  the   primary

education.  For example, France, where there is a high number

of  working parents, the system takes in children from  three

to   five   years  old  in  the  ecole  maternelle   or   the

kindergarten.  Very often, these pre-schools are part of  the

primary  schools.   The  Compulsory Education  Act  that  was

passed   in   Parliament  is  a  clear  indication   of   the

Government's  commitment to educating our future generations.

This augurs well for us.  Let us take this a step further and

incorporate   the  foundation  years  into   the   mainstream

education provided by MOE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantages of such a move are plenty and I would

name a few.  The dual income families need the support of the

State so that both parents can contribute



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>



to  the  economy.  The Ministry of Education can  ensure  the

quality  and  standards of the early childhood education  and

the   kindergartens.    This  is  to  ensure  that  a  strong

foundation  is  in  place  when  they  continue  to   primary

education.   The  Ministry  of Education  has  an  impeccable

record, locally and internationally, and I see no reason  why

we cannot do the same for early childhood education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to touch on education focused

for  the Malay community.  Sir, the Malay community has  made

tremendous progress in the area of education over the past 10

years.  Prime Minister Goh highlighted this last year.  As  a

result,  we have made inroads in many non-traditional fields.

More  Malay  professionals are holding key positions  in  the

private and public sectors.  This is possible because of  our

system of meritocracy.  However, there is a need to translate

the  culture  of academic excellence seen in the Chinese  and

Indian  communities into the Malay community.  The  community

must  understand  that it should not aim for average  results

and  mediocrity.   We must aim to achieve high  standards  in

education  and attain world-class recognition in whatever  we

do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is a great social leveller. Through

education,  the  community  will  be  able  to  stand   tall,

participate and be part of the mainstream.  In this  respect,

I strongly encourage more involvement of the community at the

national  level.   The Malay community should  be  more  pro-active   in   reaching  out  and  bonding  with   the   other

Singaporeans,   for  example,  by  involving  themselves   in

associations  or  clubs, like the Rotary  Club,  Toastmasters

Club, alumni associations and other secular associations like

the  community  clubs.   In doing so,  we  will  create  more

opportunities for interaction and understanding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me conclude, Sir, by saying that I do not profess to

have all the solutions - far from that, but I hope to be able

to contribute positively to the democratic process.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in his Address, the President

said  that  we  must  build  first-class  infrastructure  and

provide  services at competitive price.  The Government  must

try to control the cost of doing business in Singapore if  it

wants  the  businesses to succeed.  It is said that Singapore

is a country where the business cost is high, such as rental,

labour, transport and other Government levies.  In the  past,

when  our neighbouring countries were relatively backward  as

compared  to  us, despite our higher business  cost  we  were

still able to attract some investments here, because of other

advantages  we had.  However, the neighbouring countries  are

now  catching up on us and are able to do what we  have  been

doing.  They are now attracting foreign investors because  of

their  lower  business  cost, and  have  become  our  serious

competitors.   This  happens not only in  the  new  areas  of

investments,  but in areas which used to be our  strongholds.

Many  established  companies  have  been  relocated  to   our

neighbouring countries, and this is not confined to the multi-national  companies only. Even our very own small and  medium

enterprises are relocating there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, we are still able to attract some high-tech

industries  to  invest  here,  it  has  brought  about   some

structural  unemployment in our labour market.  Although  the

strong push for retraining and re-skilling has helped in some

way  to solve the unemployment problem, there are still  some

problems,  particularly  with  the  older  workers  who  have

difficulty coping with the new technology.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore economy is made up of many types of

enterprises.   Some are very strong and some are  small,  and

the  majority  are SMEs.  To them, the profit margin  depends

very  much  on the operating cost.  Whether they can  survive

will have serious impact on unemployment in future.  All  the

high-tech  farms  in  Sungei Tengah, the  wood  factories  in

Sungei  Kadut  and  the  scores of  department  stores  along

Orchard Road are sensitive to the cost of business.  There is

no  necessity for us to force the cost sensitive business  to

relocate.   For  certain reasons, we need to retain  some  of

these  companies.   In  order to reduce  the  cost  of  their

business, we must think of ways and means to help  them.   At

this juncture, while we are hoping to get out of the woods of

recession,   we  should  think  of  ways  to   retain   these

enterprises  to  save  jobs for our  workers,  otherwise  our

recovery will be slower.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of sea and air transport, there is over

capacity  in the region, and the competition from within  the

region  has  intensified, for example, the case of  Evergreen

Shipping Company.  Even if our profit is less by $20  million

per  year,  we  should  try to keep  the  patronage  of  this

shipping company.  We have to try to reduce our cost, enhance

our  quality of service in order to keep Singapore as an  air

and shipping hub of this region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following are some of the complaints about the high

cost of business operation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rental cost. We often hear complaints from the

businessmen that the rental cost here is very high.   In  our

public  tender system, we inevitably pick the highest bid  as

the  successful bid.  The fact is this successful tender does

not  necessarily reflect the true market value of  rental  in

Singapore.   It  shows only the mentality of  the  successful

tenderers.  Some may tender at excessively high price out  of

desperation, or they use the premises to engage in  lucrative

side-line  business, such as the collection of  Toto  or  4-D

lotteries.   Under  such  circumstances,  if  you  take   the

successful tender price as a reflection of the market  price,

then you are wrong.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transport costs. In Singapore, our cars are among the

most  expensive ones in the world. The prices of  petrol  and

diesel are controlled by the five big oil companies operating

in  Singapore.   Their  high profit margins  jacked  up  fuel

prices  and  added on to our transport cost,  and  hence  the

business  cost.   The Government has the obligation  to  help

bring  down  fuel  prices in order  to  reduce  the  cost  of

transport to the businessmen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Utilities charges. High utility charge is the most

common complaint.  Just a few years ago, the water tariff was

just  55  cents per cubic metre.  Today, it has  gone  up  to

$1.10  per cubic metre. With an additional tax of 40%,  water

now  costs  $1.55 per cubic metre.  In other words,  for  the

past  few years, our water price has increased by some  300%.

This has aroused the wrath of the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporate tax. The Finance Minister has reduced

corporate  income tax  and shifted some taxation to  indirect

taxes.   Some companies have many subsidiary companies,  some

profitable and some heavily in the red.  All these companies'

losses  or  gains cannot be set off.  Our income  tax  system

does  not allow the main company to offset the losses of  the

losing  companies  with  the high profits  of  the  lucrative

companies.  As a result, the effective tax rate of the  group

is not the stipulated 28% but is effectively some 70% to 80%.

Therefore,  I hope the Inland Revenue Authority would  review

the system to see how the effective tax rate could be reduced

to help the group of companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from income tax, there are also some other taxes,

such  as property tax, which are a burden to the businessmen.

For example, in the case of a warehouse, whether it is vacant

or  occupied, the owner has to pay property tax on it.   This

is another burden on the businessmen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Government regulations are made in such a way that

causes  an increase in business cost. For example, in certain

work  sites, the rules stipulate that there must be at  least

one resident engineer and a safety officer to look after



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>



the  work.  In order to avoid running into trouble  with  the

rules and the civil servants behind them, the developers have

to  employ  more  people.   For  example,  some  workers  are

employed just to make sure the mosquitoes do not fly into the

worksite  and start breeding there. Therefore, we should  not

have  so  many of these rules and regulations which  tend  to

increase the cost to the businessmen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Ministry of the Environment's Addendum, it states

that  we  will endeavour to tap all sources of water  supply.

At present, although water supply is assured in the two water

agreements  with  Malaysia,  the  first  agreement  will   be

expiring  in 2016.  By then, whether the Malaysian Government

will  continue to supply enough water to us at  a  reasonable

price  is an uncertainty.  Although there are still  some  14

years  from now till 2016, we should take proactive  measures

to tap new sources of water, and to develop new technology in

the  generation of potable water. Otherwise  we  will  be  in

trouble.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are looking at the possibility of developing

technology  in the production of NEWater and the desalination

technology.   The potential for NEWater is very great.   This

is  because  the cost of NEWater is cheap and  is  very  much

lower  than that of desalination.  If there is a demand,  and

the  price  is attractive, we should produce this NEWater  as

much as possible.  We could even turn Singapore into a centre

for  NEWater  technology  and water recycling  industry.   By

2016,  we do not depend on Malaysia to supply us with  enough

drinking  water, we should have enough water in  meeting  our

needs.   Although  the manufacture of NEWater  is  relatively

cheap,  it  would take some efforts to change the mindset  of

the  people into accepting NEWater as an alternative  of  the

traditional water from mother nature.  There will be a  limit

to  the  NEWater production volume because it depends on  the

volume of available waste water.  Therefore, we have to  look

at  the overall picture of the water supply.  We have to make

use  of seawater desalination to supplement the water supply.

So we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>



still  need to develop the technology in desalination and  we

should be prepared within the next 10 years to cope with  the

demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to make a breakthrough in water technology, we

should not depend on the Ministry of the Environment and  the

Public  Works  Department  alone.  We  should  allow  private

enterprises  to take part in this industry, so  that  in  the

next  10  years some private enterprises which specialise  in

the   NEWater  technology  will  emerge.   They  will   mould

Singapore  to  be  a  centre for the NEWater  technology  and

export their services and products to the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In future, if we depend upon high-price technology for

our  water, we have to decide whether we have to  give  up  a

single  water source strategy.  We have to look  at  the  two

types  of  water   - one is potable and the  other  one  non-drinkable.   We may have to prepare for these  two  types  of

water.   Maybe  we have to include the piping system  in  our

buildings so that the two types of water could be supplied to

every   household.    HDB  and  the  Ministry   of   National

Development may want to take a good look at this issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Address, the President urged the people to be

more  inquiring and more creative.  We all agree  with  this.

The question is how are we going to encourage young people to

be curious, to be more adventurous and more enterprising.  We

should  give  them  more space and time.   This  is  a  basic

condition.  According to my experience at the university, the

standard of thesis submitted by the graduates in the past was

very  high.  However, the university adopted the two-semester

system, instead of having one examination in a year, we  have

two examinations now.  So students are too busy preparing for

the  examinations, and they do not have much time  for  their

thesis.  Therefore, the quality of the thesis now is inferior

to  what it used to be. This explains the fact that the  will

to  gain knowledge and to be inquisitive is much affected  by

the time available in the university.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at what the Ministry of Education had done in

the past, there is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>



a  tendency  to phase out the 'O' level examination  and  cut

contact  hours  for  classes.   I  think  this  is  a   great

improvement, but not everything is perfect.  For example,  by

2003, to gain admission to the university, in addition to the

traditional  'A' level results, the candidates have  also  to

produce  their SAT results as well as a special project.   In

this  way,  it  will be a great burden on our Junior  College

students.   We  can  either depend on SAT or  our  `A'  level

examination  results for university entrance requirement,  or

depend  on  the special project.  But now, we are asking  for

all  these  three requirements together!  As  a  result,  our

students suffer.  Our students are under great pressure.  How

are they going to have time to be inquisitive and creative?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's Address also touched on allowing people

more  opportunities to develop the hidden potential  of  some

students.   The  secondary school and the JC  will  have  new

curriculum to develop the hidden talent of students in  areas

like music and art.  However, in an article in Lianhe Zaobao,

the writer wrote about a friend's child who was very good  in

Chinese, and had aspired to be a Chinese scholar. However, he

failed his English paper in the `O' level examination.  As  a

result,  he  could not fulfil his dream of joining  a  junior

college with the view of going on to study Chinese Literature

in  the  university.  He  could only gain  admission  to  the

polytechnic  or even the ITE.  This student was  deprived  of

the  opportunity to make use of his proficiency  in  Chinese,

and Singapore lost one rare talent in Chinese.  No doubt,  we

can  import some Chinese scholars from China to replace  this

lost  gem, but what if their English is even worse than  this

local student?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this example, it would appear that the bureaucratic

rules  do not give room for each case to be assessed  on  its

own  merit.   A student who excels in Chinese and aspires  to

major  in  Chinese is denied admission to the junior  college

simply  because he fails his English.  Can we not  have  some

discretion  so that the specific student could be  given  the

opportunity to develop his or her talent and potential to the

fullest?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State for Transport and Information, Communications and the Arts (Mr Khaw Boon Wan): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion of Thanks to the

President.



<br><br><i>Leaving Comfort Zone</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's call for the remaking of Singapore

prompted  me  to  talk about why I moved out  of  the  Public

Gallery,  from where I had observed the debate in  Parliament

for many years.  I was very comfortable there.  I could serve

Singapore  and Singaporeans.  So why did I leave the  comfort

zone?



<br><br><i>Leaving Starvation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I visited my father's hometown in China for

the  first  time; a small hilly village somewhere in  Fujian.

Conditions  there  were harsh.  But my relatives  there  were

proud to observe that it was much better than even, say, five

years ago.  So I could imagine how it must have been like  70

years ago.  No wonder my father had to leave his hometown and

risk his life, sailing into the seas.



<br><br><i>Simple Dream: Stark Choices</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left his hometown because there was not enough food

to  go  around.  His choices were stark: emigrate or  starve.

Economic  mismanagement  and political  chaos  made  economic

refugees  of his generation.  Arriving penniless  in  Penang,

his expectations were low, aspirations were basic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His dream was a simple one: so that his family would not

have to starve.  What he valued most were political stability

and strong economic growth.  Day and night, he toiled so that

we  would  have  food on the table, a good  education  and  a

ladder out of poverty.



<br><br><i>Singapore Dream: Fair Play</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father had more than fulfilled his dream. As a

result,  I  was  never  deprived.  I  was  certainly  not  an

economic refugee.  So why did I end up here in Singapore?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in school, some of us were deeply attracted

to  the  value  of  meritocracy  advanced  by  the  Singapore

leaders.   Our  dream  was to fulfil the  equivalent  of  the

"Singapore  Dream": to achieve our potential,  regardless  of

race, language or religion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After HSC, or the equivalent of the GCE 'A' Level, I

applied  to  both  governments  for  a  scholarship.   I  was

accepted by Singapore.  Meritocracy is a powerful idea.



<br><br><i>Singapore Cause</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has succeeded because we have embraced certain

values:  meritocracy,  fair play, equal opportunities,  clean

government, racial and religious tolerance.  As a result,  we

have acquired certain core strengths.  First, our ability  to

stay  cohesive over time and across racial, income and union-management  boundaries.  Second, our ability to preserve  our

core, yet we can also make changes when the situation demands

it.   So  while we are not a perfect society, we  acknowledge

that;  we  keep improving.  That these have been  fundamental

tenets of our nation for the last 40 years does not mean that

they  are  permanent.  If we do not all chip in  to  actively

preserve  and advance the Singapore Cause, these core  values

may dissipate with the passing of time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Singapore Dream was initially a personal one - secure

a  good  life for my family.  But as I got involved in public

policies  and shaping the future, my Singapore Dream  evolved

into  the  Singapore Cause.  My own experience is that  going

beyond  the  personal  to dreaming for  the  community  -  to

achieve  our  potential as one community  -  that  is  deeply

fulfilling.



<br><br><i>Global Dream</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Dream of my generation was to make it good

in  Singapore.  But I think the Singapore Dream of the  young

generation is already quite different.  Their Singapore Dream

is  probably  to  make it good in New York,  London,  Silicon

Valley



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>



or  Shanghai, and to fly home occasionally for char kway teow

or roti prata.  The Global Dream is today's reality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Singapore Dream is actually a Global Dream, how

do  you  ensure that Singaporeans remain rooted to Singapore?

Will they call Singapore home and advance the Singapore Cause

as  their  Singapore  Dream?  Or will they  simply  leave  to

pursue their personal Global Dream?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic dynamism is a key prerequisite to root

Singaporeans  to Singapore.  But it is no longer  sufficient.

For  the  able, they can move to and succeed in wherever  the

economic  opportunities are.  Even char  kway  teow  or  roti

prata  is no longer sufficient as glue; you can now get  them

in   Shanghai,  Sydney  or  London  in  food  courts  run  by

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after all, we have been encouraging the Global

Dream, as it is important for Singapore.  Hence, we push  our

companies  to  venture abroad.  We peg  ourselves  to  global

standards.   This is also why we invest so much in education.

So many Singaporean students subsequently go on to top US Ivy

League  Universities.  Do you know that in recent years,  our

very  own Raffles Junior College has consistently been  among

the  largest  single sources of undergraduate  admissions  to

Stanford  University?  I am told that in the  year  2000,  it

even  beat Palo Alto High School to become the largest single

source of admissions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without pursuing Global Dream, we cannot succeed as an

economy.   But  it is critical for Singaporeans  to  remember

that  without a Singapore Cause, there can be no Global Dream

for them.



<br><br><i>Involvement: Making A Difference</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a strange way, in meritocratic Singapore, some of our

able  feel  that  there  is  no  room  for  them  to  make  a

difference.  With a competent Government worrying  about  the

future  and  coming out with all the solutions, some  of  the

able feel left out.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in public service, so I was involved and could

make a difference in shaping the future.  But must one be  in

public service to make a difference?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Singapore society to be robust, we need good

leaders in all the three sectors: public, private and  people

sectors.  We have done very well in the last 40 years, with a

few  outstanding  leaders, especially in the  public  sector.

But in the next phase of our development, we need everyone to

play  a  role, and in each of the three sectors.  The  public

sector  does not need to lead, nor has it the right expertise

and instincts in all private and people sector issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the private sector, we need to go beyond GLCs and

MNCs.   Our  SMEs  must play and can play a  bigger  role  in

business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the public sector, key issues, such as defence, will

have to be led by the Government.  But there are others where

the  Government can now take a supporting role to  allow  the

people  sector  to  take  a lead.  For  example,  the  Nature

Society  has taken a lead on nature preservation matters.   I

believe the public sector has benefited from their advice and

expertise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be more areas where the Government can

devolve to the people sector, to let the community decide for

themselves.  But let us not go for quick fixes.  As  a  young

nation,  shared  vision and mode of participation  will  need

time  to  evolve.  We need to move at a pace that  meets  the

expectation of the young, while balancing domestic  concerns.

What  we  seek  is not diversity for its own  sake,  but  the

ability  to  integrate such diversity  in  a  meaningful  and

useful way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do this very well in our schools. As a student, I

remember  there  were so many activities I could  get  myself

involved in, beyond the textbooks.  I remember helping to set

up  the  Red  Cross  Society in my school.   I  ran  remedial

classes.   My classmates organised sports training  sessions.

Together,   we   initiated  and  took  part  in  inter-school

competitions.  These activities



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>



built  strong bonds amongst the students.  They made us  feel

proud  of  our  school,  our heritage.   Thirty  years  after

leaving  school,  we  still meet three, four  times  a  year,

sharing  old  jokes,  but  also  always  spending  some  time

thinking  about  what we can do to help  the  school  in  its

mission.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My experiences were in a Penang school. But from my

children  and colleagues, I gather that their experiences  in

Singapore  schools are similar.  But there is an  unfortunate

break in such active participation in the community, when one

enters adult life.  We should remedy this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sense of spontaneous participation, to connect with

one another, should continue into adulthood.  I hope everyone

can  come  forward  to make things better in  our  community,

whether in VWOs, in NGOs, or whatever.  If you are passionate

about  education, come and help in the schools.  If you  care

about  helping the elderly sick, come and help in the nursing

homes.   Business people and professionals from other  fields

can often bring new perspectives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, many Singaporeans do. I just came across the

Centre  for  Fathering, not that I need  any  help.   It  was

started  by  three fathers, to promote responsible fatherhood

in  Singapore.   Two of them, at the initial stage,  actually

gave  up their jobs, so that they can push their cause  which

they are passionate about whole-heartedly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent Secretary Lim Soo Hoon told me that just last

week,  at  a  low  key, no publicity function  to  thank  the

volunteers at the Pelangi Home for the destitutes,  Jack  Neo

turned up to entertain and encourage the volunteers, even  as

he was rushing off to catch a flight out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent Secretary Yong Ying-I told me about Helen

Chia,  a  Volunteer Probation Officer who gave generously  of

her  time helping the delinquents, besides giving tuition  in

an RC to children who cannot afford private tuition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack Sim is another example. Driven by his commitment

to good public education



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>



on restroom manners, he started an Association and went on to

host  the  first WTO Conference here.  It has nothing  to  do

with   MTI   or   Geneva.   WTO  stands  for   World   Toilet

Organisation.  He even commissioned a Toilet Anthem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many more such fine Singaporeans, from all

walks  of  life, who come forward to help make our  community

better:  Subaraj Rajathurai, Prof Bernard Tan, Brother Joseph

McNally,  Prof Aziz Nather, Henry Tay, just to  name  a  few.

They are excellent role models for all, as we contemplate how

to expand the people sector.



<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my father left his hometown. I left

mine.  I have left the comfort zone in the Public Gallery  to

help ensure that my children do not ever have to be forced to

leave their hometown.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we remake Singapore, one top priority must be to

involve  all Singaporeans in the Singapore Cause.  To succeed

in  this, we must listen to their voices, whether from inside

Singapore,  or from overseas, from high or low, from  EM1  or

EM3.   After  all, let us have the humility to admit  at  the

individual level we are all bundles of EM1 and EM3.   We  may

be strong in one area, but we could be hopeless in many other

areas.  Take myself as an example.  In economics and economic

management, I probably qualify for EM1.  In many other areas,

I  am  at best EM3.  In poetry, I fail, I think.  But whether

one fails or not, one must have hope.  You are a failure only

if you allow yourself to be condemned as one.  That is why  a

few weeks ago when my grassroots leader suggested that at the

next  Tanjong  Pagar constituency's National  Day  dinner,  I

should  partner with Ms Indranee Rajah to sing a duet and  in

Cantonese, I looked at him and said, "Me singing?  Some  more

in  Cantonese?"  Then I remember lifelong learning.  So I  am

now  croaking at EM3 level, but I am putting in  the  effort.

Come National Day, I am confident I should be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>



able to perform at least EM2 to match Indranee's EM1.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how do we engage all Singaporeans, especially the

younger generation, in the remaking of Singapore? What do  we

need  to do?  Change our style?  Change our assumptions about

them?  Change our attitudes as adults?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through my work in the Economic Review Committee, I am

experimenting  by  working  with  overseas  Singaporeans  who

reside  in  the US.  Yes, there was some initial  scepticism,

even cynicism, among some of the young participants.  But  as

we  engage  them more, I sense a strong pool of goodwill  and

enthusiasm to want to contribute to make a difference.   Many

are  now  burning  their weekends and their  nights  on  this

project, with lots of emails in between.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The media reports on their activities have in turn

prompted  a  group  of young professionals in  Singapore,  on

their  own  initiative,  to also work  into  the  nights  and

weekends, so as to be able to contribute to the work  of  the

Economic  Review Committee.  It has been a very heart-warming

experience for me.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One key take-away in this experiment is that we should

never   assume  that  the  young  would  not  have  much   to

contribute.  They may have different values, different points

of  reference.  They may see the need for "fun" together with

being  "serious".   But  that does not  mean  that  they  are

frivolous.  Their energy and freshness of ideas should find a

happy merger with the older folk's wisdom and experience,  to

evolve and advance the Singapore Cause.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore can make it economically and socially. We

just  need to dream big and work together for a great future.

I  continue to see the future of Singapore full of excitement

and  hope,  and lots of scope for everyone to  play  a  part,

regardless of race, language or religion.  There is  a  place

under the sun for everyone, from all walks of life, to fulfil

their dreams and to make a difference to the lives of others.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To succeed, we need to engage all Singaporeans,

especially  the  younger  generation,  and  transform   their

Singapore  Dream, so that it is not just a Global Dream,  but

has the Singapore Cause deeply embedded in it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  yesterday  afternoon, Mr Seng  Han  Thong  remarked  in

Parliament  that  his residents complained  about  having  no

linkway  between the blocks and the market,  and  hence  they

were unable to go to the market.  Let me tell him that in  my

constituency,  there  is no linkway to  the  market  and  the

residents never complain.  They have been going to the market

on  rainy days for many years.  So I wonder whether  this  is

the result of the education by the PAP in using the tactic of

upgrading programmes to win voters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the General Election in 2001 was held

in  the midst of Singapore's economic slowdown, the September

11  event  in  the  US  and the turbulence  in  the  regional

politics.   The Singapore electorate believed  in  the  PAP's

ability to run the country, expected more good years to come,

and  hoped to have continued assets value-enhancement  and  a

better  life.   The  PAP  won  an unprecedented  victory  and

achieved its envisaged political goal.  I want to remind  the

PAP  Government that, in the next five years, its  priorities

in the governance of Singapore should be:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, how to restore our economic growth and to

ensure  that  the  people in general can enjoy  the  benefits

derived  from  such  economic growth.  With  changes  in  the

overall  economic restructuring, there may appear a situation

in  which  only  the  high income people  will  benefit  from

Singapore's  economic growth, while the older  and  unskilled

workers  remain  in  the  lower  income  bracket.    If   the

Government cannot narrow the widening income gap and economic

growth  does  not  spread throughout the whole  nation,  then

economic growth is only a growth in numbers without any  real

meaning to the lower income people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, when economic growth does not benefit the

entire  people and its growth rate is not as good as  before,

how  do  we  reduce the burden of the people of Singapore  in

their daily lives?  In his Address, the President pointed out

that our national wage level was higher than before. I quote,

"We  can  no  longer expect to grow by 8 to 10 percent,  year

after year, as we did before the Asian Financial Crisis, even

if  we were to work as hard or harder than before. That phase

of our economic development is over."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the PAP Government is asking the people not to

expect  high economic growth, can the people also expect  the

PAP  Government to review the charges it has been levying for

all  the services it provides, and the criteria in which  the

Government says is "affordable to the people"?  For  example,

in  medical  costs,  selling price of  HDB  flats,  utilities

charges  and  the university tuition fees.  All these  prices

are based on the so-called "affordability".  Now the economic

situation  has  changed.  Should not the PAP Government  have

the  moral  obligation to re-define what are the prices  that

the ordinary citizens can really afford?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is particularly so with our ageing population.

There  will  be  greater  demand  for  medical  services  and

convalescent  homes.  The PAP Government  recently  announced

the  policy  of  leaving convalescent homes  to  the  private

sector to operate.   With such privately operated facilities,

will the charges be so high that it will eventually become  a

burden on Singaporeans?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, how is the PAP Government going to enable every

Singaporean  to make the best use of his or her talents?   As

we  all  know,  we  are facing  unemployment  problem.   With

economic  restructuring, unemployed workers may not get  back

the  same jobs and pay, even after the economy has recovered.

Many of them are middle-aged.  They need a regular income  to

maintain their families.  Apart from a steady job to maintain

the  family,  it  is  more important to make  these  employed

people feel that what they have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>



learned  could  be put to good use and that their  respective

talents  could be given their full play, rather  than  merely

doing a job and earning a living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAP Government is of the view that Singapore is a

small  country with not enough talented people around.  There

is  therefore a need to attract foreign talents to supplement

the  local ones.  I agree with this principle.  The  question

is:  has the Government done all that it can to identify  and

develop  the  local  talents?   The  PAP  Government  adopted

certain  policies  to  save cost  and  to  avoid  wastage  in

educational  spending.  Have these policies resulted  in  our

today's shortage of talents?  For example, the quota  on  the

intake  of  medical  students.  In  the  past,  students  who

studied  at the polytechnics were not allowed to  go  to  the

universities.    Students   who  were   streamed   into   the

monolingual  stream would have no chance to  go  to  a  main-stream  secondary school.  Although these policies have  been

modified,  I  believe  the  PAP  Government  is  capable   of

undertaking  greater  reform to enable Singaporeans  to  have

more chances to become talented people, thereby strengthening

their ability to compete with foreign talents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, how do we ensure that the workers are not

treated unfairly by employers?  In the high growth and  tight

labour market, we regard the workers as kings.  But now, when

the  economic  situation has changed, job  opportunities  are

scarce,  job  seekers are at the mercy of the employers,  and

hence  it is the turn for employers to become kings.  How  do

we  ensure  that  in such a situation, the  workers  are  not

exploited or treated unfairly by the employers should be  the

immediate concern of the Government?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the effect of the September 11 event on

Singaporeans  and  the  recent  arrest  of  Jemaah  Islamiyah

terrorists  in  Singapore  make  us  better   appreciate  the

vulnerability of Singapore and the importance of  our  social

cohesion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Workers' Party equally cares for Singapore's

security and regards as its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>



responsibility   the  protection  of  Singapore's   interest.

Therefore,  the  Workers'  Party  supports  the  Government's

efforts  to  safeguard the peace and security  of  Singapore.

The   Workers'   Party   also   welcomes   the   Government's

announcement to open up more space for Singaporeans  to  take

part  in  political  discussions  and  acknowledges  that  on

specific  policies, those with different views can also  help

in the policy making, to benefit the majority of the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to achieve the aim of uniting the people to work

together   in  remaking  Singapore,  the  Government   should

exercise more tolerance.  It should transcend party interest,

and  should not regard Singapore as though it belongs to  the

PAP  alone.   The  PAP  is the PAP.  But,  Singapore  is  our

nation.   Whether we agree or disagree with the PAP,  we  are

all part of the nation.  The rise and fall of a nation is the

business of every citizen.  It is only when the ruling  party

and the people in general get out of the shadow of failing to

separate the party from the nation, can we truly be a  united

people in remaking a new Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in

support  of the motion thanking the President for his Address

in Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I sat listening to the President's Address, I

wondered  how  many  in Singapore watched  the  telecast  and

listened  to  the  President's Address.  More  so,  how  many

Singaporeans felt the sense of vulnerability as we faced  the

many  security,  social  and economic challenges  before  us.

More   importantly,  I  wondered  how  many  had   felt   the

overwhelming  sense of urgency in facing up to  and  even  to

begin in an attempt to tackle these problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaking of Singapore is our roadmap to survival in

the  coming  years.   I  am  sure that  in  the  remaking  of

Singapore, the various committees set up will address many of

the  areas  that require shoring up, many of the  areas  that

require revamps and new areas that need to be looked at.   As

we course through the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>



uncertain future ahead, I am comforted by the stance taken by

the Remaking of Singapore team to leave no stone unturned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we go about remaking, I urge the Government not

to  take  lightly  the understanding of  the  psyche  of  the

Singaporean.  As our honourable colleague, Mr Seng Han Thong,

has  interestingly pointed out yesterday in his  speech,  the

uniqueness  of  the  typical Singaporean qualities  or,  more

specifically,   the  die-hard  single-minded  deployment   of

overseas   shopping  and  travel  survival  techniques,   can

hopefully and plausibly turn around as an ingredient  in  our

nation's  survival.  It is an example described by  Mr  Seng.

It  is  evident that we must try to see what societal effects

policies have on our people over a long term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a Singaporean that we have so conditioned for the

past  36 years can be seen as two sides of the same coin.   A

cannot-lose  Singaporean is seen as kiasu.  It  is  the  same

dogged,  hardworking, innovative, persistent and going-to-be-more-creative  Singaporean who strives for better  grades  in

schools, one who wants to secure a better job, one who  works

hard - mind you, efficiently and productively - he also wants

to move up in his or her career and to upgrade to a flat with

another  one  or  more rooms.  There is  nothing  wrong  with

aspiring for a better tomorrow and to have the better  things

in life.  After all, we work hard for these things.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the other side of the coin? As a competitive

and  street-savvy  Singaporean took shape over  the  past  30

years to help steer our nation to where we are today, we  did

not  count on the same Singaporean becoming very much focused

on  the five Cs.  We need to temper and balance ourselves  as

we  seek these five Cs.  I think the addition of two other Cs

-  that  of community and country - can and must be the  only

way  forward.  If Singaporeans can self-actualise  and  spend

time serving the community and being an active citizen, I  am

sure,   in  time,  we  can  have  a  more  rounded,  gracious

Singaporean, and discard some of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>



stereotypes  that we have been associated  with.   I  believe

that we can ignite that bit of altruism that I know exists in

the  heart  of  Singaporeans to serve their community.   Yes,

every Singaporean matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, permit me to use an analogy. I call it the rear-view mirror analogy. Many Singaporeans drive, or at least

have  been backseat drivers.  I wonder how many and how often

these  drivers look at their rear-view mirrors from  time  to

time,  except  when they want to filter lanes,  when  someone

honks  at  them, when flashing lights or someone  in  uniform

gestures for them to pull aside.  If drivers could glance  at

their rear-view mirrors from time to time to notice that they

could  let someone pass, filtering aside, letting the quicker

traffic  along, we would all have less stress on the  highway

and, definitely, more smiles and less rude glares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pursuit of the five Cs, in driving for these, if

we  show some care and consideration for the community around

us  and  initiate some sacrifice of time and effort, we  will

indeed  have a more gracious society and a more balanced  and

meaningful  life.  In housing estates, I call on Singaporeans

to flash the first smile to a resident passing by their flat,

to  offer  the first handshake to the residents left,  right,

downstairs and upstairs of them.  This would be the community

that  they can first be active in.  Sir, I have noticed that,

among  Malay  residents, the rapport  between  them,  between

units,  between  blocks, different zones, is very  close  and

very  warm.  Perhaps, our Chinese residents could learn  from

that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another "C" that can be added to make these 8 Cs is

compassion, shown on the Government's part.  I hope  that  in

the  remaking  of Singapore, the process and  the  Government

organisations  can show some compassion to  Singaporeans  who

are  caught in between policy changes.  We do understand that

implementation of changes in policies will affect some people

negatively.   Nevertheless, some compassion and consideration

must  be shown to these citizens affected and not treat  them

just  as  a  negligible statistic or collateral  damage.   By

showing more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>



compassion in situations like these, citizens find it  easier

to  buy  in on the Government's call for Singaporeans  to  be

active  citizens or to do a part in community work  and  some

other  form of social outreach requiring a draw-down on one's

capacity for compassion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the beginning of my speech, I

wondered if many Singaporeans felt the vulnerabilities before

us and the sense of urgency to face up to and to tackle these

problems.   We need to reach down deep into their hearts  for

the passion that they have for our country, that we will have

some  sense  of hope for the years ahead.  Sir,  we  need  to

instill  in Singaporeans the kind of gut-wrenching commitment

and  conviction that our first-generation leaders had in them

that  brought  us from the brink to the kind of Singapore  we

have today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, we find our foot being stepped on.

Then  we  are chided for deliberately keeping our  toe  nails

long   and   hurt  the  sensitive  souls  of   the   stepper.

Singaporeans must know that this will not change for quite  a

while  yet.   What  can we do?  Keep moving, keep  shuffling,

keep focused on our chosen path, and trim our nails from time

to  time  and keep them sharp at other times.  This situation

is  not  helped  by  the constantly changing  ground  we  are

running on.  We have little or no control of the direction in

which  the  ground moves or the magnitude of the  shift.   We

need  to  be  nimble  as a nation and  to  adapt  and  change

directions  quicker  than the next  guy  in  the  same  race.

Singaporeans must know that each obstacle we face must add to

the  fire in the belly in all of us to press on.  It  is  the

fire  in the belly that fuels our determination not to  fail.

That  was  true  before, and it has to  be  true  today  and,

especially, over the next few years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we could hear, as recent as five years ago, the

lament from the older generation that younger Singaporeans do

not  know what it means to be hungry, the uncertainty of  not

knowing  whether there will be jobs tomorrow,  or  wonder  if

they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>



would ever have decent homes or even a decent livelihood,  as

the  older generations have had to experience.  Although  the

idea,  that young Singaporeans needed a crisis so  that  they

could learn to appreciate and value what we had, bordered  on

idiocy,  the Asian crisis in 1998, the economic downturn  and

the events of September 11, have presented this generation of

Singaporeans some very sobering experiences.  I hope that  it

does  not  take too long to ignite this passion and  to  find

some common gut-wrenching sense of purpose to perpetuate  the

kind  of  life we are used to in Singapore.  To  ignite  this

passion  and commitment to get all of us united to  run  this

marathon,  we  better  find a very short  burning  fuse  very

quickly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's Address has underscored that some fuses

had  already  started burning.  The explosive growth  of  the

Chinese  market is something the world is watching carefully,

each  economy assessing where, what and how it can capture  a

slice  of  it.  A Taiwanese businessman told me not too  long

ago  that the cost of running his business in Taiwan has come

to  such a state that he could no longer continue and had  to

move  his  manufacturing facilities to mainland  China.   But

then  again, Sir, he added that if he was doing very well  in

Taiwan,  the  more  reason he should  move  his  business  to

mainland China.  We are seeing that happening on our  shores.

Then,  some  fuses have already been ignited since  September

11,  and  the  charges are continually being  laid,  and  the

uncertainty and when the next fuse would be lit is a  spectre

hanging over us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with so many wild cards on the horizon, I hope that

the remaking of Singapore will carry as many Singaporeans  as

possible  in  its efforts not just to those who can  identify

with it on a higher cerebral level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just as every Singaporean matters,

Singapore  should matter to every Singaporean.  I think  this

is the essence of the remaking of Singapore.  At this point I

would  like to make a few comments on the speech by the  hon.

Mr Low Thia Khiang.  He mentioned that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>



talent  pool in Singapore, our local talent, could have  been

the result of our policies.  With this foreign talent that we

have  been  talking about these many years, this  supplements

our  local talent.  And not only that, our local talent  will

learn  and  surpass these talents from overseas.   Take,  for

example, in banking.  Young men from overseas in the treasury

rooms,  who are dealing with derivatives, have been  used  to

and  have  been  dealing  in,  structuring,  producing  these

derivative products at the age of 23 or 24, and they come  to

Singapore  and  they work with fairly older Singaporeans  who

are  27 to 30 and, very soon, the same Singaporeans are  able

to  produce these products at the snap of a finger.   Mr  Low

Thia  Khiang  comments that he supports the PAP  Government's

efforts  in  pulling our country together.  It is  admirable.

However, I caution that Singaporeans must not be bought in on

calls  that  could  be  divisive in  times  like  this.   The

President's Address has stated succinctly what we  will  face

and the urgent call to remake Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I therefore support the Motion to thank

the President.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

support the Motion of Thanks to the President, and thank  you

for giving me the privilege to participate in this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President, in his Address to Parliament, has given

us  a  realistic scenario of Singapore's future.  It  is  not

going  to  be  smooth  sailing.   I  remember  someone   once

characterised Singapore's challenge as paddling upstream  all

the  time.   But, folks, it is not going to get  better.   We

have  to leave the safe waters of our rivers and venture into

the  open  seas.  There will be strong currents, we  will  be

buffetted by waves caused by bigger passing ships over  which

we  have  little control.  Inevitably, there will be  storms.

But  it is not a totally gloomy voyage.  If one is alert  and

careful,   navigate  well,  there  will  still  be  beautiful

skylines  and shores to admire, and periods of calm  seas  to

enjoy  the  fruits of our hard work.  Against this  backdrop,

the President spoke of the challenges for Singapore, one of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>



which   is   the  priority  to  strengthen  the   spirit   of

entrepreneurship  and risk-taking among Singaporeans  as  the

basis for Singapore's future competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that there are two pillars

required to nurture and enhance these qualities for survival.

The  first  is  to  encourage and inculcate  that  spirit  in

individuals, especially our young.  We must try to instill in

our  young  thinking  and questioning  skills,  curiosity  to

explore and the knack to take measured risks.  Our young must

not fear failures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me recount a story from one of my constituents. The

boy failed badly in the "O" levels and, in order to resit, he

had to seek the permission of the principal who said that  he

would  allow it if the boy could get 10 signatures  from  his

former teachers to support his retake.  He tried but he  only

managed  to  obtain five signatures.  He was chided  by  some

teachers and told not to bother and waste his time.  He  went

home  dejected.  Thank goodness, his principal  relented  and

the  boy is now studying, relishing his second chance.  While

it  is  not  time yet to say that this boy would succeed  the

second time round, the story hits home on the need to give  a

second  chance,  especially when one recognises  failure  and

stoke that spark of courage to try again.  What the principal

did was to etch in the youngster's mind the value of a second

opportunity  and  making  him  go  round  and  work  for  it.

Unfortunately, the incident also speaks of the  teachers  who

turned  their backs on him when he wanted to try again.   But

the  fact that he managed to get even five signatures  speaks

of the graciousness of our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young must view failures as opportunity to learn and

how  to  do it better the next time.  If we succeed  in  this

investment  in our young right here in our schools,  we  will

have  a  generation of more entrepreneurial Singaporeans  who

are  stout  of heart and are more willing to take  risk,  for

risk and entrepreneurship go hand in hand.  In some ways,  we

have  been victims of our own success.  Singaporeans who  had

the opportunity to be better educated and had grown up in  an

economy that was experiencing high



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>



growth  are  naturally  more likely to choose  secure  career

paths.   It  has  often been heard that opportunity  cost  is

sometimes  too  high  to  do  otherwise.   Risk  aversion  is

understandable.   We  must start in  our  schools.   We  have

already  incorporated  many activities and  programmes  which

will  encourage  our younger Singaporeans to  think  more  on

their feet, think out of the box, come up with new ideas  and

explore   new   frontiers  that  may   well   lead   to   new

opportunities.  Project work now scores towards qualification

for  a  place in the university.  Much has been done in  this

area.  The curriculum in our educational institutions must be

continuously  adapted to teach thinking and discovery  skills

that  will  help  everyone to manage through  the  continuous

changes that can be expected in the new economy.  However, it

will  still  be  some years before this generation  comes  of

working age.  It will still be some time before we have  more

Singaporeans,  who  by  exposure and training,  have  a  high

affinity to take risks and reap the rewards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meantime, we are promoting this spirit of

entrepreneurship  in our working adults and  to  widen  their

perspective.  There are now increased opportunities for  many

to  explore  outside  their  workplace.   For  example,  many

Singaporeans are given the opportunity to take on  short-term

or  long-term jobs outside Singapore.  This is essential  and

Singapore  employers must push their employees to do  so  for

nothing  replaces  the experience and exposure  that  such  a

working stint would bring.  Others have the chance to further

their   studies   or   take  short-term  management   courses

elsewhere.   Such exposure is necessary to give one  a  wider

perspective  and to learn from others.  The interaction  with

other  cultures and working styles all add to  enhance  one's

experience and knowledge and plug Singapore into the regional

and  global  economies.  The Government has  encouraged  this

through its many schemes and should continue to do its utmost

to promote them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second pillar, I believe, is to do the same, ie, to

inculcate this spirit of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>



entrepreneurship, an element of risk-taking among  our  large

local corporations and SMEs.  We have to build up world-class

enterprises that are able to compete globally.  The 1960s and

before,  Singapore was essentially an entreport.  To survive,

our  people had to depend on hard work and survival instincts

to  eke  out  a  living.   We provided labour,  exported  the

natural  resources  of  our region to  the  wider  world  and

received in turn manufactured goods for onward transshipment.

To  survive  and  survive better, we worked at  being  better

organised, more efficient and more competitive than the  rest

of  the  region.   Then, the MNCs came and built  some  basic

manufacturing   plants.   Our  people   became   increasingly

educated, and as a consequence, MNCs brought in their  higher

value-added activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, we learnt quickly. We took some

necessary risks and went on to build our own companies,  some

of  which  today  have gained some measure  of  regional  and

international reputation.  For the successful ones, surpluses

have   piled   up  but,  more  importantly,  there   was   an

accumulation of intellectual know-how, technical  skills  and

managerial  competence.  This happened across industries  and

the  magnitude of this intellectual property that now  exists

in Singapore cannot be under-valued.  We have now built up  a

workforce  of  Singaporeans who are very different  from  the

1960s.    We   now  have  the  opportunity  to   export   our

intellectual software.  In some ways, it is like coming  full

circle but, this time, it is not hard labour, but high value-added  labour,  backed  up  by  institutional  knowledge  and

expertise  that  we  are  able to provide.   We  have  proven

expertise  in  many  areas.    Some  good  examples  are  our

airport,   our   seaport  and  how  we  have  developed   our

petrochemical  and  logistics hubs.  We must,  therefore,  be

focused  and  concentrate our firepower in these  and  others

that we excel in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, while we have come a long way, we

cannot  rest  on our laurels.  We must move and move  boldly.

With a limited domestic base, we know we can only do so much.

Growth  must  be export-led.  We have to take  our  expertise

outside



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>



Singapore.   The  proverbial external wing  must  spread  and

soar, for as Napoleon had said, "Ability is of little account

without  opportunity".   For Singapore,  we  must  go  forth,

create and seek these opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Services were featured prominently in the President's

Speech.   I  truly believe that our people, on the coat-tails

of  the  large Singapore companies and established SMEs,  are

able  to  venture abroad and bring with them the intellectual

capital that is distinctly Singapore.  We have begun to do so

but  we  can do much more.  No longer can we make incremental

moves.   We have to have that courage to make quantum  leaps.

Let  us  not  be  held back by the old ways we  have  handled

competitiveness  within  our  shores.   Let  us  marshal  the

collective  firepower  of light-minded  Singapore  companies,

concentrate  their value offerings and venture abroad.   Yes,

there  had  been  failures and there  will  be  failures  and

pessimists abound.  There would be more short-term  setbacks.

There would be those who would quickly say, "I told you  so".

But  to  succeed,  we  must take the  longer  term  view  and

recognise our competitors likewise would pit against us  with

their own vehemence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Switzerland, Finland, Netherlands, countries that have

similar  constraints as Singapore, have companies that  stand

up  among  the  global 150.  Switzerland has 6,  Nokia  leads

Finland's charge, Netherlands, through the Royal Dutch/Shell,

ING,  Philips, Unilever and Aegonelay claim to five.  In  our

part  of the world, Taiwan has one and even the tiny  SAR  of

Hong Kong has two in the form of Hutchinson Whampoa and China

Mobile.   We can likewise do so.  Success will breed success.

When  some  of  our companies succeed, others will  have  the

courage to venture likewise.  Let us have the courage to take

the  first  steps and help some of our companies  to  succeed

long term on a global scale.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While theorists will argue on a hands-off Hong Kong

approach  or the MITI-led Japanese extreme, we must recognise

that Singapore must fine-tune its own



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>



approach, one that is appropriate to our circumstance.  Here,

I  believe that the Government's role has two facets.  One is

to  push  certain  companies out more  quickly  in  a  bolder

fashion  than  they would otherwise do.  And two,  to  ensure

that  they  go  forth  with the collective  capabilities  and

knowledge base that Singapore has to offer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several hon. Members have spoken on the need to merge

for critical size.  I strongly second that.  If companies can

come  together and combine resources or complement expertise,

we would be more formidable.  This was the dimension that was

missing in our arsenal of the 1960s.  Now we cannot afford to

forsake  such  growth  engines.  Take a couple  of  potential

global champions and unleash them, nurture and support  these

global   and   regional  champions  in  their  forays   while

encouraging them to anchor their knowledge intensive IP-heavy

economic  activities  in  Singapore.   They  would   be   the

motherships   around  which  the  SMEs   would   sail   with,

benefitting  from  the multiplier effects,  further  spawning

more  domestic  players  and  providing  employment  for  our

workers.   Yes, we will encounter storms.  The flotilla  must

stay  on  course for among seamen it is aptly  put  that  the

winds  and  the  waves are always on the side of  the  ablest

navigators.  We must keep faith.  Just as MNCs had  been  the

employer of choice for many young Singaporeans, it would come

a  day  when Singapore-grown MNCs will hold the same prestige

for  the future young from within and without.  Then  can  we

attract the best talent, local and foreign, increase our gene

pool, renew and enhance our intellectual capital.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, nowhere am I suggesting that we should

protect  local  enterprises at all  costs.   They  must  have

viable product or service offerings.  All I am saying is that

competition   is   out  there  and  not  amongst   ourselves.

Competition  is now on a global scale.  This trend  will  not

let  up  and  global competition will be the  norm  for  more

industries  in time to come.  And if we are to  come  through

and  succeed, we better lie in our ships to deliver the  most

ferocious broadside.  But



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>



what  about our smaller enterprises?  They may not  yet  have

the  capability  to take that leap.  How  can  we  help  them

compete  in this new global economy?  We must not  just  give

them a fish to survive another day, but rather teach them  to

fish  so  that  they  will survive  a  lifetime.   For  these

companies,  especially those in niche  markets,  we  need  to

believe  in them, to support their ventures with capital  and

management  know-how.   And  more  importantly,   leave   the

scientists  and the entrepreneurs, the people who are  driven

by  passion  and  vision, to get on  with  their  work.   The

challenge  is  perhaps seeking out these companies  with  the

right   formula  for  future  growth.   Next  is  to   resist

temptation to invade these companies and force-fit them  into

standard management models.  It is about providing them  with

the right impetus to grow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may ask how the support I spoke about earlier for

the  larger companies co-exists with this nurture for smaller

enterprises.  There is no contradiction.  Both are  parts  of

the  same vibrant eco-system, supporting the growth  of  each

other   to   ensure  continued  survival.   As  the   smaller

enterprises   grow,  they  could  well  be   the   seeds   of

reinvention.  How else did Nokia, a lumber company, for  most

of    its    existence   become   synonymous   with    mobile

telecommunications today?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, while I advocate bonus

in seeking opportunities outside Singapore, I also advocate a

Government role in focusing and driving the pace.  Let us not

get  mired  in  ideological discourse  but  to  implement  an

approach  that  best  utilises the  growth  engines  that  we

already have.  Without intervention, some companies with  the

right expertise may not have the guts to go beyond our shores

and  the smaller ones may not have that opportunity to  build

up its expertise.  It will always be a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>



difficult  risk-benefit  equation but  risk  must  be  taken.

Human  and  financial  capital are all  we  have.   Both  are

temporal  in nature.  We must make the best use of  both  and

multiply  them to ensure our continued survival so  that  the

next  generation  will  live in a  steadfast  and  prosperous

Singapore,  just as our forefathers had prepared  the  ground

for  us.   The time is now.  We are at a crossroad.  We  must

act  and  move  boldly and quickly seize  the  opportunities.

Future generations of Singaporeans depend on us to make steam

and navigate well.  Let us not fail them.
