<div align="center"><b>(Motion)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move a motion regarding breach of privilege,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Memorandum addressed to all Honourable Members of the Assembly dated 25th June, 1962, by the Chairman of the Singapore Trade Unions Working Committee (Committee of Liaison Officers of Trade Unions) contains threats to the Government back benchers in the following paragraphs:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"45. Everyone of you in the Assembly

are   responsible  for  whatever  that   might

follow  if  a  few  dictators  in  power   are

allowed  to  have their way in snatching  away

from  the  people the rights that they  have

gained  at  the  cost of bitter struggles  and

great sacrifices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"46. To those who are Government

Backbenchers  we wish to point  out  that  it

would  be  folly to think that they would  not

be  held  responsible by the  people  for  the

misdeeds of the Government leaders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"47. It is in fact in your hands to check

the  Government from its fascist moves. Indeed

it  is  with  the support of the  Backbenchers

that    they   have   committed   all    their

treacherous  acts and can continue  to  do  so

only if they continue to support them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"48. Whatever happens the day is not far

when  the  Government  Backbenchers  have   to

return  to the people and live among  them  as

ordinary  men and women and for the  rest  of

their  life  they will not be able  to  escape

the  people's reproach and wrath if they  fail

them  now  while those who are making  use  of

these Backbenchers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>



may have taken comfortable refuge elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"49. This is the time when you can all

clearly show that you are with the people  in

the defence of their democratic rights!",



<br><br>and  that  the said paragraphs constitute  a

breach of the Privileges of this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The motion stands referred to

the Comittee of Privileges

under the provisions of paragraph (7)

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Original Question, as amended, again

proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>2.38 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye): Mr

Speaker,  last  week  during  the  debate   on   the

Singapore National. Referendum Bill enough  evidence

has  been produced to show that the Barisan Sosialis

do  not  want a referendum on merger. I will provide

further evidence to show that the reason why they do

not  want  a  referendum is that they  do  not  want

merger   between   Singapore  and  the   Federation,

although they pay lip service to a merger policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 2nd June, 1961, leaders of the Barisan Sosialis

issued  a  statement announcing that they  advocated

internal  self-government for Singapore without  the

Internal Security Council and agreed to Defence  and

Foreign  Affairs  remaining  in  the  hands  of  the

British.  This stand by the six Barisan leaders  was

ridiculed not only by us but also by the Member  for

Anson. Such a stand on the abolition of the Internal

Security Council will bring practically no change to

Singapore's constitutional development. In fact,  it

meant  that the Barisan Sosialis was advocating  the

continuation of ---



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> On a point of guidance,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> May we know what the Deputy Prime

Minister  is now speaking on - whether it  is  on  the

original Question or the amendment itself?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Deputy Prime Minister is entitled

to speak on the motion, as amended, the motion which

I have proposed to the House.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I was saying, Mr Speaker, that

this  proposal  by the six leaders  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  really meant a continuation of  the  semi-colonial status of Singapore. When this idea of  the

Barisan leaders was laughed at and ridiculed by  the

people, the Barisan Sosialis quickly changed  their

stand  and  thought  out a new  plan.  And  on  28th

August,  1961,  they  issued a manifesto  which  was

referred to by the Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis.

The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>



Member  for  Queenstown, in a  debate  on  the  18th

April, 1962. I quote from the revised transcript  of

18th April, 1962 [Vol. 17, No. 9, col. 888]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Dr Lee Siew Choh: I bow to your ruling, Sir, and

I  will  now,  therefore,  read  to  the  House  our

document  as issued by the Barisan Sosialis  on  the

28th August, 1961. That document is the stand of the

Barisan  Sosialis  on our constitutional  future.  I

will skip the irrelevant parts and go on to the part

which  follows the issue of Penang and  Malacca.  It

reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The way ahead for real reunification of our

country and our people is in one of two directions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) an immediate, full and complete merger with

Singapore   joining   the   Federation   as   a

constituent  state like Penang  or  Malacca -"

<br><br>those are the operative words -"



<br><br>Let me repeat, "those are the operative words". Now,

the  stupidity of the Barisan Sosialis in advocating

merger  on the basis of Penang and Malacca  was,  in

fact,  pointed out as early as 23rd November,  1961,

when during a debate on merger it was the Member for

Anson who said - let me quote Hansard. Vol 15, No.  7,

col. 574:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We will come to Penang and Malacca where the

Barisan Sosialis, having no legal consultant, really

slipped...'.



<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  I  suggest to you  that  the  Barisan

Sosialis  slipped  not because  they  had  no  legal

consultant. In fact, when the 13 Barisan Assemblymen

defected from the P.A.P., they also made great  play

that  they had their own legal advisers; one of them

was Mr T. T. Rajah.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> And a few more.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The error of the Barisan

Sosialis  lies in the superficial manner in  which

they consider weighty problems of the State. It is

fantastic  indeed for a political Party  like  the

Barisan  to  change its stand  as  easily  as  its

leaders change their trousers!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> How do you know

they change their trousers?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> They might not have changed

their   trousers  perhaps,  but  the  Member   for

Cairnhill could perhaps investigate by the smell.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, when we pointed out to the Barisan

Sosialis  that it was not possible for  Singapore

to  merge  with the Federation on  the  basis  of

Penang  and  Malacca, they refused to acknowledge

the  mistake.  And finally it  was  left  to  the

Member  for  Hong Lim to point out publicly  this

error in the thinking of the Barisan Sosialis. At

the radio forum on 14th June, 1962, this was what

the Member for Hong Lim said - let me quote:





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Just now the Prime Minister has mentioned about

the Barisan's stand of Penang and Malacca type of

merger.  My attitude towards this is that perhaps

they have once made a mistake.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Mr Speaker, the Barisan has soiled its

political trousers. We told them there was a stain

on their trousers but they would not believe it.

This was probably because we were sitting facing

them.  The Member for Anson and the Member for

Hong Lim, being seated behind the

Barisan  Sosialis, could see the  stain  on  the

Barisan  trousers more clearly. And  they  finally

convinced  the  Barisan of their  mistake.  So  it

was that the Member for Hong Lim and the Member

for  Anson  succeeded in persuading the  Barisan

Sosialis to move a resolution for complete merger,

even if it would mean the control of education

and labour policies by the Central Government. In

fact,  the  Member for Anson, during the  debate

last  year  on  merger,  was  so  excited  at  the

prospect  of  having  found  an  alliance  in  the

Barisan  Sosialis and so delighted  that  he  had

found  a  new  formula that he had this  to  say

(Hansard, Vol. 15, No. 7, col. 583):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, I do not want to exaggerate. I cannot

exaggerate.  But  I shall put it very  simply.  In

fact,   Sir,  I  will  be  quite  frank  that   if

education   and   labour  were   given   to   the

Federation,   the  White  Paper  would   be   more

acceptable  to me, and I do not care if  it  means

the end of my political career.'



<br><br>Members of this House will remember the Member for

Anson's public announcement   that   he   was   finished   with

politics after he had resigned as Chief Minister

and failed to appear in a by-election in Cairnhill. We all know too well by now how much weight we can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>



attach  to the words of the Member for Anson.  The

history of his political antics shows that  he  is

one  of the denizens of never, never land. Those

who  live  in never, never land never, never  mean

what  they  say.  The Member for  Anson  was  so

delighted  that  he had found an alliance  in  the

Barisan Sosialis - continued in Hansard, Vol. 15, No. 7, col. 566:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, I must say that I learned with some

surprise   and   delight  from  the   Member   for

Queenstown that his Party - to me, as far as  I  can

understand, a Party that represents the industrial

Chinese   worker,  I  do  not   know   about   the

others - were prepared to accept Federation  control

of education policy, and I say hear, hear!'



<br><br>Now  if the Barisan Sosialis, or for that matter

the  Member for Hong Lim and the Member for Anson,

are   sincere  about  their  declarations,  then

rightly they should go out and propagate to  the

people  that they wish for complete merger  with

the  Federation  even if  it  means  control  of

education  and  labour policies by  the  Central

Government.  But have they really done  that?  Mr

Speaker,  they  have instead been  spending  their

time  in  denouncing the referendum and the  White

Paper  proposals. What is astounding is  that  the

Barisan Sosialis should, within the space of one

year,  have  changed  its stand  on  merger  three

times.  Three  times! First, they wanted  internal

self-government  without  the  Internal  Security

Council - the British to retain foreign affairs  and

defence. After this idea had been ridiculed by the

people,  they  advocated merger like  Penang  and

Malacca.  When  this new line was pointed  out  to

them  as  a mistake by the Member for Anson  and

the  Member for Hong Lim, they proposed in  this

House  complete  merger, even if  it  meant  the

control  of education and labour policies  by  the

Central Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, can the people of Singapore allow a political Party like the Barisan Sosialis to

be  in charge of the destiny of their future when

such  a  political Party has no  firm  stand,  no

fixed    policies   and   has   no    idea    what

constitutional changes mean to the livelihood of

the  people:  a  Party like the  Barisan  Sosialis

which  takes  directives,  from  outside,  which

takes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>



directives  or  advice even from their  opponents,

the  Member for Hong Lim and the Member for Anson?

Even  the erstwhile revolutionaries in the Barisan

Sosialis  have lost confidence in their own  Party

and  in  their  leadership. We know, Mr  Speaker,

that   the   Secretary-General  of   the   Barisan

Sosialis,  Mr  Lim  Ching  Siong,  dispatched   a

mystery  letter  to  the  Prime  Minister  of  the

Federation, and by hand too. What the contents  of

this  letter are, we do not know. I do not believe

that  any  of  the 13 Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen

knows what is in this letter either.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Shame!



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Could it be another change in

the stand of the Barisan Sosialis on merger? Or is

this  a  secret sell-out? All these antics of  the

Barisan Sosialis clearly show their immaturity  in

the  handling of public affairs. We dread to think

of the consequences if the affairs of this country

are   allowed  to:  be  managed  by  the   Barisan

Sosialis. The Barisan Sosialis can feed the people

with  slogans. But the people will remain  hungry.

What  the  people want is an assurance that  they

will  have  food to eat and water  to  drink.  Not

Barisan  falsehoods and slogans rammed down  their

throats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, two days ago, the Member for Anson made

great   play   about  the  spirit  of   the   Reid

Constitutional Report. In fact, he  had  moved  an

amendment, which reads: 'merger as a state  on  an

equal  basis  with  the other eleven  states  with

automatic Federation citizenship for all Singapore

citizens in accordance with the spirit of the Reid

Report  and  the constitutional documents  of  the

Federation, 1948 and 1957.'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the Deputy

Prime  Minister  is right when he  says  that  the

amendment was moved. Notice was given but  it  was

not moved.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, for

the  correction. The amendment was not moved,  but

notice  of  the  amendment was given  along  these

lines. The Member for Anson goes back to 1948  and

1957. But he forgets that we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>



are  living in 1962. The spirit of the Reid Report

is  already  embodied in the Constitution  of  the

Federation   of  Malaya.  This  Constitution   was

gazetted  on  11th December, 1957. In  so  far  as

those  clauses  relating to the admission  of  new

territories  and  the question of  citizenship  by

incorporation  of territories are concerned,  this

Constitution still holds good. Article  2  of  the

Constitution says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Parliament by law may admit other States to the

Federation.'



<br><br>And Article 22 states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If any new territory is admitted to the

Federation  in pursuance of Article 2,  Parliament

may  by  law  determine what, persons  are  to  be

citizens  by reason of their connection with  that

territory  and the date or dates from, which  such

persons are to be citizens.'



<br><br>It  means,  in fact, that there is no question  of

automatic  citizenship as demanded by the  Barisan

Sosialis, the Member for Anson and the Member  for

Hong Lim. Indeed, the Member for Anson argued that

there  was  no  provision for  the  transfer  of

automatic    citizenship   in    the    Federation

Constitution.   How   those  citizens   who   have

connection  with the territory that  has  joined

the  Federation after 1957 can become citizens  of

the  Federation can only be decided by an  Act  of

the Federation Parliament. This means that finally

it  is  the  Federation Government which  must  be

responsible  for  passing  this  Act.   Therefore,

citizenship proposals must be negotiated with  the

Federation  Government.  To  claim  for  automatic

citizenship is quite contrary to the provisions of

the Federation Constitution. To ask the people  to

vote  for something for which no provision is made

constitutionally is indeed to deceive the  people.

After  he had spent considerable time reading  the

Report  of the Reid Commission and arguing in  its

favour, we were indeed astounded that the  Member

for  Anson announced, that he did not wish to move

his amendment. The frivolity with which the Member

for  Anson  introduces motions and withdraws  them

shows  his  utter disregard for other  Members  of

this  House. We therefore cannot regard him  as  a

man to be considered seriously.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Barisan Sosialis, the U.P.P. and the

Workers' Party are honest in their intention for a

closer relationship with the Federation, then they

ought to adopt a more realistic attitude and  seek

to  explain  to  the  people what  can  really  be

achieved now instead of dangling objectives  which

they  know  very  well cannot be obtained  in  the

immediate future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the Barisan Sosialis opposed the

amendment  of the Member for Cairnhill  to  add  a

third   alternative  in  the  proposals  for   the

referendum.  This  proposal  by  the  Member   for

Cairnhill  suggested that Singapore  should  enter

Malaysia  on  no  less favourable terms  than  the

Borneo  territories. Let me remind the House  that

during  the  debate on merger, one of  the  points

which  the Barisan Sosialis harped upon  was  that

whereas the Federation was prepared to accept  the

Borneo  territories as constituent States of  the

Federation. Singapore was being treated on a  less

favourable level. In fact, in their argument  they

suggested, that Singapore should be treated at par

with  the  Borneo territories. It  was  surprising

indeed   that  the  Member  for  Queenstown, the

Chairman  of  the  Barisan Sosialis,  should  have

opposed the entry of Singapore into Malaysia on no

less favourable terms than the Borneo territories.

This   stand  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis  can   be

explained in the light of our knowledge  of  their

opposition towards the formation of Malaysia.  The

Barisan Sosialis do not want Malaysia. Neither  do

they  want Singapore to enter Malaysia. Why,  Sir?

The  reason  is  that  the  Barisan  Sosialis  are

following  the  line of the P.K.I., the  Communist

Party  of  Indonesia, which opposes  the  Malaysia

Plan.  During the debate on West Irian, the Member

for  Thomson  let the cat out of the bag  why  the

Barisan was against Malaysia. Mr Speaker. I could

not get hold of a copy of Hansard for this debate,

and  I have to resort to newspaper reports of this

debate.  This was what the Straits Times  of  20th

January, 1962 (page 4) had to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`He [Mr Bani] said Malaysia was an anti-Indonesia plan. Mr David Marshall asked if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>



Mr  Bani would explain what he meant when he said

that Malaysia was an anti-Indonesia plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr  Bani  continued: "We have  been  accused  of

being anti-Malaysia. Our attitude is quite simple.

We support the concept of Malaysia."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that an original plan for Malaysia had

included  Indonesia, but the plan of  Tunku  Abdul

Rahman excluded Indonesia.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson cannot deny saying that

Malaysia  was anti-Indonesia because  it  did  not

include  Indonesia. In fact, during the debate  on

Malaysia,   the   Member  for   Anson   vigorously

protested  against  this  stand  of  the   Barisan

Sosialis.  I quote from the Straits Times  of  the

25th of January, 1962, page 12:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Referring to a statement made by Mr S. T. Barn

(Barisan-Thomson) during the debate on West  Irian

that  Malaysia  was anti-Indonesia,  Mr David Marshall

said he could not accept this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To say that the Malaysia Plan was anti-Indonesia

could  suggest  only one thing, that  the  Barisan

Sosialis  considered the North Borneo  territories

should  be  part  of Indonesia  and  not  part  of

Malaysia."'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ever since the Assembly and the people of

Singapore  became  involved  in  the  question  of

merger  and  Malaysia,  the  conspiracies  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis to prevent and hinder merger  to

stop  Malaysia  have  been exposed.  They  are  an

utterly  insincere and dishonest group  of  people

who  do  not have the national interest at  heart,

but only seek ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Bluff!



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> --- to promote the interest of the Communist movement in South-East Asia ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Do not bluff yourself!



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> It hurts them, Mr Speaker.

As  stooges  of the P.K.I., they are  prepared  to

stoop  to the strategy of fighting the referendum,

fighting merger and Malaysia and all this  against

the national interest of Singapore, the Federation

and  the  Borneo territories. In this very  debate

itself,   the  Barisan  Sosialis  in  their   last

desperate moments once more reveal with  ease  the

fluidity with which they change their stand.  They

move one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>



amendment to the motion we are debating. But  even

before  a  vote had been taken on this  amendment,

the leader of the Barisan Sosialis, the Member for

Queenstown,   indicated  that  his   Party   would

introduce another amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the antics of the Barisan Sosialis are of no

avail, because the people have no confidence in

their Party which seeks to remove the British ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Why do you not try ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Let me repeat it so that they

can  hear  it  better. The antics of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  are of no avail because the people  have

no confidence in their Party which seeks to remove

British colonialism in order to substitute another

type of foreign imperialism.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move an

amendment ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I just remind the hon.

Member  that he may speak on the motion  as  well,

because he is now speaking on the main motion.  He

will  not have another opportunity of speaking  on

the main motion. At the same time, he can move the

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> I seek your

guidance, Sir. Can I speak again on this?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am afraid not. The procedure is

that  the Member for Queenstown when he moved  his

amendment   was  speaking  on  the  main   motion.

Therefore,  he  is  now prohibited  from  speaking

again  on the main motion. The Member for  Thomson

has  not  done so as yet. The Member for Cairnhill

has  spoken on the main motion when he  moved  his

amendment. The Deputy Prime Minister has spoken on

the main motion. And now the Member for Thomson is

speaking  on the main motion. Any Member  who  has

not  as  yet spoken on the main motion may do  so.

But there is nothing to prevent those Members from

speaking on any amendments that may be moved now.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, as an

amendment,





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"at end, to add `or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) genuine merger of Singapore with the

Federation of Malaya, with Singapore entering  the

Federation as the twelfth state and with  all  its

Citizens  automatically becoming Federal  Citizens

on Merger Day'.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment will put forth in the

referendum a proposition which, in fact,  will  be

the  stand  of the Barisan Sosialis on the  merger

issue ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Another stand, is it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I do not wish to comment on what

the   Deputy  Prime  Minister  has  said  at  this

juncture ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> You had better not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> --- and he will get his answers in good

time. The only direct comment that I want to  make

is that I am sure he does not believe half of what

he has said just now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this concept of merger has been supported by

the  Workers' Party and the United People's  Party

in  this  Assembly in November last year. I  refer

you.  Mr  Speaker, to col. 406 of the  debate  of

21st November, 1961. You will note, Sir, that  the

proposition I now make to be put to the people is,

in  fact, word for word, the same as the amendment

moved  on  21st  November, 1961, to  the  P.A.P.

Government motion on the reunification of the  two

territories.  You  will  recall,  Sir,  that  this

amendment  was  opposed  by  the  P.A.P. and  was

subsequently defeated in this Assembly.  Sir,  the

sentiments  on this amendment have been thoroughly

discussed in the debate held last year. Our points

of  view have been explained clearly and they  are

in black and white in the records of the Assembly.

I do not propose to repeat them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been said that the Barisan Sosialis

made a mistake in asking for complete merger.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> He thinks of getting complete

merger.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Government Members, to

substantiate their allegation, have attempted  to

quote  the Member for Hong Lim as though he is  an

authority  on Barisan affairs, as saying  that  we

had made a mistake ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Certainly, the Barisan ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I ask the

Deputy Prime Minister not to interject so often?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> To some extent, Sir, they

have  also  tried to quote the Member  for  Anson.

But,  as  you  are  aware, Mr Speaker.  Sir,  the

Member  for  Anson  has refuted  this.  Today  the

P.A.P. use half truths and untruths to keep  this

afloat.  The  Member for Hong  Lim  once  used  an

analogy of the Johore type of merger.

Sir, the P.A.P. has twisted that to mean

that he wants the Johore type of merger. Sir, I do

not  want to suggest that the Menther for Hong Lim

has  made  a mistake. In all fairness to  him,  I

must  say  he  merely  made  the  analogy  in  the

context of a speech that he was making.  But  the

desperate  P.A.P. have tried to use that  to  make

political  capital.  The  Member  for  Hong   Lim

unwittingly played into the P.A.P. hands. Sir,  we

must  correct this and straighten it out once  and

for  all. There is no question of a mistake by the

Barisan.  Sir,  we have stated in  the  past  very

clearly  that we want merger. We have stated  that

we  want  complete merger. We have stated that  we

want a merger which is genuine and which can bring

about  genuine national unity. We have also stated

that, in our view, merger arrangements which  will

create different classes of citizens,  which will

only  further  the disunity among our  people  and

which  will deny the people of Singapore a  common

political life with their brothers and sisters in

the Federation, will not constitute genuine merger

and  will not bring about genuine national  unity.

There is no mistake about this, Mr Speaker.  The

records show clearly our stand. Because today the

P.A.P. are  politically bankrupt, they  seek  to

distort and use half truths and untruths to defend

their  actions which are detrimental to  national

unity. Therefore, Sir, they have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>



sought  to use our analogy of Penang and Malacca,

to use this completely out of context is order to

distort our stand, because they hope by doing this

they will show that our proposition will mean  the

disfranchisement  of half of our  citizens.  They

seek  to discredit us by saying that we want  half

of  our  citizens  to  lose  their  citizenship

rights.  They have done this in the  same  way  as

they  attempted to distort the analogy  of  Johore

which was used by the Member for Hong Lim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no mistake as I have already

stated.  We have clearly asked for genuine  merger

with all Singapore citizens automatically becoming

Federal citizens on merger. Just now, Mr Speaker,

Sir, while the Deputy Prime Minister was speaking,

he  sought to suggest that the call for  complete

internal self-government was inconsistent with the

stand of the Barisan Sosialis on the merger issue.

Sir,  I  do  not want to start the debate  on  the

whole question of reunification all over again. We

have dealt with this matter at great length in the

debate  on  the question of merger in  this  House

last year. This cheap tactic of the P.A.P. to  try

and distort is not going to help them one wee bit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they say that we are communal in our

approach and yet they seek to harp on autonomy  in

labour  and education. They say that the  Barisan

made  a  mistake  by asking for complete  merger,

because  in  a complete merger there  will  be  no

autonomy  in  education and labour.  Sir,  in  all

honesty,  if  the Government Members would  admit,

they  would  say  that this  is  directed  at  the

Chinese  population in Singapore, and  they  have

the  cheek  to  stand up and say that  it  is  the

Barisan Sosialis that is playing the Chinese line.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, I have no intention of re-opening the

debate  on the whole question of merger. We  have

debated  it at great length and our conscience  is

clear  because we have no dirt to hide. As I  also

said,  we are not the least perturbed at all these

twists   and   turns,  at  all  these   lies   and

distortions of the P.A.P.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister said that what the

Government  offer are realistic alternatives.  We

dispute this, Mr Speaker,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>



Sir.  Our  people  should not be  compelled  to

choose  one of these alternatives simply  because

the  P.A.P. consider  them realistic.  What  the

P.A.P. consider  realistic is  not  necessarily

good  for  our  people. It is  not  interest  of

national reunification. When the P.A.P. say  that

these  alternatives are realistic, what they  do,

in fact, mean is necessarily in the

that  these  are  terms which are acceptable  to

the  Government  of  the Federation  of  Malaya.

Surely,  Sir, what the Federation is prepared  to

accept is not necessarily good for the people  of

Singapore;  it is not necessarily  fair  to  the

people of Singapore.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we in the Barisan Sosialis refuse to

accept  the  position where  merger  terms  for

Singapore are dictated by a handful of people

in  the  Federation of Malaya. The fate of  the

people  of  Singapore should not be  made  to

depend  on  the charity of a few men  who  hold

power

in their hands in the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, merger must mean genuine national

reunification of Singapore and the Federation

of  Malaya. It must mean the genuine national

unity  of our people. This cannot be achieved

if  the people of Singapore are going  to  be

treated as slaves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. say, "Merger now or never."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> I

never said that. "Merger now

or later." There will be merger.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> They say that if there is to be no

merger now there will be no merger forever. The

Prime Minister obviously denies this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I never said that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> He will have his opportunity of

refuting  what  I said. But there  has  been  a

suggestion  in the past that either you  accept

merger on whatever the terms now or you will be

doomed  forever. Sir, this has been put to  the

Opposition in this House. This has been  put

to  the  people of Singapore in the  form  of

threats,  and the impression the P.A.P. seek

to  create is this: if we do not have  merger

on  the terms they propose, then that would be

the end of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>



Singapore. That, in short, simply means  that

either you have merger now on the terms  that

the  Federation  Government are  prepared  to

give,  or  you  do  not have  merger  in  the

future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Nonsense!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> However, we do not subscribe ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. This is a debate of some

importance.  Perhaps the Prime  Minister  would

like to get up now on a point of elucidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, never at any time

will anybody in his right mind suggest that if

there  is  no merger now there is  to  be  no

merger  forever,  for one very  simple  reason:

that   the   analysis  is  that   merger   is

inevitable.   It   either  takes   place   now

peacefully by consent or it will take place  at

some  subsequent time with a  great  deal  of

trial  and  tribulation amidst general commotion

for everybody and unhappiness for the whole of

Malaya, including Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, if the P.A.P. Government

seriously  believe that merger is inevitable - as

we  do  believe  that  merger  is  historically

inevitable - we say that if today we cannot  get

terms  that  are  fair and  reasonable  to  our

people, we shall wait. We shall not be bullied

and  bulldozed into accepting terms  that  are

unreasonable because the P.A.P. want  to  save

their  political career. I say that  if  they

are  honest in saying that they believe  merger

to be historically inevitable, then there is

no  need  for this unnecessary hate.  Sir,  we

believe   that  national  reunification   is

inevitable  and  I say that if we have to wait for terms - if at all we have to wait; in the first place, we  are  not  sure

whether  we  have  to wait,  we  are  not  sure

whether the Federation Government will  refuse

out request for automatic Federal citizenship ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of

elucidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I would like to

refer the hon. Member to a letter written by the

Prime Minister of the Federation - which  was as a result of a formal  exchange

of  letters - tabled in this  House, dated  13th

November,  1961, and it is stated in the  second

last paragraph of this letter:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`May I reiterate that the argument that all

Singapore Citizens at the time of merger  should

automatically   become  Federation   citizens

cannot     find     acceptance     under     our

Constitution?'



<br><br>This  is a formal document which has been tabled

in this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I shall shortly deal with the

constitutional   aspect  of  getting   automatic

citizenship. But what I do want to say here at

this  moment  is briefly this. We consider  that

the  P.A.P. are not in a position to  negotiate

terms with the Federation Government.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> There is nothing to stop you from

negotiating with them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, one cannot negotiate for terms

if  one  does  not  have the moral  standing  to

negotiate for them. Sir, the Government of the

Federation of Malaya is not naive. The  men  who

hold  power  in the Federation of  Malaya  are

fully  aware  of  the political  situation  in

Singapore and they know to what extent  the

P.A.P. command  the support of the  people  of

Singapore.  They know - although  they  may  not

admit  it - that today the P.A.P. are  not  in  a

position  to  express  the feelings  of  the

people.  They are morally not in a  position  to

negotiate   for  terms  for  the   people   of

Singapore.  The  Member for cairnhill  indicated

this  many times when he made fun of  the  so-called  autonomy in labour and education  which

the  P.A.P. say had been got  as a result  of

hard bargaining.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is clear that today the White Paper

terms are being given to the

P.A.P.  Government and they have no other choice

than to accept these terms. Our call have  a

conference  of all the Parties in  Singapore  so

that  a  common   stand could  be  put  to  the

Federation Government on the terms was not  accepted

by the P.A.P. And today the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>



Prime  Minister says that we can negotiate.  We

tell  the  P.A.P., Sir, that if  they  seriously

want   us  to  negotiate  for  terms,  let  them

dissolve  this Assembly, hold the elections  and

whichever   party  that  Comes  to  power   can

negotiate  for  terms. They would  then  have  a

fresh  and  direct mandate from  the  people  of

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I was saying, if we have to wait for

better  terms, in our view, that does  not  mean

that  we will never have merger. The Federation

Government  are bound to change their  views  if

they  do not want to accept our terms just  now.

Sir,  it  is  well known that at one  time  they

said, "No merger under any circumstances."  But

now they are prepared to consider merger of some

sort.  Sir, this is a sure indication that their

views  are  bound to change further. And  I  say

that this is historically inevitable. Of course,

the  P.A.P. cannot wait. We understand why  they

say this. We have stated time and again that the

interest   the  P.A.P. have  in  these   merger

proposals  is only to the extent that they  will

save  their political career. We have  no  doubt

whatsoever that the fate of the P.A.P. rests on

their White Paper merger proposals, and that  is

why  there  is this hate, that is why  there  is

going to be this unfair referendum, and that is

why the P.A.P. say that they cannot wait.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. keep on saying that it is

impossible to get Federal citizenship  for  all

Singapore    citizens.   Sir,    the    Federal

Constitution, particularly Article 22, makes  it

possible   for  the  Federation  Government   to

determine the terms for any territory on  merger

with  the Federation. That Article, as in  fact

the  Member for Anson has indicated earlier, has

been inserted in the constitution primarily  for

the purposes of deciding on terms on merger of a

new territory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a lot of words have been uttered by the

P.A.P. to  try  and  ridicule  our  call   for

automatic Federal citizenship. Sir, by automatic

citizenship,  we  do  not mean  that  the  Prime

Minister  has  only to go to the Federation  and

play  golf  and  on Merger Day  every  Singapore

Citizen  will  automatically become  a  Federal

citizen. We have never suggested this. We  have

never suggested that we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>



can  get automatic Federal citizenship if we do not

talk it over with the Federation of Malaya. We have

said  that  this  is  a  matter  that  has  to   be

negotiated   and   we  say  again  that   automatic

citizenship is something that has to be  negotiated

with the Federation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> What makes you think you can

write it into the Constitution?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, this is yet another point on which

the  P.A.P. have sought to bluff the people.  I  do

not  want  to  say anything more at  this  juncture

[Interruption] because at the right time and at the

right  place, not too long, you will know what  the

contents of the letters are. I must say this  here,

Sir. This is a reflection of the P.A.P. tactics.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Barisan Sosialis!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> The Prime Minister, as a private chap,

sent  a private letter to some close colleagues  of

his  in maybe some part of the Federation on things

that have got to do with the political life of this

country.  His Central Executive Committee does  not

know  what letter he sent. Sir - the Member for  Bras

Basah  is  not  here - only recently  she  said  that

although  she was a member of the Central Executive

Committee of the P.A.P., she did not know what  was

happening  in the P.A.P. And the 13 of  us  in  the

Barisan  Sosialis  know  that  this  is  how   they

operate.    But - and     this      is      thought

projection - because  they do this,  they  think  we

also know.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of elucidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> All my correspondence with the

Tunku  has  been published. It has been  tabled  in

this  House,  and there is nothing to  prevent  the

Member for Thomson from publishing his exchange  of

letters.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think yesterday we had a promise

from  the  Member  for  Choa Chu  Kang  that  those

letters would be published, or one letter would  be

published. Now the Member for Thomson



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>



has indicated that they will be published. So

perhaps  the  Prime  Minister  can  be  a  little

patient.  That  letter will be  published,  as  I

understand from the remarks made.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> They keep saying more - that it is a

sell-out,  that this is this, and this  is  that.

But at the end they will know ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Eat their words.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> --- that they will have to eat their

words;  yes, that is right. But anyway I  do  not

want to deal with this matter at this moment.

the Government side seething with impatience. The

letter will come, I understand.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, as I said, we have stated that

automatic  Federal citizenship is a  matter  that

has to be negotiated. We say that again that this

is  a matter that has to be negotiated. Sir, here

it  is interesting to recount the P.A.P. lies  on

citizenship.   Once   they  said   that   Federal

citizenship   for  all  Singapore  citizens   was

impossible.   When  we  exposed   this   lie   by

explaining that under the Federal Constitution it

was  possible  for the Federation  Government  to

grant  Federal  citizenship to all our  citizens,

the  P.A.P. changed their line. This  time  they

said  it  was  reasonable. When we again  exposed

this,  they  again changed their line.  And  this

time they talked in terms of super merger. Sir, I

am  sure we have never heard of this term  "super

merger" when the merger issue was debated in this

House.  The  super merger talk  only  came  about

after  the debate on the Referendum Bill started.

They  said,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that  the  Barisan

wanted  more merger than the P.A.P. Sir, we  tell

them:  we do not want more merger or less merger.

What  the  P.A.P. seek to do is to get  something

very much less than merger. We want merger.

has an opportunity to speak on this amend, ment.

He will no doubt be given the opportunity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, we do not want less merger or more

merger. We want merger that will genuinely bring

about national reunification.

make our people second-class.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> How second-class?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> The P.A.P. attempt to hold a

dishonest referendum, because they know that  if

they   hold  a  genuine  referendum,  an  honest

referendum,  the people will show  them  whether

what  they  are getting is merger, less  merger,

bogus merger, or what have they.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, on a point of

elucidation.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Member for Thomson

mentioned second-class citizens. I have  already

made  it  clear  that  in  the  opinion  of  the

distinguished lawyer with him in his anti-merger

campaign, there is no second-class citizen,  and

I would be greatly obliged if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>



he  would  just  answer the  questions  which  I

raised   yesterday.  Please   do   Second-class

citizen - how?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We are in open meeting.

Perhaps  in  Committee straight talk across  the

Table  is  permissible sometimes. But I  do  not

propose to answer those questions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not propose

to  answer  those  questions apart  from  saying

"yes".  I am not a legal man and I am not  using

"second-class citizen" as a legal term. I am not

interested    in   what   legally   second-class

citizenship means. I am a layman and there are

not very many lawyers out of 1.6 million people.

The   vast  majority  of  them,  99.9  per  cent

recurrent,  are laymen like me,  and  they  know

that if on merger there is going to be no common

political life given to the people, if they  are

not  going  to  be  given the  same  rights  and

privileges  as  the citizens  in  the  11  other

States  in  the Federation of Malaya, then  they

are treated as second-class citizens.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> How?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You wait.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, the P.A.P.'s attempt to hold a

dishonest  referendum is, in fact, to  escape  a

categorical  rejection  of  their  White   Paper

proposals.  Sir, the White Paper  proposals  are

"no   merger",   and  this   is   no   Communist

propaganda.   This  is  what  the   Member   for

Cairnhill has said over and over again. He  says

it is merely a form of closer relationship. Sir,

the  Barisan is quite rightly against the  White

Paper  proposals which the P.A.P. are trying  to

sell as merger.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You want complete merger.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> We are told that the White Paper is

merger. The Member for Cairnhill, who is a  more

trusted friend of the Federation Government than

our Prime Minister ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member will not give way.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, the Member for Cairnhill, who

is  a  more  trusted friend of the Federation  of

Malaya  than our Prime Minister is, says this  is

no  merger.  The  White Paper  proposals  do  not

constitute  merger. And we say it is not  merger.

But when we say this is not a merger, they say we

want  to  frustrate merger. Why do they  not  say

that  the  S.P.A. also want to frustrate  merger,

because   the   S.P.A. say   this   is   closer

relationship? The S.P.A. say this is no merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. want a referendum on the White

Paper because they are committed to holding  one.

We  want  a fair referendum. This the P.A.P. are

not  prepared  to  hold, because  they  know  the

people will reject the White Paper proposals in a

fair  and  reasonable referendum. The  Government

oppose  the  amendment moved by  the  Member  for

Queenstown  which  would  have  meant  only   one

question.  Now,  Sir,  we  move  this  amendment,

knowing  full well that this is not going  to  be

just  one  question  but alternatives.  And  this

amendment  will  put  our  stand  to  the  people

clearly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the only decent thing the Government can

do  is  to accept the amendment. The Deputy Prime

Minister says we do not have the support  of  the

people;  he says we are inconsistent; we  do  not

have   consistent  policies.  The  Deputy   Prime

Minister  has  even  suggested  that  we  made  a

mistake  by asking for complete merger, and  that

only   their  proposals  for  merger   are   fair

proposals and only those will be accepted by  the

people.  Here,  Sir, there is an opportunity  for

them   to   accept   the   challenge - accept   the

amendment;  the stand of the Barisan Sosialis  as

has been debated in this House last year at quite

some  length. Then we will see what  the  outcome

is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a referendum is to ascertain the views of

our  people.  It is not to force  the  people  to

support   the   White   Paper   proposals.    The

Government's  obligation is to  put  the  Barisan

proposals to the people. It is not for the P.A.P.

to decide whether the proposal is good or bad. It

is for the people to decide. If this amendment is

accepted, Sir, and if this proposal is put to the

people, we will accept the verdict of the  people

whichever way it goes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for  Cairnhill  has  done a  lot  of  somersaults

before.  But last night he said very clearly  and

categorically that he would like to  present  all

forms  of merger to the people. He said he  would

support  that. And that was why he presented  the

third  question. Now we have put  up  the  fourth

question   which  embodies  the  stand   of   the

Opposition  as  was  debated in  the  Legislative

Assembly last year. Although the S.P.A. did  not

support  our amendment then, I think, to be  fair

to  himself as well as to everybody and  to  make

sure he will not have to eat his own words again,

the  Member  for  Cairnhill  should  support  our

amendment, because it will allow a chance to  the

people to have a real choice of all the forms  of

merger which the political Parties in this  House

have put forward.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you see the alternatives which are put

before the House at the present moment, the first

two  are from the P.A.P., the third is supposedly

from the S.P.A. But, as I have already indicated,

they  all come from the same source and have  the

same  theme.  They are all tailored to  suit  the

whims and fancies of Federal politicians and,  of

course,  since they are acceptable to the Federal

politicians, they are presented to the House. But

let us ask all our representatives in this House:

let them ask themselves solemnly whether they are

representatives  of the people of  Singapore,  or

whether   they   are   representatives   of   the

Federation.  Let  us  ask them:  when  they  were

elected  to  this Assembly, whether  the  general

elections  were  held  in  Kuala  Lumpur  or   in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Peking.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Not in Peking either.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I do not know whether our

Prime  Minister was elected in Tanjong Pagar  or

in   Tanjong   Rambutan!  Because   if   we   are

representatives of Singapore, then we must  speak

on behalf of the interests of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And not ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Peking.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> --- for the interests of other

places.  I remember, Sir, that the Prime  Minister

last year during the merger debate suggested to us

that  we  could  ask  Mr Lim Kean  Siew  and  Mr

Seenivasagam  of  the  Socialist  Front  and   the

Progressive Party respectively to put a motion  in

the   Federal  Parliament  to  suggest   automatic

citizenship   on  merger.  That   is   an   absurd

suggestion and that alone goes to prove  that  our

suggestion  of  automatic  citizenship   was   not

unrealistic. Even the Tunku himself said so,  that

it  was  possible. At that time he said  the  only

thing was that he would not grant it. That is all.

But  it  was possible. That is the point which  we

want  to  stress, and what the Member for  Thomson

has already stressed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only trouble with our Prime Minister and the

P.A.P. is  that  they went to negotiate  on  bended

knees and they never had the support of the people

of  Singapore behind them. I do not want to repeat

what the Member for Thomson has already said.  The

fact  that  our stand on merger is  good  is  even

admitted  by  the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Minister  for Education the other night. He  said,

"Yes, the Barisan Sosialis stand is very good."



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> He does not understand it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The only thing, he said, was

that   it   was   not  realistic.   Let   us   ask

him - realistic to whom? To himself or to the people

of   Singapore?  Of  course,  Sir,  it  may  sound

unrealistic to certain people, perhaps  to  P.A.P.

politicians, or perhaps to Federation  politicians

at  the  present moment, or to the Prime  Minister

who  has to run to the Federation for succours  in

order that he may get the hand-outs to keep him in

office.   But  to  us  in  Singapore,   Sir,   our

suggestion    for   automatic   citizenship    and

proportional representation is very realistic.  To

us  it means the only basis for merger. It is  the

only  fair and just basis for merger, because,  as

you  know, Sir, merger is not only a merger of two

territories  but also a merger of two peoples.  If

you want to have merger, then you



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>

must have the mutual consent of the peoples of the

two territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conditions of merger must work towards

mutual  interest and mutual benefit. That  is  the

only  way we can have a happy merger and  a  happy

Malaysia.  If  you have one party having  all  the

advantages over the other, you are just laying the

ground for future trouble. That would not lead  to

national   unity.  It  would  lead   to   national

disunity, as we have stressed time and time again.

Therefore, when we talk of merger - even if we  want

to  talk  on  the  mode and manner of  merger - our

choices  must not be limited to what other  people

want to accept. The choices must be on what we  in

Singapore  want. I hope the Front  Bench  on  this

side  of  the  House as well as  the  P.A.P. will

realise this. It is only when you really ascertain

the  views of the people in Singapore that you can

say  that  you have an honest referendum.  If  you

pose questions which are limited to the choices of

the  P.A.P., then it is ascertaining the views  of

the  P.A.P. and  not  of the  people.  The  Prime

Minister  himself  has repeatedly  said  that  the

referendum  is  to  ascertain  the  views  of  the

majority of the people of Singapore - the views  of

the  people of Singapore, and not the views of the

P.A.P.  Let  him  remember  that.  In  any  honest

referendum,  the  people  should  be  allowed   an

opportunity to express their wishes and choice  on

the  mode and manner - even if they insist  on  this

"mode  and  manner". From our point  of  view,  we

think  that  our  stand on merger - complete  merger

with   automatic   citizenship  and   proportional

representation - will  have  the  backing   of   the

majority of the people of Singapore. Therefore, if

the   P.A.P. want  to  put  up  a  semblance   of

honesty - they  are  not  honest;  everybody   knows

it - but even if they want to put up a semblance  of

honesty - let them accept our amendment and put  up

our  stand for the people to accept or reject. The

Member  for Anson gave a very picturesque  analogy

the  other  day. He spoke about a girl wanting  to

get  married to a man. If she wants to get married

to  A, it does not mean that she must accept B, C,

or  D who happens to come along. Surely she has  a

right  to  wait until A comes along. Of course  on

merger, Sir, we can wait. The only trouble



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>



with  the Prime Minister is that he cannot  afford

to  wait,  because merger to him is the  means  of

political survival. Without merger he knows he  is

finished.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> He is finished anyway.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes, I agree. He is finished

anyway.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It seems to be a habit in

this  Chamber  for  supporters  of  a  speaker  to

interject.  I have never come across that  in  any

other Parliament. We get interjections from across

the  Floor,  but  not  from Back-benches.  And  it

happens on both sides of the House.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The whole trouble with our

Prime   Minister  is  that  he  wants  to  deliver

Singapore  bound hand and foot to  the  Federation

because - I do not know - maybe he hopes to be  a  Tun

sometime, maybe he hopes to get a safe seat in the

Senate; maybe he is thinking of becoming a  United

Nations representative, and somebody has said that

he  is  looking forward to being the Deputy  Prime

Minister  of  Malaysia. I do not know.  Anyone  of

these is a possibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> In fact, he is a Prime Minister!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But the main thing is this.

If  we  are to go in, we must go in on terms which

are  fair and just to the people of Singapore, not

just  to  the P.A.P. Let them remember this.  They

always give the excuse that the White Paper merger

proposals were the best that they could get.  They

say  that those were the best possible terms  that

they  could  get.  The  Member  for  Thomson   has

stressed  that  at  that  time  they  were  in  no

position  to  negotiate, and therefore  how  could

they  get better terms? On this particular aspect,

even  the Secretary-General of the S.P.A. has,  on

many  occasions, publicly stated that the  present

terms  are not the best possible terms. The Member

for  Cairnhill also says he could get better terms

for  Singapore  on merger; let him deny  it  after

this.  Therefore,  those so-called  best  possible

terms  are not the best possible terms. The Member

for Thomson reminded us that at one time the Tunku

did  not want merger. Now they have come round  to

wanting merger. We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>



know  for a fact that they want Singapore so  much

that if only we stand firm the terms will have  to

be  improved. It is not that we want to  get  into

the  Federation. It is the Federation  wanting  to

take  in  Singapore.  Let us  remember  that  very

carefully.  The mere fact that the P.A.P. had  to

reveal  the terms of the merger proposals  bit  by

bit showed that they were afraid that their merger

proposals would not be acceptable to the  people..

They  already realised then that they had to  hide

their   shameful  deal  from  the  eyes   of   the

people - always    talking    of    nationals    and

citizenship!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I be permitted to refer to what the Minister

for  Finance  said? I refer, Sir, to the  Official

Report of the 10th of July, at page 39, [Vol.  19,

No. 2, col. 195] the last paragraph. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, the truth of the matter is that Singapore

citizens  retain  all  the rights  that  they  now

possess.'



<br><br>Quite right, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In addition, they acquire new rights as

nationals of the new Federation.'



<br><br>What  are the new rights of the nationals? As  far

as we know, Sir, they have the right to possess  a

passport;  they  have  the right  to  being  equal

before  the  courts. But these,  Sir,  are  rights

which  we  possess  in Singapore  at  the  present

moment. So what are those new special rights which

the  Minister for Finance talked about? Any person

in  a  democratic society is equal in a  court  of

law. Why must they be nationals before they can be

equal in a court of law? In Singapore, we have our

Singapore  passports. Does it make any  difference

whether we get our passports from Kuala Lumpur  or

from  Singapore?  But  the  one  thing  which  the

Minister for Finance has not dared to say is this:

by  becoming  nationals, Singapore  citizens  will

have  the  right  to  be called  up  for  military

service. Now this is an obligation and a duty  and

also  a  right in a way. But if you want a man  to

fight  for a country, make sure that he  gets  all

the  rights and privileges of that country. Do not

treat him as a second-class citizen and ask him to

fight for that country. This is a sell-out of  the

P.A.P.  They  talk of merger. Yet after merger,  the

Singapore  citizen who becomes a Federal  national

or  a  Malaysian  national  has  to  go  into  the

Federation as an alien and will be treated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>



like  an  alien  because he cannot  have  all  the

rights  and  privileges of a Federal citizen.  How

can   you   call   this   "merger"   under   those

circumstances?  Let me go further  down  the  same

paragraph. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A Singapore citizen now enjoys certain basic

political  rights.  He has a right  of  franchise,

that is, he has a right to choose who shall govern

Singapore.'



<br><br>And  somewhere a few lines from the bottom of  the

page, he says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`He loses none of these rights after merger.'



<br><br>I was very interested to read about the comparison

of the pros and cons of the P.A.P. type of merger.

He  says,  "He  loses none of these  rights  after

merger."  I challenge that statement.  Let  us  go

back to the fifth line of the paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`He has a right of franchise, that is, he has a

right to choose who shall govern Singapore.'



<br><br>Very  right,  Sir - "He has a right  to  choose  who

shall  govern Singapore." But let us ask him  what

sort  of Government will he choose? Will he choose

a  Government that has the powers that we have  at

the  present  moment? Is that not  something  that

will  be lost? At the present moment, Sir, however

weak  we  may  be,  however  limited  our  powers,

Singapore still has three-sevenths of the power in

the Internal Security Council. But let us see what

happens  when  we go into the Central  Parliament.

Let us see what happens when we have this humbug of  a  merger.  We  will get fifteen  seats  in  an

enlarged   Parliament  of  say  150   seats.   The

proportion of power that Singapore will  get  will

be  15  upon 150. What is that? That is one-tenth.

From  three-sevenths of the power that we can  get

in  our  own Government, we are going to get  only

one-tenth  of the power, is that not a  reduction?

Is  that not something lost? I do not have to  say

anything  about  the 25 per cent  of  the  revenue

which   Singapore  will  lose   to   the   Central

Government. At the present moment, Sir, we control

every  cent  of our own money in Singapore.  After

this  humbug  of  a merger, 25  per  cent  of  the

revenue from Singapore will be controlled  by  the

Central Government in Kuala Lumpur. Is that not  a

loss?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whenever we say "second-class citizen", they

say  it  is  not  true. They say that  some  legal

opinion  has  been given saying that there  is  no

such thing as a second-class citizen. Second-class

citizenship,  Sir, is something  which  you  feel,

something which you know ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> Old tune.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I realise that the

Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

Education does not like to hear it because he  has

already sold out the rights of Singapore. We  have

already told him repeatedly, but he does not  like

to  hear  it I ask him to go out into the  streets

and  coffee-shops. Everybody will be able to  tell

him   something  which  he  does  not   understand

himself, that by encouraging this type of  merger,

they  are  going to turn Singapore  citizens  into

second-class citizens. They asked, "How  can  this

be  so?"  I have already indicated a little  while

back that our powers in our own Government will be

reduced. The citizens will not be able to elect  a

Government that will have full powers to deal with

our  own affairs in Singapore. As regards internal

security,  at  the present moment, we  still  have

three-sevenths of the power, whereas  once  we  go

into the Central Parliament we get only one-tenth.

Money? - one-quarter  gone.  But  what   is   more

important,  Sir - anybody will be  able  to  see  it

straightaway - is   that  at  the  present   moment,

Singapore    will   be   sending   only    fifteen

representatives to the Central Parliament. We have

624,000 citizens in Singapore. Let us do a  little

bit  of arithmetic, Sir. Divide 624,000 by 15, and

you  will  find that it works out to somewhere  in

the  region  of 41,000 citizens. In  other  words,

41,000  Singapore citizens will  be  electing  one

representative to the Central Parliament.  Let  us

look at the Central Parliament in Kuala Lumpur. At

the present moment, they have 104 seats, and their

total electorate is somewhere in the region of 2.3

million. I am not sure of the figure, Sir, but  it

is  approximately that. If you do a little bit  of

arithmetic and divide this 2.3 million citizens by

104,  you   will  find that you get  a  figure  of

21,000  or 22,000. In other words, 22,000 citizens

in the Federation will be able to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>



elect    one   representative   to   the   Central

Parliament.  In  the  case  of  Singapore,  41,000

citizens can elect only one representative to  the

Central Parliament. Any three-year old child  will

be able to tell our Government Ministers that that

means  our  citizenship value is nearly  half  the

citizenship  value of the Federation citizens.  If

you  add  on the rural weight-age, you  will  find

that  in  many  cases the value of  the  Singapore

citizenship is only a quarter of the value of  the

Federation  citizenship in certain  areas  in  the

Federation.  So  this second-class citizenship  is

clear. It is easily demonstrated and anybody  with

a  little  bit  of  feeling and a  little  bit  of

intelligence will be able to see straightaway ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Have you any?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But it looks as if such

intelligence  is not to be found in  our  Minister

for Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me refer again to the same transcript, page

43  [Vol.  19,  No. 2, cols. 201-2],  also  in  a

speech  by the Minister for Finance. It is in  the

third  paragraph.  He  was asking  how  would  the

Singapore  citizen  be  better  off  if   we   had

automatic  conversion, and he said he  could  only

see advantages in two respects:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`First, he will be able to stand for election in

the  Federation  general  election,  not  only  in

Singapore,  but  also in the Federation.  This  is

something  not  of  great  value  to  the  average

citizen who, if he wants to stand for election  to

the  Central  Parliament, can do so in  Singapore.

The  other additional benefit the average  citizen

gets  from automatic conversion is that he  will

be able to vote more easily in the Federation when

he changes his address and moves there.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he says these advantages are not of

fundamental  importance. You  see,  Sir,  how  the

Minister for Finance in his prepared speech talked

about    this   citizenship   right   being    not

fundamental.  He  thinks it is  of  no  importance

whatsoever.  He  belittles the  basic  fundamental

right in any parliamentary democracy. If we are to

rely on the one man one vote system, the only  way

to  make sure that you have your voice heard is to

see  that you have the voting right. If you do not

have  the  voting right, your voice is not  heard,

and   you  will  not  be  able  to  influence  the

Government or pressure the Government to make  any

new change you consider necessary. And here you



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>



see,  Sir,  the Minister for Finance  saying  that

these  are  not  important things. These  are  the

basic  and fundamental things. If you have merger,

Sir, it is a case of merger of the peoples and  of

all  the  peoples  coming together  and  having  a

common  political life. The citizens of  Singapore

should  have the right to go to the Federation  to

influence the Federation citizens, and vice versa,

so  that  the Central Parliament will be  able  to

pursue  a policy which will be acceptable  to  the

peoples of both the territories. It is only  then,

Sir,  that you can change the Government or change

the Ministers who do not happen to agree with your

views  at  periodic intervals. There is  no  other

way,  Sir,  and yet our Minister for Finance  says

this  is  unimportant. I know,  for  example,  the

Minister  for Finance stays in Cairnhill.  At  the

present  moment, he is the Member for Kreta  Ayer.

That  is  very far away, Sir, If he subscribes  to

this  policy of his, it amounts to this,  that  by

staying in Cairnhill he will not be able to go  to

Kreta  Ayer to stand for election, and if he wants

to go to Kreta Ayer to stand for election, then he

will  have to go to Kreta Ayer and stay there  for

10  years. Or our Deputy Prime Minister, who stays

in  Tanglin, will not be able to go to Rochore  to

stand for election ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> But I have.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is the whole trouble. You

have and yet you want to deny these rights ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have already remarked in

the  past that the Member for Queenstown loses his

temper  so  easily;  he  forgets  he  is  in  this

Chamber.  The  Speaker  is  trying  to  keep  this

Assembly as august as possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> He cannot behave himself.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> So, Sir, these are very

important  rights which the citizens of  Singapore

must  have. These are not unimportant trivialities

as  the Minister for Finance makes them out to be.

On  them  depend  all  the basic  and  fundamental

rights that operate in a parliamentary democracy.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Why do you not go to Malacca?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Then, Sir, may I refer you to

page  40?  I  want to refer to paragraph  2  [col.

196],  Sir.  The Minister for Finance was  talking

about   equality  before  the  law,   freedom   of

movement,  freedom of speech, and  all  that,  and

then in the second paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"`Except as expressly authorised by this

Constitution,  there  shall be  no  discrimination

against citizens on the ground only of religion.'"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to stress, Sir, on the words, "Except as

expressly   authorised  by   this   Constitution".

Therefore, Sir, what we have at the present moment

can easily be changed if the Central Parliament by

a motion change the constitution. As you may know,

Sir, not so very long ago, they had amendments  in

the  Federal  Constitution.  In  fact,  they  have

already   had   three  changes  in   the   Federal

Constitution in the short period of a  few  years.

So what guarantee do we have that there will be no

more changes again?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Go and join the Federation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is the point, Sir. He

says, "Go and join the Federation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have pulled up the Deputy

Prime  Minister once before. I would suggest  that

he  try  not to interject, because I might  remind

him  that  the  Speaker or the  Chairman,  whoever

takes  the Chair, relies to a great extent on  the

Leader of the House to keep order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> So, Sir, unless we have this

proportional representation in order to  have  our

influence  felt in the Central Parliament,  unless

we   have  the  possibility  of  going  into   the

Federation and influencing the voters or to  stand

for  election inside the Federation so that we can

get our voice heard inside the Federation, we will

not  be  able to exert any pressure at all on  the

Government   that   may   want   to   change   the

Constitution. It is simple logic, Sir, and I  hope

the   Minister  for  Finance  will  be   able   to

understand all this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a lot of play has been made about our letter

to  the  Tunku and it is a pity the Prime Minister

and the Minister for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>



Finance  are  not  here. They have  all  the  time

chided us to reveal the contents of, our letter to

the  Tunku.  We  had  not, wanted  to  reveal  the

letter,  Sir, not just to please them. No,  it  is

not our intention to make political capital out of

the letter which we sent to the Tunku. But  very

unfortunately for the Ministers opposite, they did

not know the actual contents, and because they did

not know, they sought deliberately to misinterpret

and  distort the contents of our letter  that,  we

sent to the Tunku. By so doing, they had hoped  to

convince their own Backbenches that our  letter

to  the  Tunku  was  to ask for special  terms  on

merger, and because we had refused to divulge what

is  in  that letter, therefore, that letter  meant

that the Tunku had refused us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will notice, Sir, that every time they talked

about  our  letter, they linked  it  up  with  the

letter  which  the Member for Anson wrote  to  the

Tunku,  and by so doing they had hoped  that  they

could  confuse their own supporters who - I  believe

there are some who are maybe dissatisfied with the

ways  of their leaders. As I say, Sir, it  is  not

our intention to make political capital out of our

exchange of letters, unlike the Prime Minister and

the  Ministers  of the P.A.P. who  will  stoop  to

almost  anything. May I at this  stage,  Sir,  say

that  when  our  Secretary-General  wrote  to  the

Tunku,  he  wrote  with the full approval  of  the

Central  Executive Committee. It is a  pity  their

Special  Branch did not know about  this.  Because

our  telephones are, all tapped and their  Special

Branch spies follow us around all the time.  I  am

sure  they must turn to MI5 now, if their  Special

Branch  does not prove to be good enough.  Anyway,

whatever  we  do  in the Barisan  Sosialis  we  do

collectively, unlike some of the P.A.P.  Ministers

who,  as  far as I remember, used to make speeches

and  those  speeches then became policies  of  the

Government.  That was a bit too  much  for  us  to

stomach  at  that  time and  because  of  that  we

ultimately had to leave the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I say, Sir, since the P.A.P. have been trying

to make political capital out of our letter to the

Tunku and since they have been trying to confuse

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>



mislead the people, I think it is appropriate  that

we now expose their lies and  innuendoes concerning

our  letter  which  had at  one  time  caused  a

sensation in the local Press. The P.A.P. at  first

fabricated   the  falsehood  about  our  Secretary-General having gone to hand a letter personally  to

the  Tunku,  until  we exposed  the  falsehood.  Of

course,  after  we had exposed the falsehood,  they

changed  their  line and now say  that  it  is  our

Assistant Secretary-General. That is quite true  as

we  pointed out at that time. Sir, since there  has

been so much talk about our letter, let me read out

the  contents  of the letter which  our  Secretary-General wrote to the Tunku. Before doing that,  may

I quote the Official Transcript of the 9th of July,

1962,  at  page 27 [Vol. 19, No. 1, col.  39];  the

Prime  Minister  was talking about the  Member  for

Anson having tried to write to the Tunku, and  then

he added:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And even the Communist-controlled Barisan

Sosialis,   through  their  open  front  Secretary-General,  Mr  Lim Ching Siong,  in  April,  a  few

months ago, sent a letter to Tunku Abdul Rahman  by

the  personal  hand  of  the  Assistant  Secretary-General.  What  the letter contains  presumably  is

only  known to the Secretary-General and the Tunku.

But everybody can guess what this gesture of peace-making  was aimed at. However, the very  fact  that

neither the letter nor the response of the Tunku to

the letter has ever been made public ---'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh Chin Chye: Even to the Chairman.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  Prime  Minister: ---  probably  even   to  the

Chairman of the Party, is in itself significant.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure you, Sir, this letter is somewhere in

the  middle of my April-May file. So the  original

copy  of the letter has been with me from the  very

first day. It is not that. I do not know about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I again refer you to page 39 [col. 58], Sir,

it is in the third paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Dr Goh Keng Swee: I hope the Member for

Queenstown will come to the point quickly. Now, his

Secretary-General has written a letter to the Tunku

---'.



<br><br>And then you pulled him up on a point of order. I

will  now read you the letter which we sent to  the Tunku. It is dated 27th March, 1962:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><div align="right">27th March 1962<br>

<br><br><div align="left">Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj,

<br><br>Prime Minister,

<br><br>The Federation of Malaya,

<br><br>Federation House,

<br><br>Singapore.</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Tunku,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We gladly welcome your desire to see the creation

of  one  country, sharing a common feeling, outlook

and  destiny.  We wish to assure you that  in  this

desire  for national unity, we are completely  with

you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like you, we also want to see that nothing will

come  about  that may cause any disruption  to  the

present  harmony existing among the people  of  our

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel that much of the unhappy feelings about

Singapore  have arisen from a lack of opportunities

for  apparently  divergent views to  be  adequately

discussed  so  that  a happy and  lasting  solution

could  be  obtained  for the  benefit  of  all  our

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we feel that a free and frank exchange of

views  and  discussion between us can contribute  a

great deal towards national unity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with this in mind that we take this

opportunity of your visit to Singapore to write  to

you,  hoping  you  will be  able  to  grant  us  an

opportunity to meet you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should you be unable to see us at this juncture,

we  would  be  glad to welcome any  other  occasion

convenient to you at any future date.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our best regards to you,



<pre>

                                                   I remain,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member knows the

rules.  After  a  document is read,  it  should  be

tabled.  Perhaps  the hon. Member  will  table  the

document.  Copies could be taken from the  original

document which could then be handed back.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> This is not the original, Sir;

this is only a copy of it. The original was sent to

the Tunku.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you see, Sir, it is a simple letter with no

asking   for   special  terms,  which   they   have

misconstrued. We never asked for anything  special.

We  merely asked for an interview in order that  we

might the better be able to present the Tunku  with

the  other  side  of the picture in  Singapore.  We

realised  that  the P.A.P. had given  the  Tunku  a

distorted   version  of  what  was   happening   in

Singapore,  and we felt it our duty to  present  to

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>



Tunku  the  proper side of the picture.  Then,  it

would be for the Tunku to decide, because, as  you

can  know by now, Sir, the P.A.P. are the greatest

of  distortionists  and fabricators.  It  is  only

right  and  proper that we in the Opposition,  who

have  had our views shut off from the radio,  from

Rediffusion  and  from  the  Press,  be  given  an

opportunity  to  tell the Tunku exactly  what  was

happening. To complete the record, let me read  to

you  the  reply which he gave us. It is a copy  of

the letter which he sent to us. It is headed:





<br><br><div align="center">`Perdana Menteri,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Dear Mr Lim,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for your letter and for your assurance

that  you  are completely at one with  me  in  the

desire for national unity and preservation of  the

Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note your request for an opportunity to have a

free  and  frank exchange of views. Unfortunately,

however, I am unable to meet you during this visit

to  Singapore as I have two engagements  in  Kedah

which   necessitate  my  leaving  Singapore  early

tomorrow morning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will, however, be pleased to meet you and

other  leaders  of  the Barisan Sosialis  at  some

future date, and I will let you know when this can

be arranged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for your kind regards,

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the exchange of letters which

caused  such  a  hullabaloo in Singapore  at  that

time.  Everybody was wondering what was happening.

The  P.A.P. tried to make great political  capital

out  of  it. We allowed them to, in order to  give

them  enough rope to hang themselves. As expected,

they  hanged themselves, because they did not know

what  was in the letter. Even here in this  House,

they have been trying to put all sorts of meanings

and  interpretations into our letters. Now that  I

have read  those letters to you, you will see that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>



what  they sought to read into our letters has  no

foundation of truth.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>4.35 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a completely polite letter from the Tunku,

with  a  promise to see us later; but so much  was

read  into the exchange of letters, Sir,  that  we

had to issue a statement on the 6th of April. This

is what we said. It is only a very ---



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Point of order, Mr Deputy

Speaker,   Sir, I  do  enquire   whether   these

fascinating  details are in any way  pertinent  to

the motion before the Rouse. I would urge, Sir, if

I  may, that  the Member for Queenstown  remember

that we are subject to a "guillotine".



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I think the Member for

Queenstown  is  in  order  to  quote  the  letters

exchanged  between the Barisan  Sosialis  and  the

Prime  Minister of the Federation of Malaya, while

discussing the question before this House, it  is

perfectly  legitimate to reveal  the  information,

and  so far the Member is completely in order. Dr

Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Anyway, Sir, concerning this

letter, there is not very much left - only a small

hit.  About our statement which we issued  on  the

6th of April, we were commenting on the attack on

us  by  the  P.A.P. in their political  statements

issued to the Press.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We are firmly opposed to any policy based on

racial  discrimination, yet we who are opposed  to

the    present   proposals   based    on    racial

discrimination,  are accused of being  racialists,

while the P.A.P. leaders, who are trying to impose

this  policy  based  on racial prejudices  on  the

people,   call   themselves  non-racialists.   How

twisted  can  the  P.A.P. logic  become?  It  was

because of our concern for the extremely dangerous

communal drift and to present the true feelings of

the  people of Singapore to the Tunku that we  had

instructed the Secretary-General of our Party, Mr

Lim Ching Siong, to write to the Tunku with a view

to   seeking   a   way   to  halt   the   present

deterioration.  We  have not, as  the  P.A.P. has

alleged,  pledged  our support for   the  P.A.P.'s

White   Paper  merger  proposals  that  is   their

unfortunate  lie, Sir - or for the present  Malaysia

plan.  We  have  been consistently  against  these

proposals,  and our stand remains the same.  Hence

our  present  campaign to expose the  P.A.P. sell

out'.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more paragraph, Sir, a short one:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The P.A.P. has also spread the falsehood that our

Secretary-General had gone to Cuscaden Road to see

the  Tunku  without an appointment. The  truth  is

that the letter to the Tunku was delivered by hand

by  our  Assistant Secretary-General of the Party,

Dr  Poh  Soo  Kai, who handed the letter  to  the

Tunku's  Press  Secretary at Federation  House  in

Cuscaden Road,'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is the episode of the exchange of

letters  which  has caused so much  commotion  and

which  has given the P.A.P. such a headache.  They

twisted  our stand this way and that way, and  now

it  has  been shown very clearly that the  P.A.P. - who  all the time were in the dark - had been trying

to confuse and mislead the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell the P.A.P. this: even if the Federal

politicians  should not grant  us  equality,  that

does  not  mean  that  we  should  not  fight  for

equality.  The Prime Minister has obligations  and

duties,  as  the Prime Minister of  Singapore,  to

fight for the rights of Singapore, and I ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.

The Member does not give way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will tell him, if he calls

himself the Prime Minister of Singapore, let  him

work  for the interests of Singapore. If he  wants

to  fight for the interests of the Federation, let

him go to the Federation and leave Tanjong Pagar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what are the choices before us? The

P.A.P.  White Paper, as we have said, is a  phoney

merger,  with  phoney autonomy  in  education  and

labour.  I  have already explained  to  you  about

second-class  citizenship. I have already  touched

on  the  fact  that we have not got   proportional

representation,  and because  if the  unequal  and

unjust terms, the proposed merger will lead not to

national unity but to national disunity. In  fact,

it will lead to a widening of communal differences

which I do not wish to touch on. It will not  lead

to  unification of the people and  will  not  give

independence    to    Singapore.    The     slogan

"Independence through merger" is the humbug  which

the P.A.P. have been trying to sell to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>



people of Singapore. There is no independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see the second alternative. It is couched

in  very  vague  terms. It is  open  to  too  many

interpretations and can mean whatever  the  P.A.P.

distortionists want it to mean. There is no  White

Paper  on it and, in effect, the people are  asked

to  choose  something which is not only vague  but

also  something  which they know  hardly  anything

about.  It  amounts to giving the P.A.P. a  blank

cheque.  Who  wants  to give the  P.A.P. a  blank

cheque?  As  it is, the P.A.P. are  untrustworthy

enough  and  nobody  has any confidence  in  them.

Therefore, it is very difficult for the  voter  to

decide on it and to vote for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the third alternative, Sir, I have already

indicated that it is another unknown quantity, and

it is not a genuine choice which is being posed to

the people. Now, what we want is a genuine choice.

You  must give a choice which is acceptable to the

people - something which they can choose. The fact

that the voter is not allowed to say "No" is proof

enough, Sir, that the P.A.P. know that the choices

that  they  are  offering to the  people  are  not

acceptable  to  the  vast majority.  There  is  no

justification whatsoever for them to say that  the

people cannot say "No".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we ask that we in Singapore be allowed to

have  a  genuine and honest choice of the type  of

merger that the people want. As has been suggested

by the Member for Cairnhill, let all the Parties

go  and  explain  to the people  their  respective

stands  on merger, on the questions which will  be

posed  in the referendum. Let the Government admit

that we have a right to ask another question to be

proposed to the people. It is our duty to convince

the  people as to the most suitable form of merger

for  Singapore. It is simple, it is fair,  and  at

least,  under  the circumstances since  they  have

insisted  on the mode and manner - there  will  be

less complaints. At the present moment, the P.A.P.

have  the  Radio, Rediffusion, and the  Press  all

under  their  control. I do not  think  they  need

worry  as to what the Opposition Parties will  do.

They do not have to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>



worry  about  the Opposition Parties  telling  the

people  what they are supposed to know.  What  the

Opposition  Parties  can do,  I  should  say,  the

P.A.P.,  with all the facilities at their command,

should be able to do much better. Therefore,  they

need  have no fear of allowing a fourth choice  to

be  offered  to  the people. Let them  accept  our

amendment  to put a fourth alternative.  Let  them

not  try  to railroad merger with this  humbug  of

their three choices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our stand is well known. It has been

debated in this Assembly and the people, in  spite

of  the P.A.P. distortion, know that we stand  for

automatic    conversion   and   for   proportional

representation. I want to remind the  S.P.A. once

again  of their statement that they want a genuine

choice to be posed to the people. Now is the  time

for  the S.P.A. to support our amendment. Let  all

the possible alternatives acceptable to the people

of  Singapore be posed to them for their choosing.

Then  let  the people decide. Only then  will  the

definition of "referendum" as given by  the  Prime

Minister,  that it is a process to  ascertain  the

views  of the majority of the people of Singapore,

hold  true. Remember it is to ascertain the  views

of  the people of Singapore, not the views of  the

P.A.P.

<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir, I  fully  support  the

amendment  moved by the Barisan Sosialis.  Let  me

now  speak  on  it.  Before I speak  on  the  main

subject, I should like to touch on the subject  of

the  untrustworthiness of the Prime Minister.  His

words are usually not trustworthy.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for

Stamford  has  already spoken on the main  motion.

She  has indicated that she is now going to  speak

on  the  amendment, and any irrelevancies  on  her

part  will  be ruled completely out of order.  So,

will  the Member please come back to the amendment

by the Barisan Sosialis?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, I can guarantee that what I wish to

speak on is related to our amendment. Because the

Prime Minister has told us previously that what we

wanted he could give us. This remark was quoted by

the Member for Cairnhill yesterday. I do not wish

to speak on it again. The amendment by the Barisan

Sosialis is just to see whether the Prime Minister

can accede to it, Mr Deputy Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I frankly tell this House that we Barisan

Sosialis   strongly  oppose  the   phoney   merger

proposals  as  suggested by the P.A.P.  The  White

Paper on merger is not a genuine merger. To expose

this  phoney merger is not only the responsibility

of  the  people  but  also  that  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tunku Abdul Rahman has said that the negotiations started by the P.A.P. are not for a merger but for a closer relationship.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order. In the

November debate last year I tabled an exchange  of

letters  between myself and the Prime Minister  of

the Federation of Malaya, in which he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'May I refer to your letter of the 11th

November,  1961,  regarding the representation  in

the  new  Federation Parliament which is contained

in  paragraph  15  of the memorandum  forming  the

basic proposals for merger of Singapore.'



<br><br>I  do not know whether the Member for Stamford has

read  this  document or has had it  translated  to

her.  "Merger" is what is referred to by the Tunku

in his letter in the official exchange of letters.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I might want to add something to

that point of order. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. If the Chair requires

the assistance of any Member, then it will call on

that  Member.  I  think the  Chair  is  completely

competent to carry on in this Assembly. Miss  Fung

Yin Ching. [Interruption] Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> It is, Sir, I was trying to draw

your  attention  to the fact that there  is  other

information on that point of order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Anson

has spoken on the main motion and he will have  an

Opportunity to speak on the amendment moved by the

Member  for Thomson which we are debating now.  He

can  raise  this  matter later,  as  a  matter  of

information  or elucidation. He can bring  up  his

point then. Miss Fung Yin Ching.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  what the Prime Minister  has  said

just  now seems to me as if he wants to prove that

the  P.A.P.  White Paper on merger  is  a  genuine

merger.  But  yesterday the Member  for  Cairnhill

said that the proposal in the White Paper is not a

real merger. It is only half merger. I do not know

what  ideas the Prime Minister has on this  aspect

of the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> We are not debating the motion, we

are now on the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I have ruled, before the

Member for Stamford started to speak, that she can

speak  on  the amendment moved by the  Member  for

Thomson. Miss Fung Yin Ching.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, the stand of the Barisan Sosialis is

that  the Government should not run away from  its

responsibilities, but the circumstances prevailing

today  are different. If they insist on going  on,

they  will have no way out. The provisions in  the

National Referendum Bill have been debated in this

House  and  the Bill has been passed. We  find  it

necessary to bring up this amendment now.  I  want

to  quote from the Prime Minister's words to prove

that  our  amendment is reasonable. It  represents

our  stand  on  merger. Our Chairman  has  clearly

stated  it. I want to quote some speeches  by  the

Prime Minister as recorded in the Sin Chew Jit Poh

of  the  8th  of  July.  It was  reported  in  the

newspaper  that  at  a Press conference  broadcast

over  Radio  Singapore,  when  the  Tunku  was  in

Singapore,  The Prime Minister of Singapore was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>



asked, if he had his way, whether he would have  a

national  referendum. What was his view on  it,  a

Press  reporter  asked him. For the  sake  of  the

official  record of this House and not to misquote

him,  I  would  like to read all  that  the  Prime

Minister said. He is reported to have said, "I have

said in the past what I thought about this. Let me

repeat  it.  In the Legislative Assembly  we  have

secured  enough power and rights. I am not worried

about the proposed merger, because my view is that

the  Communists know that the crux of the  problem

is  here. The Communists want to spread hatred and

disorder  among the people, so that they can  then

do what they like. I feel very sorry about this. I

cannot  agree  with the Tunku. I believe  we  know

more of the hopes and aspirations of the Singapore

Chinese.  We want to give them a choice.  If  they

honestly think that the Penang or Malacca type  of

merger, as suggested by the Barisan, is what  they

like,  or  the  Johore type, as suggested  by  the

Member for Hong Lim, or ---"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> An amendment moved by the Member

for  Thomson, at the end of the Original Question,

as  amended, to add a new paragraph. The  Question

is, "That the words proposed to be added, be there

added."



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  just  now I quoted the speech by  the  Prime

Minister to prove that the amendment moved by  the

Barisan  Sosialis is reasonable. Let me  read  the

last  paragraph  of  the Prime Minister's  speech.

Just  now I said about the suggestion put  forward

by  the Member for Anson is on an equal basis with

the  11  States  of the Federation of  Malaya,  on

complete  and unconditional merger.  If  they  are

given  the preferences and if they do not make  up

their  own  minds, they cannot put  the  blame  on

others.  Consequently they have nothing  to  lose.

There  is  a  certain remark  made  by  the  Prime

Minister.  In this remark I personally  feel  that

the  Prime Minister is quite democratic and  just.

Unfortunately, the Prime Minister  in  his  speech

has distorted the stand of the Barisan Sosialis. I

feel  it  necessary to point out here - I hope  the

Prime  Minister will let the people have a genuine

choice - a  free  choice - and not to compel  them  to

make  a choice between two alternatives which  are

unacceptable  to them. Only through the  right  of

free  choice  will the people not  feel  neglected

eventually.  This  is very important.  The  people

must  be given a real choice and not a superficial

choice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendment by the Barisan

Sosialis  is very reasonable and just because  it

will  reflect  the  true and  real  stand  of  the

Barisan Sosialis. If this amendment by us is again

defeated and rejected by the Government,  then  I

believe  that this is the beginning of a  tragedy.

This tragedy will be inevitable. Nevertheless, the

people  of  this country are now facing a  crucial

challenge in the history of this country.  If  we

look at it from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>



objective point of view, the transitional struggle

is  only  one aspect of the whole struggle.  Today

the  Government  is dependent on the  minority  in

this House.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We must not go back on that

tack  now. That has all been disposed of, I  hope.

We are now on the amendment. I think what the hon.

Lady must do now is to urge that the words in  the

amendment be added to the motion. She must confine

herself,  as  far  as she can,  to  the  amendment

itself and not to generalities.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, the contents of our amendment have been dealt

with  by  my Chairman and the Member for  Thomson,

Therefore, I  will not repeat it here. I  hope  the

Government  will  not reject  our  amendment  this

time. The right to choose is the fundamental right

of  the people. As remarked by the Prime Minister,

let  the people make the choice so that they  will

not  be neglected in the future, so that they will

not feel they are losing anything. I fully support

the amendment by the Member for Thomson.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

we  have now before us, it seems to me, four doors

into  Malaya  and Malaysia. As to which  of  these

doors  is  the best is a thing that  we  want  the

people to express themselves on at the referendum.

Whether  the fourth door is an 'open' door,  or  a

'closed' door to us is a matter which none  of  us

in  Singapore  has the right to say, because  the

bolt is on the other side. It is for those in  the

Federation to, say whether they want to unbolt the

door.  As  far as we are concerned,  Sir,  on  the

S.P.A. side, we will welcome the fourth door,  if

the bolt is pushed back.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What about Borneo?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Judging from what I have

heard  outside talking with the common  people,  I

find  they are very confused. The longer we debate

this merger issue, the more confused they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>



become,  because  of the many  side  issues  being

brought  in. In fact, only this morning a  kampong

dweller  came to my house for advice. He  said  he

and his friends would like to know just one thing:

"Will  Malaysia benefit people like  me  or  not?"

That is all he wants to know. He is not interested

in  the  right of voting in the Federation because

he  would not be a politician. He cannot afford to

be a politician. He cannot afford to travel to the

Federation.  So  he just wants an  assurance  that

Malaysia  will be of benefit to people  like  him.

Thus reduced to that simple issue, despite all the

talk and arguments, the pros and cons (I would say

the  defects also), I have no hesitation in saying

that   Singapore, because  of  its   geographical

position,  will benefit by being part of Malaysia.

In  fact,  in  my  opinion, Sir, Singapore  cannot

afford to be isolated from Malaysia, just as Great

Britain  now  finds that she cannot afford  to  be

isolated  and  excluded from the  European  Common

Market.   In   fact,  Sir, I  believe   Singapore

economically   will  receive  new  vitality,   new

strength, new  resources.  She  will  become   an

economic   magnet  attracting  new  capital,   new

enterprises,  new industries, and naturally  that

will  be  of  great  benefit to the  workers,  the

unemployed  and to the young people  in  Singapore

who are now queuing up for jobs.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suppose that has some

reference  to  the amendment we  are  debating.  I

cannot  see it at the moment, but we are debating

an amendment. All these remarks, I should imagine,

will come in very useful when the Member, if he so

desires,  wishes to speak on the Original Question

as amended. But if he can relate what he is saying

to the amendment, then he is in order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to

range over  the whole field.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. In that case, I am afraid

the  Member cannot do that. He is now speaking  on

an  amendment  and  he should  now  speak  for  or

against it and leave it at that. Once the amendment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>



has been disposed of, then the hon.  Member

will  have  his chance of ranging over  the  whole

field.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, this fourth proposition

is  like  a door which was tried long ago and  was

closed  and bolted. The term "genuine  merger"

is not in the vocabulary of any historian. I would

like  to say, as a humble student of history, when

we   talk   about   forms  of   closer   political

association, we do not talk about genuine  forms

or phoney forms ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Barisan Sosialis forms.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> There are certain main types

of  forms which have existed historically. We  are

told  by historians that certain types fit certain

situations.  The  form that the  Barisan  Sosialis

proposes and discusses as merger, which really  is

just   a  form  of  merger,  or  closer  political

association,  envisages  that  all  citizens  will

automatically  become Federal citizens  on  Merger

Day.  If it were in our power to say so, we  would

say,  "Yes, we agree." But it is not in our power.

It is like a man buying some goods. What I wish to

pay  may  not  be  acceptable  to  the  seller.  I

therefore cannot insist that the seller must  sell

at  my  price.  If we insist, Sir,  that  is  not

showing   a   spirit   of   true   socialism   and

brotherhood, but of imperialism, of demand, and I

think,  between Malays and Chinese,  and  Indians,

there  must not be a spirit of demand. There  must

be  a  spirit of goodwill and brotherhood.  As  we

learn to trust one another, we will find that more

will  be given without that demand being made.  As

we  become  Malaysian-minded, then all these  four

distinctions will disappear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the fourth door is closed and bolted, are

we  therefore  to say to the people of  Singapore,

"Do  not enter through any of the other doors?"  I

think  that is being negative. Can we say  to  the

people of Singapore, "Be satisfied with your state

of increasing unemployment. Wait until the door is

unbolted.  Never mind if there are more  and  more

thousands  of young people unemployed. Never  mind

if  wages cannot rise. Never mind if capital keeps

on running to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>



Federation.  If  factories go to Johore,  Petaling

Jaya and Penang, never mind."? I think that is not

being   realistic.  Very  likely  if  the  Barisan

Sosialis  had been with the P.A.P. at  this  time,

they  would have said all the three doors are good

must  say  that  even in our own  Party  sometimes

there are people like that. I think in every Party

there are people who put party politics first. But

we  believe,  Sir,  that in the  interest  of  the

country we must have more and more people who will

say we put the national interest first.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Even if it means accepting

from our political foe something which is good, we

will  accept  it  provided  it  is  good  for  the

country. With that attitude and in that spirit,  I

think we all agree that for Singapore there cannot

be  a  "no"  to  the  entry of  Singapore  into

Malaysia. For the sake of the people, it  must  be

"yes".  The only decision we have to make  is  the

mode  and manner of entry. If three doors are open

and  one  door  is closed, well, we must  ask  the

people to decide which of the three doors they can

enter. We cannot insist and say, "The people  must

not be allowed to choose," because the fourth door

that  we want is closed and it is not in our hands

to open the bolt. If the Barisan Sosialis say they

can  open  the bolt, we are happy. But  since  the

bolt is on the other side, and we cannot open  the

door,  and  there are three floors by which  entry

can  be  made into Malaysia, and the common people

want  to  know  whether Malaysia is beneficial  or

not,  the real debate should be, will Malaysia  be

beneficial  to the common people of  Singapore  or

not?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Tanglin  is an honest man. That is why I  rise  to

answer him. He says the door that is being offered

by this amendment is closed. This amendment speaks

of genuine merger of Singapore with the Federation

of  Malaya, with Singapore entering the Federation

as   the  twelfth  State  and  with  its  citizens

automatically becoming Federal citizens on  Merger

Day. I ask



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>



the Member for Tanglin, what does he understand by

the  proposal which he has supported, proposal No.

(b) in the motion, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'a complete and unconditional merger as a state

on  an equal basis with the other eleven states in

accordance  with the constitutional  documents  of

the Federation of Malaya.'?



<br><br>What  does  he  ever understand by  that  phrase?

Indeed,  Sir, if the Member would like to rise,  I

shall be happy to sit down.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We are not in Committee. I

think the Member must make his speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I understood that he was seeking

to  rise on a matter of clarification, but I shall

proceed.  I  ask  him  to  notice  that  they  are

offering  us a so-called proposal of complete  and

unconditional merger. That is proposal (b). I take

it  the  Member for Tanglin, having  accepted  it,

says  that that door is open. Maybe it was a  long

time  ago, and memory is short in this House,  but

it was referred to last November and I refer to it

again today. These are the words of the Federation

Prime  Minister spoken on 16th October,  1961.  If

the  Member for Tanglin will bear with me, I  will

quote  it from page 9 of the Straits Times of  the

next day:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`One thing is certain, and that is we cannot take

Singapore  with  us in complete merger  without  a

great  deal of unhappiness and trouble, and so  we

must find a middle course.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, talking about the Federation bolting

the door, if he says they have bolted the door  to

our  proposal, what about proposal (b)?  Here  are

the words used by the Federation Prime Minister:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We cannot take Singapore with us in a complete

merger.'



<br><br>Yet  they pretend that that door is open, and  our

beloved  Prime Minister, illustrious and  learned,

on  the  12th  of June in a radio broadcast  which

went over Radio P.A.P. on the 14th said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If the people reject the White Paper proposals,

they  just  vote for complete merger.  That  is  a

rejection of the White Paper proposals and we will

get them complete merger.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So where is the logic of this? The Prime

Minister of the Federation on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>



16th of October in his own Parliament told his

people and their representative:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We cannot take Singapore with us in complete

merger.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Prime Minister told us on the 12th of June,

"You  want  complete merger? We  will  get  it  for

you."  And he puts it in proposal (b). We have  now

learned  that  it  is almost physically  impossible

for the P.A.P. to be honest. Everything they do  is

done   with   a  corkscrew  and  so  we  anticipate

dishonesty from them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I ask the Member for Tanglin, whose profession

has taught him logic and whose repute for integrity

has never been challenged, political novice though

he may be, I ask how he squares the suggestion that

proposal (b) is open but our proposal is not?

Proposal (b) is an open door, but the proposal we

urge is not an open door. How does he make that

distinction, Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment before you is a matter that has

coalesced  and codified the stand of the  Opposition

from the very commencement. It was the one that  was

debated  at  length  and  was  finally  defeated  on

December  the  6th,  with  the  Member  for  Tanglin

supporting.  At that time, there was no question  of

"We  would  like to get it for you,  but  it  was  a

closed door." There were other excuses. He says, and

not wrongly, if you ask for something but the seller

will  not  sell it at that price? I agree with  him,

and  the  answer is patience. If you cannot  get  it

today, you may get it next week. You may get it next

month. It is a matter of patience. If you cannot get

what  you  want  today, does it  mean  you  have  to

destroy  the  opportunity for what you really  seek?

Sir,  there is a little couplet that says, "For sake

of  silver spent today, why pledge tomorrow's gold?"

Singapore and the people of Singapore have waited  a

very long time for freedom and for integration,  and

they  have  shown an immense capacity for  patience.

Why,  I ask the Member for Tanglin, does he consider

that  a year or two is so vital that we must destroy

the  reality in chasing the shadow? The  Member  for

Tanglin knows full well that in the context  of  our

people, citizenship is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>



sheet-anchor  of their security. If we  cannot  give

them  that common citizenship, they will not have  a

sense of security or belonging which alone can  make

possible a happy and united nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very unhappy to note, Sir, that the S.P.A.

has  seen  fit to start on an inauspicious  note  in

rejecting  a proposal which at least 17  Members  of

this House urged and went on record in support of  on

the 6th of December. Whether it is closed or whether

it  is  open,  is  the Member for Tanglin  seriously

telling  me  that  he  knows for  certain  that  the

Federation Government would be prepared  to  accept

proposal (c) which they have introduced through  the

Member  for  Cairnhill, "on terms no less favourable

than  any of the Borneo territories"? Does he really

say that that door is open? If so, we would like  to

know why. Has it ever been negotiated? He knows  the

answer  truthfully - No. Has (b) ever been negotiated?

No,  Sir, It has not been negotiated. Nor  has  (b)

been  negotiated. I say that if he wants, and  I  am

not suggesting, as has the Member from Cairnhill, to

put  all  possible alternatives before  the  people,

well,  let  us at least put this one which  has  the

support  of one-third of the total number of Members

in this House. It will not exhaust all possibilities

of  merger, but it is a fair and an honest one.  And

if  the P.A.P., with their corkscrew mentality, seek

to  suggest that it is dishonest, because  according

to  the Prime Minister you are offering a dish  that

is  not  on  the menu, let me rub it in again,  Sir,

they are offering proposal (b) allegedly because the

Opposition  wants  it  and  in  the  terms   of   the

Federation Prime Minister - I repeat it:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`One thing is certain, and that is we cannot take

Singapore with us in complete merger without a great

deal of unhappiness and trouble, and so we must find

a middle course.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if this is a fraud, what about his proposal

(b)? Is it a fraud, that we all know it is, the

allegedly honest alternative?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the amendment before you is in the spirit of the Reid Report, and if you will remember

I read the paragraph which spoke of those having

citizenship retaining those rights in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>



a   common   citizenship.  That  is  one   of   the

constitutional documents. On Monday, Sir,  at  page

21  [Vol.  19, No. 1, col. 31], the Prime  Minister

asked if we could show him any precedent or analogy

for automatic citizenship:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Sir, if the constitutional documents contain

either,  by precedent or by analogy, provisions  to

support such a claim...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you got that Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On page 21?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> It is about a quarter from the

bottom,  "Sir,  if  the constitutional  documents."

Now,  Sir,  I  say by analogy and by precedent,  we

have the Reid Commission Report and we have Article

28  of  the  Constitution  giving  State  nationals

immediate citizenship on entry into the Federation.

The  Deputy  Prime Minister says that there  is  no

possibility  under  the Constitution  of  automatic

citizenship.  Again,  Mr  Speaker,  he  seeks   to

flounder in technicalities. Under Article  22,  Mr

Speaker,   the   Federation   Parliament   can   in

anticipation  pass  an Act to  say  that  from  the

moment  the  instruments of transfer of sovereignty

over  Singapore  are  executed and  exchanged,  all

citizens  of  Singapore shall be  citizens  of  the

Federation.  That  would be automatic.  The  Deputy

Prime  Minister  is  wrong in  saying  that  it  is

impossible to provide for automatic citizenship. In

fact, Article 22 requires the Federation Parliament

to  direct  its  mind  to the  issue  and  to  make

provision  not  only in respect of  those  who  are

citizens  but  also in respect of  those  who  seek

relationship  with the territory. So, Mr  Speaker,

when   he   tells  us  that  it  is   contrary   to

constitutional provisions and that it is  a  deceit

and  fraud upon the people, he just does  not  know

what  he  is  talking about. The Deputy Prime  Minister  is not the only one who does not know  what

he is talking about. There is, Sir, in this House a

Gentlemen called the Parliamentary secretary to the

Minister for Education.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think it is right

for the hon. Member to address a Member or refer to

a  Member in such terms, which can be taken  to  be

derogatory.  The hon. Member should just  say  "the

Parliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

Education".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Well, Sir, the Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Education is supposed

to  be  bilingual.  It seems that  he  speaks  both

English  and,  Mandarin, but I would  inquire,  Mr

Speaker,   Sir,   whether  he  understands   either

language. I refer you to page 60 [Vol. 19,  No.  1,

col.  91], of the 9th of July. You will find,  Sir,

that I pointed out to the Deputy Speaker:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`On a point of clarification, Sir. Mr Deputy

Speaker, in the light of what I understand will be

the fourth alternative which is what I seek, if we

cannot have one question, I shall not be moving my

amendment of which notice has been given.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it must be that obvious, because it was

translated into Mandarin too, but at page 80 [col.

121], the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister

for Education said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, about the second

amendment I am not prepared to touch on it at the

moment because I would like to see what grand

arguments the Member for Anson will be advancing.'



<br><br>Sir, I do not know into what particular dialect  he

would  wish translations of what I say in order  to

understand.  If you will turn over  the  page,  Mr

Speaker,  the  whole of the second paragraph  [col.

122] reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The second amendment proposed by them calls for

the automatic conversion of Singapore citizens into

Federal  citizens. I hope that when the Member  for

Anson  moves his amendment he will tell us  whether

he  agrees  that the education policy of  Singapore

should keep in line with the Rahman Talib education

policy,  and whether he is prepared to let autonomy

in  education  and  labour be handed  over  to  the

control  of  the Central Government. I  would  also

like  to  ask him whether he is prepared to  accept

any measures put out by the Central Government, for

instance,  the 4 to 1 ratio of Malays to non-Malays

in the civil service. You see, ...'

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member must not go

off  on  a  tack  like that. There is  a  perfectly

legitimate  request on a point of elucidation,  and

all  the  Member  for Anson must say  is  'yea'  or

'nay';  that  is  all. If he says 'nay',  then  the

Member sits down.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> In the light of the rebuke, I say

'yea'.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> I believe there is a mistake

in  the  transcript. I referred to the Member  for

Queenstown  and  not  to  the  Member  for  Anson,

because  he  was not the person who was  going  to

move the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am sorry, Mr Speaker, Sir; he

makes a double mistake because the Notice sent out

was  in  my  name and the amendment was  to  amend

paragraph  (b).  On the 9th we did  not  have  any

notice  of  amendment by the Member for Queenstown

and  it  is  no use trying to wash our  eyes  with

dust.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> On a point of order. Mr

Speaker, Sir, when I said those words, I meant the

amendment  about automatic citizenship.  That  was

the amendment moved by the Member for Thomson.  At

that  time,  Mr Speaker, you said the Member  for

Queenstown could only speak after moving his first

amendment.   I   am  referring  to   the   present

amendment, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> But, of course, in point of fact,

on  the 9th of July, there was no second amendment

to   be   moved   by  the  Member   for   Thomson.

[Interruption] Has the Member for Upper  Serangoon

completed  his "risibility"? As I was  saying,  on

the  9th of July, there had been no notice put  in

of  the second amendment to be moved by the Member

for  Thomson.  I  think a notice  came  late  last

night,  but,  of course, there was  an  indication

that  an amendment of that nature was going to  be

moved. But whether the Member was mistranslated as

saying "the Member for Anson", of course, we could

always check from the tape*.

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*A check from the tape recorded in Mandarin gives "the Member for Queenstown."

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged, Sir. On Monday,

there  was  a  notice  in my name  of  a  proposed

amendment  to  give automatic citizenship  and  to

change   the   words  to  the   "spirit   of   the

constitutional documents". And here  he  asks  the

Member for Anson about his grand arguments when he

moves  that  amendment. But, Sir, let us  pass  on

from the Gentleman, who does not know what he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>



is  talking about and does not understand what  he

is  hearing,  to  the Deputy Prime  Minister.  The

Deputy  Prime  Minister, who speaks  of  honesty - a

word  that I say comes ill from his lips,  as  ill

and  as  alien  as  the word "national"  which  he

insists   on   mispronouncing  in   such   foreign

fashion - takes me to task for making a long  speech

and  not moving my amendment. Mr Speaker, I  will

explain  very  simply. There is a  guillotine.  My

amendment is in fact incorporated in the amendment

which  is now before the House. In essence, it  is

not  my purpose to seek to filibuster and take  up

the  time  of the House on unnecessary amendments.

This  is  one - this fourth one - which 17 of us  have

agreed to and still agree to, Sir. Mr Speaker, if

you will remember, on the 9th of July - I might draw

your  attention to the exact page - at page 25 [col.

35]  the Prime Minister said, the 5th line of  the

transcript:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'By reason and logic we are entitled to as much

as what was afforded to the 11 States. I have said

before,  and I repeat it now, that it is the  duty

of  the  Government to see that we are treated  as

favourably as any of the other States.'



<br><br>And  if  you  will  turn over the  page,  Sir,  he

repeats himself in the last paragraph [col. 38]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The first principle of any federation is that

all  States  are dealt with equally and  that  the

norm, or rather, the equivalent [I ask you to note

the word 'equivalent'] of what was given to the 11

States  of the Federation should also be available

to any new member if the new member desires it.'



<br><br>Sir,  the equivalent of giving the State of Johore

citizenship for its nationals is giving the  State

of  Singapore  citizenship for  its  nationals.  A

subject  of  the Ruler in Johore, as a subject  of

the  Ruler in Kedah, as a subject of the Ruler  in

Selangor,  is  in  an analogous  position  to  the

citizen  of  the  State of Singapore  who  is  the

subject of Her Majesty represented by the Yang di-Pertuan   Negara.   They  were   given   automatic

citizenship  on  the formation of the  Federation.

The  Prime  Minister talks about his duty  to  see

that our people get equivalent treatment and equal

justice. That is all this amendment seeks.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am indeed unhappy to note, Sir, that a

perfectly legitimate proposition which a third  of

this  House  seek  to put to the people  is  being

resisted not by the Government, whom we can expect

to  resist  anything  decent,  but  by  the  Front

Opposition Bench - the S.P.A. and U.M.N.O.  We  have

never  suggested  that the White  Paper  proposals

should not be put to the people. In fact, we  urge

that  they should be honestly put. That  is  their

stand and we are a hundred per cent with them that

it  should  fairly  and squarely  be  put  to  the

people. Not with the word 'merger' that the  Prime

Minister seeks to tag on, but frankly as proposals

for  a  closer relationship. We have never, never,

never   had  a  shadow  of  doubt  that  we  would

wholeheartedly support any attempt, every  attempt

to put those proposals honestly to the people. Why

did  the  S.P.A. and U.M.N.O. object  to  another

proposal  which,  in their eyes,  is  not  equally

worthy,  but  which,  in our eyes,  is  much  more

worthy  and  should  be  put  to  the  people   of

Singapore?  Why is that? In the context  of  their

rejection  of  our amendment on the 6th  December,

1961,  Sir,  they  said that it  was  put  up  for

political  purposes  and they  would  support  the

Government. Very well, they did it. But I say, the

same  reasons  no longer prevail. Here  the  Prime

Minister  (and  their own leader)  has  repeatedly

said that all reasonable and possible alternatives

will  be put to the people. We are not asking  for

all  possible alternatives; we are asking for  one

alternative - an  honest  alternative,  a   simple

alternative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not know why it is constantly sought

of  me to restate my stand, but let me explain  to

you  what  I understand by that alternative.  Sir,

there  is  no misunderstanding. It means education

and  labour  will  be  under Central  Governmental

control.  There  can  be no question  about  that,

because,  to my mind, in our efforts  to  build  a

united  nation, it is healthier that there  should

be a uniform policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether we are agreeable to it or not in its

implementation or its outline, will  be  a  matter

for constitutional effort to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>



amend and alter - not only for us but for all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I say that what I understand by a complete

and  genuine merger is that we will, in fact, seek

no  special  consideration because of our  wealth,

seek  no  special  consideration  because  of  our

unique  economic and military value, but  that  we

will  seek  merely,  in all humility  and  in  all

sincerity,  equality with the  other  States.  Our

wealth will be, at the disposal of all. Let us not

forget  that our per capita income is believed  to

be four times that of the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a wonderful prize, Sir, and we are

seeking  for  it  nothing but  what  is  basically

right.  We  are  asking for no  premiums.  We  are

asking  for  no special consideration. The  P.A.P.

want  to go shouting that they want education  and

labour.  Let us put the alternatives then  bluntly

to the people, Sir. That is fair enough.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you rather have education and labour and

no   citizenship?   Or  would  you   rather   have

citizenship,   common   liabilities   and   common

responsibilities? That is fair enough. Sir. And  I

will be glad to take the P.A.P. on that basis  and

to  see the referendum clearly fought along  those

lines  as to whether the people of Singapore would

be   prepared  to  accept  loyally  to  be  on   a

completely  equal basis with the other  States  in

the Federation - education, labour, finance - the lot

in  the  hands of the Central Government  as  with

every  other State; or whether we seek the special

privileges  which the P.A.P. say we  seek - as  the

P.A.P. make  as  a donkey's carrot - in  order  to

excuse   the  sell-out  of  the  basic  issue   of

citizenship.



<br><br>6.19 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands) (In Malay): Mr Speaker, just now we have

heard  the Member for Anson attempting to "tickle"

U.M.N.O. in debating the amendment moved  by  the

Member   for  Thomson  in  connection   with   the

alternatives put to the people of Singapore on the

question of merger. I, on behalf of U.M.N.O.,  say

unequivocally and sincerely that we do not wish to

indulge in twists and turns and we loathe any, one

who indulges in such tactics and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>



who tries to mislead or do anything of that sort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our stand, Mr Speaker, does not mean that it is

based on the wishes of the people but after having

given  due  and  thorough  consideration  to   the

problem  whether  it  will be  beneficial  to  all

strata  of society. Therefore, we are prepared  to

put  aside our party ideologies. We do not retreat

from our stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of U.M.N.O., I say we will not retreat

from the proposals as embodied in Command Paper 33

of 1961.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> May I remind the hon. Member that

we  are  now on an amendment, and I think he  must

address  his  mind to the amendment.  What  he  is

saying will be very relevant when we come back  to

the original Question. Then, as he has not himself

spoken  on it, he can do so. Now, we must  dispose

of this amendment first.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Ahmad Jabri (In Malay): I respect your

ruling,  Mr Speaker, but what I intend to  convey

is that I reject the amendment moved by the Member

for Thomson. So it is necessary for me to state my

Party's  stand.  This is a matter  which  we  have

thoroughly discussed and considered-the importance

of  merger between Singapore and the Federation of

Malaya,  and  Malaysia. Any  proposal  which  goes

beyond  the  confines of Command  Paper  33  is  a

pretext or is a manoeuvre to frustrate and destroy

all  successes which we have been able to  achieve

to  date, or by which we have been able to achieve

closer  relationship  between  Singapore  and  the

Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment moved by the Member for Thomson is

not  a new amendment. Indeed, this amendment  has,

in  fact,  been debated in the past. Therefore,  I

say  it  is not an amendment with good intentions,

as we had hoped.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, if

you  will allow me, I would like to dispose of one

or  two  points raised by the Member for Anson  in

connection  with the speech made by my  colleague,

the  Member  for Tanglin. He posed  the  question,

"how could the Member for Tanglin, in all honesty,

have  supported the second proposition put forward

by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>



the  Government,  the second proposition  being  a

complete and unconditional merger as a state on an

equal basis with the 11 other states in accordance

with   the   constitutional   documents   of   the

Federation  of Malaya." He also asked  the  Member

for  Tanglin  what  exactly he understood  by  the

second  proposition  before  he,  the  Member  for

Tanglin,  agreed  that it was a  fair  proposition

which  could  be  allowed to  go  forward  to  the

electorate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In furtherance of the first point that he made

against the Member for Tanglin, he inquired as  to

how the Member for Tanglin could think that it  is

a  workable  proposition when the Hon. the  Prime

Minister  of the Federation of Malaya himself  had

said  that it was an unworkable proposition.  Now,

to substantiate that, he quoted the Prime Minister

of the Federation as having said this - I hope I am

not  misquoting him - this is a note which I made  of

his statement:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We cannot take Singapore in a complete merger.

There will be a lot of unhappiness.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know what the Tunku

meant  by  it when he said it, but I can tell  the

House  what I understood by the Tunku's statement.

I  understood the Tunku to mean this, that so  far

as  proposition  (b), taking in Singapore  as  the

twelfth State is concerned, from the point of view

of  the  Tunku, and from the point of view of  the

Federation,  there  would be no  unhappiness.  The

unhappiness  would  stem from Singapore.  That  is

what  I understood the Tunku to mean when he said,

"We  cannot  take Singapore in a complete  merger.

There will be a lot of unhappiness."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Anson is of the view that

the  Hon. the  Prime Minister of  the  Federation

meant  that if he took Singapore in as the twelfth

State,   there  would  be  unhappiness   for   the

Federation. I certainly did not understand him  to

mean that. And we all know, Mr Speaker, Sir,  the

Member  for Anson knows, the Member for Queenstown

knows, the Member for Thomson knows ---



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of clarification. Mr

Speaker, the first part of that is at page 8. This

is the Prime Minister to his Parliament:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Absolute merger, for instance, would cause some

degree of uneasiness in the minds of the people of

both territories.'



<br><br>And then he continued in that vein to show how the

people of the Federation would be rather unhappy:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'but one thing is certain, and that is we cannot

take  Singapore  with  us  in  a  complete  merger

without  a  great deal of unhappiness and  trouble

and so we must find a middle course.'



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, you will see what I

mean.  Now, as I was saying, the Member for  Anson

knows it, the Member for Queenstown knows it,  the

Member  for Thomson knows it, and we, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  all  of us who are in politics and who  have

been in politics for some time know what the basic

trouble is. We know it, Mr Speaker, Sir, and  yet

we  do not mention what the basic trouble is in  a

merger  between  Singapore and the  Federation  of

Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the Member for Thomson and I ask the Member

for  Anson this question, "How could it have  been

possible   for  the  British  to  have   separated

Singapore from the Federation in the year 1946, if

the  people of the Federation of Malaya and if the

people of Singapore had wanted to be together?" Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I ask those responsible Members  to

answer  the question, "Could anybody have kept  us

apart;  could the British have kept  us  apart  if

both of us had really wanted to be together?" They

could not have. If Singapore had wanted it; if the

Federation  had  wanted it, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  no

power  on earth could have stopped it. The  reason

for  this  separation was that the Federation  did

not want us and we did not want to go in then; and

the  reasons are patent to everybody who takes  an

intelligent and an honest interest, if I  may  say

so,  Mr Speaker, Sir, in these matters. The basic

problem  is  the Chinese in Singapore overwhelming

the  Malays in the Federation. That is  the  basic

trouble.  We  know it. The Barisan  know  it.  The

P.A.P. know  it. U.M.N.O. know it.  The  Workers'

Party too know it. The problem has been, how could

we   reconcile  the  fears  of  the  Chinese,  the

legitimate interests of the Chinese, the fears  of

the Malays, the legitimate interests of the Malays

in the Federation - how could



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>



these  fears be reconciled and the two peoples  be

welded  together  into  a  national  entity  in  a

national   unit?  That  was  always  the  problem.

Because there was no solution to the problem then,

the separation came. That was the basic problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, when the Tunku made that speech in the

Federal Parliament, that is what I understood  him

to  mean. The Member for Anson must know something

of  this  problem because he was the  first  Chief

Minister  of Singapore. He must have discussed  it

with  the  Tunku himself, who was then  the  Chief

Minister and later the Prime Minister. The  Member

for  Anson must have known what were the  problems

that  kept  the two territories apart and,  having

understood  the difficulties of the  Federation

Prime  Minister, he, then as Chief  Minister,  did

nothing more about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Member for Anson

said,  he did say this, "citizenship is the  sheet-anchor" that is the basic difficulty in all  these

discussions.  Now,  so far as proposition  (b)  is

concerned,  Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a proposition,

to  my mind at least, which could be acceptable to

the  Federation,  but  it is a  proposition  which

might not be acceptable to Singapore, because in a

complete and unconditional merger as a State on an

equal  basis if we go in as any other State,  then

we  go  in  on  citizenship  proposals  which  are

written into the Constitution already. Unless  and

until  the Parliament of the Federation of  Malaya

over-rides  those provisions in the Constitutional

documents  by an Ordinance, we cannot go  in  with

all  our citizens converted into Federal citizens.

Therefore,  proposition (b),  to  my  mind,  is  a

workable  proposition. It might be  a  proposition

which  is not in our interest, but it is certainly

a  workable proposition from the point of view  of

the  Federation  of  Malaya.  On  that  basis,  we

accept,  because  if  it  is  acceptable  to   the

Federation and it is acceptable to the  people  of

Singapore, of course, it can be worked.  If  there

is  mutuality in this matter, the proposition  can

be  worked. Because of that, Mr Speaker, Sir,  we

agree   to  proposition  (b).  There  is   nothing

sinister  about  it.  It is a completely  workable

proposition.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if I might come back to the actual

amendment  moved  by the Member  for  Thomson.  It

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(d) genuine merger of Singapore with the

Federation   of   Malaya,   with    Singapore

entering the Federation as the twelfth  State

and   with  all  its  Citizens  automatically

becoming Federal Citizens on Merger Day.'



<br><br>The important words, to my mind, in this amendment

are  "genuine  merger", "automatically",  "Federal

Citizens".  By  genuine merger, I suppose  we  now

mean  anything that the P.A.P. does not put forward.

The  next  problem  I have to  deal  with  is  the

question of "automatically". Now, when the  Member

for  Thomson  moved  his motion  on  this,  I  was

waiting  to hear whether he would tell  the  House

exactly  what  he meant by automatic  citizenship.

Unfortunately,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  nothing   was

forthcoming  from  him nor  from  the  Member  for

Queenstown as to exactly what they meant by saying

automatically becoming Federal citizens". It  must

have  a  meaning, Mr Speaker, Sir, It  is  not  a

phrase  which can be left standing in the air.  It

must  be related to some constitutional documents.

It  must be related to some legal position in  the

Federation   before   we   can   truthfully    say

"automatically becoming Federal citizens".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson said this, By automatic

citizenship  we mean something to be  negotiated."

That  is  about all we got from him. So he himself

has   no   clear  idea  of  what   he   means   by

"automatically becoming Federal citizens". So when

he says that it is something to be negotiated for,

I  take it he means something on which we have  to

reach an agreement with the Federation Government.

Now,  if  the  Member for Thomson  had  made  this

proposition  two or three or four or  five  months

ago,  I could see point in the statement. At  this

late  stage, I cannot, especially when  there  are

documents now before the House from the Federation

Prime  Minister which quite clearly indicate that,

so  far  as negotiating for all Singapore citizens

becoming  Federal citizens is concerned,  that  is

not  possible.  Letters  from  the  Federal  Prime

Minister,  which have been laid before the  House,

clearly   say  that  if  you  want  all  Singapore

citizens to become Federal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>



citizens, automatically or in any other way,  that

it  is quite impossible. That is the impression  I

got  from  reading  the letter of  the  Federation

Prime  Minister. If the Member for Thomson  or  if

the  Member  for Anson has other indications  from

the  Prime Minister or any other Ministers in  the

Federation to the contrary, we have not  heard  of

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this House, we have been told that the Member

for  Anson  has been in communication  with  Tunku

Abdul  Rahman on this matter. Whether he  has  got

any  further than the Singapore Government,  I  do

not know. But the point is that we are still being

told  by  the  Member  for Thomson  that  we  must

negotiate  with the Federation Government  on  the

question of citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Constitution, Mr Speaker, Sir, there

are two ways by which citizenship can be acquired.

One  is automatic, as the Member for Thomson said,

because it is by operation of law. By automatic, I

understand it to mean, Mr Speaker, Sir,  that  it

must  be  by operation of law. If it is through  a

process  of  negotiation, it cannot be  automatic,

because there is a third party intervening.  If  a

third  party  intervenes, it cannot  be  automatic

because it is subject to another will. So when the

Member  for  Thomson puts down on the Order  Paper

the   phrase   "automatically   becoming   Federal

citizens",  I  take it that he would  be  able  to

refer  to some constitutional document whereby  it

would  become possible, by operation of  law,  for

all Singapore citizens on merger to become Federal

citizens.  The only clause which I  can  think  of

which  might assist us on this matter  is  section

22,  I  think. Section 22 talks of acquisition  of

citizenship, citizenship by operation of  law.  If

you  will  forgive  me, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I  had

better  read out the whole section, as I think  it

rather important.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Subject to Clause (2) , the following persons

are citizens by operation of law, that is to say:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) every person who, immediately before Merdeka

Day,  was  a  citizen of  the  Federation  by

virtue  of  any  of  the  provisions  of  the

Federation   of   Malaya   Agreement,   1948,

whether by operation of law or otherwise;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) every person born within the Federation

on or after Merdeka Day;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) every person born outside the Federation on

or  after  Merdeka  Day  whose  father  is  a

citizen  at the time of the birth and  either

was born ---'



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker,

Sir, It is not section 22 that he is reading from.

I would like you to direct your mind to it, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I should have said section 14 (1). I

think that would have been obvious. Did I say  22?

I  beg  your pardon. It must have been obvious  to

the  Member  for Anson that I did mean section  14 (1).



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Not obvious to the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I am so sorry I misled the House.

If I may continue from (c), Mr Speaker



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(c) every person born outside the Federation on

or after Merdeka Day whose father is a citizen

at the time of the birth and either was born

within the Federation or is at the time of the

birth in service under the Government of the

Federation or of a State;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) every person born outside the Federation on

or  after  Merdeka Day whose father is a  citizen

at  the  time  of  the birth,  if  the  birth  is

registered  at  a  Malayan Consulate  within  one

year  of  its  occurrence, or within such  longer

period  as  the  Federal Government  may  in  any

particular case allow.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, so far as I am able to, this

is the only provision which allows for citizenship

by operation of law. Now, the other way in which a

State  that  goes into the Federation can  acquire

citizenship is set out in section 22:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If any new territory is admitted to the

Federation  in pursuance of Article 2,  Parliament

may  by  law  determine what  persons  are  to  be

citizens  by reason of their connection with  that

territory  and the date or dates from  which  such

persons are to be citizens.'



<br><br>So,  therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir,  there  are  two

processes  by which citizens of an incoming  state

could   acquire   Federal   citizenship - one,    by

operation  of  law as cited by me previously,  and

the other, by an Act of Parliament moved in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>



Federal Parliament. Now, the first provision,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  section 14  (1),  is  a  statutory

provision and that acts on its own by operation of

law,   but   section  22  is  purely  a  political

provision, it is in the Constitution. No doubt, it

is  possible constitutionally, but what will bring

it  on the Statute Books is a political attitude to

the  problem  that is proposed before the  Federal

Parliament.  Now, the question of  a  State  being

admitted to the Federation is a political one. The

question of who from that stage should be admitted

as Federal citizens is a political one. Now, if my

arguments  up  till  now are correct,  I  ask  the

Member  for  Anson, I ask the Member  for  Thomson

whether  or  not  the question  of  all  Singapore

citizens  becoming  Federal  citizens  is  not   a

political one. If it is recognised that  it  is  a

political one, can they, in all fairness,  say  it

when  they  know,  when the Head  of  the  Federal

Government  has told, them and told us,  and  told

the  House  that  it  is not  possible?  In  those

circumstances,  is  it fair to the  electorate  to

pose  them a question which we all, as responsible

citizens,  know and which the Assembly  knows,  is

not  possible? It is not practical politics. I  am

not telling the Member for Anson or the Member for

Thomson  that  it  is not an ideal  for  which  we

should  not  strive. It is an ideal, Mr  Speaker,

Sir.  We all have ideas of how integration  should

take place. As people entrusted with the destinies

of  Singapore, politics must not  be  looked  at

from  the point of view of idealism alone; we must

also look at it from a practical point of view.

Is  the  proposition, which is formulated  in  the

amendment,   Mr   Speaker,  Sir,   a   practical

proposition? When we want to know whether it is  a

practical proposition, we must view it against the

background  of  the  possibilities  of  its  going

through   the  Federal  Parliament.  If   we   are

convinced,  if we have been told that  it  is  not

possible,  what then is the point  of  posing  the

proposition?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> We can wait.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Thank you. Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

glad the Member for Anson has said it. Why has  he

not said it before in all his arguments?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I have said it all the time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Anson  has  been  merely  supporting  the  Barisan

Sosialis all the time. If the Barisan Sosialis had

made  the  point, "We wish to remain  as  we  are

today," I would have respected them. Let them come

out  openly and say, "We want to remain a  colony

of Great Britain." Whether I agree with that point

of  view  or not, Mr Speaker, Sir, I will respect

it.  There are numbers of people in Singapore  who

might  agree  with  the Barisan Sosialis  if  they

choose  to  remain a colony of Great  Britain.  At

least that is an honest point of view. But to  put

to   the   electorate  the  question  which   they

themselves know cannot and will not be accepted by

the  Federation is a fraud of the highest  degree,

to  my  mind. It is because of that, Mr  Speaker,

Sir, that my Party and I find ourselves unable  to

support  the  proposition  which  the  Member  for

Thomson has suggested in his amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson said a vicious note was

struck  by  the  Singapore People's Alliance  when

they agreed to question (b) and would not agree to

the proposed question (d). I do not think it is  a

vicious note, Mr Speaker, Sir, If I may turn  the

phrase  on  him, I think it is he and the  Barisan

Sosialis  who  are  guilty of  the  vicious  note,

proposing  something to an unsuspecting electorate

which  they  themselves know cannot be acceptable.

What  is  the point? Let us say the Assembly  does

accept   the  proposition  and  puts  it  to   the

electorate and everybody votes for it.  Then  what

happens?  The Federation says, "No,  we  will  not

have  it."  What is the point of it, Mr  Speaker,

Sir?  Unless there is some ulterior motive  behind

all  this.  That  is  the only  possible  rational

explanation  I can think of - the ulterior  motive.

If  there  is no ulterior motive, it seems  to  be

quite  senseless putting a question which we  know

the  Federation will not and cannot accept  today.

Maybe  ten  years  hence, maybe  years,  but  not

today.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Maybe next month.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Maybe next month. But on the documents

now  available to us, it would appear, unless  the

Member   for   Anson  can  enlighten   the   House

otherwise, that the proposed question (d) is not a

workable proposition from the point of view of the

Federation  Government. It takes two  to  make  an

agreement.  The  stand of the  Singapore  People's

Alliance is that Command Paper 33 is a first step.

If  in  two months' time the Member for Anson  can

persuade  the  Federation Government  to  give  us

automatic  citizenship, the second  step  and  the

final  step will be taken. But when we  know  that

the  proposed fourth question is not  a  practical

possibility,  I  think it would be a fraud  on  the

electorate to pose it to them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  day  before last when I  mentioned  the

second amendment  I was referring to the amendment

to  be  moved by the Barisan Sosialis asking  that

Singapore  citizens should be  allowed  to  become

Federal  citizens automatically. At that time,  we

knew that the Barisan Sosialis had an intention to

bring  up  this particular amendment. Subsequently

this  amendment  was  moved  by  the  Member   for

Thomson. So when the Member for Anson said  I  was

referring to him, according to the records of this

Assembly, maybe there is a mistake in the script.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the other day when I was

dealing  with this matter, I clearly  pointed  out

that  I  hoped  that  the representatives  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis in moving this second  amendment

should  make  it clear whether they would  include

the  following meaning in this amendment, that  is

to say, to allow the Central Government to control

education  and  labour. On the face  of  it,  this

amendment is like a man asking some children,  "Do

you want to eat the meat of the heavenly swan?"  I

believe  everybody likes to try the  meat  of  the

heavenly swan, but to be able to eat it, you  must

fulfil  certain  conditions.  In  this  amendment,

there  is  the  suggestion that the  meat  of  the

heavenly  swan is very palatable, but it does  not

say  what  conditions the people must comply  with

before they can eat it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>



That  is to say, if you want to taste the meat  of

the  heavenly swan, you must be prepared to suffer

some stomach ache if it is necessary. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  even up to the present date we have not been

able  to  see  any representatives of the  Barisan

Sosialis who are so frank as the Member for Anson,

who  says  that  he  is prepared  to  accept  this

amendment on the one hand, and, on the other hand,

he  is  prepared to hand over the education policy

and  the  labour policy and other matters  to  the

Central Government of the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Member for Thomson and the Member for

Queenstown   spoke  on  this  amendment,   I   was

listening  to them very attentively  to  find  out

whether they had any grand ideas. Unfortunately, I

was  unable  to  find out from them  whether  they

would  be  prepared  to  persuade  the  people  of

Singapore  to hand over the policies of  education

and  labour  to  the Central Government.  We  were

unable  to  hear  words clearly expressed  to  the

effect that if the amendment is accepted, then the

Singapore Government in future will not be able to

make  use of public funds to assist Chinese middle

schools.  What  will  be  the  future  of  Nanyang

University?  They would not dare  to  say  a  word

about it. Again those who do not know English  and

Malay  will not be able to become Members  of  the

Assembly. Then admission to the civil service will

be  based  on  the  four to  one  ratio,  so  that

preference  is  given  to  Malays.  They  did  not

mention   other  matters  which  are   now   being

practised  in the Federation. They never mentioned

these  conditions before they said they wanted  to

give  the  people the meat of the swan. So  I  say

this amendment is humbug. It is humbug intended to

deceive the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, everybody has either read in

the  newspapers or heard in this house that  the

Prime Minister of the Federation, in his reply  to

a letter from the Prime Minister of Singapore, has

stated  clearly  that he cannot  accept  Singapore

citizens    becoming   automatically    Federation

citizens.  Therefore, I say the  Barisan  Sosialis

are  not  sincere in having merger. That  is  why

they have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>



purposely  brought up this amendment in  order  to

close the door to merger. The P.A.P. Government is

a Government that can face realities. We know that

since   the   time   the  colonialists   separated

Singapore  from Malaya, we in Singapore  have  had

two Chief Ministers who have tried their very best

to  bring  about a reunification between Singapore

and  the  Federation of Malaya.  These  two  Chief

Ministers include the present Member for Anson who

himself has spoken to the Prime Minister of Malaya

on this matter. Even the Member for Cairnhill, who

was the second Chief Minister, has had talks about

this  matter;  but all their efforts  have  proved

futile.  It is the policy of P.A.P. Government  to

treat  Malaya  as  a nation. It will  never  treat

Singapore as a nation. Therefore, when we came  to

power,  we  took a very realistic view. With  this

attitude  we  have tried to have  talks  with  the

Prime  Minister of the Federation of Malaya.  That

is  how  the White Paper on merger has come about.

According   to   the  present  circumstances   and

conditions  prevailing  in Singapore,  this  White

Paper   on  merger  will  pave  the  way   for   a

reunification of Singapore with the Federation. We

do  not  say  it  is the ultimate  objective.  Our

objective  is to have a non-Communist, democratic,

socialist Malaya through merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson is a very clever lawyer,

but  I  feel  that, as a leader of the people,  he

should first have the prerequisite control of  his

own  temper. A person who cannot control  his  own

temper  will  not  be able to hold  the  reins  of

Government  of a country. Even when he represented

the  people  of Singapore and went to  the  United

Kingdom on a very important mission, he failed.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member is quite entitled

to  say, in passing, that the Member for Anson has

got  a short temper. But I do not think he can  go

further than that. We are not interested in  other

times  when  he  has lost his temper,  if  he  has

indeed lost his temper.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,   the  second  point  which  the  Opposition,

especially the Member for Queenstown, has brought



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>



up  is that the representatives of the people must

speak for the interest of the people. On the  face

of it, it appears to be very true and correct, but

if  you  will  look at it further and consider  it

carefully,  then you will see the  true  position.

For  example,  if in the Queenstown  constituency

there  are  some  attap huts to be  demolished  in

order  to give way to houses, then the Member  for

Queenstown,  as  a representative of  the  people,

must  speak  for  the interest  of  the  attap-hut

dwellers.  So  if he says that every  Member  from

every constituency must speak for the interest  of

its  people, then the whole position will be  very

difficult.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

since  the  Member for Queenstown is not  in  this

House, may I clarify for him?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. All the Member can do is to

rise on a point of elucidation - something which the

Member has said which he has not quite understood.

Dr Sheng.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> If the Government wishes to

demolish  attap houses in any electoral  division

at  all,  the  members  of the  Barisan  Sosialis

would  certainly help the Government  to  do  so.

But if ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. This is not a point of

elucidation. This is making a speech. Mr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Similarly,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  in  the  rural  areas,   for

example, the people in each constituency  want  to

have  more  street  lamps, more  standpipes,  more

roads.   If   every  Member  from  his  respective

constituency is really thinking of the interest of

his own constituency



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock): On a point of

order, Sir, Is it relevant to the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member for Havelock does not

wait  to  see what the Parliamentary Secretary  is

leading  up to, it is impossible for me to decide.

I think he is leading up to the point.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Maybe the

Member  concerned was asleep. I was  just  saying,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, that the Member for  Queenstown

said  that  representatives of the  people  should

speak for the people. From his reasoning, it would

appear   that   the   representative   of    every

constituency  must  speak for the  people  of  his

particular constituency. If we want to  listen  to

the people of your own constituency, and everybody

does  so,  then  it  will  be  difficult  for  the

Government - supposing   the   people    in    every

constituency want more street lamps, where is  the

money?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Parliamentary Secretary has made

his point. Let us come on to something different.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I can give you more  examples to prove  that

his  logic is not correct, because we, the P.A.P.,

is  a Party which treats Malaya as a nation and we

want to achieve independence, and to bring about a

nation which is socialist and democratic. That  is

why  the White Paper of the P.A.P has been brought

up  in  the  interest of the  people  in  the  two

territories.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  Singapore   and

Malaya  are  just  like a couple  who  have  been

divorced  for over ten years. If this couple  want

to  have a reunion, and if the man insists on  his

own  conditions  and the woman also  on  her  side

insists  on  her  terms, then  it  will  be  quite

impossible.   If  both  sides  can   come   to   a

compromise, it will be possible for them to have a

reunion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already said in this

House that the Barisan Sosialis basically does not

want  to  have merger. The Member for Thomson  and

his colleagues have said a great deal about merger

between Singapore and Malaya. They say this merger

is  just like a marriage. They seem to me to  want

to  take  Malaya  at  a time when  conditions  are

suitable  for  the victory of Communism.  If  they

look  at this matter from this point of view, then

we  can liken this view to the conditions existing

between  the  mainland of China  and  Formosa.  It

would be a joke.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the Member just try to

come back to the amendment now?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

before  I  conclude my speech, I hope  that  those

Barisan  Sosialis Members who will speak later  on

will  be able to tell us whether they are prepared

to  persuade the people of Singapore to hand  over

education   and  other  matters  to  the   Central

Government of the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

amendment  move  by  the  Member  for  Thomson  as

alternative  (d) differs from alternative  (b)  in

this  one  material  particular -  "with  all   its

Citizens  automatically becoming Federal  Citizens

on  Merger  Day". From the beginning  of  "genuine

merger of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya,

with  Singapore  entering the  Federation  as  the

twelfth    State",   there   is    nothing    that

substantially  differs from alternative  (b).  But

where  it differs is, whereas (b) is unconditional

merger,  (d)  is conditional merger. It  not  only

wants  what  it  calls genuine  merger - meaning

complete   merger - but  it  also  wants  an   added

advantage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not know how the Member for Anson is

going to vote, because I have him on record at the

forum  of  the 26th of June as being  prepared  to

offer a thousand dollars to the National Union  of

Journalists if in fact the Government will put the

alternative in this way, "Do you want  the  P.A.P.

proposals," or "Do you want complete merger?"



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Do read on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> "I say to you" - and I am

reading  on  now - "that I am prepared,  since  the

journalists  are  present, to  donate  a  thousand

dollars  to the National Union of Journalists,  if

in  fact the alternatives are put in that way  and

not  in  the  alleged  merger in  accordance  with

Penang and Malacca."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in response to this public request made

on  a public occasion, we studiously left out  the

words "Penang



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>



and  Malacca"  which, by now, have  terrified  the

Member  for  Queenstown  out  of  his  wits,  have

brought  public disapprobation upon him  from  his

united front colleagues, the Member for Anson ---



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do rise on a

point  of  order. I have been quoted here directly

and  I would like you to see the question, Sir, I

have got it too:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'genuine merger of Singapore with the Federation

of  Malaya, with Singapore entering the Federation

as   the  twelfth  State with  all  its  Citizens

automatically becoming Federal Citizens on  Merger

Day.  If  that alternative which we  ask  for  is

posed  to  the people, I am prepared to  apologise

publicly  and  to pay a thousand  dollars  to  the

National Union of Journalists.'



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have the

Radio Singapore transcript. He is reading it  from

the  Straits Times, but this is on the tape,  this

is on the Radio Singapore transcript, and if there

is  any  doubt,  I  can arrange  for  it  tomorrow

afternoon  in  the  Library.  Sir, I  think   the

resonance  of  the Member for Anson's  voice  will

bear me out:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want the P.A.P. proposals," or "Do you

want complete merger?"



<br><br>That  is  the question. That is what  he  said  in

Hansard.  He said, and I quoted him as saying  so,

Mr Speaker, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If you put these two questions: do you want

merger  complete or P.A.P. merger? -  90  per  cent

will vote for merger complete.'



<br><br>All   right.   This   is  (b) -  merger   complete,

unconditional - in  his  own  words.  How  does   he

reconcile  the condition stipulated by the  Member

for  Thomson, a condition which he knows from  his

own  interview  with  the  Tunku - he  has  had  an

exchange of letters too with the Tunku - that

it is not acceptable?



<br><br>Sir, I say it is dishonest to put an alternative

which in fact is not there. It is like putting  it

on the menu when you have not got the stuff in the

kitchen.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> What about (b)?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Ah, (b), there are eleven

examples.  I say to the Member for Anson  that  we

will fight for (b)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>



and get the people (b). We will fight for them  to

get the Borneo terms, if that is what they want.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would the Prime

Minister permit a matter of elucidation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> He says he will fight for (b) and

get  it. The Prime Minister of the Federation  to

his Parliament on the 16th of October:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The opinions of politicians and leaders of

Singapore  were expressed openly.  Some  were  in

favour  of full merger which would bring Singapore

into  the fold of the Federation as a unit of  the

Federation like Penang or Malacca.'



<br><br>I  want to read the whole, Sir, if you will permit

me - it  is only one paragraph - so that there can  be

no suggestion that I am slanting it:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...like Penang and Malacca. Some expressed the

view  that  a complete merger with the  Federation

would not be in keeping with the situation...'.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member must remember

that this is being translated.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am so sorry, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The opinions of the politicians and leaders of

Singapore  were  expressed openly.  Some  were  in

favour   of  a  full  merger  which  would   bring

Singapore  into  the fold of the Federation  as  a

unit  of  the  Federation like Penang or  Malacca.

Some  expressed  the view that a  complete  merger

with  the Federation would not be in keeping  with

the   situation  and  political  progress  [I   am

thinking of Singapore] and some others felt  there

should  be  a  form of loose federation  with  the

Federation....



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one thing is certain, and that is we cannot

take Singapore with us in a "complete merger" - that

is the phrase in proposal (b) - without a great deal

of  unhappiness and trouble. So we must  find  the

middle course.'



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Quite right, Sir. - "a great

deal of unhappiness and trouble in Singapore". But

if  that is what the people want, we will  get  it

for them.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> And not in the Federation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, with the help of the

Barisan Sosialis and the Member for Anson, we have

convinced everybody in Kuala Lumpur. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>



Tunku and his colleagues are slowly convinced that

perhaps  if  that  is  what  they  want  and  they

genuinely  work  for it and ask for  it  and  they

prove  sincere  in  their representations  to  the

people  in  getting them to vote  for  a  complete

merger on absolute equality with any of the eleven

States,   then  obviously  there   will   not   be

unhappiness  and  trouble and it will  be  brought

about.  I  say  that  regardless  of  what   those

statements say, if any political Party here openly

canvasses  for complete merger as a State  in  the

Federation,  as a twelfth State, or  whatever  you

like to number Singapore as, on the same terms  as

any  of  the eleven States, we `shall get  it  for

them.  But I cannot promise to get more for  them.

That is what this proposition (b) asks for. It  is

as  simple as that. The Member for Anson is in  an

awkward position.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Not me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> He said with great eloquence

on   the  23rd  of  November - merger  complete  and

unconditional. He put in that abstract  adjective,

what the Member for Queenstown and the Member  for

Hong   Lim  did  not  quite  sufficiently  express

themselves.  They  said Penang, Malacca,  complete

merger   and   so   on,   but   he   added   those

words - important  words they were -  "complete  and

unconditional".  And  this condition  (b)  is  not

possible of achievement. It is something that  has

never  been given to any of the eleven  States  in

the   Federation.   It  is  something   which   no

Government  in the Federation, with the electorate

of the Federation as it is, can possibly concede.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> It was given to the other nine

States.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> All right, Sir, if that is

what  the  Member for Anson contends, then  I  say

vote for (b). That was given to the nine States.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> And you just twist it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, no, it is not for me to

twist  it,  Sir, There are nine state  nationality

laws.  What those laws are, the Member  for  Anson

knows well.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>



Not  only must a person be born there, his  father

must  have been born there. He knows that and  the

Member for Hong Lim knows that. He talks about his

family being in Batu Pahat in the Federation.  The

Member for Queenstown comes from Kuala Lumpur. He

knows  that. He was a national of Selangor  and  a

subject  of the Sultan. He came down to  Singapore

to  become  a Singapore citizen - the easy  way.  I

cannot  promise to get something which is  not  on

the  cards.  But  I say, if the Member  for  Anson

seriously  believes that the nationality  laws  of

the  nine  Sultanates give automatic  citizenship,

then let him canvass, and let his fate be decided,

not by me, but by a fair tribunal ---



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Who?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Of Judges.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Who?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Judges.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Anson is

getting  much  too  excited.  If  there   is   any

elucidation, I am sure the Prime Minister will sit

down and the Member can elucidate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> leaves the Chamber [Interruption].

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, this is the second

occasion in my experience in this Chamber that the

Member  for  Anson finds it difficult to  restrain

himself and has to leave the chamber. I hope  that

he will leave at least a wiser man in that he left

just in time before, in the heat of the moment, he

took me up on my challenge that he should canvass.

Because  if  he accepts the nine state nationality

laws, he knows he will come a cropper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is the purpose of this amendment? The

Member for Thomson says that merger is inevitable.

It is a long time since he said that. He said that

once  when  he was a Member of the P.A.P. and  he

stopped saying it when merger came near. But now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>



when  dawn  is  approaching and  his  manipulators

understand  that it is not possible to  avoid  it,

when they are already publicly saying now in their

recent  speeches - the  one  in  Pulau  Saigon  last

Sunday - chan  shih  ter  chou  cher,  a   temporary

setback for progressive forces. That is what  they

are saying. Nobody in his right mind believes that

they really want this. What they want is no merger

until,  of course, there is a Communist government

in  the Federation. Then all is over. That is what

they  want. They do not like the word "Communist".

They  like  the  words "progressive forces".  Sir,

that  is  not possible. History does not wait  for

the  Communists to fulfil the destiny of Malaysia.

If  the  Communists refuse to go in with  history,

then history will take place against their will.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment that has been moved is dishonest in

many  respects.  First, having  exchanged  letters

with  the Tunku - they said the Tunku thanked  them,

Sir,  "thank you for your kind regards." The Tunku

was  so  taken by surprise that these  people  had

kind thoughts for him that he thought fit to thank

them for their salutation. Sir, what do they mean?

If  it  is  only they who were left to  negotiate,

then they would put the heat on. That is what they

meant.  How  would they put the heat on?  That  is

something  they have not answered.  Vaguely,  they

say,  "Ah  well, if only we were there,  something

would  happen." And I tell them what would happen.

First, if we offer (d), if we agree to (d),  which

is  something bogus, something which  we  know  is

unobtainable, then they will campaign  for  it  on

the basis, that it is unobtainable. Then they say,

"Well,  there you are. Since it cannot be got,  it

is  off." But let us assume, for one moment, it is

obtainable. Then there is another condition,  Sir,

another  condition which the Member for Queenstown

in  the  radio forum on the 26th reminded  us  of.

This is on page 5 of the radio transcript. "Second

condition,  if  that is accepted." Then  be  said,

"proportional  representation  in  the  Federation

Parliament which will raise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>



us  up", according to them, "from 15 to 25,  maybe

even  30."  That  will make it difficult  for  the

Tunku to say "yes" or anybody to say "yes". But in

case  the Tunku says "yes" to that too, the Member

for  Queenstown has got another condition - provided

it  occurs immediately and is followed  by  a  Pan-Malayan  general election and the Tunku  dissolves

his  Government.  Then there is no  government  to

checkmate  them.  A  general  election  in   Kuala

Lumpur; a general election in Singapore - a general

melee; anything can happen. That is what it is all

about.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> You are frightened of an

election!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We are not frightened of an

election.  It will take place by and by.  Let  the

Member for Nee Soon not doubt that. I only hope he

will be there to take part in it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the price really that the Government has to

pay  for  all this - we could easily opt out  if  we

were irresponsible; if we wanted to; welsh on  our

responsibilities. There is a simple  way  out.  We

throw  our cards in. We are not hanging on.  There

is  no  benefit  in this. We are  fighting  for  a

cause.  It  is only worth while if we achieve  our

cause, and that cause is the reunification of  the

two  territories  and  the maintenance  of  racial

harmony.  If  we allowed mad fellows to  go  round

playing a gambit in amendment (b), it would end up

in  an  impasse  that would lead to hostility  and

antipathy  between Singapore and  the  Federation,

which  means  really  a  Malay  majority  in   the

Federation  and a Chinese majority  in  Singapore,

which  would eventually end in a cleavage  of  the

whole  of the population of Singapore, Malaya  and

the Borneo territories, between the Malays and the

Chinese, that is what it means.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> That is what they want!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I will say it is not our

business  to help them to do that. Insofar  as  we

can, it is our business to bring about this racial

harmony.   That  is  why  we  are  not  advocating

complete merger.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson says we are pandering to

chauvinistic  sentiments by talking  of  education

and labour. Sir, knowing them well and knowing the

local  situation intimately, we thought it prudent

to try and bridge the widening gulf of 17 years of

separation by taking the reunification in  stages.

The  ideal  is complete and absolute merger - nobody

denies that. But I say anybody who tries to  bring

education   and   labour  into   line   with   the

Federation's policy on these two subjects at  this

moment  knows - if he does not know it, then  he  is

not  fit to be in this Chamber - and if he knows and

says  that he wants to bring it about, then I  say

he  is  up  to  mischief. Even  with  education  a

reserved subject, we saw an attempt to disrupt all

the  Chinese schools last December. Then,  at  the

impetuous  request  of the Member  for  Anson - from

time to time he has this irresistible impulse, and

I  am  glad  he has betaken himself off from  this

Chamber, otherwise  he  might  land  the  Barisan

Sosialis  in  more trouble by asking  more  things

which  are  no  good for them - he asked  for  that

Commission of Inquiry, and we accepted it. He  put

the  Member for Queenstown in a tough and  awkward

position because the Member for Queenstown had  to

stand  up and say he supported the Commission  for

Inquiry.  But  no  sooner had  the  Commission  of

Inquiry  got going then they attempted to stage  a

boycott  of  schools, strikes from classrooms  to

stop  the Commission of Inquiry. That flopped too.

And  this  with  education as a reserved  subject.

Does  anybody in his right mind believe  that  the

Chinese  school situation will be calm  as  it  is

today with two massive attempts by the Communists,

already frustrated if education was going to go to

the  centre? What is the purpose of this. Sir?  To

play  a  dangerous game at all costs.  Since  they

cannot  get  the people excited on behalf  of  the

Communist  cause, then they identify the Communist

cause  with the Chinese cause generally. It is  as

simple  as that. Our business is not to allow  the

Chinese  to be so silly, so simple as to be  taken

in  by the Communists. Just as the Communists,  we

also put up a united front. It is our business  to

look after Chinese education and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>



culture  in  order  that it  shall  not  become  a

political   issue,  in  order  that  no   primeval

emotions   are  aroused  or  cause  real  trouble,

trouble  which,  once  started,  none  of  the  13

Members  opposite, nor the Members of the  Central

Committee  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis,   nor   the

Committee underground that directs them,  will  be

able  to stop. And I say to you, Mr Speaker, Sir,

that if anybody doubts what the outcome of such  a

situation would be if there were an impasse,  then

I  say  he has only to look back on  the  years

immediately following the ending of Japanese  rule

when  violent clashes took place in many parts  of

the  Federation. They have only to  look  back  to

some  of the incidents that took place only a  few

years  ago  both  in  Penang  Island  and  Pangkor

Island. Only fools and lunatics will embark  on  a

racist  policy  regardless of the consequences  of

the people of Malaysia.



<br><br>7.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I have just heard the

speech  by  the  Prime Minister. One  point,  Sir,

which makes me quite happy is that he cannot  deny

the  amendment moved by us that this amendment  is

the  stand  and has been the stand of the  Barisan

Sosialis on merger.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Interjection by the Prime Minister in Mandarin]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am afraid that interjection

is lost to the Speaker. Perhaps the Prime Minister

is rising on a point of elucidation. I am sure the

Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I want to point out to the

Member  for Upper Serangoon, as I do not  want  to

be  as  unkind  as his two allies in  the  united

front - the Member for Anson and the Member for Hong

Lim - who took advantage at the radio forum  to  say

how  wrong his leader was, that I leave it to them

to heap abuse on each other.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  before I continue my speech, let  me  answer

the interjection made by the Prime Minister.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister must have remembered that when I was on the side of the

Government  my  speeches did not  go  to  him  for

scrutiny. At that time, my views could be regarded

as representative, views of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he has no reason to suspect me. But when I

was  on the side of the Barisan Sosialis, my views

do not mean the views of the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Ching chi yi fah

yen.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, maybe I

spoke  in  the  double negative way  that  brought

about the difficulty in translation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although all along we have been on a

different  political stand against  the  Singapore

People's  Alliance, but from the speeches  of  the

Member for Farrer Park and the Member for Tanglin,

we  feel that they are really more honest than the

P.A.P.  They  are aware of our stand,  unlike  the

P.A.P. who distort our political stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> leaves the Chamber.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): You feel fed up?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have said time and again

that  when a Member walks out of the Chamber  with

decorum, he must be treated with decorum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): At the time when

the  Member  for  Anson left his seat,  the  Prime

Minister also passed a similar remark.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I chose my words very carefully. I

said  when a Member walks out of this Chamber with

decorum, he should be treated with decorum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Member for Tanglin has pointed  out  to

this  House  that according to him  the  amendment

under   (d)   is  the  fourth  door   leading   to

reunification of Singapore with Malaya,  but  this

point is fundamentally important.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>7.40 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER in the chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he has said that the other side of this

door  is  bolted by the Federation and  cannot  be

opened,  he  has not denied that this  is  a  door

which  could lead to the reunification of the  two

territories. He takes our amendment together  with

the other three proposals as four doors leading to

the  reunification  of the two  territories.  Now,

this  is quite correct. Our stand on merger  is  a

door.  With  regard to the three other  proposals,

one is the P.A.P. White Paper on merger - this is  a

door  through which the P.A.P. want  to  lead  the

people. We tell the people that this door does not

lead to the reunification of the people of the two

territories. The second door which the P.A.P. have

distorted  is  proposed by the Barisan  Sosialis;

the  P.A.P. purposely say that this is a  trap  in

the  hope that the people will be intimidated into

not  making this choice. Now, the third  door  is

the  amendment moved by the Member for Cairnhill.

This door is open, but it is quite dark inside and

where it leads to nobody knows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We propose this amendment in order to enable the

people  to  choose the right track  to  lead  them

towards  the reunification of the two territories.

Although, according to the Prime Minister and  the

Member for Cairnhill, the other side of this  door

is  bolted  by the Tunku, yet we have to  let  the

people  know. Just because this door is bolted  by

the Federation on the other side, we cannot make a

wrong  choice  to lead the people, on  the  wrong

track. The Member for Anson pointed out that  this

door  was  closed  temporarily. We  can  wait  and

during  our  time  of  waiting,  we  can  make   a

reasonable  appeal  to the Federation  Government.

The   impossibility  of  a  merger  of   the   two

territories  does not necessarily  mean  that  the

people  of  the  two  territories  will  live   as

enemies.  If the Federation Government  feel  that

they  cannot  temporarily  allow  the  people   of

Singapore to enter into the Federation, this  does

not follow that Singapore and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>





Federation  cannot adopt any economic  measure  to

benefit  the  people of the two  territories.  The

economic  barrier between the two  territories  is

already known to the people. I need not elaborate

on  it  here.  I just want to point out  that  the

people  are compelled to accept the door  selected

by  the  P.A.P. This is the sole interest  of  the

P.A.P.  This can only be interpreted to mean  that

the  P.A.P. are  trying to save their  own  fate.

Apart   from  that,  I  cannot  find   any   other

explanation or interpretation. The people of  this

country can wait, but the P.A.P. cannot wait,  and

we understand this point very clearly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park quoted Article 22 of

the  Federal  Constitution and he  explained  that

this  provision  is  a  political  provision.   Of

course, the merger of Singapore and the Federation

is   a  political  matter.  We  request  that  the

citizens of Singapore should automatically  become

Federal  citizens on Merger Day. This  is  also  a

political   matter.  Since  this  is  a  political

matter,  I  see  no reason why it  should  not  be

solved  by political means. What we object  to  is

that  the  P.A.P. are playing  a  game  of  party

politics  on  this  question of  merger.  But  our

contention that all Singapore citizens must become

Federal  citizens  is  one that  transcends  party

politics.  I  think the Member  for  Farrer  Park

should  understand  this. Now  the  whole  dispute

centres  on  this point, that is, what  questions,

should  be  put on a ballot paper in the  national

referendum for the choice of the people? Our  main

idea  is to find out the views of the majority  of

the  Singapore citizens on merger. If we only  say

that  the  Federation Government may  not  accept,

then this will be a matter on which we can consult

them.  It  is  not  a matter on  which  we  should

consult  the  people of Singapore. We  should  not

consider first what the political leaders  in  the

Federation think but what the people of  Singapore

think  of  merger.  The P.A.P.  Government  should

understand that they were elected by the people of

Singapore, and so, in the first place,  they  must

consult  them. We should, in the first place,  get

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>



positive opinion of the people of Singapore before we

open  negotiations with the Federation Government.  I

believe that the Federation Government is a realistic

Government  and if the Singapore Government  can  get

the  concerted support of the people for negotiations

with  the Federation Government, then I believe  that

the  result of such negotiations will be much  better

than  what has been obtained by a few P.A.P. leaders

in their talks with the Federation Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister in his speech just now has said that our amendment is a dishonest amendment. His only reason for saying so is that the Barisan stand on merger asks for proportionate representation in the Central Parliament and pan-Malayan general elections

when the arrangements for merger have been completed.

He  says  that  the  tabling  of  this  amendment  is

dishonest because of these two conditions. I will say

that his remark is itself dishonest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Minister for Finance stressed time

and  again that our stand of true and complete merger

would  not  be  more advantageous to  the  people  of

Singapore.  He  said  that  the  White  Paper  merger

proposals  would, on the other hand, give the  people

something more. This comparison is just like  telling

a  girl  that she had better get married because  she

would  then be given a car, a house and a  key  to  a

safe  deposit box. But we on this side of  the  House

feel  that  the stand of the P.A.P. on merger,  which

promises so many things, will not be accepted by  the

people;  that  is to say, the girl may not  be  happy

with  all the comforts given to her because there  is

something  lacking, and that is the legal status  and

security  of  her marriage. We propose that  we  must

have equal rights with those of the Federal citizens.

This  is  the point we want to stress and it  is  the

same as insisting on security and the legal status of

a marriage. I believe that many people on matrimonial

matters must first consider whether such a union will

he  afforded  any legal status. Now, the  P.A.P. are

asking  the  people not to have such a legal  status.

That means they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>



are asking the people not to have citizenship rights.

Instead  they  only  ask the  people  to  have  cars,

houses,  labour, and education. That is all. Just  to

induce   the  people.  We  therefore  see  that   our

amendment, to the motion can be compared on  similar

lines with the P.A.P. White Paper on merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the Prime Minister said a few moments ago that if merger could not ensure that

Singapore  would  be  given autonomy  in  labour  and

education, then Singapore would have some misfortune.

I  want  to ask: if there is complete merger  between

Singapore  and the Federation and if there should  be

any  misfortune arising out of autonomy in labour and

education, who should shoulder the responsibility? We

cannot agree with the arguments of the P.A.P. because

today,  apart  from  asking  for  merger,  they  have

forgotten  their political ideologies and convictions

at  the  time  when  the Party was formed.  In  other

words,    they   have   forgotten   their   socialist

principles. Otherwise, they should avoid accusing and

scolding  people  who want to have  equal  rights  in

labour  and education and other matters. Instead  the

P.A.P. should persuade the leaders of the Federation

Government to change their policy. That should be the

proper thing to be done by a truly socialist Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance said towards the end of his speech yesterday that we should pay attention to what he said, so that we would not regret in future. He told us that if we should continue to oppose the P.A.P. type of merger, then we would have misfortune

falling on our heads. Here, I would like to tell  him

this - there  is  nothing for us to regret  because  we

feel that the Greater Malaysia Plan is a plan of  the

colonialists.  In  opposing  the  colonial  plot   or

intrigue,  no matter what difficulties we Members  of

the  Barisan Sosialis will come across in future,  we

today  in  the present struggle have gained more  and

more  respect  from the people, in the  meantime,  we

have  been  very successful in exposing the  colonial

stooges, not like the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, much has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>



said  about changing and somersaulting. Let us see,

Sir, who is somersaulting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> S.P.A.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Seow Peck Leng: We are now faced with an

amendment  moved  by the Member for  Thomson  which

asks  for a fourth question. Then immediately after

that,  from  the  Order Paper, you  see  their  own

leader  saying, again after many repetitions,  that

he wants one question. Let us have it, Sir. Do they

want  one question, or do they want four questions?

It  has been one question over the radio forum;  it

has  been one question at the rallies; it has  been

one question in this Chamber; and now he wants four

questions. Then back again, immediately after that,

one  question  again. They cannot decide,  Sir.  Do

they  want one question or four questions?  Who  is

somersaulting? The S.P.A. or the Barisan Sosialis?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member for Cairnhill proposed question

(c).  It  was  said  that  he  was  dishonest,  not

sincere, somersaulting. I cannot remember what they

said, Sir, but they said a lot of things about him.

The  Member for Queenstown himself said- or  rather

he  meant it as an accusation - that the Member  for

Cairnhill  has put in amendment (c) because  it  is

acceptable  to  the Federation. Sir,  is  it  their

policy   to  put  down  questions  which  are   not

acceptable to the Federation? What do they get  out

of  it? Is it not the right thing to do - to see that

in  a  merger,  which concerns  two  parties,  both

parties must accept the terms? And would it not  be

easier  and  more  smooth sailing if  both  parties

accept  it?  Yet  it  was meant  as  an  accusation

against  the Member for Cairnhill - that he  puts  it

there  because  he  knows it is acceptable  to  the

Federation, is it a crime to put in a question that

we know is acceptable to the Federation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Upper Serangoon, I think, has said

that it is the people of Singapore we must consult,

and  not the people in the Federation. And I  think

the   Member  for  Queenstown  has  said  that   we

represent the people of Singapore and why are  we,

the  S.P.A.,  speaking on behalf of the Federation?

We  are  not  speaking on behalf of the Federation.

What we propose to the people must be something



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>



practical and preferably if we know it is going  to

be  accepted  by  the Federation.  I  do  not  know

whether  the Member for Cairnhill knows whether  it

was  to  be accepted by the Federation or not,  but

all  credit to him if he knew it was to be accepted

when he put it down.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> May I remind the hon. Member

for  Mountbatten  that  we  are  not  debating  the

amendment moved by the Member for Cairnhill? We are

debating  the  amendment moved by  the  Member  for

Thomson. So may I suggest that since the hon.  Lady

has  not  yet  spoken  on  the  original  question,

perhaps she could reserve all those arguments until

we come to the original Question, as amended by the

Member for Cairnhill, and after we have disposed of

all the amendments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Seow Peck Leng: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

with  due  respect  to  you,  I  was  not  debating

question (c). I was answering the charges  made  by

the  Members  of the Barisan Sosialis  against  the

Member for Cairnhill. However, Sir, I will pass  on

as  you have ruled. I would say that amendment  (d)

is  not  only  not  practical  but  not  necessary,

because we have the 11 States of the Federation and

Singapore  and  the  three  territories  of  Borneo

involved  in Malaysia. Questions (a), (b)  and  (c)

cover  all  the  aspects. (a)  is  what  the  Prime

Minister  of  Singapore has agreed with  the  Prime

Minister of the Federation; (b) is what the  eleven

States are getting; and (c) is what the other three

territories  are  getting. Therefore,  these  three

cover  all  the grounds of all the people concerned

in  Malaysia.  Singapore is given the  supreme  and

unique privilege of choosing any of them, that  is,

on  the basis of the eleven states or on the  basis

of  the  three territories in Borneo. So by  having

(d),  what new ground are we covering? Nothing that

concerns  all  the people or the  States  that  are

involved  in  Malaysia. I say it is not  practical,

Sir,  because we are asking not to be like everyone

else  that  is  involved. We are given  the  unique

privilege,  as I have said, to choose  any  one  of

them. We are not satisfied with that, but we say we

must have much more than that. It is good if we can

get  it,  Sir.  But we must consider that  although

Tunku Abdul Rahman may be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>



the  Prime  Minister,  he too  must  consider  the

feelings of the people who had elected him.  There

would  be  pressures on him if he started treating

Singapore  as his blue-eyed adopted child.  So  he

has  to give consideration to both sides, Sir, our

people  as  well as the practicability  of  it  in

Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And talking about vagueness. They say (b) and

(c) are vague. It is an unknown quantity and so on

and  so  forth. Look at (d), Sir, Is it not vague?

Genuine merger! I wonder whether anybody can  give

me a legal interpretation from any law book of the

term "genuine merger". Sir, if you say you want  a

genuine ruby, I know what you mean. But if you say

genuine   red,  what  is  genuine  red?   Crimson?

Vermilion? Dark red? Light red? Dull red? Which do

you  consider a genuine red? When you say "genuine

merger",   I   think   you   need   to   have   an

interpretation of what it means. It is more  vague

than  the others. At least (b) says, like  one  of

the  States. And all you have to do is to take out

the  constitution  of  the eleven  States  or  the

contract  of  the eleven States and  see  what  it

means.  (c)  is a little vague. Yes, I admit,  "no

less favourable". But it is favourable to us, Sir.

That vagueness is to our advantage. It is not less

favourable. That means we can ask for more. If  we

think the terms of the three territories of Borneo

are  not  sufficient, all right, we will  ask  for

more.  That vagueness is to our advantage.  It  is

not  to  our disadvantage. So I do not see why  we

are quarrelling with that type of vagueness. As  I

said,  the  vagueness of genuine  merger  is  more

dangerous  because we do not know what  it  means.

Then  they  will say as the twelfth State.  On  an

equal  basis? An unequal basis? A better basis?  A

worse  basis? How? Is it clear, Sir? Is  there  no

vagueness  in  that  as the  twelfth  State?  How?

Probably it is in their minds "on an equal basis".

But  as it is, I see it is more vague than (b)  or

(c). They are probably to our disadvantage. Sir, I

said  just  now  that it was not practical, apart

from the pressures that I mentioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown himself said this. In

his  own words, he said that the Tunku said it was

possible to have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>



automatic  citizenship. But he  himself  said  the

Tunku  said that he would not grant it. Now,  Sir,

why  ask the people, "Do you want it?" and in  the

next  breath tell them, "But you know you are  not

going to get it. The Tunku does not want it." As I

have  pointed out, it has to be accepted  on  both

sides to be practical.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson gave as an example of

the  dishonesty of the two questions (b) and  (c).

He says, if a girl says, "I want to marry Mr X. I

do not want to marry Mr A. I do not want to marry

Mr  B.  I do not want to marry Mr C. I  want  to

marry  Mr  X." Is that dishonesty? he asked.  No,

Sir.  Not  if the girl says it. But if the  Member

for Anson, knowing that the man, Mr X, is already

married  or for some reason cannot marry the  girl

and  goes to the girl and says, "Do not marry  Mr

A.  Do not marry Mr B. Do not marry Mr C. Insist

on Mr X. I will help you to get Mr X." I call it

dishonesty. That is where the dishonesty comes in.

When  you  know that Mr X is already married,  or

not  able  for some reason or other to  marry  the

girl - it  is not possible for her to marry  him - and

yet you tell her, "Do you want Mr X?" and insist,

"Do  not marry Mr A. Do not marry Mr C." If  the

girl  herself,  knowing Mr X  is  married,  says,

"Since I cannot marry Mr X, well, I prefer to  be

unmarried all my life." Not dishonesty.  I  agree.

The  answer  to  his question is  no.  It  is  not

dishonesty. But the analogy is not quite  correct.

In  this  case we are telling the electorate,  "Do

not  have the White Paper. Do not have Borneo.  Do

not  have  an equal basis with the eleven  States.

Ask for automatic citizenship." Knowing that it is

not   available,  that  is  where  I  say  it   is

dishonest, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably, Sir, with all these long sittings, we

are  all  getting quite tired and easily confused.

With  all  this  double talk of somersaulting - when

they  accuse us of double somersaulting, and  when

people who accuse them somersault themselves - I can

quite  understand the interpreters themselves  are

getting  confused  with double  negatives.  It  is

typical  of  the  Barisan. They have  confused  us

enough.  Now  they are using double negatives  and

confusing the interpreters too.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, what would be the result if the people

chose  (d)?  Let us say that the majority  of  the

people voted for (d). What would be the result? No

merger. Then they say, "Why not?" Why can  we  not

wait? We can wait. The P.A.P. cannot wait because

they  are toppling. But we can wait. Probably they

are  right in one way. The P.A.P. is toppling  and

cannot  wait  and  all  that.  But  where   I   am

concerned,  I too can wait, Sir. But  let  us  see

whether the waiting is going to benefit us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you are looking for a job as a general

manager  of  a firm. You go there and  the  people

say,  "Well,  you are new. I do not have  so  much

confidence  in  you.  Let  us  start  you  as   an

assistant manager." The firm says, "You want  $500

or  $600 pay. We will give you $400 or $450."  You

say, "No fear. Give me a general manager's job  or

none at all." And the firm say, "No vacancy. Prove

your worth. We will give it to you when there is a

vacancy, and when you have proved your worth." You

say,  "No, no, no. I will go jobless. I will wait.

Let  me be jobless. Unless I get $600 as a general

manager, I will not work." I will not wait, Sir, I

do  not  know,  because opinions differ.  I  would

rather take up the job as assistant manager, prove

my worth, and then get promoted to general manager

if I am worthy of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> That is a matter of opinion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Seow Peck Leng: A matter of opinion, yes.

But  do not say that we are dishonest, because  we

say,  "Do not wait." Well, probably they are rich,

Sir,  they  can  live  without  the  $400  pay  as

assistant manager. But if I depend on my job, what

else can I do, but to accept that? [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Seow Peck Leng: So, Sir, wait, yes, wait,

if  it benefits us. But to wait at a loss, I would

rather say, "Do not wait."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also compared this case

with a girl wanting to marry Mr X. She knows  she

cannot



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>



marry him for another three years or so - I do not

remember the exact number of years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Seven.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Seow Peck Leng: Oh, seven, yes. Well, what

you  are doing is that you are advocating that the

girl should be a mistress. Is it right that if she

cannot marry Mr X until seven years more she must

now be his mistress?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>

There is the Women's Charter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Seow Peck Leng: But mistress, can. Even in

the  Women's  Charter,  you  can  be  a  mistress.

Anyway, Sir, this analogy is again wrong because a

mistress  is someone who is ostracized by society,

looked down upon by the law of the land; it is not

legal,  it  is also looked down upon  morally.  If

Singapore  goes through with the White  Paper,  is

the   rest   of  the  world  going  to   ostracise

Singapore? Or are we going to lose our trade?  If

we go through the White Paper merger, if Singapore

is  going to be looked down upon and everybody  in

the  rest  of  the world says, "Ha, you  become  a

mistress now, we will not be friends with you;  we

will  not  have anything to do with you,"  are  we

going to lose our prestige? Are we going to  lose

our trade? So the comparison with the mistress  is

not  quite fair. It would be more fair to  compare

it  with  my example of if you cannot be a manager

today,  well, be the assistant manager  first.  It

would  be more fair to compare it that way because

both  are  working towards certain advantages;  no

doubt complete merger is like the general manager,

bigger  pay  probably, better,  but  then  we  are

accepting a lesser pay towards a bigger result. We

are not accepting something that is ostracized  or

is  legally and morally looked down upon. So, Sir,

from  that  point  of view, I do  not  think  that

Singapore  can be termed to be a mistress  of  the

Federation.  Probably  we  are  starting   as   an

unimportant  little brother trying  to  prove  his

worth  to become one day a brother whom the  elder

brother will look up to with respect - as the S.P.A.

said  during  the merger debate that this  is  the

first step towards complete merger.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis say that automatic

citizenship  is possible and that  the  Tunku  has

said  it  is  possible. Probably, Sir, I  am  not

arguing  that it is not possible, and the more  we

know  that it is possible, the more we should work

towards  that  objective. And how should  we  work

towards it? The way that they are doing, Sir?  Not

even  the  way the P.A.P. have been behaving.  And

they must admit this, I am sure in their hearts of

hearts - if  they  do not admit it  now,  they  will

admit  it  in  their hearts of hearts - their  past

behaviour   of   having  collaborated   with   the

Communists.    They   themselves    called    them

Communists.  I do not know whether they  are,  but

they  now  call them Communists. They collaborated

with  the  Communist front people; they befriended

them, shielded them, held them, came to power with

their  help  and all that. That type of  behaviour

naturally calls for suspicion from the Federation,

and  the  Federation  at once  says,  "Beware,  be

careful;  do  not come too close, do not  get  too

much  involved." That is the natural  reaction  of

anybody, and the present behaviour of the Barisan,

with  the  P.A.P. shouting  Communists  at  them,

rightly or wrongly ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Rightly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Seow Peck Leng: --- or justifiably or

unjustifiably, raises suspicion and  fear  in  the

Federation. They are frightened to get too  close.

They  are  frightened to put themselves  too  much

into it. Let us try first, they say, a little  bit

and  see  how  it  works out. Can we  blame  them?

Instead of taking this and saying, "All right, you

take this opportunity; you will eat your own words

later  on.  We will prove our worth; we will  show

you  what a good small brother we are; and we will

prove   to   you   and  we  will   get   automatic

citizenship." If it is possible, as they say it is

possible,  and the Tunku has said it is  possible,

well then let us work towards it and not behave in

the  way they are behaving. The way that they  are

behaving,  Sir, is driving more and more  fear  in

the  Federation.  In the end, they  will  probably

even say, "No White Paper;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>



we  do  not want to have anything to do  with  you

since  there  are  so many Communists  there;  the

Communists seem to be so strong there."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask you, Sir, if you have a son whom you

suspect is gambling and living a bad life and  you

have  some property to leave him; what would  make

you  decide  whether  you should  leave  him  that

property? By his trying to prove that he is not  a

gambler,  that  he lives a good life?  Or  by  his

fighting  with  you  and  in  the  fight  actually

showing  you that he can be a hooligan?  And  your

suspicion  that he is mixed up with bad hats  gets

stronger and stronger every day. Is that  the  way

he is going to convince you to leave your property

to him?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way is to make the Federation respect you

and  to  have more confidence in you.  Let  us  do

that, Sir, If we accept this White Paper and  then

we  prove to the Federation how worthy we  are  of

that  trust. Even if the P.A.P. shout their  lungs

out  - I shall be finishing, Sir, this is the  last

sentence - that the Barisan are Communists; but  if

the Barisan prove their worth to the Federation, I

am  sure, Sir, that the Federation people are  not

fools;  they will see through if this  is  just  a

wolf  cry. And I tell the Barisan - this is my  last

sentence and advice to them - "Prove your worth."



<br><br>8.27 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta) (In Mandarin): Mr

Deputy  Speaker,  Sir, today we are  debating  the

amendment moved by the Member for Thomson  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis. The bringing of this  amendment

can  be  interpreted  as the  attitude  of  a  kid

playing  with sand. The Barisan Sosialis  are  not

sincere at all. And just because of that attitude,

they bring forward various contentions; today they

bring forward this contention, tomorrow they bring

forward the other contention ---



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I think it is time to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We are on the amendment moved by the

Member  for  Thomson.  At the  end  of  the  Prime

Minister's motion as amended, to add



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) genuine merger of Singapore with the

Federation   of   Malaya,   with    Singapore

entering the Federation as the twelfth  state

and   with  all  its  Citizens  automatically

becoming Federal Citizens on Merger Day'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the words proposed to be

added, be there added."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Chan Choy Siong (In Mandarin): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  in  the  past few days the Barisan  Sosialis

Members  have  been saying that we have  distorted

their  stand.  But  what  is  the  fact?  Have  we

distorted their stand? Is it necessary for them to

introduce this amendment today? It is very  simple

to  answer this question. I believe many people in

Singapore  have received a copy of  the  manifesto

given by the Barisan Sosialis as a gift to each of

them.  Now this has been their stand all along.  I

have  here a copy of the manifesto of the  Barisan

Sosialis. I will quote paragraph 5:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Our stand on constitutional future



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reunification of our country and our

people - there are two alternatives before us - one is

immediately  to  establish  a  full  and  complete

merger   with  Singapore  becoming  one   of   the

component states of the Federation like Penang and

Malacca.  The  second alternative  is  to  form  a

confederation   with  Singapore   retaining   full

internal  self-government, if possible,  with  the

Borneo territories joining the confederation.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion by our Prime Minister includes the two

questions as suggested by the Barisan Sosialis and

as  appearing in their manifesto. From this we can

see whether we have distorted their stand, as they

have  accused us. This, I think, can be very clear

to  all  the  people of Singapore. The  people  of

Singapore also know what is the true stand of  the

Barisan Sosialis on merger. And it is also because

they  have  such a stand that is why at the  radio

forum on the question of merger, the leader of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>



Barisan  Sosialis, who was present then, gave  his

opinion. Our Minister for Finance was also present

and he accepted their opinion. But when they found

this  was not what the people who are manipulating

behind   the   Barisan   Sosialis   wanted,   they

immediately changed their stand by requesting  for

automatic conversion of citizenship. That is  also

what  is contained in the amendment introduced  by

the Member for Thomson today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, history progresses with time.

The  question of merger today is not a  fact  yet.

But  we  all can see that the wishes of the people

of  Singapore,  the Federation of Malaya  and  the

Borneo territories for a united country will  soon

materialise. However, today we have certain people

sitting opposite who are dreaming and who want  to

ask  for  the  stars and things  which  cannot  be

realised  to  be  their  merger  proposals.  Their

putting forward such a proposition shows what they

are.  But  they  cannot block  merger  from  being

realised.  Members of the Opposition  Parties  and

the  Barisan Sosialis are struggling for survival.

That  is why, being in this predicament, they have

introduced  such an amendment as this  one  before

this  House.  But I am afraid their last  struggle

may be too late, because the people have known for

a very long time that the Barisan Sosialis are not

sincere on the merger issue. Why do they appear to

be so keen on trying to secure citizenship for the

600,000-odd  citizens of Singapore? I  think  they

are  only trying to use it as a cover and as a red

herring  in order to divert the people's attention

from  their  actual motive of frustrating  merger.

Today they say that merger is good, but the people

have not accepted their word at its face value.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have made another great blunder. They keep

on  harping  on  the  theory of  independence  for

Singapore.  They put forward this theory  when  in

fact  they are living in an ivory tower. Is  it  a

realistic  way out? I would say no. The road  they

have  been advocating is not a realistic way  out.

It  is  a  blind alley leading to death. With  the

brains  they possess, they could now say that  the

P.A.P. have changed their stand,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>



hoping  that the P.A.P. will follow them into  the

blind alley. We have not done so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Anson by-election they tried to capsize

the P.A.P. and split the P.A.P. As a result, 13 ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I remind the hon. Member

that  we are on the amendment moved by the  Member

for  Thomson? Perhaps she should come back to  the

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Chan Choy Siong (In Mandarin): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I only intended to  mention  these

facts to show that they had some relationship with

the  amendment  moved by the Member  for  Thomson,

and, as I have said just now, because they do  not

want  to  see the realisation of a united  Malaya.

They  want to topple the P.A.P. in order to thwart

the progress of merger. But the progress of events

is  not  something  that  everybody  can  foresee.

Reunification of the two territories perhaps might

take  quite  a long time. History has gone  beyond

our expectations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Thomson has today introduced this motion. If they have confidence in

merger  and  are sincere about it, why,  when  the

White  Paper on merger was introduced and  debated

in  this  Assembly, since that time and  all  this

time   have   they  been  trying  to   block   the

realisation  of merger? It is because  they  know

that  the  White Paper of the P.A.P. on merger  is

the correct one in the eyes of the people. But  to

the  minority in the Barisan Sosialis  it  may  be

detrimental to them. That is why they are all  the

time saying that it is a kind of sell-out plan and

they  have  been  arguing  that  this  plan,  when

realised,  will bring bankruptcy to the people  of

Singapore, and is only in the interest  of  a  few

Ministers.  They say it is to save the P.A.P  from

bankruptcy. If it is so, then there will  be  many

countries   in   the   world   where   there    is

dictatorship, and they hope, if Singapore is still

a  colony, they may be in a better position.  Even

if  merger  is  now realised, in the  coming  five

years we will have to face the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>



people  again and be judged by them in  regard  to

what we have done in the past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, today the Barisan Sosialis and

their fellow travellers, however hard they try  to

cover  up their intentions, and however hard  they

try  to  wreck merger, cannot prevent merger  from

being realised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Upper Serangoon has said that if

the propositions from Singapore are not acceptable

to  the Federation, then they could wait. But  are

we  going  to wait for a hundred years, a thousand

years? Also during the time of waiting, what about

the  economy and the livelihood of the  people  in

these  two territories? How are they going  to  be

resolved? But they say they can tell the people to

wait - wait until one day when the Federation  of

Malaya  has  a government like theirs, then  there

can be merger. It is still not too late. But under

the  present  circumstances, the Barisan  Sosialis

know,  and the people of Singapore also are aware,

that  the  objectives and wishes  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis   are  something  that  the   people   of

Singapore cannot wait to see materialise. But  why

do  the  Barisan  Sosialis not want  to  tell  the

people?   They   are  waiting  for   a   Communist

government  to appear to help them  carry  on  the

type  of  merger  they want. If so,  how  can  the

people  feel  that  theirs is a  honest  political

Party?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Upper Serangoon

says  that the arrangements by the P.A.P. and  the

Federation  are  as  a  result  of  the   P.A.P.'s

intrigues. He says he and members of his Party are

not  afraid  of the consequences that will  follow

the materialisation of such arrangements, and that

they will struggle against any such consequences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis mouth theories, but when

the  time comes, they may retreat. I remember that

at  the time when Indonesia wanted to recover West

Irian,   the   Member   for  Queenstown   appealed

excitedly  in  this House to the  people  to  help

Indonesia recover West Irian. They encouraged  the

people  to  die but they themselves hid  in  their

shelters. In the same way, when they say that when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>



Malaysia comes and it is not in their interests and  is

detrimental to them, they will struggle against  it  to

the  end. I have been associated with them for quite  a

long  time and I know what they are. In 1957  we  split

with  such  adventurists. The P.A.P. had to split  with

such  adventurists.  At  that time,  when  events  were

taking  place  they were still in the P.A.P.  They  had

sworn  they would see the Party through thick and thin.

But  when  events came to pass, they  were  not  to  be

found. The Member for Upper Serangoon also could not be

found. He knew at that time what the objectives of  the

P.A.P. were. He also said the P.A.P. is a  democratic,

socialist, non-Communist Party. And if he were to hide

in  the Party he would not be in physical danger. So we

can  see what they are. But, however they may smear  to

the  effect  that merger and Malaysia are  a  sell-out,

today   the   facts  show  that  they  will  eventually

materialise and cannot be blocked by any means.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Lady should try and come

back  to  the amendment. I think she has gone a  little

bit  too far away this time. Perhaps she can come  back

to the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Chan Choy Siong (In Mandarin): We believe that

such  events will materialise and when they  come  they

will bring prosperity and a more united nation for  all

the people in the five territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, lastly, I would like to tell the

Barisan  Sosialis  and  their  fellow  travellers  that

however hard they may argue over this amendment, trying

to  point out how good their stand is, they cannot  run

away  from their original stand as indicated  in  their

Declaration  of  Meeting of Convenors  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis. They have agitated many supporters  and  have

even  tried to convene a Joint Action Council to  block

our  merger  plan. Although they have been  criticising

the  P.A.P.'s  merger plan in unison, they  are  having

different dreams though lying on the same bed. When the

time  comes,  they will part company among  themselves.

That  is  why  I  say now and here that  I  oppose  the

amendment by the Member for Thomson.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>10.05 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang) (In Mandarin): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, our colleague, the Member  for  Thomson,

has  moved this amendment which actually has  been  the

Barisan Sosialis stand on merger and a basic contention

of  the Barisan Sosialis on merger as well, that is  to

say,  our  view on the reunification between  Singapore

and  the Federation has all along been the same. If the

Member for Delta wants me to make a reply, I will do so

later  on.  So  we can see this is our basic  stand  on

merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Government Benches were debating the National

Referendum Bill, the Prime Minister said he  would  ask

the  people  of  Singapore what  type  of  merger  they

preferred.  Therefore, we believed that what  had  been

said  by  the  Government all along would be  put  into

practice.  We  are especially of the opinion  that  the

Government  should include the stand of the  Opposition

on  merger  as a question to be put to the  people  for

their  choice.  That  is why the Member  for  Cairnhill

himself  has  brought up his own idea of an alternative

of the mode of merger, that is, whether we can join the

Federation  on terms no less favourable than  those  on

which  the  Borneo territories enter the Federation  of

Malaya. Since the Government can accept the proposal of

the Member for Cairnhill, we believe the Government has

no  reason  whatsoever  to reject  the  motion  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis.  In other words,  by  accepting  our

amendment the Government can carry out its own promise,

that is, to pose several questions for the decision  of

the  people; and among these questions there is one  of

the  mode and manner of the P.A.P. Government,  namely,

the   White   Paper;  there  is  another - the  so-called

unconditional and complete merger, which  is  anti  and

hollow;  the third one is the amendment of  the  Member

for Cairnhill; and the fourth one can well be the stand

of the Barisan Sosialis on merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our connection on merger, which is

to have a true reunification between Singapore and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>



Federation, has been made because of the rights of

the  Singapore  people, that is to  say,  that  on

merger  Singapore  citizens  should  automatically

become  Federal  citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if the Government

want  to  prove  that  they are  democratic,  they

should take heed of the people's opinions. In  the

first place, they should keep their promise,  that

is to say, they must accept our motion so that the

true  stand of the Barisan Sosialis can be put  as

one  of the alternatives in the referendum to  the

people for their consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Members of the P.A.P.

Government  have  said  in  this  House  that  the

Barisan  stand  on  merger is correct  and  is  in

keeping  with  the  interests and  wishes  of  the

people of Singapore. But apart from admitting this

publicly,  they  ask us whether we  agree  to  the

Federation  policies on education and labour  when

Singapore  citizens automatically  become  Federal

citizens on Merger Day. We know that when there is

true  merger between Singapore and the Federation,

it  goes  without saying that labour and education

will  be controlled by the Central Government, it

does   not  mean,  however,  that  if  we   obtain

automatic  citizenship rights, we will accept  the

present  policies of the Federation Government  on

education and labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we feel that the questions they

want to pose are very naive, that is to say, as  a

Federal  citizen, it does not mean  that  he  must

always accept the policies on labour and education

which are unsatisfactory to the people. Let me ask

these  naive people in the Government Party  this.

If  a  Federal  citizen is dissatisfied  with  the

policies  of  the Federal Government, what  action

can  this particular citizen take to make a change

in  those policies? Mr Speaker. Sir, I would  say

that  when  a  citizen  is dissatisfied  with  the

policies  of the Government, the only way  he  can

seek  remedial  action is through  the  democratic

process,  which  is the one man  one  vote  system

under which the term of a government is limited by

time. So if the policy of any government is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>



unsatisfactory to the majority of the people, they

can  organise their own Party, or when they  think

fit  they  can  join those political Parties  with

whose  principles  and policies they  agree.  Then

they  can  pass  a  vote of no confidence  in  the

Government.  If  they succeed in  this,  they  can

elect a new government which has the confidence of

the  people and then this government that has been

newly  elected can make the necessary  changes  in

the  policies  which  are  unsatisfactory  to  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we of the Barisan Sosialis

feel  that  if  there is to be any genuine  merger

between  Singapore  and the  Federation,  all  the

progressive  and socialist Parties  in  these  two

territories must first be united, and according to

the  principles of the Barisan Sosialis,  we  must

carry  out social reforms in our country  so  that

every member of our society will get a fair deal.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member has made his

point.  We do not want a debate on that aspect  of

it. Let us come back to the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tee Kim Leng (In Mandarin): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  was just trying to reply to the  question

raised  by  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the

Minister  for  Education  as  to  whether  we  are

prepared  to  accept  the Federation  Government's

policies on labour and education. I will say  here

that  we are unhappy with the present policies  of

the Federation Government on labour and education.

We  are also unhappy with the present Government's

policy on external affairs. So when the day  comes

when  there  is true merger between Singapore  and

the  Federation,  the socialist Parties  must  get

together  to  make the necessary  changes  to  the

unsatisfactory policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the P.A.P. Government

touch  on the question of automatic conversion  of

citizenship,  they always say that the  Federation

Government  will not allow Singapore  citizens  to

become Federal citizens automatically, because the

citizenship  laws  in  the  Federation  are   more

stringent  than  those  in  Singapore.  The  Prime

Minister  at  a  forum held in the  University  of

Singapore also said that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>



more  than  300,000  non-local  born  citizens  of

Singapore  easily obtained citizenship  rights  in

1957 by reason of the length of their residence in

Singapore.  That was why the Federation Government

said  that the 300,000-odd non-local born citizens

were not worthy enough to become Federal citizens.

Our  Prime  Minister says that if the  600,000-odd

citizens  of  Singapore  want  to  become  Federal

citizens automatically on merger day, then he says

the  Barisan Sosialis can get their friends in the

Federation, namely, the Socialist Front, to move a

motion  in  the  Central  Parliament  asking   the

Federation  Government to give citizenship  rights

to   the   600,000-odd  Singapore  citizens.   Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the P.A.P. leaders have  said  all

this,  which makes me very doubtful. It  looks  as

though their argument boils down to this; that  in

1959 they were elected by the Federal citizens  in

the  Federation. But these are not the facts.  The

present  Government of the P.A.P. was  elected  by

the  citizens of Singapore. How strange it is that

on  the  side of the P.A.P. they should speak  for

the  Federation Government! How strange it is that

they  have  forgotten entirely about the interests

of  the  citizens of Singapore! And they have  the

audacity to say that the citizens of Singapore are

not  qualified  to  become Federal  citizens!  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I believe that when the time  comes

the  people  over  there will be thrown  into  the

dustbin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another thing which is very strange.

They  say  they  are  making  sacrifices  in   the

interests of the people of Singapore. They try  to

make  their  positions safe  by  saying  they  are

working   in  the  interests  of  the  people   of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a few moments ago the Member for Farrer

Park  made a speech about automatic conversion  of

citizenship.   He   made   quotations   from   the

Constitution  of the Federation and  he  mentioned

section 14.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member must modulate his

voice. It is coming through very loudly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tee Kim Leng (In Mandarin): He quoted

sections  14  and  22. He said that  according  to

section   22,   the  citizens  of  Singapore   are

qualified  to  become  Federal  citizens  provided

there  have been political negotiations. It  is  a

fact; it is true; we know that Singapore has  been

separated  from Malaya for many years.  When  each

has  been  carrying  on its  own,  there  will  be

different sets of laws, and the only way  to  make

Singapore citizens Federation citizens is to  have

mutual negotiations between the Governments of the

two  territories concerned. So we can see from his

argument that our amendment is very reasonable and

correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, he also said that the question

of  true  and genuine merger was entirely  in  the

hands  of  the Federation Government. It  was,  he

said,  because the Federation Government  did  not

want us to have a true and genuine merger with the

Federation.  Well,  does it  mean  that  when  the

Federation  Government does not want  to  give  us

genuine merger, we must accept any type of  merger

other  than  the  genuine type of  merger?  In  my

opinion, I will say that in the interests  of  the

people  of  Singapore, we must  try  our  best  to

safeguard such interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Delta also said that on the 15th of September, 1961, we at our

inaugural  meeting  made  a  declaration  that  we

wanted the Penang and Malacca type of merger. That

was  what  she  said. I believe she has  not  paid

sufficient  attention to the  declaration  of  the

Barisan Sosialis. On the 28th of August, 1961,  we

in  the  Barisan  Sosialis made  public  a  policy

statement entitled "Our stand on merger".  I  have

made   some   quotations  from   this   particular

statement, but I do not wish to repeat them. So  I

will  say  that  if  the  Government  Benches  are

sincere, they should not distort the contention of

the Barisan Sosialis. Instead they must pay closer

attention  to  statements  made  by  the   Barisan

Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Delta also said

that  we  are  trying to promise people  something

better  than the moon, but I will say she  is  not

talking from facts. Here even the S.P.A.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>



also agrees that the White Paper is not actually a

true  form of merger. Here we make our stand  that

we  must have automatic conversion of citizenship.

So  I  hope  and believe that the Government  will

carry  out its promises by accepting our stand  on

merger  and  posing it in the national  referendum

for the selection of the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, originally I do not want  to  waste

the  time  of  the  House, but under  the  present

circumstances, when the P.A.P. is trying  to  sell

out  the people of Singapore, my conscience pricks

me and I feel that I have to stand up and speak  a

few words.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the past few months if you had gone to

coffee shops or street corners and not remained in

your  house you would have been able to  hear  the

grievances   of  the  people.  They   would   have

complained to you that when they elected  the  Lim

Yew Hock Government, it sold Christmas Island. And

now that they have elected the P.A.P. Government, it

is trying to sell the people.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I might remind the hon.

Member that we are debating an amendment moved  by

the  Member  for Thomson, in which  I  cannot  see

anything about Christmas Island.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Since I have

heard all the grievances of the people, I will try

to convey their views here and put them across the

Floor  to Members on the Government side.  Let  me

quote  a  speech made by the Minister for  Finance

which appeared in page 5 of the Nanyang Siang Pau.

He  remarked, "After merger under the White Paper,

the   citizens  of  Singapore,  however,  did  not

produce  facts  to substantiate the  benefits  and

advantages  of  the citizens of Singapore.  It  is

hoped  that in this debate Members of the  Barisan

Sosialis will make a study of the speech and  make

a  proper  reply." The Minister for  Finance  said

that  according to the White Paper on merger,  the

citizens  of  Singapore will never become  second-class  citizens. But we feel that since  he  is  a

Doctor of Economics



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>



he  should be able to grasp the theory of one plus

one  equals  two. He said that Singapore  citizens

will  never become second-class citizens. You will

see  that  out of over 600,000 citizens there  can

only   be   15  representatives  in  the   Central

Parliament. On the other hand, there are only over

200,000 electors in Malaya, yet they can have  104

representatives in Parliament. That is to say,  in

Malaya   every  22,000  electors  can  elect   one

representative, whereas in Singapore every  41,000

electors  can  elect  only one  representative  in

Parliament.

<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I have already indicated that

although   the  Member  for  Moulmein   has   been

speaking,  the Chair has not heard any translation

at   all.  And  as  the  Chair  cannot  understand

Mandarin,  he is not in a position to say  whether

the  Member did use those words or not. I have not

heard  a  single word translated from his  speech,

but I hope he has not used those words.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  I was comparing citizenship to a  truck.

If you want to level a mountain, you must make use

of  a  truck. That is to say, that citizenship  is

like the P.A.P., a lousy government. When the time

for the next general elections comes ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng) rose ---</b>

<b><br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b></b> Order. I have already

indicated  that  other  Members  should  not  take

advantage of the Member for Moulmein when  he  is

speaking.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>



Too many points of order are completely

irrelevant  and  out of order. Members  must  give

some  time  to the Member for Moulmein to  express

his point on the amendment. Mr Lin You Eng.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> This is a point of order,

Sir, I heard the Member say "huai tan", and I  do

not know whether it is in order for the Member  to

use that term.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I have already indicated

that some words of the Member for Moulmein may not

be   heard  by  the  Interpreters.  But   if   the

Parliamentary  Secretary thinks  that  the  Member

used  an offensive term, he can rise and say  that

the Member did use some offensive words and I will

ask the Member to withdraw those words.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If the people

have  equal citizenship rights, then if  they  are

not satisfied with a government, they can exercise

their   citizenship  right  and  wipe   out   that

government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the Minister for Finance said just now that there is no such thing as second-class citizenship. But let me say this; although I

do  not wish to waste the time of the House -  that

in  Singapore  every 40,000 of the electorate  can

only  elect  one  representative  to  the  Central

Parliament,  whereas in Malaya  every  20,000  can

elect one representative. So if there is no second-class citizenship, then how can there be ---



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. May I remind the hon.

Member that all these arguments have already  been

put forward by the Member for Queenstown, and that

he  is  merely  repeating what his own  colleagues

have  said  in this House? Perhaps the Member  for

Moulmein  could bring out some new  arguments  and

not repeat what his own Chairman has said here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, day

in  and  day out the P.A.P. radio have boasted  in

their  broadcasts that according  to  their  White

Paper  merger proposals they would retain autonomy

in the field of education



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>



and labour. They claim that this type of merger is the

best  we  can get. But will the autonomy in  education

and labour exist forever ---



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. We are debating the

amendment moved by the Member for Thomson. We are  not

debating  the  White Paper or complete merger  or  the

third  alternative  which are outlined  in  the  Order

Paper. Now our debate is on the amendment moved by the

Member for Thomson.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now the Member

for  Delta has mentioned the fact that Members in  the

Barisan  Sosialis  have  said  that  if  a  merger  is

impossible,  then they are willing to  wait.  She  has

asked,  how  long should we wait? Mr Deputy  Speaker,

since  the  two territories have been divided  for  so

many  years and if we can wait patiently for  so  many

years,  there  is no reason why we cannot  wait  until

such time when we can get more favourable terms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Mountbatten brought out an

analogy  of  a man seeking a post as general  manager.

She  said  that  if you are applying  for  a  post  of

general  manager and if you are not selected  for  it,

and  the  boss  asks  you if you would  condescend  to

become  the  assistant manager, you  cannot  say  that

since  you cannot get the post of general manager  you

will  refuse  or reject the offer. But  the  issue  of

merger  of Singapore with Malaya has a lot to do  with

the  generations to come of Singapore. Merger is  just

like  a  marriage. It can be said in this way. We  can

give  an  example. For instance, if a person  is  old,

thin and tall, you have the option to choose. You  can

say  that since he is old, thin and tall, I refuse  to

marry  him. You can say you are willing to wait  until

you  find a suitable partner and then you both can get

married.  When you get a more suitable  one,  you  can

reject the old skinny one. In the same way, we can say

that  we can choose when the right time comes for  the

merger.  That is why I support the amendment moved  by

the Member for Thomson.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to

speak against the amendment proposed by the Member for

Thomson to put question (d) for the referendum.  About

this  time last night, the amendment proposed  by  the

Member for Queenstown was negatived, and we have spent

the whole of today to discuss the second amendment put

forward   by  the  Barisan  Sosialis.  The   amendment

proposed by the Member for Queenstown would amount, if

accepted,  to  the  posing of  one  question  for  the

referendum with a "yes" and "no" answer. It is typical

that  during this debate on the question or  questions

for  the  referendum, the Barisan Sosialis exhibit  in

true  style their switch of stand from one extreme  to

the  other. From a one-question referendum,  they  are

now   putting  forward  the  suggestion  of  a  fourth

question to be put in the referendum.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If you insist on the mode and

manner.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Their idea is simply no merger at

any cost.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> No sell-out at any cost.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, this amendment of the Member

for   Thomson  seeks  to  propose  that   the   fourth

proposition to be put on the referendum paper would be

their  so-called genuine merger of Singapore with  the

Federation  with Singapore entering the Federation  as

the   twelfth   state  and  with  all   its   citizens

automatically becoming Federal citizens on merger day.

May  I  recount  this question of the  suggestion  put

forward  by  what the Member for Anson stated  earlier

on,  that this amendment had the support of 17 Members

of this Assembly since November of last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what has actually taken place during the last

six  to  seven  months  is  this.  This  question   of

automatic citizenship for Singapore citizens to become

Federal citizens was revealed during the debate on the

White Paper on merger last year in November. The Prime

Minister  was able to table in this Assembly a  letter

written by the Federation Prime Minister dated 13th



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>



of  November, 1961, on this particular matter. May

I,  Sir, for purposes of record, just read out the

two  relevant paragraphs at least to  refresh  the

memory of Members in this House? I quote, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...after our frank and thorough discussions of all

the implications involving Singapore citizenship and  merger,  I  have  agreed that  all  Singapore

citizens  should  keep their  present  rights  and

automatically   become  nationals   of   the   new

Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently it is felt that representation in

the  new Federation Parliament should not be based

on  the  total  number  of  such  citizens,  large

numbers  of whom would be dis-enfranchised  if  the

Federation  citizenship  and  representation  laws

were  applied.  In this Context, may  I  reiterate

that  the argument that all Singapore citizens  at

the  time  of  merger should automatically  become

Federation  citizens cannot find acceptance  under

our Constitution.'



<br><br>Those  were the words of Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra,

Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya, in his

letter  to our Prime Minister dated 13th November,

1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today the Member for Queenstown disclosed

to  this House the exchange of letters between the

Secretary-General of the Barisan Sosialis, Mr Lim

Ching Siong, his letter dated 27th March. 1962.  I

quote  the  relevant paragraph of  Mr  Lim  Ching

Siong's letter:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...we feel that a free and frank exchange of

views  and discussion between us can contribute  a

great deal towards national unity.'



<br><br>And  Tunku  Abdul Rahman replied to Mr Lim  Ching

Siong,  noting  the request for an opportunity  to

have  a  free  and frank exchange  of  views,  and

hoping to be able to meet at some future date  for

such discussion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we hope that the Barisan Sosialis will

follow  up  on this letter, now revealed  to  this

House stating their stand in black and white, what

the Barisan Sosialis stand for on the question  of

merger ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We debated it last year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> We hope, Sir, we shall be

able, at some future date, at the proper time  and

place, for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>



revelation to be made and the Tunku's reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come next to the Workers' Party on this

subject. My colleague, the Minister for Health and

Law,  at  the sitting of 29th of June,  1962 - I  am

referring  to the transcript at page  22  [Hansard

Vol. 18, No. 3, col. 3l5] - I quote the Minister for

Health and Law:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Recently he [he, meaning the Member for Anson]

wrote  a letter to the Tunku telling him that  the

Workers'  Party was quite prepared to accept  that

citizens  domiciled in Singapore should vote  only

in  Singapore  and that candidates from  Singapore

for  the  Central Legislature should  be  citizens

domiciled  in Singapore. He also asked  the  Tunku

if,  in  view  of these acceptances, he  would  be

prepared to consider a common citizenship for both

territories.  If he wishes it to be believed  that

it  will  be possible for him to get better  terms

from  the Tunku than we have been able to get  for

the   people  of  Singapore  in  the  White  Paper

proposals, I challenge him to publish the  Tunku's

reply,  I have seen the Tunku's reply and so  have

all  my  colleagues. The fact that the  Tunku  has

given the Prime Minister a copy of his reply shows

that  he  would  not  consider  it  a  breach   of

confidence if the Member for Anson were to publish

his reply.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When further challenged by my colleague, the

Minister  for  Health  and  Law,  to  publish  the

Tunku's reply to the letter sent by the Member for

Anson,  the  reply  as shown in  page  26  of  the

transcript [col. 322] was:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, the reply to the Tunku's letter was

considered by the Executive Council of  my  Party,

and it was unanimously decided not to publish it.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I will go further about the

kissing incident that he was about to perform.  We

hope that at some time, some place, the Member for

Anson will publish that reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give

way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, if the

Minister  has read that letter, he must  know,  as

every decent person



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>



knows,  that  for the welfare of this country  and

the  harmony of its major races, it is inadvisable

to  publish  it,  and this constant  egging  is  a

shameful  comment upon these people who  say  they

seek communal harmony.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

everyone in Malaya, Singapore and the world  knows

that  the Tunku stands for racial harmony and  not

those  who  pretend  to pay lip  service  and  are

dishonest in their stand.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> So, we shall wait for the

publication if you have the courage to do so.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I have more loyalty than you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, that has to be shown and

revealed - your loyalty ---



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Not to you, I do not need to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, therefore this question

of  automatic  citizenship, as I have  shown,  the

Government has published the White Paper and  also

the  exchange  of letters between  the  two  Prime

Ministers  which clearly show the  position  about

automatic  citizenship for Singapore  citizens  to

enter the Federation. I have already indicated the

part  played by the Barisan Sosialis in attempting

to  seek  clarification from  the  Tunku,  and  we

suggest  now  that  the  Barisan  Sosialis  should

follow  up  by writing to the Tunku stating  their

exact stand. The Workers' Party is not prepared to

reveal  the  reply  from the  Tunku.  Perhaps,  to

complete  the whole picture, we will look  forward

to the U.P.P. writing a letter to the Tunku to say

how well they can do in this respect.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> They have already exposed you

with all that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, this amendment by the

Member  for  Thomson,  on behalf  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis, is a mischievous amendment which cannot



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>



be  accepted. In fact, it was rejected during  the

debate  on merger last year. The function  of  the

Opposition    in    a   parliamentary    democracy

[Interruption]  is  not to oppose  for  opposition

sake ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> For the sake of the

Government?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> --- but to be a constructive

Opposition, to criticise and offer constructive

criticism ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> And chuck out the minority

Government now.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. May I remind the hon.

Member  for  Nee Soon that if he wants to  clarify

any  point, surely he can stand  on  a  point  of

information  or elucidation, and the Minister  for

Education will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Therefore, this amendment

suggesting a fourth question is irresponsible  and

mischievous and has to be rejected.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> For a dishonest referendum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The referendum that is to be

placed to the people ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Dishonest.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I have already made

this   clear   to   Members  in  the   Opposition,

particularly those in the Barisan Sosialis. If the

Member  for Queenstown has any point to  make,  he

can  stand  up,  and  I  think  the  Minister  for

Education will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The White Paper merger will be

question  one, and those who think that  they  are

unhappy  about the White Paper merger are entitled

to   show  their  preference  for  question   two,

complete and unconditional merger as a state on an

equal basis with the other 11 states in accordance

with   the   constitutional   documents   of   the

Federation  of  Malaya. If  there  are  people  in

Singapore  who believe that the Borneo territories

are  going to get a better deal, this is where the

Member  for Cairnhill has put forward a suggestion

which  we  think is a fair question  to  put.  The

Government accordingly accepts it and puts it down

as question



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>



three. But if the Barisan Sosialis, the

Workers' Party and the U.P.P. have an honest  and

constructive suggestion to make, it  will  be  the

duty of this Government to take it up. But if  it

is  mischievous, no. The task of  a  responsible

government   is  to  accept  good  criticism   and

incorporate  it and to reject any when  we  know

that  there  is an ulterior motive  behind  it  to

frustrate   merger.   I  therefore   reject   the

amendment proposed by the Member for Thomson.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> In order to have a

dishonest referendum.



<br><br>11.07 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

the  hour  is drawing near and the Front Bench  on

the  Opposition  side is feeling  relieved  that

soon  a decision will be taken which will put  an

end to all the unnecessary lengthy debate that

has  taken  place  as a result  of  the  political

warfare between the P.A.P. and the ex-P.A.P.,  the

Barisan  Sosialis.  As  an  Opposition  that  is

sandwiched  in  between, we have  been  forced  to

listen to words of wisdom from the Government  side  and from the  Members  who  sit

behind us and we have come to the conclusion  that

both   are   dishonest.  They  are  indulging   in

dishonest  manoeuvres, and I pass  this  judgment.

Both  have  graduated from the  same  school  of

distortion  and  both are practising  it  to  the

full. If one side had just been a little bit  more

honest, a little bit more guide by the principle

of  wanting to serve the country first, instead of

wanting to kill the ex-comrades first ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> That is why you have to support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Another hon. Member:</b> He denied it.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> --- there would have been a

healthier  debate  and there  would  have  been  a

cleaner,   a   healthier  and  a   less   confused

atmosphere.  Sir, the Government side  obviously

is  first  by my judgment, but they remain  silent

because  they  feel that there is  at  least  some

justification. But the Members who sit behind  me,

who  were  not very long ago sitting on the  other

side forming the Government, feel hurt because ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> We do not need your support.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> --- because the truth always

hurts. Sir, let us now come to the various attacks

that  nave  been  levelled at the S.P.A./Alliance.

the  Party in this Assembly that reserve the right

to declare the funeral day for the P.A.P., not the

Barisan, not the Workers' Party, not even the U.P.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my colleague, ithe Member for Tanglin, in a

very  honest  presentation,  tried  his  best   to

explain  to  the Barisan Sosialis  who,  by  their

words and by their actions in this Assembly,  have

lowered themselves to the position of school boys.

So   the   Member  for  Tanglin,  having  been   a

schoolmaster  for  many,  many  years,  tried   to

explain  to  them  and  used simple  illustrations

about  doors  that are closed and doors  that  are

open.  First  and  foremost,  he  was  immediately

attacked by the Member for Anson. What is all this

talk  about?  Of course, he openly says  that  the

Member  for Tanglin is an honest man, and I openly

say  that  the Member for Anson is an  honest  man

too. He says, "How can he say that the door to the

amendment is closed? How can he know that the door

to   proposition  B  is  open,  and  the  door  to

proposition C is open?"



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Because he somersaulted.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Member for Tanglin

is using a simple illustration to school children

who do not understand the elements of politics and

the elements of parliamentary debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what he means by doors open are that these

are the possible avenues where the electorate  of

Singapore  can make a decision. He does  not  say

that  the  Tunku would accept B or C. As  I  have

said,  in posing questions in a referendum, on

merger  one  must  pose all  possible  questions ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And be honest.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b>--- as well as practicable questions, so

that  the  choice of the electorate can  be  made

known not only to the Government of Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>



but also to the Government and the peoples of the

Federation of Malaya and to the world. If in their

wisdom,  the  voters  choose  proposition   B   or

proposition C and reject Crnd. Paper 33, they  are

free  to  do so. Then the Government of Singapore

will   have  to  take  note  of  that  and  resume

negotiations   with   the   Government   of   the

Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Upper Serangoon says the door to

C - that is to say, enter Malaysia on terms no less

favourable than those for the Borneo territories - is very dark. Sir, how does he know it is dark?

I put in that proposition because some Members of

the Barisan Sosialis tried to ridicule Cmd. Paper 33  and  said,  why should Singapore  be  offered

something less than the Bornean territories?  So

here is an opportunity for the Barisan to go  and

preach  that line - why should Singapore be offered

less  than  the Bornean territories - and  persuade

the electorate to accept terms no less favourable

than those offered to the Borneo territories.  Of

course, in order to know what the terms are, they

will have to await the publication of the Cobbold

Report.  I  will  resist  any  attempt  by   the

Government  to  pose  question  C  if  the  terms

offered to the Borneo territories are not  known.

It  would  be  an unfair question ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But it is known

to you.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> --- but if the terms are

published,  whether it is known to me  or  anybody

else, it should be known to the electorate so that

they can be guided in their choice ---



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I am not suggesting in

proposing proposition (c), and I have said  so  in

this Assembly, that the

S.P.A. is supporting it. The S.P.A. puts

in  that proposition as a contribution to see that

the   questions  posed  in  the  referendum   are

questions that will cover all possible avenues  of

closer association.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yet you support the White Paper.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I have

already  indicated  to the Member  for  Oueenstown

that   too   many  interjections  are   completely

disorderly. And if there is such behaviour,  there

is a Standing Order to deal with it, i.e. Standing

Order No. 55.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock :</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, like a

schoolboy  the   Member   for Queenstown  finds it

difficult to  understand  why one  can  believe  in

one thing  and  yet  suggest another thing to be put

to the electorate.  It  is for the electorate to pass

judgment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It is beyond him.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> It really shows that the S.P.A.

does  not  want to force the electorate to  accept

Paper  Cmd.  33.  If they like it, go  ahead - enter

Malaysia  on  the  terms  of  any  of  the  Borneo

territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in fact, the Barisan Sosialis has another 43

minutes  to  try to get their voice  heard  before

Doomsday. That is why they have to keep on  making

the   best  use  of  the  last  minutes  of  their

political attempt to disrupt merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson has said a few things.

He  asks the Member for Tanglin - and, of course,

he  cannot  stand  up  and  speak  under  Standing

Orders -  how  he can square the suggestion  that

(b)  is  open  but  (d) is not. (b)  is  open  not

because  the Tunku has been heard to say  that  he

would accept (b).

(b) is open because it is a form of merger that is

known  and  can  be understood by everyone - by  the

electorate,  by the Singapore Government,  by  the

Legislative Assembly, the Federation people,  the

Federation Government, and the Federal Parliament.

It is known.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> That is what it means.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Constitution of the Federation of

Malaya is ---



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. May I remind the Member

for  Cairnhil  that  we   are debating  an  amendment

moved by  the  Member  for Queenstown?  So  if  he

goes  too  much  into  the details of propositions (a),

(b), (c), and (d), he is completely out of order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will

be so guided. But  I  am trying to explain the

digs of the Member for Anson. But I will leave it

at that. All  that I  would like to say is this:

the Member  for Anson  is  at least honest in his  desire  to

want   this  question  posed.  But  in   this Assembly, not only

just  now but on previous occasions,  he  has

said   that  what  he  wants  are  automatic

citizenship  rights. But he is  prepared  to

tell the people, "Not only will you have  the

rights  but  you, the people,  will  have  to

accept  the  limitations imposed  under  the

Constitution."    That    is    an     honest

presentation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But look at the Barisan Sosialis. They keep

on  talking about citizenship rights and  not

wanting  to  say anything else.  The  Barisan

Sosialis are just playing on the emotions  of

the masses. It is easy to tell them, "second-class  citizens" and get them  so  roused  up

that  they will vote against Paper  Cmd.  33.

Is   there   such  a  thing  as  second-class

citizenship  in Paper Cmd. 33?  I  am  afraid

there   is   no   clarity  because   of   the

distortions  practised by the Government  and

by the Barisan  Sosialis. If there had been an  honest

presentation,  there  would  have   been   no

confusion  in  the minds of the people.  What

has   been  agreed  upon  is  that  Singapore

citizens   cannot  participate  in   Federal

elections   and   Federal   citizens   cannot

participate in Singapore elections.  That  is

all.  Federal  nationality is brought  in  to

give  us  all  equal status. And  as  Federal

nationals  we  can  go to the  Federation  of

Malaya  at any time and do anything we  want,

other  than stand as candidates for  election

or vote in the Federation of Malaya. The Barisan  Sosialis seem to be very keen on wanting

to   stand  as  candidates  in  the   Federal

Parliament  and  to vote in  the  Federation.

They  overlook the fact that what  is  denied

to  us  is  also  denied  to  the  Federation

citizens. Let us get it straight. Forget  all

distortions; forget all attempts to run  down

the  other Party. Singapore citizens can only

participate   in  elections  in   Singapore;

Federation citizens can only participate  in

elections in the Federation. Apart from  that

we     are     all    known    as     Federal

nationals - wherever we go, whatever we do,  we

are equal. Do not start talking of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>



second-class citizenship and play on the  emotions

of the people. Because they have been playing that

line  and  because the P.A.P. has been  trying  to

play that line - oh, the Penang and Malacca type  of

merger  means  non-local born citizens  will  lose

their  citizenship  rights - therefore,  this  line

about    citizenship   has    been    played    up

unnecessarily,  so  much  so  that   the   Barisan

Sosialis, by their amendment, are trying  to  play

on  this line of automatic citizenship rights  for

Singapore citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the difference? The difference, in what

they  want,  is that Barisan Sosialis members  can

stand  for Federal elections and they can go there

and  vote in the Federal elections. That  is  all.

But  in  exchange for that, what have we to  gain?

Complete control over Singapore affairs. Singapore

will  become  just a State like any State  in  the

Federation of Malaya. And what do we get? Nothing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, Sir, we all know that in the present

situation  and the political temper of the  people

of  Singapore, they cannot, even if they want  to,

accept  with  a  happy  countenance  some  of  the

policies  of  the  Federation Government.  And  so

because   Singapore   comes   into   this   closer

association  and has certain powers  reserved  to

the  Singapore Government for the benefit  of  the

people  of Singapore, that is why there cannot  be

complete and unconditional merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said last night that we were prepared to

listen to the proposition of the Barisan. This  is

what  I said - at page 74 of the transcript, at  the

bottom of that page [Vol. 19, No. 2, col. 250]:





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...that the questions to be posed should be

questions  that  are  easily  understood  by   the

electorate  and that the proposal  should  be  one

that has some known form. It would be wrong if the

Barisan  Sosialis were to put up a  proposal  that

bears  no relation to facts. It would be wrong  if

the  Barisan  Sosialis want to put  a  proposal  in

order  to  appeal to the emotions  of  the  public

instead  of putting up a proposal that would  best

serve  the  interests of the public. And  what  is

more  important is that whatever proposal  we  put

forward  to the electorate for their decision,  it

must  be  one  that  can  be  acceptable  to  the

Federation of Malaya.'



<br><br>Because of the exchange of correspondence between

the  two  Prime Ministers, they know that at  this

present  juncture  automatic  citizenship  is  not

acceptable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>





to  the  Federation. But they want to  demand  it.

What  is the motive behind this demand. It is  not

to  show that they are brave men, not to show that

they   have   the  interests  of  the  people   of

Singapore at heart. But it is to do their best to

damage  merger. Then they say, surely if we cannot

get what we want, we can wait. But, Sir, the trend

of   political   events  is  that  countries   are

swallowed into it, and much as we want to wait, we

cannot wait. Three years ago when the PAP, came to

power,   everytime  they  talked  of  merger   the

Federation said, "No"; - because in the midst of

the  P.A.P., in the Government, in the Party,  and

in  the - political machinery of the P,A.P.,  there

were  Communists and Communist front  people.  Now

they  have  purged themselves and, therefore,  the

Federation Government thought it would be  a  good

thing  that  instead of a complete merger  perhaps

they  could  try with a sort of closer association

where  both  sides  have  to  be  on  their   best

behaviour - Singapore  has  to  be  on   its   best

behaviour   in  order  to  qualify  for  conplete

merger,  and the Federation has to be on its  best

behaviour in order to make Singapore feel that  it

is beneficial to go in for complete merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in this form of closer association that has

been offered to us by the Federation  of  Malaya,

by Tunku Abdul  Rahman,  in spite  of  his  previous

animosity  and  fear  of having  anything  to  do

with Singapore - must  that offer of friendship - be

rejected, just cast aside, and we say, "No, we want

the whole lot or none  at all."? Of course, Sir, my

colleague the Member for Tanglin  has said that we

might want to  buy, but the seller might not want

to sell. So it has been suggested by the Member for

Anson  and by Barisan Sosialis Members, who  always

echo the views of the Member for Anson ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Their leader.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Never!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> --- if we cannot have it, let

us  wait. Wait? How can! If we cannot buy the whole

thing,  the  wisest thing is, if we are hungry,  to

buy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>



half  of  it.  To  eat half a loaf  is  better  than

nothing.  But they want to wait. They prefer  to  go

hungry.  But  they  will not go hungry.  It  is  the

people  of Singapore who will go hungry. Not  they,

the  Barisan Sosialis, and therefore they  say,  "We

can wait." Wait for what? Wait for the Barisan to do

more  damage  to  the interests  of  the  people  of

Singapore? That we will never agree.



<br><br>11.25 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at least there are some words of wisdom from

the  mouths  of  infants. The Member for  Queenstown

said - yes,  he  did say, Sir - that we  must  have  the

mutual   consent  of  the  peoples   of   the   two

territories.  And he knows that the people  of  the

Federation  of  Malaya cannot at the  present  stage

accept  automatic  citizenship.  Then  why  is   he

pushing it? Why are the Banisan pushing a case  that

they  know  is  not acceptable? It is  leading  the

people  more and more to the conclusion, as  it  has

led  us, that they are out to damage merger and  not

to have merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say that the people should not be

compelled - the Member for Thomson has said that  his

amendment is the stand of the Barisan Sosialis. Sir,

ever  since the Barisan Sosialis came into being,  I

have  read  and  I have heard in this Assembly  that

there  seem  to be three stands. One is merger  like

Penang and Malacca, another is that Indonesia is the

heartland  of  Malaysia, and still another  is,  why

should  Singapore get less than what is offered  to

the  Borneo territories? And now they come out with:

This is our stand. Well, if that is their stand, let

those who love the country, those who will fight and

die  for  the interests of the country,  resist  any

attempt  by  the Barisan Sosialis to  damage

the interests of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Upper Serangoon, because

of the illustration given by my colleague, the

Member  for Tanglin, about doors,  tried  to

read  into his speech that he did not deny that  the

door to amendment (d) is a door.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> It is a wall.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> If the Member for Upper

Serangoon is fond of talking of doors, may  I

say,  Sir,  that there is one door  that  has

been  kept  locked  by the  Government?  That

door is the P.P.S.O. The sooner that door  is

opened,  the  better  it  will  be   to   rid

Singapore  of  this threat  from  Commumists

and  Communist front leaders. Open that door.

The Member for Upper Serangoon can call it  a

dark door or any door. But I say it is

a   door  for  the  security  of  the  people   of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Moulmein said that he did

not  intend  to speak, he did not  intend  to

waste  the  time of the House,  and  then  he

went  on  wasting 20 minutes of the  time  of

this  House!  I  find it  very  difficult  to

understand what he was trying to say. He  was

talking  about citizenship. He was trying  to

talk  about citizenship again. How  can  they

keep     playing    that    line - second-class

citizenship?  There  is  no  such  thing  as

second-class  citizenship. I am  sorry,  Sir,

to  have  taken too much time.  But  I  would

urge  upon  this  House - we  have  another  27

minutes   of   important  time   before   the

guillotine   is  exercised,  and   when   the

guillotine  is exercised, may it cut  through

the  necks  of  the Communists and  Communist

front leaders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Blood-thirsty!



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, in the amendment moved  by

the  Member  for  Thomson,  there  are  three

questions    involved.   There   are    three

alternatives  before us.  One  is  merger  as

contained  in  the White Paper under  Command

Paper  33.  The  second  alternative   is   a

complete and unconditional merger. The  third

alternative is (c), that is, on  terms  like

those  of  the  Borneo territories.  After  a

long  debate on the Government's White  Paper

on  merger, the Government has never  changed

its  stand. It is clear that the stand of the

Government  is firm. On the issue of  merger,

they  have recognised the objective fact  of

circumstances.   They   have   ignored   the

objective ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang): On a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Chang Sam (In Mandarin):

Just now the Parliamentary Secretary said that the

third  alternative is a Barisan Sosialis type  of

merger.  As a matter of fact, we never put forward

such a type of merger.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is not a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Just   now  I  said  that  the  so-called  Barisan

Sosialis merger is, in fact, very shallow.  I  can

quote  a number of expressions to show what  their

merger  means.  Their merger is  complete  merger

plus  the  moon,  the sun, the  stars.  They  want

automatic  conversion  of citizenship.  They  want

immediate general elections in the Federation,  so

that they can topple the Federation Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members of the Barisan Sosialis have failed

to  recognise the practical circumstances  of  the

two  territories. They hope that if they make more

promises,  they  can get more  support  from  the

people.  They  have  undergone  many  changes.   I

understand  this morning that our  Party  Chairman

has  clearly pointed out that the Barisan Sosialis

stand changes occasionally. They maintain that  if

they  change  their objective from time  to  time,

they  will  be  able to get more and more  support

from the people. Let us ask the people of the two

territories  what they are short  of.  The  P.A.P.

merger can fulfil the wishes of the people of  the

two  territories.  The people of  Malaya  and  the

people  of  Singapore consist or  many  races.  In

Singapore the Chinese are in the majority,  while

in Malaya the Malays are in the majority. After  a

separation  of  so  many  years,  there  is   some

difference between the mode of life of the  people

of  the two territories. But, on the whole, it  is

quite the same. Let us speak of the differences in

the   field  of  education  and  labour.  If   any

political  Party  can  put forward  some  plan  to

incorporate the differences in the two territories

in the field of education and labour, then



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>



more  or  less they can eliminate the  differences

and work out a more satisfactory merger plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember this phrase: Sink differenes and

find  out  some common points. Then and only  then

will  merger  be  easier. I  am  sure,  under  the

circumstances,  their type of  merger  cannot  be

implemented. Everybody is aware that their type of

merger  is  not practical. Their actions  are  not

objective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we know the Barisan Sosialis and the stooges of the Communists are bound to use

all  forms of intimidation to change the stand  of

other  people. However, they cannot easily  change

the stand of the P.A.P. Since the introduction  of

the  White  Paper on merger up till now,  we  have

never  changed our stand. Why? This is  a  strange

question, Mr Speaker. I feel this is a matter  of

principle. The P.A.P. principle is quite different

from the principle of the Barisan Sosialis. One is

based  on the Malayan context, while the other  is

to  suit the united front policy to achieve  their

own ends. That is what I said. The two fundamental

stands are quite different.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the Member come back

to  the  amendment? Time is getting short. I  must

remind the Parliamentary Secretary that there is a

guillotine against the Opposition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

I do not intend to lengthen my speech.

I just want to bring up some analogy

to illustrate the principles of the Barisan

Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the amendment. You will

remember that  at the inauguration of the Barisan

Sosialis, they  had  no platform. They copied the

political platform  of  the  P.A.P. word  for  word.

They adopted our political platform and said that  that

was their own political platform.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think

that has anything to do with the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker.  I  cannot finish my speech  because

there are some points which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>



are connected with the amendment. The stand of the

Barisan  Sosialis  is quite different  from  ours.

That  is  why I have to point it out particularly.

In  our  platform  there is stated non-Communist.

But  in the platform of the Barisan Sosialis there

is  no such word as "non-Communist'. That exposes

their ugly side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of merger, just because we are non-Communists, that makes the difference

between us ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Member come

back to the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

During  the debate today, the Opposition  Parties

have been saying that they are serving the people.

That  is  why they are making a noise  here in

the  interest of the people. How can they  serve

the interest  of  the people?  In  my  opinion.

their  type  of merger is to create more  conflict

between the various races.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the one man representative of the

Workers' Party has sought to make himself out  to

be  a  very  extraordinary  lawyer,  a  wonderful

lawyer.  The  Parliamentary  Secretary   to   the

Minister for Culture has said that he has a very

bad temper. That spils everything. His policy  is

a  policy  of  "tailism".  They  are  toeing  the

Barisan  Sosialis line. They are just  like  the

Barisan  Sosialis  stooges living  the  life  of

people who are being the line of others. Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  if the people  of  Singapore  and

Malaya  today  listen  to the  "tailism"  of  such

leaders, it will be very unfortunate for them.



<br><br>11.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Chang Sam (In Mandarin):

Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope that I can answer in four

minutes all the unreasonable accusations from the

Government  side. The Member for Delta  asked  us

why we want to seek citizenship rights for 624,000

citizens. My answer is that the citizenship rights

of   these   624,000  citizens  are  their   basic

democratic rights which should not be thwarted in

any  way.  Mr Speaker, Sir,  just now the  Member

for  Cairnhill said that if full merger could  not

be secured, then half merger would be quite good.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>He  said  that  if we could not get  all  that  we

wanted to buy, then why not accept half of it?  In

my opinion, the White Paper merger proposal is not

just one half of something that we want, but it is

poison,  and that is why the people cannot  accept

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill

asked that   apart  from  the  Barisan  Sosialis  merger

proposals which provide for automatic citizenship,

what  else could the people of Singapore  get?  If

the  question  is  as simple  as  that,  then  the

Federation  Government has  no  right  at  all  to

reject  the request that all citizens of Singapore

should   automatically  become  citizens  of   the

Federation.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  from  the  short

speech  of  the  Member  for  Cairnhill,  we  can

clearly see that he has

entirely  changed his stand.  I  quote  from  the

Nanyang  Siang Pau of 4th July, 1962.  The  Member

for  Cairnhill  said  that all  political  Parties

should  discard  all  party differences  and  seek

unity  among  themselves in  order  to  promote  a

closer relationship between Singapore

and  the  Federation. No matter what the  Barisan

Sosialis  or  the Workers' Party merger  proposals

are, we should let the people decide on them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday we only debated the

three   alternatives.  Now,  our   amendment   was

rejected by the

Government and the S.P.A. The fourth alternative

introduced  by the Member for Thomson is  in  line

with  what the Member for Cairnhill has said, that

there  should be adequate questions for the people

to  choose  from. However, you can  see  that  the

Member for Cairnhill is not interested in looking

after  the  interests of the people of  Singapore,

but after the interests of the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original Question, as amended,

was:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House resolves that the people

of Singapore be asked to express their choice

on the mode and manner of the inevitable

reunification of the two territories and that

a referendum be held for the people to

decide between the alternatives of reunification on the basis of



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the constitutional arrangements set out in

Paper  Command  33  of 1961 giving  Singapore

autonomy in education and labour; or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>

is now before the House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Two minutes, Mr Marshall.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  smokescreen is now complete.  We  have

before the people allegedly three questions for a

referendum, when, in fact, there is but one, and

that is not a question, Sir, because you are  not

allowed to give an answer yes or no. There is  no

choice of answer. You must say yes and therefore

there  is this position that we are now allegedly

giving  the people a referendum, when, in  fact,

all  they  can do is say yes to the one proposal,

Command Paper 33. I have but two minutes, Sir.

It has been shown to you that proposal (b) is the

one which the Prime Minister suggests is mine. We

have  put our stand very clearly in the amendment

which  they  have  now  just  defeated.  Sir,  he

suggests  that we can put it to a Commission  of

Jurists  or  Judges.  If  he  can  assure  us  or

obtain - not he, I am not interested in the  P.A.P.

corkscrew  assurances - or  if  we  can   have   an

assurance  from  the  Prime  Minister   of   the

Federation that he would be content to  give  us

what a legal commission would consider to be  the

true  meaning of that proposal, I would be  happy

to  accept  it.  But to leave out  ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b>Order. It is midnight.

In accordance with the decision of this House, I

am to put the Question.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House resolves that the people of

Singapore be asked to express their choice on the

mode  and  manner of the inevitable reunification

of  the  two territories and  that a referendum  be

held  for  the  people  to  decide  between   the

alternatives of reunification on the basis of



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the constitutional arrangements set out in

Paper  Command  33 of 1961 giving  Singapore

autonomy in education and labour; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) a complete and unconditional merger as a

state  on  an  equal basis  with  the  other

eleven   states  in  accordance  with   the

constitutional documents of the  Federation

of Malaya; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to enter Malaysia on terms no less

favourable  than the terms  for  the  Borneo

territories.".
