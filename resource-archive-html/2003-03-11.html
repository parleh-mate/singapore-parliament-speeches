<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for Resumption of Debate on Question

[28th February, 2003],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That Parliament approves the financial policy of

the Government for the financial year 1st April, 2003  to

31st  March, 2004." - [Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

for Finance].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker Sir, the

concerns  of our people today can be summarised in  three

words: Jobs, Jobs and Jobs.  For working people, they are

concerned  about  keeping  their  jobs.   For  retrenched

people,  they are searching high and low for a job.   For

young  people, they are worried about whether  there  are

vacancies  for them after 12 or more years in  our  rigid

and rigorous education system.  Furthermore, as the Prime

Minister  was quoted recently in the papers, the  outlook

is  not  getting any better any time soon.  The worse  is

yet to come.  As a result, the confidence of Singaporeans

about  our economy has reached a bottom unprecedented  in

recent years.  Confidence in the PAP leadership's ability

to  lead  us  through  this downturn, especially  amongst

those   in   the   category   of   so-called   structural

unemployment, is also diminishing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On job creation and confidence, the Budget Statement

did  not  take  the  opportunity to  address  them  in  a

sufficiently strong and forceful manner to make an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>

impact.   To me, Sir, it is basically a response  to  the

ERC Report issued on 7th February.  True, more than 1,000

people,  amongst them some of the brightest and the  best

Singapore has to offer, have contributed their ideas  and

energies   to  the  deliberations  of  the  ERC   Report.

However, the gestation period of the Report is one  year,

which  is,  indeed, a very long time -  one  year  during

which   the   Government  has  ample  time  to  formulate

responses to some of those recommendations, many of which

are not new, as Mr Khaw pointed out to us yesterday.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those hoping that this Budget will provide some

magic  prescriptions to bring us out  of  the  recession,

they  are  disappointed at the lack of any  major  policy

announcements or bold moves.  Mr Inderjit Singh expressed

this sentiment in his trademark way very well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the key thread that runs through

the  ERC  Report  is  the  lack  of  entrepreneurship  in

Singapore.   There  are  many  recommendations  to   make

Singapore  society more entrepreneurial.  It is important

enough for the Government to appoint Mr Raymond Lim to be

the  Minister-in-charge.  Sir, we do not envy Mr  Lim  in

his  new job as he has the most unenviable task.  How  to

convert  a  nation  of  salary earners  to  a  nation  of

entrepreneurs?   He recognised that our education  system

is  not  geared to provide creativity and mentioned  that

the  school system is being changed to cater to this  new

requirement.   Even  if  we do everything  right  in  the

schools,  how  long would it take us  to  turn  the  ship

around?   How  about all those who have left  the  school

system  and  have already joined the workforce?   It  is,

indeed,  a Herculean task.  Furthermore, it is not  clear

what are Mr Lim's powers to make changes and what are his

measures  of success.  Perhaps Mr Lim could find  another

opportunity to clarify these points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if we were to depend on new entrepreneurs

to  help us in the short term, especially in the area  of

unemployment, our hope would be misguided.   The  problem

is a big one.  Let us look at some

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>

numbers.   We  have  close to 80,000 unemployed.   If  we

assume  that every new start-up would employ 10  persons,

we  would  need 8,000 new start-ups.  Since  the  success

rate of new start-ups is not very high, the number of new

enterprises in order to address this problem  would  have

to  be  in  the tens of thousands.  From the Registry  of

Companies' records, we can clearly see that new companies

are  not being formed fast enough, and we are years  away

from  making a dent in the problem if we were  to  depend

solely on new start-ups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clearly we have to find some alternative means,

even  if  they were the old and outmoded means to address

the unemployment situation.  Singaporeans are so used  to

the  Government's ability to tackle the problems at  hand

and  to make some policy changes and, presto! - we  would

be  back  on  the normal growth path within a very  short

period of time.  So much so that we in Government believe

that  the  Government holds the key to job  creation  and

prosperity  of our nation.  That is also why  our  people

accept  the  salaries of our Ministers and  senior  civil

servants to be pegged to the private sector.  That is why

we have the best paid Cabinet in the world.  But based on

this Budget Statement, there is indeed a mismatch between

our   people's  expectations  and  the  ability  of   the

Government to deliver.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As usual, Sir, the Feedback Unit conducts dialogue

sessions prior to the Budget day.  Unlike previous years,

participants  in  our dialogues did  not  have  many  new

ideas.   Perhaps  all  the new ideas  have  already  been

submitted  to  the  ERC.  In a fact sheet  given  to  the

participants  as pre-reading, we asked a  question:  what

would  you do if you were the Finance Minister?   Perhaps

it  was  a  wrong  way  to  prepare  the  audience.   The

responses  we  got  could  be  summarised  in  this   one

statement:  "If the doctor does not know how to treat the

patient, it is time to change the doctor."  In short, our

people  are  depending on the Finance  Minister  to  pull

rabbits  out of the hat.  However, on one issue, which  I

think we have unanimous conclusion, and that is, everyone

felt strongly that the Government should not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>

plan  for  a  budget surplus in this  fiscal  year.   The

ground  reaction would have been extremely  negative  had

the   Minister  presented  a  conservative  budget   with

surpluses.  Now that the Budget is a deficit one,  people

are  more relieved.  On the other hand, some have pointed

out  that we could have even a bigger deficit.  Mr  Leong

Horn  Kee had brought this up yesterday.  But I think  we

all know that we cannot spend our way out of a recession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps we can ask: why would the Deputy Prime

Minister present a budget in this way?  This is the first

budget he presented after chairing the ERC.  Had it  been

possible,  he  would probably like to  make  this  Budget

Statement  a  dramatic one.  If it had been  possible  to

turn  the  economy around by one simple Budget Statement,

he  would  have  then left an indelible  imprint  on  the

population.  The bond between the new generation  leaders

and the younger generation of Singaporeans would then  be

cemented.   Thus,  the  lack of  new  measures  providing

immediate  relief in the Budget speaks volumes about  the

challenges facing us.  It should be clear that there  are

no   quick  fixes.   This  should  be  humbling  for  the

Government  to realise that when the tide is against  us,

even  the  best Cabinet in the world could not  buck  the

trend.   On  the  other hand, I must give credit  to  the

Deputy  Prime  Minister for not adopting  any  quick  fix

measures  that  would dig us deeper into the  hole,  from

which  we would then have to work harder to climb out  of

later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Government must take charge in

leading  our  people out of the current depression,  both

with regard to the economy and also the confidence of our

people.  Government is the only institute we have that is

able  and  could do the task.  Mr Khaw has  spoken  about

complacency yesterday.  He warned that we would fail as a

nation  if  we were complacent.  I would go even  further

and  say  that we fail if the Government does not,  as  a

whole,  rise  to  the occasion.  However,  Singapore  has

pursued  the  same formulae of success for so  long  that

perhaps  our  mindsets  and  institutions  might  not  be

suitable  or appropriate to deal with the new  challenges

facing us.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In leaving no stone unturned, we could draw some

lessons on how successful MNCs react to a changing world.

Or   rather   we  can  learn  more  lessons  from   those

outstanding companies that failed to respond to  changes.

It is true that if we look at the corporate records, some

of  best companies in the world languish when the  market

changes.   Why?   It is not that the management  did  not

foresee  the  challenges.  It is not that the  management

did  not  formulate  the  proper response.   They  failed

because  they continued to carry out the counter-measures

using  the  organisational structures and  the  processes

that  had  worked in the past.  They failed because  they

did    not   question   whether   those   processes   and

organisations   will  continue  to  work   in   the   new

environment.   Indeed, some of them went into  overdrive,

launching  programme  after  programme  to  check   their

competitors.  I think, as a government, we have to  avoid

similar  pitfalls.   We should relook at  all  Government

departments,  agencies, both regulatory  and  promotional

ones, to see what needs to be refocused and what needs to

be  restructured.   We should go beyond fashionable  name

changes such as A*Star, SPRING, and IES - with the result

that  nowadays people find it difficult to even  remember

what they stand for.  Again, in the spirit of leaving  no

stone   unturned,   I   suggest   that   the   Government

administration,  in  general, should  ask  the  following

questions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, whether strategic frames that have helped us

to  succeed  in  the  past have  become  blinders?   Such

paradigms shape how policymakers view the world and allow

us  to make quick policy decisions.  The same frames  can

also blind us to emerging threats and opportunities.  One

example I would like to give here is our land use policy.

In  the  boom time, the Government adopted the policy  of

assigning  a  value  to  every piece  of  land  based  on

alternative use.  Doing so seems logical when  such  land

could be converted to residential use, for instance.  But

adopting   this   policy  universally  means   that   our

infrastructures, such as power generating plants, have to

pay  high  land use fees.  Our port authority,  the  PSA,

also  has to pay high land use fees.  We did not  foresee

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>

emerging threat of Tanjung Pelepas where the operator  is

given effectively free land by the government.  While  it

would  seem that it was the PSA management that lost  its

two  top customers, ultimately, I think, it is still  the

Government's land use policy that drives up the  cost  of

doing business for PSA.  Recognising this, the ERC Report

has  proposed the concept of competitive factor  pricing,

which  has  been accepted in principle by the Government,

and  we  look  forward to the detailed implementation  of

such a policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question we should ask is whether proven

processes  have hardened into routines.  We  are  getting

infamous  for  Government  rules  and  regulations.    Mr

Raymond Lim had already addressed this and he proposed to

time-stamp  every rule in the Government.  I think  also,

in  this  respect,  we should ask ourselves  whether  our

Ministries  and agencies are fortresses onto  themselves.

Has  the division of labour become so clear that what  is

undefined  is  left unattended in the no-man  land?   For

instance, let us ask the question: how could we help  the

unemployed  workers?  MOM's response would be  coming  up

with  programmes  for  retraining and  upgrading.   MTI's

response  would  be looking for more investments.   EDB's

response  would  be  life sciences.  The  ERC's  response

would  be  to  create more entrepreneurs.  But  who  will

really  help the unemployed to help themselves?  I  think

the  question is left unanswered.  In the South West CDC,

Mayor  Yu-Foo has been trying to create a people's market

where  the  unemployed could somehow become self-reliant.

But the problems she encountered are indeed monumental.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question we should ask ourselves is

whether  values, that we have, have hardened into dogmas.

It  is true that our values inspire and unify our people.

However,  they  too can harden into rigid, self-defeating

policies.    For  instance,  the  HDB's  housing   policy

provides  two  bites  of the cherry for  every  Singapore

citizen.  However, by pursuing it without putting on  our

thinking hat, the Government is today left with a backlog

of thousands of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>

unsold flats.  This brought the building programme of HDB

to  a  halt.   The  building contractors that  have  been

dependent on HDB's building programme are all now  facing

difficulties,  some  are facing  bankruptcy.   The  other

example is the CPF contribution rates.  On the one  hand,

we  say that CPF should return to the basics of providing

for  retirement.  On the other hand, we somehow  convince

ourselves that the proper CPF total contribution rate  is

40%.   So, when the economy turns around, we pledge  that

we  should restore that number to 40%.  Mr Inderjit Singh

pointed   out  yesterday  that  such  a  policy   creates

uncertainties  with regard to the cost of doing  business

in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not only the promotional agencies, such as

EDB, JTC, IES and STB, that should subject themselves  to

this  particular  review by asking themselves  the  three

questions  I  have  proposed.   I  have  also   in   mind

regulatory   agencies,   such   as   Immigration,    Fire

Department,  URA,  etc.  In fact,  one  of  my  favourite

gripes  is the hurdle imposed by immigration on  visitors

from  emerging countries, like India and China.  It might

have  been  true  that, in the past, many  visitors  from

these  countries ended up as over-stayers.  But to  treat

every applicant from these countries who visits Singapore

as  a  potential  over-stayer would indeed  deprive  many

business   opportunities  for   tourism   and   education

enterprises in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, many of the changes that we propose

will involve pain.  When the Government promises that  no

stone  will  be left unturned, no one expected  that  the

Government will respond to some of the worms under  those

stones by restructuring the Government agencies, such  as

PSA  and  HDB,  through  massive  retrenchment  or  early

unemployment.    While  shedding  surplus   manpower   is

oftentimes the right approach, making jobs redundant,  in

particular by the Government, should be the last resort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a job is more than just a person receiving a

pay  cheque.  A job indeed defines the role of the person

in  society.   It gives the person respect  and  dignity.

Often times, the workers are not at fault.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>

Again,  let us come back to the case of PSA.  It  is  the

management  that  lost  the  top  two  customers  through

inflexibility  or insensitivity.  However,  if  you  look

further,  as  I  said earlier, it is also the  Government

land  use policy that saddles PSA with a burdensome  land

cost that PSA must recover from its customers.  Thus, the

Government is ultimately responsible for PSA's  troubles.

Extending  this idea to all businesses, it is also  clear

that  Government land use policy has played a major  role

in  bringing  us to our current difficulties.   Only  the

Government  could  unwind  the situation  that  we  found

ourselves in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, notwithstanding my comments, I

found  the  Budget indeed to be a very carefully  crafted

one,  balancing the short term needs as well as the  long

term  goals  of  our  country.  It is  a  deficit  budget

designed   to  maintain  Government  expenditure   in   a

shrinking  economy.   It maintains the  support  for  the

lower  income groups.  And furthermore, the Deputy  Prime

Minister has been bold to introduce several new measures,

such  as  tax  exemption for foreign-sourced  income  and

interest on local bank deposits.  The first exemption has

been  proposed  repeatedly in the past by  Feedback  Unit

participants.  I am indeed very glad that the  Government

has finally agreed to this suggestion.  The tax exemption

on  interest  on  local  bank deposits  is  indeed  quite

unexpected.  It is indeed quite uncommon in this world to

find  a  government that is prepared to exempt  taxes  on

interest  from savings account.  I believe this exemption

will  continue  to promote the habit of saving  and  will

provide  great  relief to our retirees  who  are  largely

dependent   on   their  savings  to  see   them   through

retirement.  I would like to thank the Minister on  their

behalf.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the prescription of the Minister

for  our  economy  reminds  me of  the  approach  between

western  medicine and herbal medicine.  Western  medicine

provides  quick  and effective relief but  sometimes  has

severe  side effects.  On the other hand, herbal medicine

must  be  taken  over a long time.  It  is  also  a  more

holistic approach that probably would bring about  better

long term health.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>

Singaporeans have been expecting western medicine in this

Budget,  but the Minister has prescribed herbal medicine.

It  would have been ideal if the Minister could prescribe

a  blend of western and herbal medicines so that we would

have the best of both worlds from both practices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our economy is indeed in

transition.   As  Mr  Raymond  Lim  pointed  out,  in   a

knowledge era, those resource-endowed countries  are  not

necessarily  those that would emerge as  winners.   Often

times,  the  resource-deprived countries are  those  that

would vault ahead of the others.  In this respect,  I  am

reminded  of  the  analogy of the evolution  of  species.

Species  evolved from a small population are  subject  to

rapid  and severe change in the environment.  The  weaker

ones  are  eliminated and only those who can adapt  would

survive.    Our   economy  is  now  subject   to   severe

challenges.   Elimination  of  the  weaker  companies  is

painful but necessary.  Sir, I believe that so long as we

take  care  to  maintain social cohesion through  helping

those  unfortunate  amongst  us,  Singapore  will  emerge

stronger and fitter at the end of this journey.  I  thank

the  Minister  for  a thoughtful Budget  that  strikes  a

balance between the diverse needs of the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion standing in his name.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

may  I be allowed to make a clarification on what I  said

yesterday in respect of the cost of the bypass operation?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Provided it is a clarification and no

debate.  You have to be concise.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> It will be a short one.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> OK, go ahead.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> May I clarify my speech on the

point   about  the  two  brothers  who  went  for  bypass

operations.  The one done in Singapore at Mount Elizabeth

cost him almost S$30,000, and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>

not  S$40,000, as I said yesterday.  The other  operation

done in Malaysia at Johor Baru General Hospital cost  him

Malaysian  Ringgit 500, or S$235 if we take the  exchange

rate at S0.47 cents to M$1.  Both operations were done in

1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have checked with NUH this morning that, for

a  C class patient in NUH who has undergone a bypass, the

estimated  cost is about S$3,500 and the  stay  is  about

seven  days.   So  even  if  we  compare  hospital   with

hospital, Singapore's cost is more than ten times that of

Malaysia.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the Finance Minister labelled this  year's

Budget  as  "Seizing  Opportunity in  Uncertainty".   The

headline  caption in the Lianhe Zaobao  described  it  as

"Relieving   current   concerns   to   build    long-term

advantage".  But, to the general public, this is a budget

that  cares  not  for the predicament of the  people  and

offers no help to them at all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the ordinary people, the utilities, SC&CC rebates

are  merely  some meagre favours.  At the time  when  the

economic growth was good, and the Government  accumulated

huge  surpluses,  they gave just a  little  in  terms  of

rebates,  and  glorified  them  by   declaring  that  the

Government was sharing the wealth with the people. Today,

with  an  unemployment rate as high as  4.5%,  and  still

mounting continuously, the rebates remain the same.  Take

the  utilities rebate as an example.  In the 1996 Budget,

the utilities rebate amounted to $73 million.  This year,

with a situation where  retrenchments are escalating, and

those  who  are lucky enough to keep their  jobs  get  no

bonus  and even suffer a pay cut, the rebates package  is

$71  million.  Not only has it not been increased, it  is

actually reduced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister said that the present economic

difficulty has not bottomed out yet and that we  must  be

prepared for  the worst to come. In his Budget Statement,

the Finance Minister urged our people to help one another

and put in concerted

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>

efforts  to pull through the difficult times. But  having

said that, does the Minister lead by extending his nimble

and  agile  hand  to prevent those who were falling  from

dropping  into  the  water, or pull  out  those  who  are

already  in  the water and drowning? Absolutely  NO,  the

Minister is merely stretching his fingers at his original

position.   These  utilities rebates and SC&CC  exemption

cannot  effectively relieve the anxiety.  As it was  said

by    an  economist,  the short-term rebates  are  indeed

lacking in bearing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Minister for Finance may say proudly

that    he   had   issued  to  our  people  the  Economic

Restructuring Shares, and two-thirds of the  shareholders

have  already cashed out their shares.  But we  must  not

forget  that  the  ERS are only given as a sugar  coating

over  the poison of increasing the GST.  With higher GST,

we  have  to  pay more tax each day, be  it  at  the  wet

markets,  supermarkets,  hospitals  or  on  the  road.  .

Three years down the road, I am sure that there would not

be  any  more  ERS  to be issued. Will the  Minister  for

Finance   lift the GST then?  Surely not!   We  may  even

expect a heavier GST.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister may say that one cannot make

bricks  without straw. There is no growth in our economy,

the Government's revenue is reduced. All that can be done

has  already  been done. But I am sure the  hand  of  the

Finance Minister is certainly more nimble and agile  than

those  of  the families where the breadwinners have  lost

their  jobs, and  those who are struggling for  survival.

The  PAP  Ministers are well known for their  ability  to

create wealth and preparing for the rainy days. Now  that

the rain has come, if the Finance Minister is sympathetic

to the people on their present predicament, surely he can

bring  the  initiative of his wisdom and creativity  into

full play and do more for the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister said that he was afraid that the

Government's   various rebates given to help  the  people

lighten  their  financial burden may be habitually  taken

for  granted  by the people. The people's dependency   on

the Government

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>

not  only causes him to be worried, but also to feel that

it  is  dangerous.  He sincerely and earnestly urged  the

people  to  move away from the dependency mentality,  and

make  every  attempt  to   resolve  their  own  problems.

However, I wish to remind the Government that when we see

a  80-year-old granny bending her fragile body  to  glean

and  collect scraps from the rubbish heap, when we see  a

university graduate putting aside his academic excellence

to  roast  chestnuts for sale, when we  see  a  youngster

concealing his MA qualification to apply for a job  as  a

warehouse assistant, we know that most Singaporeans  want

to live with dignity. They will certainly seek to be self-reliant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAP Government should not use the conduct of a

small  group of Singaporeans as a criterion, and use  the

excuse of not wanting the people to degenerate and forget

about  the  promises they made during  the  last  General

Election.  Do not forget that the Prime Minister has also

said  that  the  people's problems are his  problems  and

their concerns are his concerns too.   The Prime Minister

is  going to retire to give way to a younger person soon.

I  hope  that  the Minister for Finance who is  going  to

succeed him as Prime Minister will remember what he said.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faced with the threat of retrenchment, pay cut,

zero  bonus, uncertain economic prospect, I feel that  it

is  even  more important that the Government should  give

the  people a clear signal, to let the people  know  that

the Government is resolute in wanting to lower their cost

of  living.  Today, the burden on the people's  shoulders

is so heavy that they could hardly breathe.  According to

a  recent  report  by  Goldman Sachs, the  debt-to-income

ratio of an average Singaporean family is the highest  in

the   world.   Singaporeans  consider  owning  their  own

residential property as their first priority. With 93% of

the   families owning their own home, every family is  in

debt.  With the series of impacts since 1996, the debt-to-income  ratio of an average Singaporean family has  risen

from 122% to 174%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faced with a whole series of retrenchment exercises,

uncertainty in job security

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>

coupled  with  the  heavy debts, the  people's  worry  is

indeed understandable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all these years, I have been repeatedly asking

the  Government to carefully review its policy on  public

service  charges.  Even in the good years, we should  not

use  market  forces as a cover, raising the  standard  of

services as an excuse, and affordability of the people as

the logic to keep on raising public service charges.  The

Government should have exercised control over the cost of

living,  give people a chance to catch their breath,  and

keep  the wealth with the people.  HDB flat pricing is  a

good example. It causes people to be up to their ears  in

debt.   But the Government turned a deaf ear to all these

appeals.   Even  in current bad times, on the  excuse  of

raising   the  standard  of  service,  public   transport

charges,  medical fees and all sorts of charges  such  as

taxi licence fees, etc, have been adjusted upwards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently, the People's Action Party Government

will   never  commit to freeze charges over a long period

of  time,  this will cut off its sources of revenue. Once

the  economy recovers, the Government will go back to its

old  tricks   of using free-market policy as a  cover  to

increase its charges.  Did the Finance Minister not point

out  in  his  Budget Statement that in  good  times,  the

Government  will  accumulate  surpluses  to  offset   the

deficits.  Increasing public service charges  has been  a

significant  means  for  the  Government  to   accumulate

surpluses.  The only difference from now onwards is  that

business  cost cannot be increased by a large margin  for

fear  of frightening away the foreign investors and  with

such constraints, the PAP Government will surely turn  to

the  people  for  their  revenue,  like  increasing  GST.

Furthermore,  in  order to maintain its  competitiveness,

the  Government will also  control tightly the wage level

of  the people. Under such circumstances, the predicament

of the people is clearly imaginable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, I would like to, once again, appeal to the

Government  to    take the high cost  of  living  of  our

people  seriously and  to change the policy and principle

of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>

public   service  charges,  reconvene  the  Cost   Review

Committee to identify the problems, prescribe the correct

medicine,  and relieve the real concerns of  the  people,

rather   than  distributing  shares  before  the  General

Election,  and  then  increasing  the  various  fees  and

charges after the General Election.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance repeatedly emphasised that

the  main  aim and strategy of this budget is  to  create

opportunities  for enhancing productivity and  increasing

job  opportunities.   Can I ask  the  Minister  how  many

people  have  lost  their  jobs since  the  last  General

Election,  and  how  many  job  opportunities  have   the

Government   created?  Among  these  newly  created   job

opportunities,  how many are taken up by foreign  talents

because  Singaporeans are not competent  enough  to  take

them  on?   The Government says that there are plenty  of

vacancies in our labour market, but Singaporeans are  not

prepared  to  lower their expectations to take  on  these

jobs. Has the Government made any attempt to find out why

there is such an anomaly?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy of skill upgrading and retraining is

nothing  new.  But, why is it progressing so slowly?   If

the employment situation is not improved, and batches and

batches  of graduates are pouring into the labour market,

what  counter measures does the Government  have?   After

implementing  the recommendations of the Economic  Review

Committee,  what  is  the Government's  forecast  on  the

labour   market?   Will  the  situation   of   structural

unemployment  improve with the Government's  decision  to

develop life sciences and the service industry?   In  its

estimate,  how  many  years will it take  for  the  whole

economic  transformation to complete? Can the  Government

give our people a definite answer?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparing the recently released Economic Review

Committee  Report to the February 1986 Economic Committee

Report, the fundamental issue remains the same, that  is,

the  weak international and regional demand coupled  with

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>

domestic structural problems, such as high cost resulting

in  the  loss  of  competitiveness, the  inflexible  wage

structure,  high  savings  being  put  into  unproductive

investments like properties, and the reaction to external

changes being slow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1986 report said that Singaporeans would rather

stay  unemployed than to take up lower-paid or  demanding

jobs  because  they  do not understand  that  times  have

changed.   Now, the Government is saying the same  thing.

Have  we changed?  For counter-measures, the 1986  report

set   a   precedent  by  reducing  the   employers'   CPF

contributions by 15%, freezing the wages for  two  years,

reforming the salary structure, introducing the  variable

wage  component,  controlling the Government's  revenues,

lowering  corporate tax, developing the service industry,

developing  the  private  enterprises,  developing  local

enterprises, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the ERC has left no stone unturned, then we can

say  that  these stones had already been turned  some  16

years  ago. Yet 16 years later, they are being picked  up

from  the  same localities, and  most probably  put  back

into  their original positions again. The only difference

is that the then Minister of State for Trade and Industry

who  led  the Economic Committee is now the Deputy  Prime

Minister  cum Minister for Finance, who is again  leading

an  Economic  Review Committee. And in the  report  then,

there  was no mention of China at all, yet it is now  one

of the major factors contributing to our being in such  a

predicament today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When DPM Lee met the union and grassroots leaders,

he said, "If the Government had  anticipated that China's

economy  would  take off so rapidly, it  would  not  have

allowed our wages to escalate so fast." The strange thing

was  following China's economic reform and opening to the

outside world in 1979, our leaders have been making trips

to  China  every now and then, and were received  by  the

paramount leaders of China.  When did our farsighted  PAP

Government first realise that China was going  to  emerge

rapidly?  Have they adjusted their strategies then?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past may not be remonstrated with, but we can

still  pursue  the future.  We can forget about  accusing

the  Government for  its past mistakes, but we  must  ask

this  Government, which it has claimed to  be  formed  by

roping  in the top talents and the most farsighted elites

of  Singapore, this question: when the time was good, you

kept  adding on to the burden of living of the people  on

the  principle that the people could afford it. Now  that

the   economy  has  gone  into  a  predicament,  you  cut

salaries,  cut  CPF under the cover of lowering  business

cost.  The  people's income is diminishing, why  has  the

cost of living still not gone down yet?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With economic development being internationalised,

the  changes  in  the economic  landscape  in  East  Asia

following  the  emergence  of China's  economy,  and  the

enhanced  competitiveness of our neighbouring  economies,

I  am  not  too optimistic with our medium-term  economic

development.  Review the Government's principle  of  fund

allocation  for the public service, find ways  to  reduce

the  various  charges, lighten the burden of  the  people

and, at the same time, bring down business cost, are  the

immediate tasks of the Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Toa Payoh)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am a little puzzled after listening to

the  speech by Mr Low Thia Khiang.  Mr Low said that  the

Government does not understand the difficulties faced  by

the  people, and that the Government has not sent a clear

signal  to  the  people.  I think  this  is  a  distorted

opinion.   We  must  not forget that the  Government  has

postponed the 1% increase in GST by one year.  This shows

that the Government understands the difficulties faced by

the  people.   This  year's budget is a  deficit  budget.

Does  it  not send a clear signal to the people that  the

Government  cares?  Mr Low also said that the  Government

has not done much for the unemployed.  Perhaps he has not

read the newspapers or heard the Minister's speeches that

we  have  put  in tremendous efforts  to attract  foreign

investments, and by so doing to create  more jobs for our

people.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are problems in our economy, and these

problems must be solved.  I would liken our economy to  a

pregnant lady in labour.  When my wife was in the  labour

room, I was there to accompany her, and the labour took a

total  of 18-hours.  During child birth, the mother  must

experience  labour  pain.   Without  going  through  such

labour  pain,  there would be no joy of a new-born  baby.

Likewise, our economy is like going through child  birth.

If  we are not prepared to face some pain, and if we  try

to  take  short cuts, our new economy will not  be  born.

Therefore,  I urge all the MPs, including our  Opposition

Members,  to  work  together  to  endure  this  pain   of

childbirth,  and  to look forward to  receiving  the  new

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, 2002 was a very difficult year.

The   economic  recovery  which  the  people  have   been

expecting did not materialise. The unemployment situation

has  worsened,  externally there were  squabbles  between

Singapore and Malaysia, and the bombing in Bali has  made

us keenly aware of the terrorist threats right before our

eyes.   On the whole, 2002 was a difficult year that  has

brought us few good news.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outlook for 2003 is still fraught with

uncertainties.    Externally,  the   tension   that   has

bedevilled  relations  with  our  neighbour   has   eased

somewhat although the bilateral issues have not yet to be

solved.  The situation in Iraq is unstable, with the  war

threatening to break out any moment.  Our economy remains

weak.   With  the successive retrenchments recently,  the

unemployment rate is likely to go up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister, in his recent interview, warned

the  people that the bad time is not quite over. He  said

that  while  we  should not lose hope, we  must  also  be

prepared  for  the  worst.  Hence,  when  discussing  the

budget,  we  must  be  aware of the  uncertain  prospects

facing us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government accepted almost all the

recommendations of the ERC.  These include postponing the

restoration of the employers' CPF contributions, lowering

the salary ceiling of CPF contributions,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>

lowering the CPF contribution rates for workers  aged  50

and  above.   All these  measures are aimed at  enhancing

Singapore's  competitiveness  and  preserving  jobs.  The

Government has also put forward specific measures to help

revive  our  economy,  such  as  setting  up  a  Services

Committee to be chaired by DPM Lee, and the Committee  on

Promoting Entrepreneurial Spirit with Mr Raymond  Lim  in

charge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is apparently lacking in the Budget are some

goodies  people  were hoping to get  to  alleviate  their

present financial difficulties.  Their disappointment  is

understandable.   They had expected  both  corporate  and

personal income tax rates to come down further.  However,

we  need  to focus on the long term strategic objectives,

and this is precisely what this budget seeks to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although restructuring is painful, it is the most

effective  way to help upgrade our economy  to  a  higher

plane.  While the budget is generally on the right track,

I think we could do more in the following aspects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, build up an external economy. Secondly,

help our local companies and, thirdly, we must change our

mindset.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Build up an external economy. We have a very small

economy  with  a population of 3.5 million.  We  have  to

depend   on foreign markets.  Our only choice is to  stay

connected  to  the world while at the same time  minimise

the  negative  impact  of external factors.   The  Budget

focuses  on  lowering  business  cost  to  maintain   our

competitiveness.  However, I am afraid the world  economy

has  changed structurally.  It is not enough to be merely

cost-competitive.  Many economies offer  more  than  cost

competitiveness.  They offer a huge domestic  market  and

an inexhaustible pool of technical professionals and rich

natural resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot offer the same thing, but does it mean

that  we  are  finished?   Of course  not.   We  have  to

identify and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>

leverage on our competitive advantages, for example,  our

people,  our  most important resource.   Our  people  are

nimble,   quick   to  exploit  opportunities,   creative,

resilient  and  our workers are full of  aspirations  and

ambitions. These are essential ingredients in the make-up

of  any  successful entrepreneur.  In addition,  we  have

strong  financial  resources.  Even  during  the  current

economic  slowdown, many of our companies, both GLCs  and

private  companies, remain financially  healthy  compared

to  many  foreign companies.  Thirdly, we have  a  stable

political and social environment which ensures  that  our

enterprises can develop and grow unimpeded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have all the conditions for

success.  I am of the view that if we are to continue  to

prosper  in  a rapidly globalising environment,  what  we

need is not just a Singapore economy. We have to build  a

vibrant  and  growing  external  economy  that   is   not

constrained by our own limitations. We have to open a new

window, build new channels, develop new networks  and  be

directly involved in the world economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such an economy cannot be constrained by our own

geopolitical  boundaries.  Let me give an  example.  Over

the  years, my company has been investing in some Chinese

cities  and  most of the businesses have  done  well.  We

naturally  began to consider expanding our businesses  to

other  parts of China.  There was one critical  obstacle.

Our  local  partner  was  not  prepared  to  join  us  in

investing  in places outside their province.   They  felt

that  their  duty  was to attract foreign  investment  to

their  own  province so that jobs could  be  created  for

their local people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To them, investing in places outside the province

means  an  outflow of capital and would not  help  create

jobs  for  the people.  They are wrong.  In view  of  the

reluctance  of  our local partner to go out  of  its  own

province, we decided to venture out to other provinces on

our  own.  With the passage of time, such new investments

will  become more attractive than the existing one.  When

that happens, we may

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>

relocate  our  present factories  and  move  to  the  new

location. Then the province where we originally  invested

in will lose out eventually.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if they are far-sighted, they

will  know  that to venture out and invest  with  us  may

bring  them  more  profits and  would  also  benefit  the

existing joint venture business.  As a partner in  a  new

investment,  their  partnership  position  will  be  more

secure.  They will become our strategic partner.  This is

the  same with Singapore, although investing overseas may

result  in capital outflow and will not create  jobs  for

Singaporeans in the short term.  I believe that this is a

long-term  strategy that will strengthen our economy  and

would   eventually  create  more  well-paying  jobs   for

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we recognise that investing overseas is an

important strategy, then we have to help our companies do

so.   In  this  connection, I would like  to  make  three

suggestions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, formulate direct incentives to encourage

and  help  enterprises  to  go  overseas.   Investing  in

foreign  countries entails high costs  at  the  start  up

stage.    This   has  discouraged  many  companies   from

venturing  overseas.  Through tax incentive and  rebates,

we could help to share some of the costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, set up a special seed fund to co-invest

with  Singapore companies.  Lack of capital is  a  common

obstacle to companies going overseas.  Local banks may be

averse  to lending them money to invest overseas  because

they are not familiar with the environment in the foreign

country or they do not have the licence to lend money  in

these  countries.   Therefore,  companies  that  want  to

invest  overseas  have  to  look  for  new  banks.    The

Government should set up some seed funds to provide  such

facilities. We must be prepared to take some  risks.   As

it is said, "no risk, no gain".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, MTI should set up an agency to provide one-stop services to companies that intend to invest

overseas,  as  what  the EDB has been  doing  to  attract

foreign

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>

investments to Singapore.  Our many overseas offices  can

also  help  in this respect, but it would be  helpful  to

have a central coordinating agency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GLCs can also play a supplementary role in

assisting such companies.  Many of these GLCs have  built

up    international   networks   and   have   substantial

investments  in China and other emerging  economies.   It

would  be  good if they can help our local  suppliers  by

bringing them along so that they can establish a foothold

in  overseas countries.  On their own, they would find it

difficult to compete with the low cost domestic suppliers

initially.   If we could help them overcome  the  initial

difficulties,  they would be able to  compete  with  them

eventually  and  they may well emerge as  another  global

company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, giving Singapore companies a helping hand. Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  we  have  to  be  aware  that  Singapore

companies  are  facing a grave challenge.   The  economic

recession  has  never been so grave and the  duration  so

long.  While focusing on the need to lower business cost,

we  must  also consider specific measures to  help  local

enterprises pull through this difficult period,  so  that

when  the  opportunity comes again, they can recover  and

prosper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main factor that is likely to constrain the

rapid recovery among Singapore enterprises is the lack of

capital.  Due  to the economic crisis in the  past  three

years,  many of these companies have incurred losses  and

heavy  debts.   With banks being  very cautious  at  this

time, even when the economy turns around, these companies

will  find it difficult to get working capital  from  the

banks.  Therefore, their recovery will be hampered.  Some

of them may not even make it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must look ahead in reviving the economy. First

of all, we must ensure adequate liquidity.  Next, we must

make  sure  that the fund goes to those who need  it  and

deserve it.  Therefore, there is an urgent need to set up

a  special  bank  to  cater to the  needs  of  the  SMEs.

Whether  this  bank  forms part of  our  present  banking

system, and how it would be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>

run, are details that warrant careful consideration.. The

terms  of  lending  must  also  be  considered.   But  in

principle, a decision must be taken to set up such a bank

to  assist  the  SMEs to recover from  the  recession.  I

believe this is viable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is also important to change

people's  way  of thinking if we are to embrace  the  new

economy.   While  we  are making efforts  to  revive  the

economy, we could see three trends emerging:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) As we build an external economy, we will see

more and more Singaporeans going overseas to work;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) With our economy going global, we can expect an

influx of foreign talents coming here to work; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The restructuring of the economy will continue

and accelerate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we have to leave our comfort zone, be

prepared  to  take  risks,  be more  flexible  and,  when

necessary, free ourselves from past practices. The  world

is  changing rapidly and we have to keep on changing too.

I  remember Mr Lim Swee Say saying that our restructuring

is  unlike mountain-climbing.  In mountain-climbing, when

you are tired, you can pitch a tent to take a rest and if

you  persist,  you  can  reach the  peak.   He  said  our

restructuring  is more like rowing a boat  in  a  stream,

surging with rapid currents. If we stop, we will regress.

We  must  get our people to expect changes.  We  have  to

progress with the times or we will be left behind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must reform our seniority-based wage system and

replace  it  with  a  wage system with  monthly  variable

components to give employers more flexibility.   We  must

enhance  the employability of older workers so that  they

can  retain  their  jobs or look for new  jobs  when  the

economy is being restructured.  We must encourage  people

to  be more flexible, be prepared to venture overseas and

help them where we can.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Budget is a bold and balanced

one although it offers no

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>

desserts.  It has provided the necessary steps to  ensure

that  we  keep our competitive advantage.  It is  like  a

Ferrari with its engine finely tuned and the best  driver

behind  the wheel, yet we still need to have  a  team  of

engineers  and technicians working together at  the  crew

pit  to back up the machine. In this way, we will win the

race and bag the trophy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, just now, Mr

Gan  likened our new economy to a would-be mother at  the

labour ward.  When a woman is giving birth to a baby,  of

course  she suffers labour pain, and she knows that  soon

the  pain will be over and joy will prevail when the baby

is born. But, can the Government tell us clearly when the

present economic pain is going to be over?  Will the pain

last a long time?  In case there is no natural birth, can

we resort to birth by a caesarian section?  If a would-be

mother cannot stand the pain any longer, she can ask  for

a  caesarian  section  to deliver  the  baby.   Can   the

Government  also  do  a caesarian  section  to  ease  our

economic pain?

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Perhaps Mr Low has

not  undergone this labour pain, neither have I.   But  I

can tell Mr Low very clearly that when my wife was giving

birth,  I was there with her.  In the beginning, she  was

very  nervous,  the  pain came again and  again,  and  it

dragged  on for 18 hours before the baby was born.   Even

the doctors could not predict how long the pain would be.

So  for  us  to  predict when our economic recovery  will

come,   I   think  it  is  very  difficult.    Even   the

gynaecologists could not predict it.  But  one  thing  we

can  say  for sure is that the baby is going to  be  born

eventually.   Whether it is natural  birth  or  caesarian

birth, so long as it is not an abortion, it is all right.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, if you are the Finance Minister faced  with

the  present  difficulty, what type of budget  would  you

present?   We should ask this question of the Member  for

Hougang.  He would only talk about caesarian birth or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>

natural birth, but no delivery. My conclusion is that  he

has  just a lot of ideas, but no solution.  The important

thing is that we must prescribe the correct medicine  for

the  ailment.  This year's budget is a  very  appropriate

one,  and  I believe most of the people would agree  with

me.  In  fact,  many people are saying that  our  Finance

Minister has prescribed the correct medicine, while  some

were  of  the  view  that the dosage may  not  be  strong

enough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Timah said this is a herbal

cure  and  he has asked for a fusion between the  Western

medicine and Chinese medicine, and even that Mr  Low  did

not  agree.  He took it as just changing in form  without

changing  in substance. I think we need warm  hearts  and

tough minds as mentioned by Deputy Prime Minister towards

the  end  of  his  budget speech. This is  precisely  the

spirit  of  our  budget this year.  In other  words,  the

prescription by the Finance Minister is that we must,  on

the  one hand, have physiotherapy for our external  pains

and,  on  the  other  hand, oral  medicine  for  internal

treatment.  Recently,  we have  been  talking  about  the

difficult  times  and  that we must change  our  mindset,

upgrade  or re-skill. This is oral medicine. And  we  are

asking  our people to move out of the comfort zone  where

they  have  been enjoying all their life to get  out  and

venture into the unknown. This is difficult.  I think  we

need to give them some psychiatric counselling as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, whenever we visited our constituency,

and I believe my parliamentary colleagues will agree with

me,  and  faced a resident who was unemployed,  he  would

take it lightly as though he was just having a break. But

now,  when  they are unemployed, they are very depressed.

They told me they are prepared to take on any job offered

to  them, because they know job openings are not easy  to

come by nowadays.  But when they are told that there  are

jobs in coffeeshops, they would give many excuses not  to

take up the offer..

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People must accept all sorts of training to cope

with the needs of the new

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>

economy.   The  fact that some still have not  taken  the

first  step to adjust to the new reality is that they  do

not  realise  that the world around them has  changed  so

much.  We  need to make them aware of the rapid  changes,

and  make them realise that they do have a place  in  the

new economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different people may have different reactions to

this  Budget presented by the Finance Minister. In  terms

of  awareness  of  the  new  challenges  ahead,  I  would

categorise our people into four different types:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the foresighted. They know the problem, take

proactive  action and be pre-emptive. The Government  and

the successful entrepreneurs belong to this group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we have the normal-sighted. They know the

reality  and  adjust themselves to the  new  environment.

They  upgrade themselves and are coping well in  the  new

economy. Most of our workers belong to this group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we have the short-sighted. They fail to

realise how fast the  world is changing and do not adjust

themselves  to adapt to the new environment.  Because  of

this,  they lose their jobs and are not prepared to  take

on  new jobs but simply wait and hope for the old jobs to

come back to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, we have the "switched-off". They are the so-called bo chap people. They do not care about what is

happening around them.  They do not know of the  imminent

danger  of losing their jobs and simply refuse to go  for

training and retraining.  When they eventually lose their

jobs,  they  blame the Government for not  looking  after

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government needs to educate the short-sighted

and  the "switched-off" groups of people so as to enhance

their awareness of the present situation before us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang asked why there was no mention of

the likely emergence of China in our economic review some

10 years ago.  He must not forget that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>

Senior  Minister Lee started visiting China in the 1970s,

even  before China had adopted the "economic  reform  and

opening  to  the outside world" in 1978.   He  encouraged

people  to  invest  in  Xiamen and some  of  the  coastal

cities  in  China.   More than two decades  ago,  he  was

already  encouraging our people to take risks and venture

overseas  and  some of our entrepreneurs  did  invest  in

China and faced the tough time initially.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low said, "Let bygones be bygones, let us look at

the  future."  I think we should do more than  that.  Let

the  past be the past, but there is still a future  ahead

of  us.  We have to make sure that the past mistakes  are

not  repeated.  I think the Government is caring too much

for  the  people, so much so that the people are becoming

over dependent on the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, we can see some undesirable trends

in our society:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, giving a bit to everyone to make everyone

happy.  But, the question is: is everyone happy? When  we

distribute  ang  pows and the goodies, we  want  to  give

everybody  a share so that everybody can be happy.   But,

many  people would say it is not enough.  Why is it  that

you have so much and I have so little? In the end, nobody

is  happy.   Mr  Low  mentioned just  now  that  the  PAP

Government  has a lot of means to make a lot  of  wealth,

but  he  was  being cynical.  So, I think the problem  is

perhaps  the  Government  is  being  too  efficient   and

generous and has given away too many rebates and  shares.

On  top  of  this,  you do not need to  worry  about  the

shortage of water even when there is no rain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there are a lot of people who blame

everyone  else  for  all  their  difficulties   but   not

themselves.    Globalisation  and  regionalisation   have

brought  about a lot of challenges.  The employers  would

blame the employees for being too choosy, too lazy,  etc,

and  the  employees will complain that the employers  are

not employing them.  Even though they know

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>

very  well that they do not have the skill and competence

to  take on the job, they would say the employers do  not

want  them  because they are old or because  they  cannot

speak English.  I know of one man who even remarked  that

he  was  not  employed because he was botak or  bald.   I

received  some SMS citing money not enough  for  them  to

celebrate the Chinese New Year.  They complained that the

employers  had  money but would not pay them  more.  They

blame  the  employers.  They blame the  Government.  They

blame  everyone,  but they never blame themselves!   They

want  to have a job that pays well, but they do not  want

to put in some efforts to acquire the necessary skills to

deserve  that job.  I think our workers should work  hard

and try to upgrade their skills, for their own good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, whenever there are activities, there are

lucky  draws.  This is another strange phenomenon in  our

society.   In  the company dinners, and now even  at  our

constituency functions and grassroots activities,  people

are attending  only because of the lucky draws.  They  do

not  come because of our activities that we are preparing

for  them.   So  I  hope that when we  are  planning  our

financial policies we should not let the people fall into

any of these categories.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to face the new challenges in the new economy,

I  urge  the  Government to foster the three new  spirits

among Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we should encourage our people to learn and

adapt to changes.  When we are being threatened, we  must

find  ways  to  counter  the threats.   Just  as  we  are

threatened  with  the cut-off  of our water  supply,   we

have  new  alternatives, such as NEWater  or  desalinated

water.  Singapore is able to survive because we are  very

good in adapting to changes.  We must also cultivate  our

citizens of all ages and all stations of life to be ready

and  able  to  adapt to changes.  We have to boost  their

confidence so that they have hope.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we have also to encourage our people to

make  ours a learning nation. Last year, President Nathan

mentioned

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>

that  he  started life as an office attendant and  worked

his  way  up to become a senior civil servant, a diplomat

and  eventually the President.  Even our Senior  Minister

started  learning to use the computer at  a  very  senior

age.  So I think we should all learn.  We should have the

spirit  of  lifelong learning among us, and  this  spirit

must be sustained.  We should provide the facilities  and

convenience  to motivate our citizens to become  learning

citizens. We may have to learn from McDonald's  how  they

created this herd mentality that prompted people to queue

up all over the island to buy their "Hello Kitty" toys!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we must be more focused in helping the poor

and  needy.   When we talk about the poor and  needy,  we

would  normally refer to the low-income families. But  in

the  present day situation, even the graduates are having

problems   making  ends  meet.  Mr  Low  mentioned   that

nowadays, a university graduate had to work as  a  hawker

selling roasted chestnuts.  Why  not ? If you can package

the  chestnuts in such a way that it becomes  a  national

brand, it could well be a good business proposition  too.

So  under  the  present situation, in some families,  the

parents are unemployed, the children are unemployed, even

the  graduates cannot be spared. I think we have to focus

our attention on the genuine cases of hardship, the truly

poor  and needy, and move away from the past practice  of

"a piece of candy for everyone".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can adopt these new spirits quickly, I am

confident  that we will be able to get out  of  the  hard

times  soon and I must say that this budget is  one  that

prescribes the correct medicine for our present  economic

ailment.   With a bit of luck, we will be well  and  good

pretty soon!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.

<br>12.10 pm

<br><br><!-- Mrs Fang Ai Lian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Fang Ai Lian (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, I

shall  speak in English and I shall not talk about labour

pains  although  I am quite experienced  here.   I  shall

speak from the point of view of a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>

practising accountant, serving the business world.  And I

would  like  to applaud the Finance Minister for  what  I

would  call a progressive budget.  It contains some  very

far-sighted  elements  that  will  yield  us  significant

results  in the long term, although in the short term  we

may  not  have such good returns.  Still there  are  many

sacred cows which have been slaughtered and also quite  a

few significant policy shifts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take Budgets 2002 and 2003 as a

package.   So I see Budget 2003 as continuing the  spirit

of  decisiveness  and boldness which was  established  in

Budget  2002.  And the two budgets really set  in  motion

the  transformation of our tax regime from one  that  has

been  considered somewhat insular, somewhat domestic,  to

one that clearly favours the globalisation of business in

a  global  world.  There are also efforts  to  level  the

international playing field, and in so doing, would  also

make our environment, our tax regime, much more conducive

for foreign investments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to applaud the Finance Minister and

Government  for planning a budget deficit for  the  third

year  in  a row.  The Government has said that  a  budget

deficit  would be inevitable in difficult times.   But  I

have  got to say that not every Singaporean believes that

statement  because  in  the past a  balanced  budget  has

always  been a long held Government sacred cow.  So  that

had  been slaughtered and I suppose we can slaughter  our

own  scepticism  as well.  We do face very  extraordinary

circumstances  and you have articulated that  the  macro-economic  figures show that we have a small  growth  last

year,  and we will also have a forecasted smaller  growth

this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as has been said by many, the mood on the

ground is rather gloomy because businesses are not  doing

as well, and quite a few are on the verge of experiencing

collapse.  You also have bad news regarding unemployment,

the  PSA lay-offs, the HDB lay-offs and also the prospect

of  war in Iraq and terrorism.  All these heightened  the

fear of unemployment, uncertainty, as well as pessim-

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>

ism.   So we do need some exceptional measures to counter

these extraordinary circumstances and we are glad that  a

deficit  budget has been planned, although some may  say,

and  some  already had said, that perhaps the  Government

has been cautious, not entrepreneurial enough in taking a

few   risks  and  whether  the  budget  deficit  is   the

inevitable  result of poorer revenue coming  out  from  a

poorer  economy  and  also from a  smaller  rise  in  GST

compared  to  the results that could have  been  computed

based  on  deliberate efforts to boost  the  economy  and

stimulate  businesses.  So there are some disappointments

in Budget 2003, one of course is the non-reduction of the

tax rates for corporate as well as for individuals.  Many

had  hoped  that there would be at least a one percentage

point  reduction in the rates, but I suppose those  hopes

were dashed on Budget day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I think the disappointment has

been  offset  by  some  real  concessions,  and  by   the

slaughtering  of  yet  more  sacred  cows.   One  is  the

exemption  from  tax  of  overseas  income  remitted   to

Singapore.   It  has  been  said  many  times  over  that

businesses have long lobbied for this concession but, for

a  long time, the tax authority has tenaciously clung  on

to  it,  and businesses have all but given up.  In  fact,

one  businessman said to me, "Good luck to  you  guys  in

trying to push this one through."  So, we guys got  lucky

this time round, because it got introduced in the Budget.

And, clearly, this is a bold step going forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exemption covers three areas - branch profits,

dividend  income and service income.  And we  would  also

ask the Finance Minister to kindly consider the exemption

of  interest  income  as  well,  since  we  have  already

introduced it for domestic interest income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This exemption is very important, because it really

narrows   the  gap  between  us  and  Hong  Kong.    When

businesses  consider the location of HQ  either  in  Hong

Kong  or  Singapore, the tax treatment of foreign sourced

income has always put

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>

Hong  Kong  in a much more superior position.   So,  this

exemption  closes the gap and I think we  deserve  a  big

tick   instead  of  a  little  cross  in  our  analytical

spreadsheet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will not only attract businesses to Singapore.

It will also heighten wealth management for the financial

services  industry and will also give the entrepreneurial

effort  a  big  boost as businesses go out of  Singapore.

What  is  more important to note here is, of course,  the

change   in  the  Government's  stance  of  not  allowing

exemption  because we want to prevent abuse.   There  was

some  worry  of  round-tripping,   transfer  pricing  and

denying  revenue.  So, it is heartening to note that  the

Government   has  abandoned  this  so-called  "punishment

mentality"  and  has  taken on a  much  more  enlightened

approach   of  embracing  a  much   broader   vision   of

globalisation,  rather  than  the  narrower   vision   of

preventing abuse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with this sacred cow, a lot of the other items

on   the  business  wish  list,  together  with  the  ERC

recommendations,  have also been  acceded  to.   The  ERC

comprises more than 1,000 people.  So, it is a tremendous

feat  to  go through the whole list of issues, ideas  and

recommendations.  I will record that as an achievement in

its own right.  Amongst the many recommendations, the ERC

seeks  to  see lower cost in doing business and  also  to

spur  the  efforts in entrepreneurship.  I am happy  that

both areas have been adequately addressed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One area is the CPF. The CPF comprises a major cost

component.   The decision to freeze the CPF  for  another

two years is very much welcomed by businesses, because it

provides  that amount of certainty in structuring  costs.

I  know CPF features very heavily in all aspects of   the

lives  of  Singaporeans.   It  is  not  just  about   the

retirement  nest-egg.   It  is about  the  stock  market,

property  market  and  it is about businesses.   So,  any

policy  decision on the CPF must be consistently applied,

so  that there is certainty and the Government should not

flinch in the face of pressure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1997, we faced the Asian economic crisis. The

Government reacted very well

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>

with a massive cut in the CPF.  That helped businesses  a

great  deal.   But it got restored quite quickly  at  the

first  hint of recovery.  And with hindsight,  we  wonder

whether  less haste should be applied because the  second

economic crisis came soon afterwards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also applaud the Government for taking all the

necessary   measures   to  support   and   to   encourage

entrepreneurship, and also the appointment of Mr  Raymond

Lim  as the Minister of State for Entrepreneurship.  This

is  really what "walking the talk" is all about.  This is

real  commitment.  This is sponsorship  at  a  very  high

level.   So,  businesses, both  new  and  old,  can  look

forward  to  working with Mr Lim who will be rooting  for

their cause, causing a mindset change, and also the swift

implementation  of  all the pro-business  measures  which

have been introduced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to talk about start-up costs, which

are  now allowed as a deduction against business revenue.

This  is clearly a step in the right direction.  This  is

what  business is all about.  You have got to spend  your

dollar  first  before you can earn a  dollar.   In  fact,

businessmen have always wondered why they cannot get  the

taxman  to  think in the same way as  them   -   to  view

business  transactions  in the  same  way  as  they  view

business  transactions.  So, this is a move in the  right

direction,  alignment  of  thinking,  alignment  of   how

businesses operate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of start-up costs, I wonder whether

the Finance Minister would also kindly consider extension

of  this concept to look at group relief as well  as  the

pioneer incentive scheme.  For group relief, again on the

entrepreneurship  drive,  whether  this  could  also   be

applied  to  the  losses  of  overseas  subsidiaries  and

whether  they  could  be  used  against  the  income   of

investors, both corporate as well as individuals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the pioneer incentive relief, it would also be

good if this could commence when businesses start to make

money  rather than when they commence business.  This  is

all in the concept of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>

start-ups,  that costs would necessarily be  incurred  in

order for businesses to make money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to move on to the specific tax

measures  which I consider progressive.   First,  on  the

Automatic   Writing  Down  Allowances  for   intellectual

property rights, and then on the Exemption of Withholding

Tax for Digitised Goods and Services.  We live in a world

that  is  powered  by  technology,  by  information,  and

together  with e-commerce, every aspect of our  lives  is

touched  by  an  interplay of these three  elements.   We

could  either resist it by instituting protectionist  tax

measures that would make our cost of business a lot  more

expensive in accessing the latest developments and really

make  ourselves much more efficient or we  could  embrace

change.   So,  I  am very happy in this regard  that  the

Government has chosen to embrace change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I applaud the measures taken to ease and to

encourage the ownership of intellectual property  rights,

because  in  an  e-commerce environment,  everything  and

anything  can  be  patented.   So,  by  encouraging   the

ownership  of  intellectual property rights,  we  have  a

fighting chance to spawn and to sponsor the Amazon.com of

the  world.  And here, our status is clearly raised as  a

hub  for intellectual property rights, because no  longer

do  businesses have to worry whether they will qualify or

whether  they will be favoured for writing down allowance

on a case-by-case basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exemption of withholding tax for digitised goods

and services is also a very farsighted move to really put

Singapore  businesses on the cutting edge of  technology.

Because  purchase of digitised goods and services becomes

part  of  life  these days.  Information  reports,  data,

analytical tools are all delivered electronically, and it

is  a  "must have" for businesses in order for businesses

to  be  effective  and  to be efficient.   So,  with  the

exemption of withholding tax, businesses can now have all

these "must haves" at affordable cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now also touch on Exemption from Withholding

Tax for Payments for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>

Cable  Capacity  as well as Writing Down  Allowances  for

Indefeasible  Rights of Use.  Again, in the international

communication capacity, this is such a key building block

to  our knowledge economy, and the world is getting  more

on-line, not less.  And it is good that we recognise  the

vast  benefits that our economy  can tap into the  widest

network  of  capacities,  because all the countries  have

already  done  it.  The UK, Australia,  New  Zealand  and

Ireland  have introduced fiscal measures to favour  their

operators.  So, if we do not do this quickly enough,  our

operators  will be competing in a world which is  heavily

stacked  against them.  We also benefit  because  we  are

able  to tap into the benefits of an on-line world, which

is already upon us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to conclude by saying that Budget 2003

really  paves  the  way for our businesses  to  be  truly

global.  We have to rise to this occasion.  Sure, we have

to  grapple with the economic problems which are right in

front  of  us,  but  there are also opportunities  abound

outside there.  So, this Budget recognises the importance

of  globalisation.   It  seeks  to  remove  some  of  the

obstacles in the way of businesses and it also  seeks  to

reward  those  businesses that overcome  these  problems.

So, it is now up to  businesses to progress from here and

also up to the Government officials to speedily implement

the pro-business measures that have been announced.

<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, in our pursuit of leisure and the good life, we must

not  only  raise  consumers' standard of living,  through

proper  management of the economic system,  but  more  in

line  with  a  young country's approach to  increase  the

collective national strength of our nation.  Our goal  is

to  ensure that the nation remains independent and  self-sufficient,  and not for the sake of being  materialistic

only   -   a self-defeating habit that we too often  fall

into.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent Budget, revealed by the DPM and Minister

for Finance, reflects the right path that our country  is

taking, especially

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>

in  the  light of a slowdown in the world economy  and  a

foreseeable difficult economic climate ahead.  The biased

slant  in  the Budget towards helping existing businesses

grow  and  encouraging more to take the step of  starting

new  businesses, will surely spur the economy towards the

path  of generating new income through goods and services

which,   in   turn,   would  then   generate   more   job

opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental purpose of any economy is to develop

the productive base of the country  -  the industries  no

matter where they may be, within the country or under the

control of the country's citizens around the world.  This

way,  economic development will mean having more  choices

for   the   people,  more  leisure,  more  wealth,   more

opportunities to pursue happiness, and society as a whole

will be successful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our experience in the past years has taught us a

dramatically  clear lesson that we must not  forget,  ie,

giving consumers too much and producers too little.   Our

wages  were rising too quickly while our businesses  were

battling  to make ends meet.  Easy credit over the  years

has  encouraged spending.  Consumerism got out  of  hand,

which was what happened during Japan's bubble economy  in

the  1980s,  leading  to  the eventual  collapse  of  the

economy in 1991 and 1992.  In Korea, the late 1980s  were

heady,  pro-consumer years.  The 1988 Seoul Olympics  did

for the country what the 1964 Tokyo Olympics had done for

Japan.   Anything  seemed possible.  By 1990,  the  trade

surplus  was  heading for the cellar, and the  government

had to fight back with a huge "anti-luxury" campaign.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, beyond all these economic cycles - and here I would like to assure Senior Minister of State

Khaw  Boon  Wan  -  the human spirit is still strong  and

resilient.   Singaporeans have more in mind than  getting

the  cheapest possible price and highest possible salary.

There are people who like to work hard and save and  make

sacrifices.  Even lottery winners, who typically  do  not

have  society's most desirable jobs, do keep  on  working

even

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>

after  having cashed in.  In fact, people who  own  small

businesses  behave  in a self-exploitative,  economically

irrational  way.  They typically work longer  hours  than

normal  employees and earn less money than they could  if

they sold their assets and invested the proceeds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This work culture must be preserved in order that

our economy continues to grow and help spur on the spirit

of  entrepreneurial drive in our people.  I am glad  that

this drive is getting strong support from the Government,

starting  from  our  education  system  right  up  to   a

committee  looking into entrepreneurship led by  Minister

of State, Mr Raymond Lim.  For a start, some cost-cutting

measures  have  been  adopted,  such  as  the  employers'

contribution to CPF being capped at 16% for  another  two

years,  property tax rebates and certain  rental  rebates

among  others.   Furthermore, a longer term  lowering  of

cost  for entrepreneurs includes certain exemptions  from

statutory  audits and the use of limited partnership  and

limited liability partnership structures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore moves towards a mature economy, it

becomes  harder to achieve growth based on  its  domestic

economy  which is constrained by the small  size  of  its

population.  Our economic interest must then be to extend

our  economic  boundary beyond our shores  to  the  world

markets.    When  this  happens,  our  national  economic

interest  is at threat as Singapore companies  will  move

their plants overseas to areas where labour and land  are

cheaper.   As  pointed  out by  Robert  Reich,  a  former

Secretary of Labour in the Clinton Administration in  his

book called "The Work of Nations", corporations had grown

past  the  point where they could be considered American,

German  or  Japanese.  With headquarters in one  country,

research  centres  in  another, factories  in  yet  other

countries,  and  customers  all  around  the  world,  big

diversified corporations could be loyal only to their own

economic interests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roger Porter, who was then President Bush's chief

domestic  policy  adviser in 1990, gave  a  speech  about

America's outlook on world trade.  Some people, he

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>

said, clung to the "old notion of nations, companies, and

markets  rigidly  defined by national borders".   But  in

this  modern  age, he concluded that such  a  notion  was

"outdated and dangerous".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to still benefit from the scenario, we must

continue  to  refine our tax laws in ways  that  will  be

attractive  for holding companies and their  headquarters

to  be  sited in Singapore.  The move to exempt from  tax

all  foreign  income  in the form  of  dividends,  branch

profits and services income from 1st June 2003 is a  good

example  in  making the case for local corporations  with

international operations to have its base in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The promotion of continuing training and retraining

of  Singapore workers as the economy restructures  itself

is  a  commendable  move  by  the  Government.   It  must

continue  even  when things get better.  As  an  example,

nursing, though a very important function in the  medical

profession,  has  not  been popular  among  Singaporeans.

However,  through good collaboration between the  private

hospitals  and training grants from the Government,  this

profession has now gained popularity as many educated and

mature  workers,  who  have been  displaced  due  to  the

restructuring  of the economy, are now  turning  to  this

job.   This  bold move is a far-reaching step with  great

implication for our economy, as corporations seek to move

towards  countries  that are more  educated  and  have  a

skilled labour force.  Another example which I would like

to   bring  to  Members'  attention  is  this.   Although

Chrysler  had its headquarters in Detroit and  Matsushita

was  based in Osaka, neither would necessarily care about

the government or labour force of its home country.  Each

would  go  wherever  the money, the market,  and  skilled

workforce drew it.  To quote Robert Reich again,  "In  an

age  of global corporations, a nation's well-being  rises

or falls with the skills of its workers".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with increasing the wealth of its citizens,

Singapore must be a place for present and future  wealthy

individuals  to  park their savings  and  assets.   These

individuals can be role models for budding

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>

entrepreneurs to emulate and overtake in wealth creation.

The  Budget  strives to achieve this.  Firstly,  interest

will  be  tax free in the hands of taxpayers irregardless

of  which financial institution is used and the amount of

money deposited.  Secondly, promoting the development  of

world-class  trustee and custodian services by  improving

the  tax environment for trusts.  However, Singapore will

still  find it difficult to compete with other  countries

if  it  does not address the tax laws relating to  estate

duty.   I  would  advocate that in developing  a  vibrant

trust industry, consideration should also be given to the

possibility  of  abolishing death duties.   Beneficiaries

will then have the incentive to reinvest their wealth  in

Singapore; thus, in turn, benefiting the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, for the present, capital

preservation must be foremost in the minds in a declining

economy.   This  is  a  time when most  corporations  and

individuals   face   a   mismatch  between   assets   and

liabilities.  In a period of growth, most businesses  and

individuals  are  less  concerned  if  their  liabilities

exceed  their  assets as capital appreciation  will  soon

reduce  the  gap  when their assets  increase  in  value.

However,  when the economy reverses downwards, businesses

and  individuals suffer from the deflationary effect  and

the  national economy will be pulled down as a result  of

debts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For individuals, most of their savings have been in

the  CPF.   Over  the good years, many have over-extended

their  housing  needs by utilising their CPF  savings  on

properties  or  properties which would have  declined  in

value  and,  in  some cases, below the  amount  of  their

mortgage.  The same applies to those who have invested in

declining equity markets.  The immediate response to such

circumstances  will  be  to  reduce  spending  and   lift

savings,  if  any.  When you get a greater  part  of  the

population  in  Singapore lifting  their  present  meagre

ratio  of savings to consumption, you will have  a  nasty

impact  on  demand and ultimately on the  health  of  the

corporate sector.  The size of the economy will shrink.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am happy to note that the Budget this year has

started  the  process  of managing  the  rising  cost  of

factors of production, mainly, the cost of land, which in

the  longer term will help businesses and individuals  to

be  prudent  and match better their assets against  their

liabilities.   When more businesses and  individuals  are

less  highly geared with assets greater than liabilities,

then  the  ratio between savings to consumption  will  be

more manageable and demand will rise again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore can

overcome  its  problems in restructuring its  economy  as

long  as  we  have political stability and  the  will  to

overcome  difficulties.  The ability  for  a  country  to

achieve a robust and vibrant economy need not necessarily

be  from  a  country  big and rich in resources  as  past

economic  theory shows.  In this digital world,  size  is

not  a  barrier  to achieving prosperity.   Intelligence,

education and training, a stable pro-business Government,

the  ability  to adapt to a changing environment  and  to

capture   opportunities  are  now  the  key  to  national

prosperity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a lot had been spoken by the 30 speakers

before  me.   I  will not belabour some of  the  positive

points  mentioned yesterday and today about  the  Budget,

but   will  instead  focus  on  what  I  believe  is  not

adequately  addressed  by  the  Budget  or  the  Remaking

Singapore  Committee.   These are ideas  that  should  be

considered  to  make Singapore a better society  for  the

longer term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, budget deficit versus budget surplus.

Overall,  this is a mildly acceptable budget.  There  are

no   surprises  and  no  big  deficit  planned  to   help

businesses and private individuals to tide over the  hard

times  ahead.  Maybe the Minister is planning for another

off-budget  deficit later in the year when things  really

get  tough.   If not, the Government will have  lost  its

moral  right  to  demand and plan for huge  surpluses  in

better years.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the point for citizens to allow the

Government  to accumulate huge reserves and surpluses  in

good  years, spend little of those surpluses in difficult

years,  and not give any report of the investment  return

on  the  accumulated surplus?  Nobody knows what  is  the

return  on  investment  or the yield  till  date  of  the

Government reserves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such figures were not disclosed. It will take many

thousand  man-years to compile, we were  told.   This  is

absurd.  The Government can be a lot more transparent  to

win the people's trust.  It can also be more generous  by

keeping  the  GST  at  4%  till  the  economy  has  fully

recovered.   The  Government has the political  clout  to

raise the GST if we ever get into a chronic deficit.  So,

let  us not worry too much about a chronic deficit  right

now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Ministers should lead by example to send a

strong signal to investors by cutting their own high wage

cost.   There is a lot of tweaking to the current  system

to  lower business cost.  However, such tweaking does not

solve the fundamental problem of high and non-competitive

business  cost.   Like the recommended  CPF  wage  freeze

proposed  for  workers, Government Ministers  and  senior

civil servants should take a similar 30% wage cut for two

years,  or  until the unemployment rate falls back  below

3%.   If  the  Government  solves the  high  unemployment

problem,  then  they deserve every right to  the  million

dollar  salary  and  should get a performance  bonus  for

that.  But until that happens, there is no basis for such

high  salary when unemployment is at a record high.   The

Government  Ministers should be more  automatic  in  this

matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like in the ERC Report, this will also send a strong

signal to all Singaporeans and foreign investors alike  - that  our  Government  leaders are  taking  the  personal

interest  to  decisively  reduce  high  wage  cost,   and

strengthen  Singapore's competitive  position.   It  will

also  help  a  bit  in  reducing the Government's  feared

chronic deficit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civil service employees and Government officials

have long enjoyed security

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>

of  employment.  Unlike workers from the private  sector,

they are less likely to be retrenched.  Even if they  are

retrenched,   like   recently,   they   get   very   good

retrenchment  benefits that so many actually  volunteered

to be retrenched.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since the 1994 salary revisions, the

compensation  for  the civil service has  reached  parity

with  the private sector.  Bonuses were paid without  the

same degree of rigorous benchmarking that is a feature of

the  commercial world.  They can get away with any honest

mistake, while a private sector CEO will immediately  get

the boot.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with an insecure and uncertain economy moving

forward,  the  stability  of careers  for  senior  public

sector  employees and Government officials  has  exceeded

parity.  In fact, they are better off than many people in

the  private sector.  They have high wages and  a  secure

income  stream.  This is not correct.  The Budget  failed

to address high civil service wage cost and this needs to

be corrected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the concept of retirement, jobs and the CPF.

I  am happy to hear that the Deputy Speaker, Mrs Lim Hwee

Hua,  is in common agreement with me that the concept  of

retirement needs to be corrected.  I will touch  on  more

of   it  at  the  coming  Committee  of  Supply  debates.

Meantime, I want to touch on the CPF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government restructured the CPF to focus on the

basic retirement needs of Singaporeans.  The question is:

can Singaporeans afford to retire in Singapore?  I do not

think  so.   With  such high cost and high  standards  of

living - after deducting medical and housing needs -  how

many  years  can the limited amount in the  CPF  last  an

employee?  If the majority of Singaporeans are not  going

to be able to retire with the limited savings in the CPF,

please  tell us so.  Stop kidding Singaporeans that  they

can   make  use  of  their  CPF  to  pull  through  their

retirement needs.  It is not enough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To all the Singaporeans out there, retirement is

only  for the rich and financially able.  If you  do  not

have money to buy food and pay bills, you will need to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>

work,  never mind that you have reached 65.  Even begging

is  a form of work, though non-productive and not allowed

in  Singapore.  This is the reality of life in Singapore.

If  you  do not have money, retirement is not an  option.

The  Government  is  not  going  to  take  care  of  you.

Retirement  is a luxury for the rich, and for  those  who

can afford to stay unemployed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So is job choosiness. If you are a responsible

person, with responsibility to fulfill and bills to  pay,

you  cannot be that choosy about the next job.   If  your

current  job is going to be gone, you will need to  start

hunting  for the next stockpile of cheese.  There  is  no

welfare  in  Singapore, so stop looking to the Government

for handouts.  They are not giving us any.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn new skills while you can - where funds are

currently provided by the Government.  Make good  use  of

it  and  do  not be resistant to change - for  change  is

going  to  be  a constant in our society.  Increase  your

knowledge,  for  knowledge increases our economic  value.

Be  gung-ho in trying out new ideas.  Who knows, you  may

be the next Olivia Lum in the making.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on my next point. The whole concept of CPF

savings for retirement also needs to be changed.  The ERC

Report  has  failed  to  address this  foundation  stone.

Maybe it is too hot for them to handle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compulsory CPF savings is good. It is a prudent

policy to enforce savings on good working days.  But what

happens  when things go bad and there are rainy days  for

months?   Before our citizens can retire to  enjoy  their

retirement  savings, they might have died  of  stress  or

hunger  due  to  lack of money and job.  So  let  us  not

begrudge what rightly belongs to our members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With certain safeguards and clear guidelines, the

Government should allow our citizens to borrow from their

own  CPF  savings for emergency and rainy days - to  tide

them  over their difficult period.  If members can borrow

from their own CPF to buy depreciating property and money

losing stocks, there is no reason why they

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>

are not allowed to borrow from their own CPF to buy their

next  meal or pay their next bill.  And when they  return

to  the job market, they can start to repay back the loan

amount  over an instalment period.  If members  can  take

private  bank loans, there is no reason why they are  not

allowed  to borrow from their own retirement savings  for

needy days.  This sacred cow needs to be slaughtered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, go beyond being a factory for others. 80%

of  our  exports are manufactured products.  We had  done

well  as a centre for manufacturing excellence.  The  sad

thing  is  that  little  of those  manufactured  products

belong  to Singaporeans.  We do not own the designs,  the

inventions or the brands.  Being efficient and productive

is  not  enough.  We must go beyond being a  factory  for

others.   We  need  to  be owners of  these  manufactured

products  and  brands.  If we just rely on upgrading  our

manufacturing with new technologies and capabilities,  we

will be heading for failure when other low cost countries

catch up with advanced technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to celebrate those businessmen who create

new  products, generate interest, create demands and make

good  profits along the way.  We, as a Singapore society,

must  generate new brands and repackage old products that

we  can  market to the whole world.  So, consumer brands,

like  Eu  Yan Sang, Osim, Tung Lok and BreadTalk must  be

celebrated, encouraged and expanded.  All these companies

have  one  common  thread.   They  have  the  ability  to

generate   a   new   marketable  brand   following   from

repackaging a stale old product.  There are  a  lot  more

lesser brands out there that can be helped to expand  and

grow regionally.  MTI and Spring Singapore can take on  a

more  strenuous  effort to identify and  give  them  more

personalised support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is stupid of us to expand overseas by building

factories and industrial parks alone.  Aim higher and get

others  to  work  by manufacturing for us.   We  need  to

generate   good  international  brand  names  with   good

products that citizens of the world are willing  to  sell

their pants - to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>

buy  from us.  That calls for good marketing and branding

-   something  that  is  very  important,  and  that  the

Government has failed to recognise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, to my last point on benefits of being a

Singapore   citizen.    Mr  Speaker,   Sir,   while   the

Government  seeks  to welcome international  talents  and

skilled workers to reinforce our limited pool, and  build

a  critical mass of talents to contribute to our economy,

we  need to show greater appreciation of our own citizens

and  offer them something more than what non-citizens  in

Singapore can get.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Membership must have its privileges. Singaporeans

must have greater privilege than non-citizens, so much so

that highly talented foreigners will queue up to sign  up

for  citizenship.  However, at the moment, the Government

seems  to  be  taking  the support  of  Singaporeans  for

granted.   Foreigners seem to be wooed with  red  carpet,

open  arms  and  good pay to come to work  in  Singapore.

Singaporeans, on the other hand, are getting  retrenched,

getting pay cut and told to lower their expectations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporeans complain to me that they only see

liability  in  being  a citizen.   There  is  no  visible

benefit.  They say they cannot vote because it is  always

a   walkover   in  their  constituencies.   They   cannot

participate  in policy making too because  the  Ministers

will  not  listen to them, ikan bilis.   They  feel  like

being forced to live in a five-star hotel with no say  in

how  the hotel is run, while struggling hard to make ends

meet.  They were told to lower their expectations because

the Government invites lower cost skilled foreign workers

and talents to come in and compete with them.  They asked

what are the benefits of citizenship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, for the male citizens, they need to give up 2

1/2 years of their prime youth to do National Service  to

defend  their  country.  On top of  that,  it  is  up  to

another  40 days a year, away from building their  career

to  do  reservist training.  Foreign talents and  foreign

workers  do not.  They enjoy the peace and security  that

Singapore men provide through offering

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>

National  Service  and  they  get  good  pay  along  with

building their careers.  No wonder many male Singaporeans

are   talking  about  migration  and  giving   up   their

citizenship if they have a choice.  Maybe they intend  to

come back as a foreign talent to work in Singapore, to be

better  appreciated by the Government,  and  without  the

liability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is something wrong here that

this  Government  has failed to address.   Membership  in

Singapore  must  have  its privileges.   Many  young  and

mobile  Singaporeans  are saying  that  there  is  little

privilege  and  more  liability, and  it  is  better  off

without.   This is not right and the Government needs  to

get  this  corrected.  There must be strong economic  and

social  reasons for Singaporeans to be proud to  want  to

remain as a Singapore citizen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic reason could be in the form of lower

tax  rate for working citizens, more so for male citizens

still  active in serving their NS liability.  The  social

reason could be the concept of what does Singapore  stand

for.   The US stands for freedom and opportunity.   China

stands  for  economic  progress.  India  stands  for  the

largest  democracy  in the world.   What  does  Singapore

stand  for?  Currently, most Singaporeans think  that  it

stands for PAP - poor also pay!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until we can identify and agree on what truly we

stand for as a society, we are not going to inspire pride

in  our  citizens.  To me, Singapore must  aim  to  be  a

symbol for vibrancy, originality and affluence.  It is an

ideal  end-state that talented mobile citizens  can  look

forward to and be inspired.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, these are the five

points  that are important ideas to make and help  remake

Singapore towards the next level of prosperity.   I  hope

the  Government can take up these points and expand  from

them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I would like to seek some

clarification from Mr Steve Chia.  Sir, he  mentioned  in

his  speech about what Singapore stands for and a lot  of

people

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>

complaining  about not being able to participate  in  the

elections  because  there was no  alternative  to  choose

from.   Does he agree that, despite all these complaints,

what  we  stand  for  and  without  the  opportunity   to

participate,  Singaporeans  themselves  should  do  their

part?  The basic thing is that you are born here, you are

citizens here, and you are masters of this land.  If  you

see  something wrong, does he not think that Singaporeans

who  complain  should participate to make it  right?   If

they  find  there is not sufficient Opposition to  choose

from  during the elections, then come forward to  support

our   position,  join  the  Opposition  party  and  offer

themselves as candidates.  Then you have a choice.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Low, that is not a clarification.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> rose ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not think you need to answer that.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

before  I  begin my speech, I would like to take  up  two

points that the NCMP Mr Steve Chia mentioned earlier.   I

am  actually quite surprised that he felt that the Budget

has no plans to help businesses and individuals.  I think

speaker after speaker, as well as the people outside this

House,  have spoken up about how the Budget aims to  help

businesses, create jobs and preserve jobs.  In fact,  Mrs

Fang  Ai  Lian,  NMP, has also mentioned about  the  many

benefits  that  this  Budget will produce  and  the  many

sacred  cows that the Budget has actually slaughtered  in

order to lay the foundation to revitalise the economy and

prepare the economy for the next phase of growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the issue of chronic deficit, I think

that  we need look no further than Hong Kong to see  what

the problems are if you actually work on a budget deficit

year after year.  Hong Kong now, for instance, instead of

reducing their income tax, has to increase the income tax

because of the chronic budget deficit.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>

And,  additionally, they are also thinking that they  may

have to impose GST to help them get over this issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards benefits of being a Singapore citizen, I

think  Mr  Steve Chia who is himself a Singapore  citizen

would  remember that he must have benefited from the  ERS

and  NSS,  as  well as the fact that NSmen  actually  get

extra  ERS  and NSS shares.  There is also obviously  the

upgrading benefit.  So I do not know why Singaporeans are

saying  that they do not get benefits.  In fact, when  we

go  to  the  constituency and do interim upgrading,  very

often, it is the permanent resident who says that he does

not  get the benefits and why only the Singapore citizens

actually get additional benefits.  So I think it is quite

obvious.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked what does Singapore stand for. I

think he has answered it himself.  He said that Singapore

should  be  a  city that stands for talent, vibrancy  and

affluence.   I think that is what Singapore is  and  many

people will not disagree with that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Budget 2003 has aptly been entitled

"Seizing  Opportunity in Uncertainty".  These  are  truly

momentous times facing us as a nation.  A recent piece by

Straits  Times journalist, Ms Chua Lee Hoong,  warned  of

the  danger  of failing to recognise that the  challenges

facing us are vastly different from the ones before.  The

same  day  that Ms Chua wrote her article in the  Straits

Times,  Streats  reported billionnaire,  Warren  Buffett,

issuing a warning of the damage that derivatives -  which

he  calls "financial weapons of mass destruction"- can do

to the global economy.  We are standing on the edge of  a

precipice,  with  a  coalition of  forces  conspiring  to

create a vastly different world order.  Greed - Enron and

World.com; malevolence - Iraq and the Al Qaeda  terrorist

network;  nuclear  brinkmanship -  North  Korea;  and  an

insatiable thirst for economic success - China  and  many

other developing countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget may be construed by some as a

disappointing  one,  because the hoped-for  tax  cuts  or

personal rebates did

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>

not materialise.  But, in truth, Budget 2003 is a holding

budget, helping us to take the first few steps towards  a

re-engineering of our social and economic DNA, so that we

can  better face the challenges of a different  and  more

unpredictable world ahead.  Fiscal demand boosters,  such

as  tax  cuts  or higher rebates, will not  be  effective

against  a backdrop of the Middle East war that  has,  in

some ways, already begun.  Even in the scenario that  war

does  not  break out, the UN debate has already polarised

the  world.  Therefore, we must not be seeking short-term

solutions to our longer-term problems, although there  is

also a need to hear the cries of the disenfranchised  and

less well-off.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that Hong Kong - like I said earlier - because of its dire fiscal position, has been forced to

raise  taxes, the first in nearly two decades, at a  time

when  the economic outlook is perhaps more grim  than  we

can  imagine.   Yet, we cannot gloat over  their  present

predicament,  because the resilience  of  the  Hong  Kong

people  is  legendary, and neither  must  we  forget  the

salivating prospect of Hong Kong being part of  the  vast

Pearl  River  Delta hinterland, one of  China's  economic

powerhouses.  If the SAR Administration can get their act

together,  they are well capable of overtaking us  again.

So,  the threat can come not only from newer competitors,

like  Tanjung  Pelapas  and  KLIA,  but  also  from   the

resurgence of older competitors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am by no means an ardent football fan, but many of

my office colleagues - and I am sure many hon. Members in

this House - are.  I liken this competitive threat to the

intense rivalry between top English Premier League teams,

Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Newcastle, each of

them  jostling for primacy.  Even if one of  these  teams

falters  in  one  season, it would be a  grave  error  to

ignore  that  team, and that is because the  pedigree  of

these top teams means that any one of them is capable  of

staging  a comeback and winning top honours.  The  brutal

realities of global competition are here to stay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now deal with some specific areas in the

budget.  Taking the line of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>

ERC Report, I wish to speak, first of all, about the long-term   structural  issues  focusing  on   the   perennial

favourites - SMEs, enterprise promotion and the  role  of

Government and Government-related organisations.  Then, I

wish  to  say  something  on refining  the  measures  for

alleviating the short-term pains of the current downturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, SMEs and enterprise promotion. While MNCs

have  been  assiduously courted, it has  been  recognised

that  the  domestic  enterprise sector  still  employs  a

comparatively  larger  number of  workers  than  the  MNC

sector,  but  lags significantly behind the  latter  and,

therefore, needs help.  The hurdles SMEs face  are  well-known, and have already received an airing in this House.

Lack   of   access  to  capital,  inefficiency   business

practices,  difficulty in attracting quality  staff  and,

most controversially, the threat of GLCs.  The budget has

introduced    many    welcome   measures    to    promote

entrepreneurship and help domestic enterprises.  There is

the   Pro-Enterprise  Panel  to  act  on  feedback   from

businessmen  on  Government rules  and  regulations  that

might  increase  business  cost  and  stifle  enterprise.

There  is  now even a rule about rules.  All  rules  will

have  a  5-year  shelf life and are renewable  only  upon

adequate justification.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in, these are laudable, wide-ranging and

comprehensive efforts by the Government.  But, as  in  so

many other things, the real test is in the implementation

of  these  programmes.   Yesterday,  the  newly-appointed

Minister  of  State for Entrepreneurship  noted  that  to

shift mindsets, the Government should, when dealing  with

businesses,  set  its default key at  "Yes"  rather  than

"No".  I am indeed pleased that the Minister of State has

made this commitment.  However, Sir, I believe that, very

often, whilst Ministers and top officials may have  their

default  buttons set at "Yes", this may  not  be  so  for

others down the line.  For the officers executing policy,

a    "Yes"    default   button   does   mean   additional

responsibilities, greater fuzziness and a higher risk  of

unintended outcomes - something antithetical to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>

the   historically  low-risk  tolerance  of   the   civil

servants.  But this is well worth the price.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the Minister of State to

remind  all  officials at all levels  of  Government  and

Government-related  organisations  who  deal   with   the

public, from the managers to the front-line officers,  to

re-set their default button to "Yes", so that a truly pro-enterprise  environment can develop, and entrepreneurship

can flourish unfettered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my parliamentary colleague, Mr Leong Horn Kee,

mentioned NUTS in his speech yesterday.  Credit for  this

phrase should also go to our doyen of Creativity, Mr  Sim

Wong Hoo, who wrote the book Chaotic Thoughts for the New

Millennium.  In it, he described various situations  when

the  "No" default button characteristic of people with  a

NUTS  mentality drove him nuts!  Let me read one  out  to

you:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When our corporate headquarters were completed in

1997, we needed to give it a name.  The placeholder  name

was Creative Technology Centre.  Made sense, but it was a

boring name that everybody had.  I wanted a special name,

because  we  are  'creative'.  So the usual  names  like,

'Creative  Building,  Plaza,  Complex,  House  ...'  were

suggested  on  the name list.  I rejected  all  of  them.

Finally,  we  came out with a very good  name,  'Creative

Resource'  - the source of all creativity - and everybody

loved it.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But wait, before we could go ahead, we had to submit

the building name for approval.  What!  I was shocked.  I

needed  somebody else's approval for the name of  my  own

building  by some faceless committee that I did not  even

know existed.  Imagine having the name of your baby being

approved by somebody you do not know.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, that is the regulation. OK, we submitted and

no  prize for guessing the right answer.  The answer  was

NO.   The reason given was that the name was not 'Centre,

Plaza, Building, Complex, House, etc ...

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was actually a list of approved names in the

rulebook  and we were only given the impression  that  we

could name our own building.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I nearly jumped through the roof when I heard the

answer.   It was a very typical case of NUTS.  'Resource'

was  not in their rulebook, hence the standard answer was

NO.   I  was not going to give up on this, right?  So  we

fought back and wrote letters to appeal.  Finally,  after

a long process, our name was approved."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure hon. Members of this House will smile

at this incident, but

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>

setting our civil service default button to "Yes"  across

all levels will be a challenge to very established habits

of  mind,  but something we must not let up  on.   And  I

suppose  that  is  the  reason why this  issue  has  been

brought up year after year in this House.  But I am  more

optimistic this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many SMEs have also complained of the need to deal

with  an  inordinately  large  number  of  agencies  when

applying for various schemes.  The establishment  of  SME

First  Stop, which is a call centre set up by  SPRING  to

act  as a bridge connecting SMEs to the various agencies,

has  alleviated  the problem.  However, further  feedback

from  SMEs  is  that it will be better if the  First-Stop

becomes a One-Stop.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPRING could be the one-stop centralised

coordinating agency charged to deal with all, or at least

most,  issues  faced by SMEs.  This would further  reduce

the  current  labyrinth of agencies and  conditions  that

SMEs  have to navigate before they can get help for their

business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, one could argue that entrepreneurs must

make the effort to seek assistance, and should not expect

everything on a platter.  But there is a Cantonese saying

that  best sums up the spirit of what I want to say here,

and  I  hope the Minister for Education and the  Minister

for Information, Communications and the Arts will forgive

this  lapse.  The Cantonese saying is: "Pong yan pong  do

tai,  song  fa  song do sei", which means  that  when  we

render  help, we should go the distance and complete  the

task.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Minister of State for Entrepreneurship

himself noted that countries like Taiwan and Hong Kong do

help their entrepreneurs by creating the right conditions

for  start-ups,  and  even those in  Silicon  Valley  are

indirectly assisted by the high defence spending  in  the

area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another pressing issue which Budget 2003 has not

adequately  addressed  is access to affordable  financing

for  SMEs, especially start-ups.  Although the Government

has, over the years, made available

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>

various financial assistance schemes for SMEs, there  are

still  persistent  complaints about the accessibility  to

capital  and low cost financing.  Again, the Minister  of

State,  Mr Raymond Lim, had noted in his speech that  the

Government  will  not "throw money at the  problem".   He

said that it is like having an ATM machine, in which  you

key in the word 'entrepreneurs" and out comes a stash  of

cash.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His analogy reminds me of my eldest daughter when

she  was  a 2-year old.  When I told her on one  occasion

that  I  did  not have the money to buy her the  toy  she

desired, she told me that I could just go to the  machine

on  the wall and press the buttons for cash!  In reality,

most  businessmen, unlike children, know that  they  will

have  to deposit some cash into the bank before they  can

withdraw the money. The philosophy that there is no  free

lunch has been touted often enough, and most are under no

illusion  that the Government will easily throw money  at

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these SMEs are appealing that there be a

wider  spectrum  of financing options made  available  to

them and that the conditions for obtaining such loans are

not  made  unnecessarily onerous.  Many SMEs,  especially

start-ups, find it difficult to meet the requirements  of

a  secure  collateral,  track record  and  minimum  self-financing that are needed before any loan can be extended

by  the banks.  Additionally, on the side of the lenders,

the  knowledge  required to assess the viability  of  SME

business  proposals  by banks, or even  SPRING  Singapore

officials,  may  also be lacking.   To  this  end,  I  am

proposing  that  perhaps a committee comprising  industry

practitioners could be set up to assess such loans, where

the  industry  knowledge is lacking on the  part  of  the

lenders, particularly SPRING and other Government-related

organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To alleviate this problem, there have also been

suggestions,  ranging from setting  up  a  SME  Bank,  to

extending  the  Start-up  Enterprise  Development  Scheme

(SEEDS)   which  is  administered  by  EDB  to   domestic

enterprise.   Other  suggestions include  allowing  fully

paid-up HDB flats to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>

be  used as security for business loans, setting up of  a

private  equity  exchange, encouraging local  enterprises

and   GLCs  to  provide  venture  capital  to  SMEs,  and

promoting the establishment of a SME credit bureau.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the newly-appointed Minister of

State   for  Entrepreneurship  to  look  seriously   into

implementing   at   least   some   of   these   financing

alternatives as soon as possible, as access  to  low-cost

financing  is the lifeblood of business.  SMEs  will  not

grow, no matter how many SME-friendly measures are put in

place, without the lifeblood that is needed to keep  them

alive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point relates to the role of Government

and  Government-related organisations.  Related  to  this

whole  issue  of SMEs is the influence of Government  and

Government-related organisations.  The common grouse  is,

of  course,  that GLCs crowd out the private sector,  and

this  has  been the subject of vigorous debate  over  the

motion on the Temasek Charter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wholeheartedly support the Government's move as

announced  in Budget 2003 to, among others, progressively

stop  providing  services that  the  private  sector  can

supply, and review all Government-related companies every

three years.  In fact, I think many of these measures are

long  overdue, judging by the calls and appeals that  had

been persistently made in the past, even in this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some TLCs have added a multiplicity of businesses

that  it  seems incongruous to outsiders.  For  instance,

what  business does PSB Corp now have in running  courses

when  there are so many private education firms that  can

do  them?   By  the same token, why is HDBay involved  in

providing  interior designing services and developing  e-commerce  applications when there  are  already  so  many

existing  interior design firms competing  for  the  same

pie?   If errant renovation contractors were the problem,

then  the HDB's role should at most be one of accrediting

renovation contractors.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Ministries and statutory boards therefore

to  limit  the  scope of the activities  of  agencies  or

companies they spawn.  Such agencies or companies should,

unless  they  are of a strategic nature or operate  in  a

sphere  where  the  private sector is deemed  not  ready,

confine  themselves  to policy and  promotion,  and  also

champion the involvement of the private sector to  supply

services  to realise its core mission.  For example,  the

proposed  statutory  board for Continuing  Education  and

Training,  which  I  fully  endorse,  should  as  far  as

possible  outsource the courses it plans rather than  try

to  do  them itself.  The IDA and several other  agencies

recently issued a call for business collaboration to  the

private  sector  to  co-develop new business  models  for

location-based  services based  on  Government  data.   I

think  this  is an excellent example of how  the  private

sector can work with the public sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the recent appointment by SLA of a real

estate  agent  to sell their property at  Tiong  Bahru  - unfortunately  it is not my firm - at what  was  an  eye-popping fee, demonstrates just how much cost savings  can

be  achieved  when  the Ministries and  statutory  boards

assiduously   seek   private-sector   participation    in

implementing  its  policies.  Such  moves  would  further

facilitate  entrepreneurship and the growth of  Singapore

companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, services sector. The Government's

acceptance  of  the  ERC's recommendation  to  set  up  a

Ministerial  Committee on Services to be chaired  by  the

Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance is  an

excellent step forward to grow the services sector  which

hitherto   has   largely  remained  the  step-sister   of

manufacturing.  However, several key issues still need to

be resolved if we are to grow our services sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost is the issue of adequate and

appropriate  manpower.  The service delivery standard  of

many  frontline workers in these services sector are also

less than satisfactory, such as in the retail industry.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of the Retail Academy of

Singapore,   spearheaded  by  the  Singapore   Retalier's

Association, is a one-stop place to raise the quality  of

our  retail staff to world-class standard and this  is  a

positive step in the right direction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, perhaps through the soon-to-be

established  statutory  board on CET,  should  look  into

training  and  job enhancement schemes  for  the  various

services  sector, including nursing assistants, cleaners,

waiters, chambermaids and waste collectors, to help these

jobs gain greater acceptance as well as raise the service

standards of such jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some cleaning and waste collection companies I know

of  have  often complained about their manpower problems.

They  say that it is very common for Singaporeans to pack

up  and leave their jobs after three days, unable to take

what they deem as the harsh and unpleasant conditions  of

the job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our retail sales staff are, for instance, famous for

their  one-liner answers such as "All here already, lah!"

when  you ask them if the product is available in another

colour  or  size.   One  also  wonders  why  it   is   so

coincidental that none of the waiters or waitresses at  a

restaurant is looking at your direction when you want  to

ask someone for help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another major issue that should be tackled is the

removal of regulatory impediments that stifle the  growth

of  the  services sector.  For instance, while we  remain

unable  to  secure  adequate  numbers  of  trained  local

workers for, say, the spa industry which we are trying to

promote, we should be open to relaxing our foreign worker

policies for such sectors. After all, as the Minister for

Trade  and Industry often put forth as justification  for

the presence of foreign workers, they help to ensure that

these  businesses remain viable and thus  along  the  way

also create jobs for our locals which would otherwise not

be available.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, alleviating short-term pains. The Budget

does have some goodies for the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>

ordinary  Singaporeans  -  rent  and  conservancy  charge

rebates,  property tax rebates, the ERS  shares  to  help

offset the impact of the GST hike.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Government to continue to move

towards  a more focused and perhaps community-based  help

system.   A  one-size-fits-all  approach  does  not  work

because  aid  does  not  go  where  it  is  most  needed.

Spreading  wealth like distribution of  ERS  shares  when

there  are  surpluses or during times of strong  economic

growth  is  acceptable,  but in the  new  economy,  where

income  spread  will  widen, it is  more  appropriate  to

render  help  where help is more sorely  needed.   It  is

therefore  very  reassuring  to  hear  the  Minister  for

Finance  say  that  the Government will  concentrate  its

social  safety  nets on the minority of Singaporeans  who

need  them  most. This will ensure that the help  reaches

the  neediest Singaporeans without undermining  our  work

ethic  and  culture of self-reliance.  It is  a  delicate

balance, but one which I judge could be finally met  with

this statement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, as structural unemployment becomes a

norm rather than an exception, the Government should  put

in  place  measures  to  help  this  group  of  displaced

workers.   Whilst  we do not want to encourage  a  crutch

mentality, the reality is that structural unemployment is

likely  to  become  the  norm,  there  would  always   be

retrenched  workers who desperately need help until  they

find the next job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, an interim financial package akin to the EDRS

but  with  more clearly defined and stringent  conditions

could  be set up to grant short-term financial assistance

to those who are really in need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Premier Zhu Rongji, in his farewell address to the

National People's Congress, spoke on public servants  who

uphold  the  law and truly serve the public  -  combining

aggressive pursuit of economic growth with compassion for

the laggards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newspapers quoted him as saying, "Government

officials at all levels should

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>

go  to  the  people  in their neighbourhoods  and  homes,

listen  to  their  views, care about their  hardship  and

promptly attend to their grievances."  Indeed, this is  a

challenge  well-worth taking up for the   Government  and

Members of this House, including myself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, despite the apparent "tameness",

this  Budget is, in reality, a watershed Budget.  I  also

see  this  Budget  as  a work-in-progress  of  the  ERC's

recommendations  for  Singapore's long-term  growth.   It

makes  an  unequivocal  call  for  the  Ministries,   the

statutory  boards and the public sector to  change  their

practices  where  they hinder private sector  enterprise.

As  DPM Lee noted, "In Singapore, an entrepreneurial  and

innovative  civil  service  bureaucracy  must  not  be  a

contradiction  in  terms."  Indeed, many  of  the  policy

changes  announced  in Budget 2003, such  as  the  Yellow

Pages rule and public sector market testing, require  the

Government and Government-linked organisations to  change

their  mindsets  and venture out of their  comfort  zone.

Without minimising the importance of doing so, let us not

brush  aside the wrenching adjustments this will  require

of the civil service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I see this as the start of a journey to reform

Government  thinking. We may be far from the destination,

but  it is at least a good start. At the same time,  this

must  be  matched by a national movement for Singaporeans

to  discard  a crutch mentality of wanting handouts,  and

instead  be more adventurous, more daring, more  tolerant

of  failure,  and  more resilient amidst  the  storms  of

adversity.   At the grassroots level, often  we  see  the

handout  mentality manifesting itself, especially  during

these  challenging times, but I have every reason  to  be

hopeful  that  the mindsets and the constitution  of  our

people, especially the young, are changing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daily press nowadays have regular ventures of

young Singaporeans who break traditional moulds and  have

chosen to chart their own destinies.  Like Alison Ng, the

graduate  "gao  luk"  seller  or  the  two  NTU  graduate

porridge sellers, as well as many others like Eugene  Low

of Hardware Zone and the four 28-year-old

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>

NAFA  graduates, who despite all the problems  they  face

with starting a business, have made their shop "Fourskin"

at Heeren selling T-shirts a success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Singaporeans are living proof that not all are

waiting  for handouts from the Government and are willing

to  embrace  wholeheartedly the virtues of diligence  and

enterprise.  In fact, the current adversity we are facing

may in the end turn out to be a blessing in disguise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the not too distant future, when historians

document this phase of our development, they may well dub

it  as  a  baptism  of  fire, not just  for  the  younger

Ministers but for Singaporeans as a whole, especially the

young, and equipping them for the many challenges ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need everybody on board the ship to not only work

together but in the right place and doing the right thing

in  order to continue to successfully steer and sail  the

ship.   This  in effect is what the ERC's recommendations

and Budget 2003 have laid the ground for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with this, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, I have three points

of  clarification.  First, with regard to  the  criticism

that  there  are  no plans to help business  and  private

individuals,  I think the MP for Hong Kah has  failed  to

listen to my speech carefully.  I said that there was  no

big   deficit   plan   to  help  business   and   private

individuals, and not that nothing was planned. The second

point  is  with  regard to chronic deficit.   Is  the  MP

telling  us that the Government is not going to  increase

GST  when there is a series of deficits in the future  to

recover when the economy recovers?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The second one is not a clarification.

It is a question.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> The third point is that

the  MP  can  disagree  with my comments  but  these  are

comments from the citizens that are reflected to me,  and

I am reflecting the concerns of the citizens.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>

The  MP can disagree with that.  I have no problems  with

that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Nobody is saying that you have problems

with that.  Dr Ong Seh Hong.

<br>1.25 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank

you  for  allowing  me  to participate  in  this  debate.

Before I make my speech, I would like to take on a couple

of  issues on what NCMP Mr Steve Chia has said.  He  said

that the Government is actually kidding Singaporeans that

they  can  retire comfortably with their CPF savings.   I

would  like to bring to his attention pages 98 and 99  of

the  ERC Report on refocusing of the CPF system.  DPM and

Finance  Minister has also stated in this House that  CPF

would  be  refocused on the basic financial, housing  and

medical needs for retirement.  Also in the ERC Report, it

is  clearly stated that, since its introduction in  1955,

the  CPF system is a sound framework for Singaporeans  to

save  for  their  own retirement, reflecting  our  strong

emphasis on individual responsibility.  It is our  belief

that  everyone  has  to take his own  responsibility  for

retirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he commented that the Singapore Government did

not  promote  or  create any Singapore brand.   In  fact,

Singapore  itself is already a brand internationally  and

this  is  the hard work of a clean, capable and efficient

Government led by PAP in the past four decades.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to take issue with his comments on

having a chronic deficit.  Is he not aware that if we run

a  chronic deficit, as the hon. Member, Amy Khor has also

mentioned,  we may end up in a situation like Hong  Kong?

Worse  still, our Singapore dollar will also be  weakened

and  it  will  affect the savings of our CPF members  and

thus the long-term retirement nest-egg of our citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also made the comment that PAP stands for "Poor

Also  Pays" which I differ.  Look at the rebates we  have

given,  all the assistance schemes given by the CDCs  and

all the Government agencies to help the less fortunate in

society to tide them

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>

over  the  hard times.  Are they not assistance  for  our

poor and needy?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from what Mr Steve Chia has

commented  from  his  dialogue with  some  residents  and

grassroots and from reports in the newspapers, I see that

quite a number of Singaporeans are still complaining that

there are not enough goodies in this year's Budget.  They

want more and more handouts, like what Mr Steve Chia  has

just suggested, from the Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to

clarify.   I never said "handout".  I said that we  ought

to  tell  Singaporeans not to look to the Government  for

handouts  or support or help, because they are not  going

to get any.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong:</b> They want more and more handouts

from the Government even though many of them are employed

in  this  difficult time.  I am very worried  about  this

trend,  Mr  Speaker, Sir.  I am worried that Singaporeans

have   failed   to  see  the  impact  of   the   economic

restructuring we are going through. They might  not  have

seen  that  in  the  new economy.   There  will  be  some

Singaporeans   who   may   actually   become    long-term

unemployed. There will not be any lifelong employment  in

Singapore  and  every Singaporean has to expect  frequent

changes in job to stay gainfully employed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to survive and to succeed, I think

the Singapore society as a whole must cultivate a mindset

change and to develop a culture that embraces change as a

way of life.  As the Chinese saying goes, "qiong ze bian,

bian  ze tong", which means when we are caught in extreme

circumstances, we must change and only change will  bring

about relief.  This Budget policy has painted the changes

we  are  expecting  ahead.  So it is now  for  us  -  the

people,  the  Government, the unions, the  companies  and

everyone  who has a stake in Singapore - to pull together

and face these changes together.  However, much has still

to  be  done  to  bring  about this mindset  and  culture

change.  We have probably been cushioned too well in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>

comfy  zone and somehow we have this mentality of waiting

for  the Government to do everything for us.  Maybe  that

is  like  what  the hon. Member Mr Ong  Ah  Heng  quipped

yesterday that we have a er shi si xiao government, ie, a

Government that looks after everything.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans must grow up, like a teenager growing

into  an adult and getting out of the parental house  and

becoming more independent and self-reliant.  The  signals

are  there for Singaporeans to see - changes in CPF, bank

originated loans for HDB, removal of restrictions on  car

loans,  relaxation of CPF investments and so  on  and  so

forth.   All these carry a similar underlying  message  - Singaporeans  have to make their own decisions  and  take

their  own  risks.   However, from the  way  people  have

rushed to take up bank originated loans to buy cars, I do

not  know whether they have realised the significance  of

the  impending changes.  To adapt to the changes, all  of

us  must learn to be flexible, nimble, quick to act in  a

crisis, and responsive.  We must always be positive if we

want  to succeed in an environment of changes and to have

the confidence to overcome difficulties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, when we encourage our people to

embrace changes, we ourselves must also be mindful of the

constant  stress level that our people would  go  through

with these changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human beings are by nature not fond of frequent

changes,  whether in their environment or  circumstances,

because  change means uncertainty.  Uncertainty  makes  a

person worry.  Even for the employed, in the new economy,

they probably have to go through many transitions of jobs

and during these transitions they would also have to look

for  some means to look after themselves while in-between

these  jobs.   So these are things that we will  have  to

understand and do something to help our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know of a lady in her 50s who has worked in

SingTel  for  about  30 years.  She  was  always  in  the

Customer Services Department.  However, the call centre

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>

handling  residential accounts was relocated to  Malacca.

She  has been transferred to another department to handle

commercial billing.  She told me that she was only  given

4  days  to  train  and  2 days of  orientation  and  was

expected  to handle a different job scope.  Such  is  the

speed  of  change and the adaptations we must  face.   Of

course, she feels stressed with these changes but  anyway

she was lucky to still keep a job to go to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After restructuring the economy, we would probably

expect  a  small  group  of  Singaporeans  who  would  be

structurally  unemployed, not through  their  own  doing.

They might go for training and retraining and still could

not  get a job.  Maybe they are not up to par for the job

or  there  is  just no job for them.   It  is  a  correct

approach  that we should not give free handouts to  these

people  as  otherwise we may probably degenerate  into  a

welfare  state  and perpetuate the cycle  of  dependence.

So, how?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe, for this group of people, we should encourage

them  to venture into some small businesses and services,

a  kind  of  "cottage service industry",  providing  some

domestic help, repair or delivery work.  However, we must

have  the legislation to help them keep the cost of doing

business  to the very minimal.  For a start, for example,

maybe we should relax further by allowing them to use HDB

flats   to   register  their  business.   Currently,   my

understanding is that a HDB flat is only allowed for some

IT-related  business  and to get approval  you  are  also

subject  to IDA support, and so on and so forth.   So  we

may  have to do something to relax this and to help these

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of my grassroots people also suggested that to

help  this  group of people get started, some small,  low

interest  or  interest-free loan, may be  given  to  them

through  some  self-help groups or CDCs in order  to  get

them  started.   This equivalent to some sort  of  "semi-informal sector" will help to create some jobs and income

opportunities for some of these people who may be out  of

job or not able

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>

to get jobs.  And we should not forget that even Bengawan

Solo, a successful confectionery and kueh maker, had  its

humble beginning in a HDB kitchen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This call for a change and flexibility of our rules

and the civil service has been much alluded to by many of

my  other parliamentary colleagues here, and I should not

go  further.  Mr Speaker, Sir, here I would like to  link

it   to   the   role  of  the  Government  in   promoting

entrepreneurship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like many of the other Members here, I am very

encouraged by the appointment of the Minister of State in

charge  of entrepreneurship.  I agree with what  he  said

that  the  job of the Government is to create an enabling

environment for entrepreneurs to emerge and grow and  let

a  thousand  flowers bloom.  But we must  do  this  fast.

Speed is the essence if we want to succeed.  I would urge

that  the  Government  expedite its  review  of  all  the

statutory requirements and regulations of doing  business

here  and to make it less restrictive and easier to start

up  business.  One example that comes to my mind  is  the

change  of use of HDB shop space.  I notice that in  Hong

Kong  and Taiwan, if a business does not do well,  within

24  hours you can see that the owner will change the shop

front  and  start a completely different trade.   But  in

Singapore, the change of use usually requires a lot  more

work and application.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rigid mindset of "do only if the rules permit"

is pervasive and is very bad for us.  It also affects the

operation   of   work  even  at  the  grassroots   level.

Recently, my Constituency Sports Club wanted to  organise

a   basketball  tournament  and  they  were  creative  or

innovative  enough  to  suggest that  they  want  to  get

sponsors  to put up advertisements on the banners  around

the  basketball  courts.  I said, "Good, brilliant  idea.

Why  not  go and do it?"  But I was taken aback when  the

Chairman of the CSC suddenly asked me, "Do PA rules allow

us  to  do that?"  I think everything that we have to  go

back to the rule book is something like the NUTS syndrome

that  was  alluded to by Amy Khor just now.  I  think  we

should

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>

encourage  more entrepreneurs.  We should  actually  move

away from this checking the rule book mentality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the funding of entrepreneurs and local

enterprises.   It is good to see that the Government  has

actually put in various schemes through SPRING,  IES,  to

help  Singapore  companies to venture out.  But  we  must

review the way they are being given out and administered.

In this area, more flexibility and more customer-friendly

approach  have  to  be  adopted.   I  will  give  another

example.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grassroots leader of mine told me that he went to

the  Philippines to bid for a contract to build  cellular

phone  antenna  stations.  He told  me  that  there  were

another  three  Singaporean  firms  competing  with  him,

including  a  listed  company.   Eventually  he  got  the

contract,   even  though  he  said  that  he   made   the

presentation  wearing a T-shirt while  the  other  people

were wearing suits.  I asked him how did he make it.   He

said he was able to do it, and he used Hokkien to say it,

by  "boo kia pang piow, boo kia char tan".  Basically, he

had  a very gung-ho mentality.  He was not afraid of  the

bombs and kidnappings there.  He also managed to keep his

overheads   low   by  hiring  locals  compared   to   his

competitors who used Singaporeans who had to fly there  3

to  4  times  at 3 to 4 times the cost and they  have  to

check  into a hotel.  But he said that when his  business

expanded  and he needed to get some help, he  was  turned

down  by  TDB for the simple reason that his company  was

registered  in the Philippines and not in  Singapore.   I

thought in this sort of situation, our agency, even if it

cannot give the grant, should point out the road and help

them  by  providing a one-stop customer service  to  tell

them  how they can navigate through the system and  where

are  the  other fundings that are available.  If  we  are

able  to help these people to spread their wings  to  the

region  or  internationally, in return, they will  plough

some benefits back to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that this policy statement has signalled that

these  mindset changes will be there and hope that  these

changes will happen sooner rather than later.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I would like to touch upon, Mr

Speaker, Sir, is on the concept of retirement.  This  has

been  alluded  to  by  the  hon.  Member  Lim  Hwee   Hua

yesterday,  and  I  support her  view  that  in  the  new

economy,  the concept of a pre-determined retirement  age

is  probably no longer relevant.  I think we  should  let

everyone  have a greater say.  If you want  to  encourage

self-reliant and self-independent Singaporeans we  should

allow  them  to have a greater say in when they  want  to

stop  work  and, at the same time, we will let them  take

care  of  themselves, financially or otherwise.   So,  we

need  to  rethink  this  idea of a legally  defined  pre-determined retirement age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With better healthcare and social conditions we are

living  longer  and  healthier.  To  condemn  a  healthy,

energetic  62-year-old man to his home  or  spending  his

time  on  the  golf course is probably a waste  of  human

capital.   We should make better use of them  because  we

already  have  scarce  human  resources.   We  must  also

understand that chronological age is no indication  of  a

person's physiological and mental health.  The concept of

setting a retirement age actually contradicts our move to

make  Singaporeans  to be more independent  and  to  take

charge of their own destiny.  By removing the concept  of

retirement age, we can encourage Singaporeans to plan for

themselves  financially, psychologically and emotionally.

And this is definitely a right signal sent to our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, of course, together with this change of

retirement age, we need to re-orientate the employers and

employees  towards,  for example,  redesigning  the  work

environment, the job, redefining the work,  and  for  the

employees to be able to accept reduced working  hours  or

some  sort  of flexible working arrangement if  they  are

going  to  work beyond a certain age.  The  advantage  of

hiring  older workers is manifold and I am not  going  to

elaborate here.  For Singapore, it will also give us  the

added  advantage  of reduced reliance on foreign  workers

and  we  are able to keep our citizens gainfully employed

longer,  promote their independence, dignity, confidence,

self-worth and reduce

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>

their  dependence on the State for financial,  social  or

medical needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to manage these changes ahead calls

for  the  cohesion of the people and the  wisdom  of  our

leaders.  If not managed properly, there would be  a  lot

of  resentment  and it is a fertile ground for  extremist

views.    History  has  shown  that  difficult   economic

situations  have  often  led to profound  changes.   When

confronted  with  economic hardship,  the  social  fabric

woven into the society can be undone very quickly.  So we

need  to be very vigilant over such potential threats  to

our  society.   This is especially so for a young  nation

like Singapore.  For example, the depression in 1929 sent

the German economy into extreme slump.  The German people

immediately began to blame the government for  the  state

of  affairs.   They  were  then willing  to  buy  in  any

political  party  that promised them changes,  especially

the  extremist  parties.  The rest was history,  and  how

Hitler  came  into power.  Sir, this is a gloomy  picture

and  I  do  not  think the likelihood of it happening  in

Singapore  is  high, but we have to  be  mindful  of  the

divide  that  economic  uncertainty  can  bring  to   our

society.  In any case, this is a whole new world order we

are  seeing  now.  All of us have to pull together  as  a

united people behind the strong and capable Government to

sail  through  this  rough sea, as we  modify  the  ship,

because there is no safe harbour for us to park our  ship

and rebuild.  But, in the end, I believe we will emerge a

stronger nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development and Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development and Minister for Defence (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, the public finally got a

glimpse  of  the  long awaited Economic Review  Committee

Report.   Adorning  the  cover  of  the  Report  is   the

beautiful  and resplendent "Esplanade".  I  have  a  copy

here.   I like the cover.  This is, to me, an interesting

parallel.   When  I saw the cover and  when  I  read  the

Report, I thought the parallel was even more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>

appropriate.  The ERC Report provoked many reactions, the

same kind of reactions as the Esplanade.  Most people did

not  fall  in  love with the Esplanade  at  first  sight.

Indeed, when the idea was conceived years ago, when  many

of  us  saw  the  pictures  and the  models,  there  were

scathing comments.  However, over time, most of  us  have

fallen in love with our magnificent Durian.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reactions to the ERC Report were also

mixed.   Different  people saw different  things  in  the

Report.  Employers found relief in the non-restoration of

the  CPF.   Investors were encouraged  by  the  long-term

direction  of low taxes and cost.  Workers were reassured

that they will be given a helping hand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, it is equally true that many on the

ground,  including many MPs in this House like  Dr  Wang,

were clearly disappointed.  Ignatius Low and Soh Wen  Lin

of the Straits Times wrote on 8th February that many felt

the  ERC  "blew a unique chance to rebuild  the  system."

Mano  Sabnani wrote in the Weekend Today on 8th  February

that his friends thought the "visions and strategies were

not  all new."  They were old stuff.  Indeed, many of the

ideas have been around for some time.  But the difference

between  then and now is that a collection of  ideas  has

now become a set of Government policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do people react so differently to the ideas in

the  ERC  Report?   In part, because it is  a  voluminous

report.  After all, it is the product of 1,200 man-years.

In  part, because everybody was looking out for their own

little  niches, their own little ideas, their own  little

suggestions.  When their ideas were there, their reaction

was, like Dr Wang said, "It was an old idea; in any case,

it  was  my idea."  When their ideas were not there,  the

reaction  was, "The Government didn't look  deep  enough.

It  was  a  waste of time and resources."  Just like  the

Esplanade, Sir, each one of us sees a different facade of

the  monumental ERC Report and passed judgment.  How then

should we read the Report?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to illustrate this point, I want to bring you

on a journey to China, to a place call Jiang Xi (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) where there is a famous mountain called Lu Shan ( ). Tourists and scholars flock there by the thousands -

in fact, millions - to unravel the poem of one of China's

most famous poets, and his name is Su Shi (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;).

Singaporeans will probably know him as Su Dong Po (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). The title of the poem is Ti Xi Lin Bi ( ). It is a Song ( ) Dynasty poem. It reads like this:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heng kan cheng ling, ce cheng feng ( )

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yuan jin gao di ge bu tong ( )

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bu shi lu shan zhen mian mu ( )

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zhi yuan shen zai ci shan zhong ( )

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot translate the poem as well as I can

appreciate it, but I will try.  The poem says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I look at the mountain from the front, it looks

like a ridge.  When I look at the mountain from the side,

it  looks like a cliff.  There are so many of them,  they

are   near  and  far,  tall  and  short,  they  all  look

different.   I  cannot see the real face  of  Lu  Shan  (

).   Because  I  am right in the middle of  the  mountain

range.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, people rush to mountain tops only to be

disappointed  because they could not see the  majesty  of

the  mountain  or the ranges in the mountain  or  at  the

summit.   In  fact, we all know that the  most  beautiful

view of Lu Shan (

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) or any beautiful mountain like Mount Fuji, is not

in  the  mountain or at the summit but rather the majesty

is gleaned from a far distance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ERC Report, to me, is like Lu Shan (

).    It  has many radical policies, the import of  which

can  only be appreciated from a far distance. You do  not

have  to  be physically removed from Singapore,  but  you

must  read  it  with a mental detachment.  How  far  from

Singapore must we read the ERC Report?  I think

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>

we  have  to read it from really far, from outside  South

East Asia and beyond.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors looking at Singapore from outside

Singapore will quickly differentiate Singapore  from  the

rest  of  the  region.  It will then be  clear  that  the

Singapore mountain is quite different from those  in  the

region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC Report has many radical ideas. But to me,

it  sends  a few, simple but clear messages.   The  first

message is that Singapore is open for business.  It is  a

simple statement, but we go beyond that.  We say that  we

are  not xenophobic.  We welcome talent, whether they are

black or white, and all shades in between.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I read in the Report is that the

Singapore  Government will lower costs, the direction  of

costs  will  go  down,  both  corporate  income  tax  and

personal  income tax.  And this Government is  determined

to    make   Singapore   an   affordable   business   and

manufacturing centre by sweeping away as many  rules  and

bureaucracies as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, individual factors of production will not be

the  cheapest in the region, but if investors look at the

total  cost   -  the key words here are "total  cost"   - they will find that the total is less than the sum of its

parts.   For  example, Matsushita's  Maris,  the  world's

foremost manufacturer of refrigerator compressors,  found

that  while labour cost in Singapore is much higher  than

in  the region and in China, Singapore is still a cheaper

place to manufacture its products.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I gleaned from the Report is that,

collectively,  we  are  willing to  sacrifice  short-term

gains  for  long-term benefits.  All of us will  moderate

our pay increases, like deferring the CPF restoration for

two  years  or  maybe even beyond, and  all  of  us  must

upgrade  ourselves  and make ourselves  relevant  to  the

world outside.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM mentioned that the ERC Report is not just an

economic  roadmap for the future.  It is also an exercise

in social bonding.  For this reason, Singaporeans

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>

do  not  go  to  the streets to demonstrate,  unlike  our

friends  in  Hong  Kong, because here  we  need  to  make

adjustments  to  our  lifestyle, to  make  a  living  for

tomorrow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all these, foreign investors have begun to

notice us from afar.  The ERC Report is like a lighthouse

that  beckons them to our shore.  Many foreign banks  are

beginning  to  shift forex operations back  to  Singapore

from  our  competitors like Hong Kong, Sydney and  Tokyo.

The Bank of Tokyo and Credit Swiss First Boston are among

those  reported  to be moving major components  of  their

currency  trading  operations from  Tokyo  to  Singapore.

Others  who are here like Citibank and ABN-AMRO  will  be

adding  more forex and derivative businesses.   Germany's

WestLB  Bank has recently started operating  here.   Sir,

this  trickle  will slowly turn into  a  tide.   Fidelity

Investment,  one  of the world's biggest  fund  managers,

left  Singapore  in a hurry immediately after  the  Asian

crisis  in  1997. Today, it has applied for a licence  to

restart its operations in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we might well ask: how can all these new

happenings be attributed to the ERC Report which was only

released  early this month, on 7th February?  The  answer

is  that  many  of the key recommendations  were  already

released  many months ago.  To me, the ERC Report  is  an

anti-climax too, like MPs here have suggested, but  there

are good reasons why it is so.  The ERC Report, to me, is

like  a  movie.  It is like a movie where the story  line

had  been  told many times.  In fact, over  the  last  12

months,  we  were  also invited to  some  detailed  early

previews.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was as if the whole nation was invited to sit

next  to  the director's chair while the ERC "movie"  was

being  made.  Sir, while the ERC Report might be an anti-climax,  I cannot understand why many are not excited  by

the  recommendations in the Report.   Memories  are  very

short.  We have forgotten that some taboo policies, which

only a few years ago were held to be sacrosanct, have now

been  bulldozed by the ERC.  For example, lowering  taxes

to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>

as  low  as  20% was an absolute no-no, even only  a  few

years  ago.  The argument then was that if the Government

were  to  lower  taxes  below  25%,  Singapore  could  be

blacklisted  as a tax haven, an absurd answer  you  might

think.   Then, it was the holy grail, only  a  few  years

ago.  So, a major U-turn sign has been removed.  One  big

nut has been cracked.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there are other taboos which have been swept

away,  another one was the concession to exempt  selected

foreign  income  remitted to Singapore from  taxes.   The

Budget  will  now  give  such  income  remitted  back  to

Singapore  tax free exemptions.  A smaller taboo  may  be

exemption of interest of domestic deposits from taxes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the ERC Report has consigned these nuts to

the  incinerator.  So, I cannot understand why  Mr  Leong

Hong  Kee said that major U-turn signs have been  allowed

to  stay.  These are radical policy U-turns which many of

us,  including myself, have railed against 10 years  ago.

Many  of  us failed then.  But, today, 10 years on,  they

have  become  policies.   The policies  have  come  about

because  of  the ERC Committee meeting, deliberating  and

finalising the recommendations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a major crisis, a new economic landscape post-September 11, and a new Finance Minister have made a

hundred  flowers  bloom.  I celebrate these  U-turns.   I

think we can do with a few more of these U-turns, but let

us  digest  the present lot of cracked nuts on our  plate

before we move on to the next plate of cracked nuts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ERC Report serves a very important purpose.

Investors  take  a  long-term view of their  investments.

The  ERC  Report provides them with advanced intelligence

of  Singapore's long-term policies.  The ERC prescription

is  a  holistic  treatment to our current economic  ills.

This  kind  of treatment takes time.  But what  investors

are seeing is something even more illuminating.  In spite

of  a  major economic crisis, resulting in the Government

running  three  years of deficit, Singapore  is  lowering

taxes.  This, by itself, may not be profound, but we are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>

lowering  taxes in the face of difficult economic  times,

in  the  face of deficits.  When we compare this to  Hong

Kong,  which  is raising taxes to cover their shortfalls,

this  move  by  Singapore, as opposed to  what  our  most

fearsome  competitor  is  doing,  is  clear  evidence  to

investors that Singapore, first, has the financial clout;

and,  second,  the  social cohesion  to  restructure  the

economy  and reorganise ourselves in order to move  ahead

of the crowd.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singaporeans caught up with the daily routine

may  not  appreciate these long-term policy implications.

I  can understand that.  Like all MPs here, I do have the

meet-the-people sessions.  And in these MPS sessions,  my

grassroots leaders and I have met many casualties of what

I  would  call  this very severe economic downturn.   And

many  of  them have come with a begging bowl  asking  for

handouts.  My grassroots leaders and I cannot be  unmoved

by  these  events.  We help them in any way we could.   I

turn to my CCC.  I turn to my Mayor who is sitting there,

and they all chip in and help them in one way or another.

I  write to MOM.  I write to NTUC and some of these cases

were  successful.  In fact, the sad story is many  of  my

key  grassroots leaders themselves have been  retrenched,

but  they  are still with me.  They are still  doing  the

MPS,  and they understand that their unemployment is  not

the fault of the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all of us here understand the desire for more

handouts,  and we also understand the desire for  instant

cures for our economic malaise.  But, really, there is no

viagra  for our economic impotence.  Many people tell  me

there is - the economy will rise again, they say, if land

cost  was  lowered.  I heard Mr Loh Meng See say business

cost  in Singapore is high; land cost is one of the sins.

Many  of them have told me that if the Government was  to

lower  land cost, then all will be well.  But two  issues

need to be looked at very seriously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, artificially lowering land cost by flooding

the  market with land might well make land cheap, but the

consequence of taking large doses of this kind of strong

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>

medicine  has  a  known medical side effect.   It  causes

massive  heart attacks.  For those saddled with  negative

equity,  the disease might well be cured, but the patient

will  be  dead.  And negative equity works like a  virus.

Once   it  has  infected  a  critical  mass,  the  entire

population is in peril.  In fact, much of Hong Kong today

is trapped in negative equity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was reading the South China Morning Post last

night, and on the weekend issue, the Sunday Morning  Post

issue of March 9th, there was a report which said that  a

survey  by  Mastercard showed that Hongkongers were  more

gloomy  in the middle of last year than Indonesians  were

when  Indonesia  was  at  the height  of  the  Indonesian

crisis.  That was how depressing.  Hong Kong is a land of

entrepreneurs.  Today, it is more like the  land  of  the

gloomy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second point is land cost in Singapore is

not  that expensive today.  It is not the cheapest in the

region,  but it is not that expensive.  Since  the  Asian

crisis,  market  forces  have  driven  down  land  prices

considerably.   Compared to Shanghai, for  example,  good

quality housing in Singapore might well be cheap.  I  was

reading  the  Time  magazine last month.   Hannah  Beach,

Time's  Shanghai correspondent, lamented that  she  could

not  find  a  decent - I repeat decent -  not  luxurious,

accommodation for her housing budget.  What does she mean

by  "decent"?   She means a flat or a house with  running

water, continuous lighting and heating, because she needs

to  file  reports back to the States.  When she  found  a

decent place at US$5,000 per month, the agent immediately

told  her  that the asking rent had been up to  US$5,500.

For that kind of money (which is something like S$9,500),

she  could  have got a luxurious penthouse in  Singapore.

Premium  grade office space in Singapore is  quite  cheap

today.  One would easily get reports in the Straits Times

today, but I got this figure sometime ago.  Premium grade

office  space  in Singapore could go as  low  as  $5  per

square  foot.  I am talking about top grade office space.

If you bargained hard enough, you might even

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>

get  it  lower - I do not know.  But for $5, you can  get

reasonably very good office space.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Guangzhou today - not Shanghai or Beijing - good

grade office space is already $3 per square foot.  We are

only  $3  difference,  but  we  are  Singapore.   In   my

assessment,  land cost in Singapore is reasonably  cheap,

and the same for industrial land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no need to artificially drive down

land costs to be the cheapest in the region.  Competitive

pricing,  yes;  but fire sales, no.   Land  is  only  one

factor  of  production.  We can compensate  for  this  by

making  the  total cost less than the sum  of  individual

costs.  I call this synergy in reverse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is in bear territory. We hear his roar,

we  see  his footprints.  But the marauding bear  is  not

just  chasing us; the bear is chasing each and every  one

of  our  neighbours  as well.  We do not  have  to  strip

ourselves naked - like selling everything on the cheap  - in order to out-run the bear.  All we need do, Sir, is to

shed  enough baggage to out-run our neighbours.  In fact,

we  should not out-run the bear this time.  We need  some

clothes on for the next bear run.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of us are unnecessarily gloomy. A few even

think that this is the end of Singapore.  Yet, during the

good  times,  many  of us thought the music  would  never

stop.   Now  that  we are in bad times, the  same  people

think  the  music would never start again.  We have  been

through this before in 1986-1987.  This is not the  first

economic downturn, nor will it be the last.  Memories are

always  short.   In  the  recession  of  1986  and  1987,

Singaporeans went through the same emotional trauma.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to end my speech by quoting a familiar

Chinese idiom.  It says: Sai Weng shi ma, yan zhi fei  fu

(

).   Sai Weng was a horse trader.  One day, his favourite

stallion ran away.  He was extremely sad.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>

Soon  after,  the stallion brought back a  herd  of  wild

thoroughbreds.   He was delirious.  The essence  of  this

idiom is: do not despair, something good will come out of

something bad.  The Chinese say: Yin huo de fu, huo fu wu

chang                                                   (

).  Nothing is forever.  I like to look at things with an

"Ah  Q"  mentality.  Because of the economic crisis,  the

Government  has  reviewed and agreed to U-turn  on  major

policies, which were once immutable.  In fact, many  nuts

were cracked.  I see this as a sign that good things  are

on the way.  The crisis has injected in us all a sense of

urgency  for  change.  Clearly, we  could  not  carry  on

business  the way we did.  The crisis gave birth  to  the

ERC.   And I think the ERC Report will guide us into  the

future.

<br>1.50 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

thank  you for giving me this opportunity to join in  the

debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are making a Budget in the middle of many

developments.  The economy is weak.  Jobs are  harder  to

find and to keep, both for retrenched workers and for new

graduates.  Crime was up last year.  A war in Iraq looms,

driving  up oil prices and inflation worries.  Cut-throat

competition   breathes  down  our  neck   both   in   the

neighbourhood and further afield.  And we  can  hear  the

sucking  noises of the giant Chinese vacuum cleaner  that

draws  away investments, factories and jobs.  On  top  of

all  that, terrorism tries to paralyse societies by  fear

and by tearing up the social fabric.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not surprisingly, more Singaporeans are feeling

anxious.  The world seems to have turned very messy, very

harsh.  There are changes upon changes.  Many wonder what

is happening.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can Singaporeans find courage and strength to

press  on and face life's challenges, and see the ongoing

struggles  as  an investment in their future?   And  what

future would that be?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in these circumstances, I feel that our Budget

must  strengthen hope.  Realistic hope, to me, is central

to our ability

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>

to   deal  decisively  and  effectively  with  the   many

challenges, and to emerge victorious.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we strengthen hope? First, let us press on

with  all  efforts  to  inform  Singaporeans  about   the

developments  around us that affect us in  the  economic,

social and political arena.  It is a natural tendency for

people  to avoid pain.  And one way to avoid pain  is  to

try  and block out unwelcome news and information.   Some

may  think  that  it is perhaps more merciful  and  maybe

easier  to  keep morale up, if we shield our people  from

having to face the increasingly harsh realities.  Yet, if

we  do  that, we dull our senses and lull ourselves  into

wrongly believing that there is somehow an entitlement to

a  good  life,  and  that  would  be  counter-productive.

Clearly,  we  must not set out to demoralise our  people.

But  we must always call a spade a spade, so that by  and

by,  Singaporeans  at large will adjust to  understanding

that  the world has changed in big and fundamental  ways.

Then,  we  will be much more ready and able to  make  the

necessary adjustments and adaptations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I am glad that the Finance Minister has been

forthright  in his analysis of the economic picture  that

we  face,  and  also  the fiscal position  that  we  must

expect,  going forward.  Specifically, he has pointed  to

volatile times ahead and tighter Government revenues.  In

other  words, the days of what I would say cruise control

life  management  -  which is that  you  just  put  on  a

constant  setting and the car just moves  on  its  own  - assuming  that there will always be a job and that  there

will always be pay that goes up - those days are over  as

well  as any expectations that, whether in Government  or

in  our  private life, we can spend freely  without  much

thought.  Those days are also over.  The future is  about

staying nimble, making choices, taking chances and living

with  our own decisions and within our means, both  as  a

nation  and as individuals.  And as these big changes  in

thinking   and  behaviour  take  place,  we  would   have

positioned Singapore and Singaporeans for a more  hopeful

future.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, hope rests on the confidence that things

will improve in the future.  This confidence must have  a

proper  basis,  for otherwise it would  be  mere  wishful

thinking.   Take the area of jobs, for example.   We  all

know  that  this is now a key concern among  working  age

Singaporeans,  because of the restructuring,  relocations

and  retrenchments.  How do we show Singaporeans who want

to adapt that they would be helped?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or put it in another way: how do we explain to

adaptable  Singaporeans  that the  Budget  measures  will

bring more jobs to Singapore, and that they will have  an

equal chance to take these jobs?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me start with job creation. Jobs do not appear

out  of the blue.  Jobs are created when companies invest

in  Singapore and do business here.  Unless Singapore  is

attractive  to investors, they will not put  their  money

here, and there will not be jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does Singapore offer? Do we offer cheap land?

No.   Cheap  wages?  Not when compared to many developing

countries.  Do we have capabilities that companies  need?

Well,  our workforce has been top-rated by BERI for  many

years, but our overall education profile, because of  our

history,  trails  those of developed countries  in  whose

league  we  must  fight if we want a better  standard  of

living.  Our infrastructure?  Yes, we are rated well here

and  it  gives  us  a certain edge.   And  then  we  have

strengths  in certain key intangible areas like political

stability,   low  corruption,  effective  and   proactive

Government,  hub  status offering  high  connectivity  in

various areas, open trade links, industrial peace, and  a

pro-investment, pro-business tax environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given all these, one may ask: why would companies

not  want  to  invest in Singapore?  And  the  answer  is

because  every  other country wants that same  investment

dollar,  and will compete fiercely for it.  So  companies

compare  the  packages  that  different  countries  offer

before  making  their decisions.  Even companies  already

here  will do their sums to see whether they want to move

or stay.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How then can we be hopeful of winning our share in

this  fierce competition?  The short answer  must  be  to

reinforce our strengths and remedy our weaknesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, on company and personal income taxes,

the  Finance  Minister has introduced  changes  beginning

last  year that will see Singapore becoming progressively

less  demanding.   Although  no  further  corporate   and

personal tax reductions were made in this year's  budget,

the   commitment  to  make  further  reductions  by  2005

remains.  At the same time, the exemption from tax of all

foreign  income in the form of dividends, branch  profits

and  services income in this year's budget will encourage

enterprise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of capability building, the budget in

financial  year 2002 saw another $500 million transferred

into  the  Lifelong Learning Fund.  The Fund,  which  now

stands  at  $1.5  billion, is expected  to  generate  $60

million  in income to pay for more worker retraining  and

skills   upgrading.   There  are  also   additional   tax

incentives for those who, on their own, take up  training

and attend courses and seminars.  And of course there  is

the  setting  up  of  a  special agency  to  promote  and

coordinate   Continuous  Education  and  Training.    The

commitment of the Government to do everything possible on

the supply side to give Singaporean workers the chance to

compete  for the new good paying jobs is very  clear  and

unwavering.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to healthcare cost, which is another

concern,  especially among older Singaporeans and  lower-paid workers, the Government has transferred another $100

million  into the MediFund, bringing it to $900  million.

And  the interest income will help more poor Singaporeans

deal with high medical expenses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, to me, it is the spur given to the introduction

of  the  portable  medical benefits that deserve  special

mention.  We have an aging workforce.  And when an  aging

workforce meets with the end of lifelong

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>

employment, then it becomes obvious that many  are  going

to be stuck financially if they fall ill in between jobs,

or  if  their  employers  do not  provide  basic  medical

benefits.    I  am  glad  that,  after  many   years   of

discussion,  a  specific tax incentive is  now  given  to

promote  the implementation of portable medical benefits.

However,  I  do  feel that the pace of progress  in  this

matter  is  too slow because there is not yet a  proposal

with defined terms and premiums for workers and employers

to  adopt.   My  worry is that the longer  the  delay  in

implementing this, the more older workers will be  placed

in  jeopardy.   So I urge the Government to  consider  an

aggressive  and specific timetable for the implementation

of portable medical benefits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area that I feel the Government can do more

is  business  costs.   Cost levels  directly  impact  the

competitiveness  of  companies.   Feedback  received   by

unions   indicates  that  a  significant  proportion   of

unionised  companies that had relocated part  or  all  of

their operations to other countries in the past few years

had cited high cost of business as one of the reasons for

their  decision.  Therefore, it is an important  item  to

pay attention to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at the cost factors, wages and land are

two  main  ones.   On wages, I would say that,  over  the

years,  tripartite partners have worked closely to reform

the wage structure in Singapore.  When companies have  to

deal with increased volatility, the wage structure cannot

be  rigid.   Otherwise,  we will  be  forcing  many  more

companies  to prematurely lose money, downsize  or  close

down and many more workers will lose their jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But much work remains to be done. The seniority-based wage system will, in an increasingly volatile

operating  environment, make our older workers  more  and

more  vulnerable.   The  lack of more  timely  adjustment

mechanisms, such as the monthly variable component,  will

also  harm companies and their workers in times of sudden

poor demand.  Other cost components that work against the

employability of older workers, such as high

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>

medical and statutory costs, must also be tackled  so  as

to  minimise casualties.   We must press on with  reforms

and  provide more flexibility in practical and  equitable

ways,   so   that  all  stakeholders  of  the  companies,

including  the  workers, will be able  to  share  in  the

success and growth of their companies.  At the same time,

when companies know that their manpower overheads are not

locked into rigid structures, but pegged to productivity,

performance and value, they will also be more willing  to

hire when demand picks up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On land cost, I just want to make a comment on

industrial  land  pricing because I  do  believe  that  a

different approach from that of the present will help  to

strengthen our attractiveness as an investment  location.

Currently,  industrial land prices, I believe,  generally

reflect their opportunity cost in Singapore.  That is  to

say,  the  valuation  of a piece of  industrial  land  is

determined by the value of its alternative use.   As  the

property market in Singapore has grown strongly for  many

years,  that has nudged up the price of industrial  land.

Beyond  a  certain point, too high land costs  cannot  be

offset   by  relative  productivity  factors,  and   some

industries may be prematurely priced out of the Singapore

economy.   And with their departure goes jobs.   Yet,  in

the long term, even property prices can only be sustained

if  the  economy  does  well.  So therefore,  given  this

nexus,  I really suggest we rethink how we want to  price

industrial land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the concept of opportunity cost. And I do

think  that it can be used in this case to benchmark  the

price  of  industrial land for given kinds of  industries

against  relevant competing locations.  For instance,  if

having  a  hub port, an air hub, or a chemical  industry,

considered strategic to the interests of Singapore,  then

the   pricing  of  land  for  such  purposes  should   be

determined  with  an  eye  on competing  locations.   The

positive  multiplier effects in employment  and  spending

will, to some extent, compensate for any lower collection

of land sales revenue upfront.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to give an example. Arising out of the concern

over terrorism, security at Jurong Island was stepped  up

and  Police  had  to introduce a stricter  security  pass

control  system for that island.  As against the  initial

estimate  of about 10,000 passes that they have to  issue

for  direct workers on the island, I am told that in  the

end, they issued close to 100,000 passes.  So you can see

that  when you enable a hub like that to take place,  the

positive  multiplier effects are significant.  Therefore,

we  want to ask if we had charged condominium land prices

for the land in Jurong Island, for example, then could we

have  had the benefit of the 10,000 direct jobs  and  the

100,000 indirect jobs created for Singaporeans?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our willingness and readiness to change and

make Singapore more attractive to investment, to business

and to job creation will be the basis of a realistic hope

for the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the hopes of Singaporeans cannot rest

just  on  what the Government does for us.   We  have  to

choose  to  ride the changes.  This is an  act  of  will.

Returning  to the example of jobs, we must ask  ourselves

that  when  the Government pours in money on  the  supply

side to create training places, what do we do?  Do we  do

our part on the demand side by stepping forward and going

for  training  and  skills upgrading and  therefore  make

ourselves eligible for the new and restructured  jobs  of

our current employers and future employers?  We must also

ask  ourselves what else are we doing to stay  employable

in  the event that we are displaced.  In the light  of  a

more volatile environment, we must also ask ourselves how

we  can make better spending and investment decisions  as

individuals, especially on big ticket items, so  that  we

will be as unencumbered as possible financially, even  if

we are displaced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, informed individual choices and decisions,

together  with  correct  policy  directions  and   speedy

implementation, give us confidence for the future.   This

Budget promotes those outcomes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Budget.

<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  practically all Singaporeans know we face uncertain

times.   Obviously, difficult times too.  But the  degree

differs.   And this can be seen in the way  many  of  the

unemployed and the retrenched behave.  Contrary  to  what

hon.  Member, Mr Low Thia Khiang, said earlier, jobs  are

still available - plenty in fact - but not the ones  many

of  the  retrenched or the unemployed are waiting for  or

willing to accept.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They give many and varied reasons why they chose not

to  accept the jobs matched or assisted by the CDCs,  for

example.   Among  them:  "Money no enough";  "Jauh  lo  - distance.  How can I work in Jurong?  I stay in  Punggol,

you  know?";  "No shift, please"; "Weekend free,  can  or

not?";  "Admin  job only, OK?"  These  are  some  of  the

responses  that  we got from many of those  who  actually

came forward to seek help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can understand the low salary as being a not

strong  enough  pull, especially when  a  person,  having

benefited  from  the high wage policy and  earning  about

$1,800-$2,000  after  working  for  about   10-15   years

suddenly  finds  himself retrenched,  with  two  kids  in

school and has recently upgraded to a 4- or 5-room  flat.

Thus, for someone like him - and there are many of them - the $1,000 salary, with a take-home of about $850, in the

mind  of  such  a person, surely "money no enough".   But

after months of waiting, surely it is better to grab  the

$850

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>

rather  than  no  money at all, except  for  the  interim

assistance from Government, which is less.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the CDCs try. Nearly 5,000 applied

for  assistance last year at the North East CDC,  out  of

which  65%  were matched, but only 14% placed with  jobs.

From  the  macro  job fairs held with  the  help  of  the

Ministry  of  Manpower  to  a  more  focused  Compassvale

locality  and industry-based job fair, the CDC tried  and

tried.   It  never gave up.  Even the GRC-based  approach

was  taken, through Pasir Ris-Punggol, for better  focus,

with  geographical  considerations  taken  into  account.

Temporary employment through Town Councils too for  those

in  arrears, pioneered by Pasir Ris-Punggol Town Council,

thanks to the hard work by its Chairman, the hon. Member,

Mr Charles Chong.  The scheme is now extended to Tampines

and Aljunied Town Councils.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, times are bad, all right. My CDC

officers  now  tell me that there has been  a  change  in

attitude lately.  More of those who came to seek help are

less  choosy.   More desperate perhaps, savings  dry  up,

relatives'  help not as forthcoming, and  more  are  even

prepared  for  training and retraining.  Before,  it  was

difficult  to  convince  them  to  go  for  training  and

retraining, they were thinking that the Government,  with

its  past track record, would be able to turn the economy

around  in  no time, and they would go back to their  old

jobs.   I  personally know of cases of those who,  having

worked as policemen, firemen, water boat men or tug  boat

men,  did  not see themselves in alternative work.   They

wanted  to  work in the same jobs till retirement.   They

are  proud  of  the  work they did, and  they  were  good

workers  indeed.  But those jobs are no longer available.

This  is the structural unemployment which the Government

has  been  trying to prepare Singaporeans for, especially

in  terms of training and retraining.  But some,  perhaps

many, did not take heed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the CDC experience shows how we

have  tried  and  how sad sometimes the stories  can  be.

They serve as a reality check as to how difficult times

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>

can  be,  especially for those in need.  As hon. MP,  Mdm

Cynthia Phua, said yesterday, many have to tighten  their

belts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Sir, reminds me of an anecdote, more like a

joke.   There  was a time during the Cold War  days  when

China  used  to provide a lot of financial  aid  to  many

African countries.  One day, Chairman Mao got very  upset

because  these  satellite countries were getting  spoilt.

He decided to give them a dose of reality check.  He sent

them a note:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Comrade, yes, times are bad, but we cannot go on

like this depending on others for help all the time.   We

must each do our part.  Tighten your belts."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came one reply:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Comrade Mao, you are right. We agree. We must

tighten  our  belts.  Yes, Comrade, please  do  send  the

belts."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the situation faced by many of our

retrenched and unemployed is no laughing matter.  Much of

the  interim assistance given out has been exhausted, and

even those forced to take lower paying jobs are now faced

with  loans  and arrears beyond repair.   Money  owed  to

Singapore Power for electricity and water has led to many

now  living without those amenities.  I do not  have  the

numbers, but perhaps during the Committee of Supply,  the

relevant  Ministry would be able to give  us  an  update.

But  this  situation must have dented the level of  self-confidence and self-esteem in many of those affected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dare say that many of those caught in this

predicament  are  victims  of  their  own  situation  and

financial mismanagement.  They will say that it  is  easy

for  people  like  us  to say that.  Nevertheless,  their

problems are real and they need urgent help.  I dare not,

however,  say  that  we must provide more  of  Government

assistance  to get them out of the deep hole.   Welfarism

is not the way out.  But how do we fare as Government and

fellow  Singaporeans in the face of  these  needy  cases?

The  number  of fellow Singaporeans hauled to  court  for

bankruptcy,  for example, must have risen, desperate  and

not  knowing  how  to save themselves.   All  these  will

certainly have an impact on their self-confidence.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the number of those affected is large enough,

either  from a social and low income group or,  worse,  a

particular  race - as a significant percentage  of  those

affected  are  Malays and Indians - the  problem  becomes

more  acute.  There is a need to look at this problem  of

financial  squeeze in the short term while we  pursue  to

prepare  them to overcome their predicament for the  long

term through education and training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member, Dr Wang Kai Yuen,

earlier  this  morning described the situation  in  three

words:  Jobs, Jobs, Jobs.  I agree.  But may I  add  that

the  solution  is  in a 4-letter word,  an  abbreviation:

JELL.   It  is not a signal for a short cut nor  a  quick

fix.   But, indeed, it is to emphasise a longer term view

for  the future.  JELL stands for Jobs, Employability and

Lifelong  Learning.   This is also the  approach  at  the

North East CDC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore happy to welcome the decision by the

Government  to establish a statutory board in  charge  of

Lifelong  Learning and Training.  MOM, NTUC, CDCs,  self-help groups and voluntary welfare organisations will tell

us  that  there  are  serious  hurdles  to  overcome  for

training  and retraining.  The untiring efforts shown  by

MOM  and  other complementary agencies must continue  and

should  bear  fruit.   The Government,  the  Ministry  of

Finance  in  particular,  should  not  leave  any   stone

unturned   here   to  provide  the  infrastructural   and

financial  help needed to give the new board  a  fighting

chance to succeed and to excel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mindsets and attitude problems on the ground are

real.   It could be as innocent as senior workers - those

45  and  above  -  not  wanting  to  attend  classes  for

perceived  fear  of  holding back  others,  to  the  more

serious  ones like those having mental blocks to upgrade,

especially  with computer training.  The not-so-young  45

and above, concept of retirement - for a long time pegged

to  the  55-year mark - needs redressing, and their  grey

mindset   about-one-job  whole-life  career   too   needs

sensitive   overhauling.   Counselling  for  second   and

alternative  careers needs to be looked at  carefully  as

there is a serious shortage of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>

counsellors working on the ground, whether at  MOM,  CDCs

or VWOs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a related but important new frontier, the

Government's call for more entrepreneurs deserves  closer

scrutiny  by  all for the opportunities they  come  with.

More can be done to upgrade and expand opportunities  and

open  up new fronts for employment.  We have often  heard

that not enough was done to support the nation's call for

our  budding entrepreneurs.  From the stories we read  or

heard or saw in the media, the new budding - and now more

successful  -  entrepreneurs did it on their  own  steam.

That  is what entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship are  all

about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I personally believe that we could do

a  lot  more  to  sow the seeds for more  entrepreneurial

flowers  to bloom. While we would want to see more  local

entrepreneurs  to  succeed, creating  employment  in  the

process,  I  feel  that it is equally important  for  the

Government to nurture the spirit of enterprise in as many

Singaporeans as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, Sir, the North

East  CDC  believes so.  We start young, even at  primary

schools.   In  fact, the need to instill  the  spirit  of

enterprise  should  cover all age groups.   Like  at  the

North  East  CDC,  the Students Middle  Aged  and  Senior

Citizens  (SMS) approach will provide opportunities  wide

enough   for   all   to  realise  their   potential   for

entrepreneurship  and being enterprising.   Our  national

efforts  at promoting entrepreneurship should also  cover

as wide and as deep an area as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, jobs, JELL and entrepreneurship should

provide  us the glue that would bind the people  together

in  good or in bad times. Economics, or livelihood, after

all, is the best bond for social cohesion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easy to say that the Government should and

could do more but this is also an opportunity for us, the

people, to ask ourselves:  what have we done more to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>

help  ourselves and the economy in these uncertain times?

Yes,  the Government must and will have to take the  lead

but  the  people  must also have the will  to  learn  and

unlearn  many  times  around what holds  for  the  future

economy and the challenges of uncertainties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not swallow the Oliver Twist culture for more

hook,  line  and  sinker  unthinkingly.   Instead,   more

Singaporeans should stand up, fighting for - in the words

of  SMS, Mr Khaw Boon Wan - a 'more than good' chance  to

be  the best through a competitive culture called  ERC  - Enterprising and Resourceful Culture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion in the name of the

Minister for Finance.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, I

would  like to draw attention to two big areas of concern

for Singapore, both of which relate to our demographics - our aging population and our declining fertility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget addresses both subjects to varying

degrees - the aging population and the changes to the CPF

contribution rates, and in the measures to enhance  older

workers' employability.  With regard to fertility,  there

is   one  solitary  item,  tax  exemption,  for  employer

subsidised  childcare benefits - not  much,  but  perhaps

just a signal that the issue is not being forgotten.  For

today, I will touch only on the first subject, leaving my

observations  on our pro-family efforts and policies  for

the Committee of Supply debate to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Marine Parade GRC, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua,

spoke yesterday on the need for us to totally review  our

concept of retirement and the way that CPF is structured,

against  the  background of CPF  withdrawal  age  of  55,

retirement age of 62 and life expectancy of 78,  and  the

rapidly  evolving  patterns of  employment  as  companies

compete  in  the globalised economy.   Many  Singaporeans

have  come  to  realise, with considerable consternation,

that  what  they had been taking for granted  or  assumed

that  somehow  CPF  would take care of  their  retirement

needs has been an illusion.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, the Inter-Ministerial Committee on the

Aging Population found that only 24% of those turning  55

had  $60,000 in their Minimum Sum cash portion.  Now  the

ERC   estimates   that  even  of  new   account   holders

contributing for a full career span at current CPF rates,

only  50% would achieve the targeted $80,000 Minimum  Sum

for  the  cash  portion of $40,000.  The  Government  has

taken steps to limit the ceiling on CPF withdrawals to be

made  for  property purchases, and the DPM has  announced

that the rate of contribution to the Special Account will

be  raised  in  steps over the next three  years  towards

addressing  the shortfall.  But even with  these,  it  is

anticipated that only 60% of account holders  will  reach

the  target  Minimum  Sum level.   Further,  this  target

amount translates into an income stream of something like

$600  per month, assuming a 4% interest rate for a period

of  16 years, taking retirement at 62 and life expectancy

at  78.   Thus, recognising that this amount may  not  be

adequate  and, indeed, the ERC has recommended  that  the

Minimum Sum should be subsequently raised beyond $80,000.

But  truly,  how  much will we be  able  to  do  and,  if

anything, at what pace?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, another major deficiency of the CPF

model  in catering for Singaporeans' retirement needs  is

that  the  system  currently leaves out some  significant

groups  of  people - the self-employed,  workers  in  the

informal sector and home-makers - whose contributions are

not attributed economic value and are not included in its

cover.  As the latter group is largely women, who will in

all  probability outlive their husbands, their  financial

security in old age will be precarious.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC has taken the approach in its

recommendations that CPF should cater for the 10th to the

80th  percentile  of  the  income  spectrum.   Now,  this

approach makes eminent sense, as indeed the top  20%  can

very  well  look after itself and, truly, the bottom  10%

would   have   so   little  put  aside  through   regular

contribution  rates - as well as did  every  dollar  that

they   earned   to   meet   their  immediate   day-to-day

expenditures - that it does not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>

make sense to have them make an employee contribution  at

all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, implicit in this recommendation is that

there  will  be 10% of the population who  will  have  no

financial  provisions  for their  post-retirement  needs.

This is a very significant number.  Just some months ago,

the  Minister  for Community Development and  Sports,  in

answer  to a question on the financial assistance schemes

available, shared that in the financial year 2001, almost

15,000  beneficiaries were helped.  But on examining  the

details  of  the numbers, one finds that the majority  of

these   were  either  in  interim  short-term  assistance

schemes  or  for very specific purposes, such as  student

care  fee  assistance, and only 2,773 were  beneficiaries

under  the  main Public Assistance System.  Compare  this

number to a full 10% of the population of workers as they

reach retirement age. The DPM has mentioned in his Budget

speech  the  need  for  Government to  focus  its  social

assistance  in  the future on only the truly  needy.   It

appears  that  this group of truly needy may  be  a  very

significant number.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How has Government planned to provide for this

bottom  10% in their retirement?  Is the intent to simply

gear  up, so that more people will come under the current

assistance schemes, coupled with continuing to depend  on

families   to  step  in the breach,  as  is  the  present

practice and expectation?  Is this realistic, considering

the  trends  of  family formation that we  are  currently

experiencing?   Given this scenario of the  lack  of  any

savings  at  all for the bottom 10%, the full-time  home-makers not catered for in the CPF system, the anticipated

inability of 40% of CPF account holders in the future  to

meet  the  Minimum  Sum  target, and  indeed  the  likely

inadequacy of that sum to generate enough monthly  income

to  maintain  a desired living standard, it seems  to  me

that  a  critical  part  of  the  solution  must  be  the

continued employability and employment of older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of us must be looking to being employed well

beyond  our current expectations, not only to keep active

and engaged, but also to generate some

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>

continuing income to supplement what we have been able to

put  aside as savings.  In this, the Government has  been

very active and very visibly putting its money where  its

mouth is, so to speak, with generous funding invested  in

the  Skills Redevelopment Programmes since 1996 and, more

currently,  in the People-for-Jobs Traineeship Programme.

The  $0.5 billion that Government has just deposited into

the  Lifelong  Learning Fund in financial  year  2002  to

bring  it  to  $1.5  billion to date  will  generate  $16

million  of  interest income to continue to  support  the

skills  upgrading  and retraining  programmes.   This  is

truly  a  commitment that few governments  anywhere  else

would  make and something which  Singaporeans should  not

take  for  granted.   But  Government's  willingness   to

generously fund skills upgrading and retraining alone  is

not enough. Workers and employers need also to play their

part.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the workers' part, while some are still refusing

to accept the reality of Singapore's changing environment

and  its implications and impact on them personally -  as

just  been recounted by Mayor Zainul Abidin Rasheed  -  I

believe that there are many more people now who are  much

more willing to adjust their expectations and to try  new

jobs  in  sectors  that  they  may  not  have  considered

attractive  enough previously.  There are jobs  that  are

available, if all parties are willing to give it a try.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides creating new jobs in new sectors, we have

some  900,000  non-Singaporeans  working  in  our  midst.

While  we welcome them and know we will continue to  rely

on them far into the future, there are many sectors, like

healthcare,  for example, where employers would  welcome,

with open arms, willing locals to fill positions, so that

we   can   moderate  the  ratio  of  local  to  non-local

employees.   The  Government has  put  in  the  money  to

support  reskilling workers. Workers are now more willing

to   give  the  schemes  a  try  and  to  moderate  their

expectations.  Now, employers must also

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>

be  willing to overcome their prejudices and mindsets  to

hire these mid-career recruits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to share a success story, not only to

encourage  workers currently looking for a break  in  the

dark  clouds  that they can take heart, but  more  so  to

encourage  employers to engage in some enlightened  self-interest.  It is about our experience in KK Hospital with

a  group  of new recruits who underwent three  months  of

training  in the National Skills Standard for  healthcare

attendants.  In fact, in the HMI training programme  that

my  NMP colleague, Dr Gan See Khem, had established, they

are a small group and they have been with us for just two

months.   But I have been tracking their progress  and  I

am confident enough that they will be long-term employees

with us to share our story with the House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We started with 10 recruits, mostly in their 40s

from   varied   backgrounds  -   clerical,   secretarial,

production operations, storemen. They are now deployed in

frontline  positions in our wards, clinics and  operating

theatres.  Frontline jobs in healthcare institutions  are

very tough work.  You are on your feet most of the day in

constant patient contact and service, going on shifts.  I

can  tell  you  that this group has had some  tough  time

adjusting,  but  they  are  very  determined   and   very

committed to making this endeavour work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the hospital's part, each of their supervisors

had  been  briefed as to making an extra effort  to  help

them  settle in, to be available to help, either to coach

or  to assist, just to provide encouragement.  We started

with  10,  we  have lost three, who are  unable  to  make

mainly  the  physical adjustments.  The remaining  seven,

however,  their reports on them, both from  the  recruits

themselves,  as well as their supervisors, is  that  they

have  got  through  the adjustment  period  and  are  now

functioning  very comfortably in their  assignments.   In

fact,  they  have been given top marks by the supervisors

for attitude and performance.  I think 7 out of 10, a 70%

retention rate, is pretty good, and I am very happy  with

the outcome.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group of 40-somethings is a shining example of

what   is   possible  with  reskilling,  good   attitude,

commitment  and the willingness to stick it  out  through

the  initial  adjustment to a new work environment.   The

moral  of  the  story is that effort  is  most  certainly

required  on  the  part  of  the  workers,  and  on   the

employers,   in  paying  attention  to  job   fit,   some

orientation  and  instructions on the job  and  attention

from supervisors in helping the new mid-career recruit to

settle in and adjust.  This did not take a huge effort or

commitment  of any additional resources on the  company's

part,   mainly   just  some  additional  attention   from

supervisors in the initial period.  For that the hospital

has  gained  a  bunch of enthused, committed  and  stable

staff.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see in these tough times an opportunity to

redesign  jobs  and  to fill vacancies  with  mature  and

stable workers.  Not all sectors are in the doldrums  and

I  would like to take the occasion to encourage employers

in those sectors that are in good shape to engage also in

what  is  not at all altruistic, but distinctly in  their

own  self-interest,  as I believe the  returns  are  well

worth the efforts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have shared one story of one group in one

organisation.   We must share all other  success  stories

that  there  are, big and small, to talk  about  what  is

possible  and workable and viable.  But beyond  spreading

the good word, we need to do more, to urgently accelerate

the process, getting companies over preconceived ideas of

the   capabilities  and  commitments  of  older  workers.

Exhortation and proselytising would only get us that far.

I  would  like  to therefore suggest that  it  may  be  a

worthwhile  investment to incentivise employers  to  hire

older workers by offering tax offsets against the cost of

employing  these  re-skilled older recruits,  but  for  a

limited period only of, say, 3-5 years, as the intent  is

purely to get them pass the existing immediate prejudices

and mindsets.  Once employers have had the opportunity to

get past the initial scepticism, I am sure that they will

have  enough positive experiences with older workers that

sweeteners would no longer be necessary in the long  run.

No doubt, details of such a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>

scheme  will have to be worked out to prevent gaming  and

abuse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has already shown the importance it

places   on   addressing   the  problem   of   structural

unemployment  and  enhancing the employability  of  older

workers  in the generous funding it continues  to  direct

towards skills upgrading and retraining programmes.  This

investment  in reskilling would go to waste if  employers

do  not  respond  in  sufficient numbers.   I  believe  a

concerted  effort to incentivise companies for a  limited

term  to hire older reskilled workers would be well worth

the money spent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other significant factors in the total

picture  of enhancing the employability of older workers.

The  two  most  important that have been discussed  often

before are moving away from a seniority-based wage system

and  portable medical benefits.  We have been  discussing

moving away from a seniority-based wage system since  the

1980s.  As recommended by the ERC, we really need to  act

much more expeditiously on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to portable medical benefits, the Deputy

Prime  Minister has offered both a bit of a carrot and  a

stick  in  the  budget.  But the question  is:   is  this

enough,  and  how  can we move this along  faster?   Both

Members,  Halimah  Yacob and Heng  Chee  How,  have  also

spoken on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, while the manufacturing sector continues to

be  very  important  to us, many of  the  jobs  that  are

available,  and  will be available, are in  the  services

sector.   Singaporeans need to change yet another mindset

-  that  of the attitudes towards work in serving  others

and  accord  such  honest  labour  the  respect  that  it

deserves.  This would facilitate the transition  we  need

to make.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I stand

in  support  of  the motion raised by  the  Minister  for

Finance.    I  would  like  to  especially  welcome   his

Ministry's acceptance of the recommendations by the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>

Economic  Review Committee on focusing to make  Singapore

the regional hub for new areas like healthcare, education

and creative industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have some time ago raised the notion in this

House  that  Singapore becomes the regional medical  hub.

This  idea is not new; the implications are not  unknown.

We  have,  indeed, been there, but balked each  time.   I

hope that this time this idea will not be thwarted again,

lest we lose the chance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Malaysia and Thailand have been making up

ground  in  healthcare services by leaps and bounds.   In

2001,  the  Thai's Bumrungrad Hospital alone saw  225,000

foreign  patients; much more than all  the  hospitals  in

Singapore  put  together.   Treatment  like  open   heart

surgery,  once  considered beyond the abilities  of  many

hospitals,  is something most hospitals in  Malaysia  and

Thailand offer today, at a fraction of the costs  charged

here.   Both  Malaysia and Thailand have  declared  their

intention to go for a bigger slice of the healthcare  pie

in  the  region.  Both these countries have the advantage

of  lower  costs and the marked difference  in  costs  is

driving large numbers of cost-conscious patients from the

region away from Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the serious questions encountered from this

idea  of  making Singapore into the regional medical  hub

that  caused  key  players to abandon  it  in  the  past?

First,   the  fear  of  spiralling  cost  of  healthcare.

Second,  "the demonstration effect", which is the  effect

of  increasing  demand from the local populace  expecting

the  services being offered to foreign patients at  full-fee paying prices and perception of inequality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point of spiralling costs, having more full-paying foreign patients, apart from giving a spin-off

effect for our other services by having more visitors  to

Singapore, may be a source of subsidy rather than a cause

of  rising  healthcare  costs for local  patients.   Sir,

there is a need for a mindset change here.  Getting more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>

foreign  patients  paying full rates  help  hospitals  in

operating  costs  and may moderate the  need  for  future

hospital fees hikes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is more cost effective and sensible to share

expertise   and   expensive   equipment   in   Singapore,

especially  in  the  very specialised fields  like  liver

transplants and gamma-knife facilities.  There is  not  a

sufficient  pool of patients to support these areas  from

our  population  of 3 million people.  Super  specialists

will  get more patients to keep their skills and  improve

on  them.   This will benefit both the local and  foreign

patients in the end.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the present scheme of blurring the

private   and   public   sectors  by   allowing   private

specialists to come back to public hospitals as  visiting

consultants  and allowing public hospital specialists  to

practise  in  the private sector will minimise  the  ill-effects  of  doctors leaving the public sector  for  more

lucrative  returns  in  the private  sector.   There  are

enough specialists, especially in the private sector,  to

cater  for  both  local  and foreign  patients.   Private

hospitals today are running at less than half capacity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spiralling healthcare costs are inevitable the world

over.    Having  foreign  patients  here  will   have   a

cushioning effect rather than a worse-off effect in  this

respect.  Sir, the real reasons for our inevitable rising

healthcare  costs  are  the  increasing  expectations  of

patients,  the  Government's assurance  that  our  public

healthcare system is the best, the demographic  variables

of  population  growth  and age structure,  the  changing

epidemiological patterns of diseases with a shift towards

chronic  degenerative conditions requiring intensive  and

longer-term  care  and  the  rapid  advances  of  complex

capital-intensive technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point of perception of inequality, consensus

must  be  reached  through more informed  discussion  and

public  education.   Assurance  must  be  given  on  good

affordable  and  basic  healthcare to  all  Singaporeans.

Sir, the demand in medical care could be moderated by the

suppliers

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>

themselves.    Since  consumers  cannot  exercise   their

sovereignty  in  purchasing the  appropriate  amount  and

level  of medical care in most cases, they are invariably

dependent  on  the  expert judgement  of  the  providers.

Hence, to address this issue, healthcare providers can be

subjected to the audit of an effective watchdog body with

a  system of checks and balances and healthcare providers

should  be  bound  by ethical codes of  conduct.   Public

hospital A-class beds should be limited to not more  than

13%.   A  further measure may be the requirement  of  the

public  hospital  providers  to  follow  prescribed  fair

allocation of time for local populace as against  foreign

patients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the challenges facing this path of being

the medical hub of the region?  Sir, I feel the following

areas are worth elaborating.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's healthcare services are high in costs

and  fees  in  comparison to about half in  Malaysia  and

about  one-third in Thailand.  In this respect, I applaud

the  Economic Review Committee's recommendation to ensure

adequate  supply  of  land  at  institutional  rates  for

medical  hub developments.  Singapore may have  lost  the

edge  to  Malaysia and Thailand for many low-end  medical

treatments and Singapore should aim for high-end  medical

treatments  such  as  transplant surgery,  complex  heart

surgery  and  other  complicated or  advanced  surgeries.

There  must be concerted efforts by service providers  to

contain  and  keep  healthcare prices  more  competitive.

Sir,  I  feel that integration of the private and  public

sectors is the way forward to maximise our resource pool,

to  have better economies of scale, to contain costs  and

to avoid duplication of services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a need for mindset change here by the

Government  to treat these two sectors as one  entity  to

achieve  our  aim  of  being  competitive  globally.    I

therefore   welcome   the  Economic  Review   Committee's

recommendations  on the establishment  of  a  responsible

healthcare  consumer  forum for greater  transparency  on

pricing and clinical practice norms and the introduction,

selectively, of subvented

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>

healthcare   at  private  facilities  to  help   generate

economies of scale in the private sector and enable  them

to provide more cost-competitive services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has a very good reputation as a

centre   of   medical  excellence  and   our   healthcare

professionals are recognised for their high  quality  and

efficiency.   We need to have more structured  aggressive

marketing  of  this  fact.  Both the private  and  public

sectors  must  undertake this in  a  coordinated  manner.

Remembering  that  there is increasing  protectionism  of

local  healthcare  services in  other  countries,  joint-ventures  with reputable big names within the  region  to

form  strategic alliances may be necessary.  Other  areas

worth considering should include offering incentives  and

recognition  to  healthcare professionals,  strengthening

international  professional  associations  and  enhancing

networking with regional healthcare providers.  China  is

a  country  with  a huge potential demand for  healthcare

services  and  is a new market that needs  our  immediate

attention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to have the upper edge, there is a

need  for  innovations and an ability to  predict  future

trends.   For example, with the trend towards  an  ageing

population, there will be an increase in the incidence of

chronic diseases.  Thus, a greater focus on strategies in

eldercare and health promotion as well as development  of

treatments for chronic diseases should be encouraged.   A

good  example  would  be  the  recent  improved  surgical

procedure by our local doctors on reshaping the heart  to

give  patients with chronic heart failure a new lease  of

life.  For nearly two-thirds of patients who are waiting,

often in vain, for a new heart, this new procedure  is  a

solution.  This procedure costs a third of the price of a

heart  transplant and thus gives us the  extra  advantage

with regard to foreign patients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our "research culture" had not been great and

"clinical  research", especially, was never the emphasis.

Our public hospitals' priorities are driven by maximising

immediate returns.  Clinicians, especially

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>

the  specialists,  are  incentivised  to  treat  as  many

patients  as  possible; they become too preoccupied  with

the  routines and are required to tend to maximal numbers

of  patients.  That leaves them with little or no time to

teach  the juniors, let alone spend time on research.   A

lot  of  changes  at  our institutions  are  required  to

promote,  identify and support the different  aspects  of

clinical research.  Research activities on the world-wide

prevalent diseases should be expanded expeditiously.  One

good   example  is  the  research  on  prevention,  early

diagnosis  and  drug therapies to combat  coronary  heart

diseases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order for Singapore to remain competitive,

we  need  to pay attention to the training of the  future

generation   of  our  healthcare  providers.    Only   by

continuing  to  invest heavily on our  undergraduate  and

postgraduate  medical education will we ensure  that  our

doctors  will  be competent and conversant with  the  new

developments in medical sciences.  Thus, our  investments

on  the Health Manpower Development Programme ought to be

enhanced.  The learning of medicine is an apprenticeship;

one  cannot  be a good doctor just by reading  textbooks.

We  must  encourage those who are willing  to  teach  and

those who are willing to learn by providing them with the

opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is worthwhile to include the extension of

the  service hub to become a training hub, as  this  will

boost our aim of being a medical hub in the region.  This

will  have  the  effect of promoting  collaboration  with

doctors  in  the  neighbouring countries and  of  gaining

their acceptance of us.  Training is a great professional

relationship  creator.  The goodwill and mentorship  will

continue long after the training period is over.  Word of

mouth is the most effective form of advertisement of  our

medical  capabilities.  It would be  far  more  effective

than  any  advertisement campaign, which might  earn  the

wrath  of  the authorities in our neighbours.   There  is

also  a need for the public sector to involve the private

sector as partners of the training and service

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>

hub.  Only then could we have optimised our strengths  as

a medical hub in the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Innovative packaging with other products such as

insurance, travel arrangements, hotel and shopping  needs

should  be  facilitated to make it  more  attractive  for

consumers to come here.  The various service sectors will

no  doubt benefit when the consumers decide to  come.   A

coordinating   body  that  plans  and   complements   the

different  services to meet the needs of end-users  in  a

mutually consistent way should be formed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I am supportive of most of the Economic

Review Committee's recommendations on promoting Singapore

as  the regional medical hub, I do have a differing  view

on  their recommendation on reviewing the regulations  in

the Public Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act, with a view

to  relax  restrictions on responsible  institution-based

advertising locally and abroad.  Sir, ethical issues have

always been of paramount importance in the conduct of our

medical profession, especially with regard to advertising

or  medical  services.  There is  already  provision  for

limited   and   responsible  advertisement   locally   by

individuals  and  an  even  wider  provision  for  public

institutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advertising abroad is restricted by the enacted laws

of  the  foreign  countries, thus  forbidding  others  to

advertise in their countries.  The gamma-knife incident a

year ago is a good case in point.   The Malaysian doctors

viewed  the promotion of this new modality to a group  of

doctors  and  the public in Kuala Lumpur by a Singaporean

doctor  to be ethically unacceptable and indeed lodged  a

complaint  to  the  Singapore Medical  Council.   Indeed,

there  were  formal complaints lodged with the  Singapore

Medical  Association in the past by neighbouring  medical

associations that Singapore doctors and private hospitals

advertised  their medical services in the newspapers  and

the  Yellow  Pages  of the neighbouring  countries.   The

complainants felt this was distasteful and unethical.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the concerns arising from relaxing

advertisement locally by individuals will be the creation

of  unhealthy  demands  for certain  services  by  locals

rather  than attracting foreign patients. The possibility

of   boosting  unnecessary  local  consumption  and  over

zealous  advertisements  may  also  mislead  the  public.

Liberalising  advertisments locally may  degenerate  into

enticement  or  persuasion of the public to  use  medical

services for maximising profits of the doctor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do hope that the Finance Minister would

consider  my suggestions on making Singapore the regional

hub for healthcare.

<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br>3.40 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  thank  you for allowing me to participate  in  this

debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year seemed to be the "R" year for Singapore - Singaporeans were introduced to many "R" words that they

are  not  usually  used  to  -  restructuring,  remaking,

refreshing, revitalising, renewal.    Those are  the  few

that  I can think of so far.  Actually, these words  have

one  thing in common.  They are the base words  with  the

prefix   "re".   I  am  not a linguist  but  these  words

suggest  that what we have been doing previously  are  no

longer relevant.  Thus, the need for us to redo them, and

we  must before Singaporeans get fatigued with the letter

"R".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am going to focus on several aspects related

to the issue of Enhancing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>

Human  Capital presented by the Minister for Finance  and

the ERC Report.  Like many of my colleagues in the House,

I welcome the Government's decision to set up a statutory

board to facilitate this process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point I want to talk about is the issue of

training and lifelong learning.  Sir, apart for the  "re"

words,  Singaporeans are also rather fatigued  with  this

constant  reminder to train and internalise the value  of

lifelong    learning.   Yesterday,  Ms   Indranee   Rajah

eloquently  argued  that Singaporeans  should  just  pull

themselves  up together and do their part and not  expect

the  Government  to do everything for  them.   Certainly,

this is easier said than done.  How many Singaporeans are

actually hearing the calls made in this House and outside

this  House by Ministers, MPs, union leaders, etc?   But,

more importantly, how many in this House are hearing  the

cries  and  pleas of Singaporeans?  Are  we  speaking  in

different   languages?   Do  we  understand  Singaporeans

enough?   Are  we  reaching out enough to  the  different

target groups?  We need to understand the deeper and more

complex issues that will motivate Singaporeans to  accept

the need for them to train and continue to train.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mdm Deputy Speaker (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua) in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>3.42 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the Ministry of Manpower conducted a study on

adult  training in the year 2000.  Overall, it was  found

that only a third of the economically active Singaporeans

engaged  in training.  The timeframe was 12 months  prior

to  the study.  Also, it was found that participation  in

training  is  inversely related to  age  and  educational

qualification.   The higher educated  workers  were  more

willing  to  undertake training than the  lower  educated

ones,  and  so  are the younger workers compared  to  the

older workers.  Of significant importance I think is  the

finding  on  the motivations or lack thereof among  those

two-thirds who did not actively participate in  training.

One quarter of them indicated no desire to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>

train  at  all.   Amongst those who  indicated  interest,

factors  that will motivate them to train include whether

the  training can improve their career prospects,  having

more  time to go for training, the affordability  of  the

course fees, and when their family commitments are  taken

care of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more recent study in 2002 amongst retrenched

workers  also  showed  similar  trends,  especially   the

inverse  relationship  between educational  qualification

and  age  with willingness to undergo training.  In  this

study,  it was found that the educated workers  were  two

times more willing to train compared to the less educated

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst those who were re-employed, 30% indicated

their  unwillingness  to  seek  training.   More  than  a

quarter  of them gave the reason that it is not necessary

or that they were not required to go for training  - this

despite having been retrenched previously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, obviously, there needs to be a targeted

approach  at  different groups.   I  wonder  if  we  have

studied these trends sufficiently.  Are we being fair  to

Singaporeans in asking them to buck up and do their part,

when perhaps they have very little idea what is happening

and  what  they  are expected to do?   I  wonder  if  the

Government  has an indication how many Singaporeans  have

actually  picked  up  the  ERC  Report,  whether  in  the

bookstores  or  downloaded them from the  Internet.   How

many   Singaporeans,  especially  the   lower   educated,

understand  what is in the Report?  Do they  really  know

where  we  want them to go and what they are supposed  to

do?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have argued before in this House the need for

Singaporeans  to  identify and own the  problem  that  we

face.  We have to make them understand these problems and

then  own it together with the Government before  we  can

expect  them to come up and do their part.  I  think,  so

far,  all  they  have  heard in the last  two  years  is,

"economy is bad, so cut CPF; economy is still bad, cannot

be choosy;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>

economy  may  still remain bad, must go for training  and

upgrade  yourself;  must remain relevant,  otherwise  you

will be in trouble."  Basically, keep striving; do not be

complacent, or else you will be left behind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me to my next point - implications of

this  requirement to upgrade on the family.  The  earlier

list  I  highlighted also noted that  training  was  more

prevalent  amongst  workers who are  single  compared  to

those who are married.  Of course, if we factor the issue

of  age  and  educational qualification, we will  realise

that  those  who need training most are not  getting  it.

This is not surprising as heavier family commitment could

have  hindered training participation amongst the married

persons.   Madam, to many Singaporeans, this is the  real

issue.  The average couple with two school-going children

work  during  the  day and spend the evening  supervising

their children's education, if they are capable of.  Some

have  difficulties even doing so.  Some have to work  two

jobs  to survive.  Now, we want them to train and upgrade

themselves, to develop our human capital.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this growing emphasis for Singaporeans to

develop  and upgrade to stay relevant and perhaps sharpen

their  competitive edge, we must seriously  consider  the

impact on the family.  Unless training opportunities  are

available  during working hours, most training  is  often

done after working hours.  There needs to be a supportive

infrastructure to enable this to be part  of  the  living

patterns  of Singaporeans.  Without such infrastructures,

many  will  find the pressures too harsh to  handle.   We

already  have  problems of latch-key  children  with  two

parents who have to work during the day.  Can you imagine

the phenomenon that will develop when parents have to  go

for  their  classes in the evenings?  These are  systemic

effects  that  will further challenge the institution  of

the  family.   Madam, with all these complex  demands  on

Singaporeans  and their families, do we wonder  why  many

Singaporeans  choose  to  remain  single  or   not   have

children?   I  would  like to support  the  call  by  Mdm

Halimah Yacob yesterday to set up the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>

National  Council  on  the  Family  to  ensure   a   more

systematic  and  systemic approach at  addressing  issues

affecting the family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A related aspect to the family is that of youths at

risk, as we enhance the human capital.  As we discuss the

impact  of this new development on the family, one  issue

that  arises  is  that of youths at risk.   Reports  have

recently  shown the sharp increase in juvenile crime  and

many  experts  attribute  it  to  the  lack  of  parental

supervision in the family.  Can you imagine what it would

mean  when  parents are expected to spend  more  time  in

training?  What will happen to the supervision  of  their

children?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for those children and youths who are already

victims   of   circumstance  and   currently   undergoing

rehabilitation, we must ensure that sufficient  resources

are  allocated  to allow them to develop their  potential

too.   Many do find it difficult to fit back into society

and  may  then graduate to be adult offenders.   We  must

prevent this from happening.  Madam, we must also do what

we  say.  When we say that every Singaporean matters,  we

must  recognise  their  potential  and  facilitate  their

enhancement, including those who have failed before.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I would like to touch on is that of

the  responsibility of the private sector in facilitating

this  whole notion about lifelong learning and  continued

education.  We have been asking much of Singaporeans  and

I  think Singaporeans have been trying their best  to  do

their  part.   They swallowed painfully the reality  when

told that their employers' CPF will not be restored fully

for  another two years.  Last year, during the debate  on

the CPF issue, I highlighted the need for employers to do

their  part.   This  is  even more crucial  in  terms  of

training.   The MOM study I cited earlier also  indicated

that workers in the public sector are twice as likely  to

have  gone for training compared to those in the  private

sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the public sector, as I was told, has a

policy  that  every civil servant has the  right  to  100

hours  of  training per year.  This is very  encouraging.

But I do not think there is any such policy for workers

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>

in  the  private  sector.  It is  up  to  the  respective

employers  to  facilitate the process for their  workers.

It  is  a  culture that has to be developed, but  if  the

environment is not conducive, then the value will not  be

internalised  by  the  people.  I encourage  the  private

sector  employers to also do their part  in  making  this

restructuring  work.  Much is provided for  them  in  the

Budget to facilitate their business but they must also do

their  part  in  making it easier for their  workers.   I

encourage the Government to consider mechanisms that will

recognise employers who are pro-training, as we recognise

pro-family firms.  A code in relation to training  rights

of workers akin to the one in the public sector should be

drawn up and implemented in the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the education profiles of our workers are

diverse  and  I  have made the point about the  different

approaches  needed to reach out to them.  The educational

levels  of our workers have also proportionally increased

over  time.  As we encourage the internalisation  of  the

value  of  lifelong  learning, we  need  to  ensure  that

Singaporeans  have  the means to upgrade  themselves  and

certainly take personal responsibility for their training

and  upgrading  processes.  The Government has  allocated

much  resources  in  this  regard,  through  the  various

programmes as well as through the Lifelong Learning Fund.

However,    in    line    with    encouraging    personal

responsibility, some of these workers may need to top  up

the course fees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another group of workers who may need substantial

resources   in   upgrading  are  the  professionals   and

graduates.   To  them, the only way up is  to  get  post-graduate  training.  Currently, however,  there  is  very

little support in this area.  I would recommend that  the

Government consider setting up a separate account in  the

CPF  called  the Lifelong Learning Account which  can  be

used  for  topping up of course fees as well as fees  for

post-graduate  training.  This will certainly  facilitate

Singaporeans'  ability to upgrade themselves,  especially

the  higher educated ones who already have the  necessary

motivations.  I recognise that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>

the  Government  has already raised the  tax  relief  for

course  fees  to $3,500 as well as allow tax  relief  for

fees  for  seminars  and  conferences.   This  is  indeed

laudable.   But the individual Lifelong Learning  Account

will  further  enhance  the ability  of  Singaporeans  to

internalise this value of lifelong learning.  The reality

is  that  very few Singaporeans have cash savings  to  be

used  for  upgrading and allowing them to use  their  CPF

savings will go a long way in this regard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the "re" words that I started out with imply

a  constant  process of change.  Any change  will  create

systemic  efforts on the different actors in the equation

-  from the workers to the families, to the employers and

subsequently  to the Government.  Each plays  a  critical

role.   The action of one will affect the others  and  we

need  to  speak  to  each other in a language  that  each

understands.  We know that we need to enhance  our  human

capital - indeed, I grew up being indoctrinated with this

point  that  human resource is our best and  only  asset.

For the people to accept this, they need to be convinced,

and  sold  too.   They need to own it.  I  encourage  the

Government not to tell them what to do, rather  to  share

with them what we can do to make this work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last recommendation is to produce a simplified

version of the ERC Report and let every Singaporean  have

it.   Allow Singaporeans to own the Report, the  process,

and the direction we are heading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Deputy Prime Minister, in summing up his Budget

Statement,  said that, "In a rapidly unfolding situation,

all  work must be done onboard ship while we are  sailing

and battling the elements. There is no safe harbour where

our ship can shelter to rebuild and refit, before heading

out  to  sea."  This statement has clearly spelt out  the

core  spirit of the Budget Statement this year, that  is,

the Government has the means to formulate

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>

many strategies to deal with and resolve every crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the best medicine for us to ride the storm

is  to  enable  our  people to emerge from  every  crisis

stronger,  more  resourceful  and  resilient,   so   that

Singapore could become an entrepreneurship and creativity

hub.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We never doubt the Government's wisdom in facing

with  any economic predicament and the courage it has  to

fight all the odds against us.  On this occasion, all the

various   cost-cutting  measures  and  the   pro-business

environment that is created are all very familiar to  us.

Many  MPs have spoken about these and I would not  repeat

these points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I would like to raise three points: firstly,

to  intensify  the  concern  for  small  and  even  micro

enterprises;   secondly,  educate  the  people   on   the

importance of promoting entrepreneurship; and thirdly, to

tell  how  difficult  it is for the Government  to  be  a

caring parent to us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government places much importance on the large

enterprises.  There is nothing wrong about it.   In  each

and  every Budget, special consideration is always  given

to  them,  and quite rightly so.  But the small and  even

micro   enterprises  among  us  seem  to  have  attracted

relatively  less  attention from the Government.  In  the

initial  stages, many of these small or micro enterprises

gave   full   play  to  the  fighting   spirit   of   the

entrepreneurs  to  become  the sources  of  future  large

entrepreneurs.   But  the road to success  is  inevitably

full  of hardships and difficulties. In the process, many

of them lost steam and phased out.  If we want more large

entrepreneurs to be born, should we not show more concern

for  the sources from which these large enterprises  were

evolved?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that some dialogue sessions be conducted

for  these small and even micro enterprises, to find  out

the needs and achievements of these enterprising fighters

who  had started off in a low profile, so that they could

make bigger contributions to society earlier.  At the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>

same  time,  we  should  introduce their  entrepreneurial

spirit and success stories to our people, and inspire the

growth of an entrepreneurial spirit among our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of late, we frequently read in the newspaper reports

of  young  people  starting  off  new  ventures  and  the

perspective  of  advocating entrepreneurship,  as  though

starting  new  business  ventures  is  the  best  way  to

overcome the economic predicament. In fact, what we  need

more  urgently is to cultivate the entrepreneurial spirit

of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A professor of Business Administration from the

Royal  Melbourne   Institute  of  Technology,  Australia,

spoke  at  a  youth  leadership forum  recently  that  to

encourage the people to venture into business, we have to

start by reforming our educational system to inculcate in

our young people the spirit of entrepreneurship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the spirit of entrepreneurship? To possess

the  spirit  one must dare to take risk, be  responsible,

creative,    farsighted,   have   the   will-power    and

perseverance.   Do  we provide the kind  of  training  to

equip our young school children with such a spirit?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest we compile the subject materials into a

drama  that can be performed in schools and case  studies

to  be  debated  upon. All the events  happening  in  our

society  should  also  be compiled as  case  studies  for

brainstorming  by our students in the secondary  schools,

junior colleges and universities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we could invite entrepreneurs of

various  age  groups to hold dialogue sessions  with  the

young   people,  and  train  our  students  during  their

schooling  days  to adapt to any kind  of  situation  and

environment.  On the surface, these activities may appear

to  have  nothing  to  do with the economy  but,  on  the

contrary, it is precisely the spirit that is most  needed

in   times  of  economic  difficulties.   The  spirit  of

entrepreneurship is the key spirit for Singapore to brave

the wind and the waves.  We should start cultivating this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>

sort  of entrepreneurial spirit among our people as early

as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, it is difficult to be parents. Yesterday,

Ms  Indranee cited the  example of this collision between

a  motorcar  and  the MRT train.  She  felt  that  people

should  ask: what on earth was the Mercedes doing on  the

MRT  track,  rather  than blame the  Government  for  not

taking  enough  preventive measures?  I  am  raising  all

these  examples to remind Singaporeans that  they  should

not be like the fourth  type of Singaporeans as described

by  Mr Seng Han Thong, that is, those ignorant people who

know  only how to complain, to blame others but never  to

blame themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote another example. Two days ago, I was

visiting  my  residents in Radin Mas.   The  owner  of  a

garment  shop  complained to me that the  Government  had

allowed  some other people to sell dresses near his  shop

and  stole away all his business.  He also commented that

the  HDB should have taken some measures to create a wave

of people passing by the area where his shop was located.

I  was  a bit curious.  So I went to take a look  at  the

dresses that he was selling in his shop.  The answer  was

obvious.   The  designs of his dresses were  so  outmoded

that  even  my  mother would think that  they  were  old-fashioned.   Who would buy his dresses?  So, rather  than

complaining, why does he not think of ways to resolve his

problem?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, Singaporeans should learn to be more self-reliant. In his Budget Statement, DPM Lee pointed out

the  way for Singapore to go.  At the same time, whatever

can  be  done for our people has already been  done.   Dr

Wang Kai Yuen has rightly pointed out that Government  is

not  a magician.  I think it is time for Singaporeans  to

make  contributions.  Ask not what the Government can  do

for you, but what you can do for yourself.  We have to be

more  realistic in our expectation in life.  Which  other

government  in  the world has this habit of  distributing

ang  pow  to  its  people?  Which other government  would

subsidise  its  people  to  attend  courses  and  upgrade

themselves?  I think ours is the first in the world.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very difficult to be parents. I firmly

believe  that,  as parents of our people, the  Government

will  continue to take good care of our people,  to  help

and  guide  them.  I also believe that, as children,  the

people  of  Singapore  should also  appreciate  the  good

intentions of our parents.  We should be responsible.  We

should  know  what  is right and what is  wrong,  and  be

responsible citizens of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mdm

Deputy Speaker, since 1997, we have been living under the

shadow   of  the  Asian  financial  crisis.   After   the

September 11 event and the Bali bombing in 2002,  we  are

further  faced  with  the problem of  terrorism.   It  is

difficult for us to predict how the future will be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this extraordinary time, the Government of

Singapore  is  proposing a $1.2 billion  deficit  budget,

with  lots  of utilities and SC&CC rebates, plus  another

$500  million  set aside for training programmes.   These

are very good measures.  The Government has done all that

it is expected to do. But the main concern now is to keep

the  jobs  for the employed, and train the unemployed  so

that they improve on their employability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would like to speak on the

problem  of unemployment and the entrepreneurship mindset

of our young people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our unemployment rate has not come down. The

forecast  is  that it would be between 4.5% and  5%  this

year.   It  is now difficult for those who are retrenched

to  find  another job, especially those who are not  well

educated and above the age of 45.  Having to compete with

younger  and better-educated workers is indeed an  uphill

task  for  them.  I  hope that the  Government  would  do

something to encourage the employers to take on the older

workers,  apart  from providing training  and  retraining

opportunities for these workers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In good times, of course, we think of automation,

computerisation to improve productivity and reduce labour

cost.  But in this difficult time, can we not change  the

employment attitude?  Under the premise of not increasing

the  cost  of labour, we can look into how we can  create

more  jobs for the people.  Let me give one example.   In

the  past, car washing at petrol stations was almost  all

done  by  automatic  car-washing  machines.  Nowadays,  I

observe that many petrol stations have switched to manual

washing.   Two  years ago, a certain  petrol  station  at

Jurong  West  Street 93 was planning to  install  a  car-washing  machine.  But,  because of  the  recession,  the

petrol  station proprietor gave up the idea of  automated

car  washing, and decided to invite the residents  nearby

to  provide manual car washing for his customers, working

on  a two-shift basis. They charge $5 for every wash, the

same as in the automatic car washing stations.  For every

car washed, $1 would be paid to the petrol station, while

the  remaining $4 will be shared by the workers. With  60

to  80  cars washed daily, each car-washer will get  some

$1,500  a  month.  The  petrol station  proprietor  earns

$2,000 a month, without having to commit a capital outlay

for  the  automatic car-washing machine. If every  petrol

station  can  have about 10 people working as car-washers

and  with  some  200 petrol stations in  Singapore,  some

2,000  jobs are created.   I think this kind of idea  can

only be generated in the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrowing from this concept, I would like to make

some  suggestions for the public sector. For  convenience

and easy administration, the canteens in most schools are

let out to contractors on a tender system. The successful

tenderer  would  then sublet the various  stalls  to  the

individual  hawkers at a higher rate. Many stalls  remain

vacant  as the hawkers could not afford the high  rental.

In  good  times,  this may be a good way  of  management.

Now, with the high unemployment rate, can the Ministry of

Education  consider changing the system  by  renting  the

stalls  directly  to  the  individuals,  preferably   the

residents  nearby,  so that they will  not  have  to  pay

higher rents to the canteen operator.  In this way,  more

people will get

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>

the  chance to earn a living at a lower cost.  Of course,

administratively, it will be a bit difficult but  it  can

create more jobs for Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to talk about building up team

work.   Globally,   the  global  political  and  economic

scenes have changed. We can now sell our Singapore brands

to  the world market, and this is one way for our SMEs to

survive.   The  GLCs  and  some  of  the  larger  private

companies have already gone into China, India and Vietnam

for  their  development.  But, in respect of  encouraging

team  work and entrepreneurship, we can do better.   SIA,

PSA,  JTC, HDB etc, have already become well known brands

in  Asia and all over the world.  These GLCs can take the

lead  and leverage on their experience and reputation  to

take on the role of matchmaker to take our SMEs into  the

international  markets,  such  as  China,   where   every

businessman  would aspire to enter. It is a  big  market,

full of attractions for everybody.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in order to have a competitive edge in China, we

must  first of all satisfy three preconditions: financial

capital, energy and a team.  You must have large capital,

you  must have a team which you can depend upon  and  you

need to have the entrepreneurial spirit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we invest in China, we compete not only with

the  Chinese traders but we compete with the  world.   So

China  has  become a centre of contention for  the  whole

world.   One  example is the Taiwanese  investors.   They

have their people in Guangdong, Shanghai, Jiangsu and the

Suzhou Industrial Park.  They work as a team.   They have

a   good   financial  funding  system  for  international

investments  and  development.  They have  this  kind  of

entrepreneurial  spirit.   Their  projects  are   closely

watched  and esteemed by the Chinese Government. But  the

Singapore  SMEs do not have this advantage when  they  go

over to China.  Our investors tend to play solo when they

venture  into China without the support of a  team.  They

lack  capital,  and they cannot do much  to  develop  and

establish  themselves.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has built the Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP)

which  is  now well known throughout China.  Recently,  I

visited  Qingdao in the Shangdong province.  An  official

there told me that he and many of his colleagues had gone

to  the  Suzhou Industrial Park to learn.  I  asked  what

they  were  learning from the SIP.  He replied that  they

were  there to learn the Singapore management system  and

the Singapore experience.  Our endeavours at the SIP have

created   a  good  impression  on  the  senior  officials

throughout China.  When asked further, he said  that  the

Chinese   entrepreneurs  learnt  from   Singapore   about

planning,  administration and management; from  Taiwanese

they  learnt  how to make money; and from the Hongkongers

they learnt about entrepreneurship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having learnt from them, the Chinese now have all

these three pre-conditions to success.  They will be able

to  break through their old framework and make a  lot  of

money. Their economic growth was around 8% every year for

the  past  five  years.   So, we  must  seize  the  first

available  opportunity to go to China, preferably  within

the next five years, otherwise we will miss the boat.  In

Singapore, we have already good management, planning  and

experience.  We should next learn from the Taiwanese  how

to  make  money  and  learn from  the  Hongkongers  about

entrepreneurship.  After having acquired all these,  then

can we make a world for ourselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With very keen global competition, we want to be

able to create products and services to compete with  the

world.    Then   we  must  be  able  to  strengthen   our

entrepreneurship.   To promote entrepreneurship,  overall

efforts are required for a sustained period of time.   It

depends on not just the Government, but also on the  kind

of  social  culture  to promote entrepreneurship  and  to

change the mindset of the individuals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government departments must also change their

mindset, so as to create a good environment conducive  to

the  cultivation of entrepreneurship.  Senior

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>

Minister   Lee   spoke   at  the  Nanyang   Technological

University  that  Singaporeans must turn  away  from  the

existing mindset of over-dependence on the Government  if

they want to continue to enjoy prosperity.  I think it is

a very important message.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GLCs should not depend too much on the

Government.   They must take the lead to help  our  local

enterprises to go out of Singapore and into the world, to

sell  our  brand  overseas and not just  to  stay  on  in

Singapore and compete with our own SMEs, sharing the very

small pie with them.  To become a globalised city and  to

promote  entrepreneurship, we must be able to  step  into

areas that others have not developed before.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social problems. Young people in Singapore are very

lucky.   They are born in a very comfortable and affluent

society.   They  enjoy  a good living  environment,  good

education  and  are  able to learn from  the  information

technology such as the Internet.  They thus get to  learn

from information from all over the world.  It is apparent

that  the young people nowadays have better opportunities

than  we  did.   There  should be more  consciousness  of

national patriotism.  But they are apathetic to politics.

They  are not interested in national and current affairs.

They  are indifferent to the threat of terrorism  and  to

the  possible  effect of the war in  Iraq,  or  even  the

souring  of the Singapore-Malaysia relations.  Yet,  they

chase  after their favourite pop stars, such as  the   F4

and the 5566 . They are simply crazy over these idols.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a more serious note, according to a survey, more

than  10%  of  our students in the institutes  of  higher

learning  do not know who the Prime Minister of Singapore

is.    I think this is some mindset that we cannot accept

- young people who care only for themselves and the world

around  them. They  think only about where to travel  to,

but  do  not care about major national events.  They  are

simply bo chap - they do not care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are all very serious problems for the nation.

The young must take this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>

matter   very  seriously.   We  cannot  allow   this   to

deteriorate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the motion.

<br>4.18 pm

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Thank

you,  Mdm Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to join in this

debate.   I  will  not  belabour on some  of  the  points

already  raised in this House over the Budget, except  to

say  that I fully support the calls made earlier to  make

sites  more affordable for businesses to thrive, to  look

deep  into  what brands Singapore and makes us unique  in

this area in a globalised world, and to identify what are

the key performance indicators.  To follow up on what the

Senior  Minister of State, Mr Khaw Boon Wan's point  that

we  believe  truly that we do not confuse us  being  good

with what really makes us great, because that affects our

performance and how we aspire.  Having said that, I would

like to raise three main points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, on training and retraining programmes. It

is  commendable  that  the  Government  is  pumping  $500

million  into  the Lifelong Learning Fund,  bringing  the

total  to  $1.5 billion.  It is equally commendable  that

the  Ministry of Manpower has also pumped more money into

the Skills Redevelopment Programme.  These are pro-active

measures.  However, sometimes one has to be a little  bit

cautious  in  getting consoled over sheer  numbers.   The

programmes we have are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Skills Redevelopment Programme;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) NTUC Education and Training Fund that provides

union members training;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) IT Literacy courses to equip workers with IT

skills;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) BEST/WISE programmes;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Critical Enabling Skills Programme;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) Certification courses for those in technical

fields; and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) Workskills Training Programme, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list is quite long, the website is quite

interesting.   However,  my  concern  here  is:  is  this

information  going down to the retrenched worker  or  any

worker,  so that he knows what is this buffet of  courses

that  is available, and what each of these courses  gives

him  in terms of a better job prospect or a better skill-based kind of training that will take him further?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therein lies my main concern. The changing dynamics

facing  a worker today puts more onus on the worker  than

the  employer to know what is out there, to pick  up  the

courses  that  are relevant to him to make him  a  better

worker  and, more importantly, relevant, so that  he  can

feed himself and his family.  In this case, it is gender-neutral.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am talking primarily about a change in mindset, in

how   we   administer  these  training  programmes.    If

ownership is in the hands of the employee, then he or she

can  attend  training courses with the blessings  of  the

company.   For this to work, it is important  to  develop

independent  industry-focused career  development  units,

rather  than  company-based  human  resource  development

units.   This  way, the worker can be counselled  on  his

particular  industry,  beyond the  company's  needs.   To

expect employers to work out good strategies for employee

development can only go so far, as the employer will,  at

the  end of the day, be more interested in his or her own

profits for the company.  Though the Ministry of Manpower

and  the  unions have enforced a number of good practices

where development/enhancement of workers is concerned, at

the  end of the day, the sourcing and development of  new

programmes is not happening fast enough, as it  has  been

dictated  by  the demands of the employer.  An  employee-demand  on programmes cuts through this problem  also  of

encouraging workers to attend training courses  and  help

them to take total ownership over their whole career.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also qualify that I make this suggestion in

the hope that it can be applied with a greater thrust  to

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>

younger  workers right now who are more  nimble  and  can

ascertain for themselves what they want where their  work

life  processes  are concerned.  In this aspect,  I  also

endorse  what  has  been raised  by  Mrs  Lim  Hwee  Hua,

especially when it concerns the younger workers, that  we

do  not  think  about  it  anymore  as  an  end-point  of

retirement  age  at 55 or 62.  The earlier  we  put  such

practices  into reality for younger workers,  perhaps  it

will  not be so severe for them in a world that is making

more demands day by day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has already been said about Mr Sim Wong Hoo's

piece  entitled "NUTS" and the need to nurture creativity

and  entrepreneurship.  I would  just  like  to  add  one

important point of view here.  I feel strongly that  more

space must be created by middle and top management levels

to  allow workers to try out new initiatives.  What do  I

mean  by  "space"?  It is important to allow for mistakes

to  happen.   Hopefully, it will not be too  costly,  but

part  of  that creative process is to make mistakes.   In

finding new solutions, when it comes to mistakes, that in

itself   is   a  creative  process.   It  is   easy   for

institutions and companies to be lulled into a  state  of

complacency  when  many of their employees  are  in  WITS

programmes  and other sub-committees.  That is  fine  and

well.    But   what  is  more  important  is  the   daily

interaction within the office space, eg, how  the  middle

or  top  management  layer  or even  the  immediate  line

supervisor  reacts to the worker in the field,  what  are

the  suggestions  that are taken on board,  because  each

suggestion is a creative process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we do tend to fall into this trap of a box.

When it is time to think WITS, we wear our creative hats.

Outside of WITS, we think of how can we follow the rules.

Rules are guidelines to direct an outcome in a consistent

manner.  Perhaps, sometimes it is good to follow  what  I

heard from a certain CEO:  "Just go ahead and do it.   If

it  is wrong, then ask for forgiveness later."  So, being

bound  by rules, the fear of making mistakes has crippled

quite   a  lot  of  us  into  not  being  able  to  think

creatively.    I  think  the  Minister   of   State   for

Entrepreneurship will have to take this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>

on-board  in  how  to  make us  less  fearful  of  making

mistakes.   In my view, this has become one big  dampener

in  trying to create an environment that will help people

to think differently and try out new areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is with regard to job losses and

retrenchments.   Like  Mdm Halimah,  I  am  concerned  if

enough  has  already  been  done  internally  within   an

institution  first before the decision to shed  jobs  was

arrived  at.  One example I can think of here  is  Ikea's

philosophy.  For a long time, they have always looked  at

wanting to make their furniture affordable to the  income

bracket that they are targeting at, ie, the middle income

earners.  One way that they have gone about doing  it  is

to  ensure  that  even  top management  staff  do  travel

economy  class.  Sometimes, in a far-reaching event  like

this  that  we are faced with today, when we have  to  go

through  the process of retrenchment, it is also good  to

relook  at the processes within a company, to see whether

they  have been cost-effective enough from top-down.   If

not,  perhaps  it is time to have certain guidelines  for

public  and private institutions that will ensure  longer

term  employability for a good workforce that is keen  to

keep  up with skills training, rather than the bottom-end

paying  the  price  for the top-end,  or  for  bad  cost-effective  structures that were put  into  place  in  the

company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other concern I have about job shedding is: how

many  of  our employers have really explored job  sharing

and flexi-time management schemes before the decision  to

shed   workers   was  arrived  at?   Perhaps,   such   an

accountability,  that this has not  really  worked,  will

help  us to understand why quite a number of workers have

had  to lose their job.  This is also perhaps a good time

for  such  companies  to be persuaded  to  pick  up  such

schemes  and to put them in place.  Many companies  have,

for  a long time, felt they do not want to get into these

schemes   because   they  are  messy,   they   complicate

administrative  processes,  especially  job  sharing  and

flexi-time.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I applaud the initiatives of South West CDC

and  North East CDC in their joint ventures with  various

Ministries  to  retrain  retrenched  workers  into  child

minders  and  into  caring for the elderly.   These  are,

right  now,  gaps in our services.  To fill up  that  gap

with  people  who  do  need  jobs,  retrain  them  is  an

excellent  idea.   In my opinion, there  are  also  other

opportunities  in  other services if we  can  get  enough

training  funds and trainers, eg, assistant  teachers  in

special  education  schools, more administrative  support

for  schools, more estate management staff in  hospitals.

The  older  and  more mature retrenched  workers  can  be

trained  as para-counsellors too, so that they  can  help

families in crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned that we do not forget the number of

workers  with inactive CPF accounts.  I think Dr Jennifer

Lee  has  also  brought this up - the self-employed,  the

homemakers and some disabled members.  For the homemakers

and  disabled, this will be an even harder time to return

to  or enter into the workforce for the first time.  Some

of them may have dependants with them.  I think we should

not  forget  that  they  would be finding  it  difficult.

Also, how do we keep them on the radar screen?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has also offered rebates to

help  residents, based on house types.  That is well  and

good.   Perhaps, may I also suggest that we go  a  little

bit  further  and take into account retrenched  residents

who may have a tough time finding a job, because they may

be  living  in 5-room flats, etc, so that they can  enjoy

such rebates at least for a while longer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, much has been said yesterday about a budget

deficit.   I  think we can live with one, as it  is  more

humane to help people get along with their lives, and  it

is  also  the right thing to do.  The right thing  to  do

here  also  is to be mindful of the charities  scene,  as

hard-hitting  times usually mean less  money  flowing  to

beneficiaries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the Budget Statement.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Jurong):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker,

I  rise  in  support  of the Deputy  Prime  Minister  and

Minister for Finance's Budget for FY 2003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that we are realistic and bold enough to

have  a deficit budget.  Whatever the amount, it is still

an effort to deal with the current economic situation.  I

also   strongly  support  the  idea  of  the  Ministerial

Committee  on  Services headed by Deputy  Prime  Minister

Lee,  and  having Minister of State, Mr Raymond  Lim,  to

take  charge  of  the  Government's effort  to  encourage

entrepreneurship   in  Singapore.   I  congratulate   the

Ministry of Manpower for setting up a statutory board for

Continuing Education and Training to coordinate  training

and employment assistance efforts for workers.

We are indeed facing challenging and difficult times.  We

see    greater    global   competition,    retrenchments,

unemployment and restructuring.  It must be  one  of  the

most  difficult  times for us since independence.   I  am

confident that we will pull through this period  just  as

successfully.  I say this because in the last  35  years,

we  have diligently built up our competencies.  Singapore

itself is a reputable brand.  Our competencies reside  in

our   GLCs,   our   advanced  technologies,   our   local

businesses,  our  SMEs, our educated  workforce  and  our

management  expertise.  I think we should not feel  sorry

for  our  strong  GLCs  and also  our  strong  management

expertise.   This  is  our  comparative  advantage.   Our

growth  has  been described as a miracle. 35  years  ago,

without  any  resources, we succeeded.   Today,  we  have

built  up  so much experience and expertise, we  have  no

reason not to continue to succeed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To move forward, we must all consolidate our

competencies.   ERC has not left any stone unturned,  and

the  Government  has accepted the ERC's  recommendations.

So,  instead of pointing fingers at each other,  we  must

now  find  ways  to  work hard and fast  together.   Like

Senior  Minister  of State, Mr Khaw  Boon  Wan  has  said

yesterday,  we  need to work fast and  find  strength  in

unity.   Both  the private and public sectors  must  find

synergy to deal

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>

with the challenges.  We must identify our strengths  and

weaknesses and move ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not be afraid to ride on the economic growth

of   other  countries,  such  as  China,  India,   Japan,

Southeast  Asia, Europe, USA and Australia.   We  already

have Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with a number of them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To succeed, we need special ingredients. I am

referring  to a fighting spirit to overcome the  economic

challenges.  Now, what we must have is the will to win.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domestically, we should also strengthen our economy.

As  our  economy  matures, our spending  and  consumption

patterns  become more diverse, corresponding to different

levels of disposable income.  I perceive these as falling

into   three  tiers.   At  the  top  tier  are   high-end

enterprises selling high-end luxury goods.  In the middle

tier are mid-priced brands with a mass-market appeal.  At

the  lowest tier are very basic consumption goods  served

up  in modest surroundings, with minimum packaging and no

frills.   They  are  usually associated with  traditional

small  local  services-based enterprises, like  old-style

kopitiams,  market  stalls or small neighbourhood  shops.

They serve to build and strengthen the character of local

communities,  and also help to preserve the arts,  crafts

and  also  cuisine  that  form a  part  of  our  cultural

heritage.   More  importantly,  these  local  traditional

enterprises  all  share  humble beginnings.   Their  very

existence  reminds  us  daily that  as  long  as  one  is

determined  and  prepared to work hard, any  self-reliant

Singaporean can make a decent, honest living.  Thus, more

importantly, the third tier enterprises also create jobs.

I  think  the  entrepreneur, Ms Olivia Lum, is  one  good

example.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I believe there is much merit in

taking  a  closer  look  at  this  third  tier  of  small

traditional local enterprises, and ensuring that they too

benefit   from   the   Government's  measures   to   help

businesses.  Without them, we would be left with  a  much

duller  and  bleaker landscape that bores and disappoints

residents and visitors.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Government to preserve the existence of

such  enterprises and trades in suburban areas,  such  as

Tiong  Bahru  and Little India.  As far as  possible,  we

should  avoid  resettling or relocating such  businesses,

even  if  it means the urban landscape becomes  a  little

less  tidy and neatly demarcated.  I am heartened to note

that  discussions  on the importance of  retaining  "old-world  charm" has become more prominent in public forums,

and that the Government has taken the views of the public

into consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, not everything about the old world is

charming.  I support regular maintenance and upgrading of

the  operating premises of such businesses, and improving

public  safety and access.  In doing so, we  should  take

care  to retain the original character of the place,  and

make sure that operating costs for the enterprises do not

rise  by too much. The refurbishment of the Maxwell  Road

Food  Centre  is a successful example of upgrading.   The

hygiene,  ventilation and lighting have  improved,  while

the  original open-air character and original layout have

been preserved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I have discussed some ways of

ensuring  that this third tier of small local enterprises

does  not erode away.  I believe it is also important  to

ensure  that  those Singaporeans who wish to  enter  this

tier to start small businesses and micro enterprises  can

do  so  with  minimum  costs and minimum  red  tape.  The

concept of providing one-stop services to help businesses

establish  themselves in Singapore is not new.   EDB  has

been  employing  this strategy to attract big  businesses

and  MNCs  to locate in Singapore.  The Government's  on-going  efforts  to  reduce red tape have  also  benefited

private  enterprises.  For instance, the one-stop  Public

Entertainment   Licensing  Centre  helps   operators   of

entertainment outlets obtain all the necessary  approvals

from multiple licensing agencies at one go.  I think  the

Ministry  of  Home  Affairs has done  a  good  job  here.

However,  more can be done.  I urge that this  regulatory

model and supportive mindset be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>

extended to all forms of businesses and trades.  To  give

an  example  of  red tape, the setting  up  of  the  NTUC

Foodfare  kiosk of about 140 square feet at  Jurong  East

MRT took more than one year, and involved working with as

many  as  seven  different  Government  agencies.   Large

organisations may have the resources and the patience  to

wait for administrative details to be sorted out with the

relevant   authorities.    But   small   businesses    or

individuals may feel frustrated and discouraged as  their

livelihood  and  survival is at stake.  Every  day  spent

waiting means another day of lost opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More generally, I also urge the Government to look

into  promoting  all  parts of the services  sector.  The

Government  has  already  announced  plans  to  introduce

measures to promote the high value-added segments of  the

services   industry,  such  as  financial  services   and

telecommunications.  However, not everyone  who  wants  a

job in these high-value added segments will be assured of

one.   I urge the Committee to consider targeted measures

to help Singaporeans enter the more conventional segments

of  the services industry, such as becoming nurses,  home

helpers,  hairdressers, retail sales personnel,  waiters,

entertainers,  security  guards  or  hawkers.   This   is

especially  relevant  to  those  workers  who  have  been

retrenched from the manufacturing sector and are prepared

to consider working in the services sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to urge the Ministerial Committee to

consider  how best to attract young talent from all  over

the  world  to come to Singapore to provide  services  in

joint ventures with our local youth.  For example, in the

areas  of  accounting  and management,  water  treatment,

environmental  management,  early  childhood   education,

preparation  for examinations, food, property management,

logistics,   hotel   management,  entertainment,   music,

design,  etc,  many may have good ideas but lack  funding

and  resources.  How do we ensure that the same  kind  of

investment  support that is available  to  manufacturing,

the  IT  industry and the biomedical cluster is available

to start-ups in the services industry?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the economic outlook is uncertain, I

feel  confident that Singaporeans will be  able  to  find

niche  markets in the services sector and  do  well.  For

instance,  there  is  a  group of  Singaporean  musician-entrepreneurs who have been making waves in the  regional

Mandarin pop music industry.  I am not only referring  to

famous  pop  stars like Kit Chan or Stefanie Sun,  but  a

group of producers and musicians like Li Si Song, Li  Wei

Song  and Xu Huan Liang, who have produced numerous  hits

and  impressed listeners and fans in Taiwan,  Hong  Kong,

Malaysia  and  China.   I am told that  a  long  line  of

regional  pop stars are queuing up for our local  singer-songwriter   Tanya  Chua  to  write   their   next   hit.

Meanwhile,  I  have  also been told by friends  returning

from visits to major Chinese cities that every other shop

seems  to be playing the latest hits of A-Do, our  latest

male  pop  export.   We also possess  some  of  the  best

equipped  and professional music studios in  the  region,

attracting scores of stars to record albums here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the secret of these musicians' success? It

is not in copying or imitating pop music industry workers

in  Taiwan  and  China.  In fact, it is  precisely  their

unique  Singaporean characteristics that  create  demand.

Singaporeans  are  prized  in  the  industry  for   being

thoroughly  familiar with Western as well as Eastern  pop

music and being able to interpret the latest global music

trends  quickly  and creatively for a regional  audience.

In other words, they serve as an effective bridge between

cultures and add value while translating trends.  This is

a direct result of our exposure to the West as well as to

the  East, in a multi-racial and multi-cultural  society.

If our musicians can play this role in the region, surely

this  inspires other professions in the services  sector.

I urge the Ministerial Committee to highlight and promote

other  such examples of new engines of growth within  our

services industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would like to touch on the area of use of

scarce resources.  With the economic uncertainty ahead of

us,  it is prudent for us to re-examine the uses to which

we put our scarce resources and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>

ensure that help goes to those who need it most.  In this

respect,  I  support  the Government's  move  to  further

expand  the  use of means testing to allocate  healthcare

subsidies.    The  means  testing  framework   that   the

Government has introduced for step-down care three  years

ago  has benefited patients and their families.  I  would

like  to  congratulate the Ministry of  Health  for  this

effort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Ministry of Health is not the only

Government  agency  that administers subsidies  to  needy

individuals.  Other agencies, such as MCDS,  MOE,  MinLaw

and  CDCs,  also  administer subsidy  schemes,  all  with

different  criteria  and  requirements.   I  propose  the

Government  consider streamlining these  subsidy  schemes

and  apply  a common means testing framework.  This  will

reduce the need for those who need financial help to make

frequent  and multiple income declarations, and  also  to

reduce  duplication of work between Government  officials

in  processing  their  applications  and  auditing  their

declarations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to applaud the Government for

establishing a portable medical benefits scheme  to  help

workers  pay for healthcare even when they are in between

jobs.   This is a welcome addition to our existing social

safety  nets.  I would like to ask for how  long  is  the

medical coverage planned to last for each insured  person

while not employed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still on the issue of scarce national resources, I

have   observed  constant  improvements   made   by   the

Government  in  allocating resources amongst  Ministries.

We  have moved from Budgeting for Results to Managing for

Excellence and now Resource Accounting.  However, I think

it  would be beneficial for the House to learn more about

the  budgeting principles used by Ministries to  allocate

resources to various projects and programmes.   How  does

each  Ministry prioritise amongst different policy  areas

of   concern  and  measure  the  effectiveness  of   each

programme?    In  the  last  few  years,   large   inter-ministerial  committees involving  the  contributions  of

large  numbers  of Singaporeans have been  set  up.   Are

there

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>

any   plans  to  monitor  the  effectiveness   of   their

recommendations?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would like to conclude with

some   thoughts  on  the  next  step  for  Singapore   in

maintaining  our  competitiveness in the global  economy.

Much   has   been   said  about  measures   on   economic

restructuring  to  ensure  that our  fundamentals  remain

sound.   However,  competition in the global  economy  is

waged on many fronts.  It is as much about being a choice

destination for people all over the world, as it is about

effective  governance, having a flexible  labour  market,

competitive  cost  structure  and  a  safe   and   secure

environment.   What  is  it about  Singapore  that  makes

people want to visit us, to work and to play here, or  to

sink  roots here?  What is it about Singapore that  makes

our own citizens want to stay here and to contribute?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, I urge the Government to consider more

creative  ways  to shape the vision for  Singapore  as  a

choice destination and the best home.

<br><br><!-- Dr Gan See Khem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Gan See Khem (Nominated Member):</b> Mdm Deputy

Speaker, thank you for giving me the opportunity to raise

some  of  the issues regarding Deputy Prime Minister  Lee

Hsien Loong's speech on the Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many speakers ahead of me who have brought

up  various  issues  regarding  the  Budget  on  manpower

training and promoting private enterprise.  I come to you

at  this  late  afternoon to put a little  more  personal

perspective into the issue of private enterprises and its

development in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I represent the business community and both the

Singapore  Business Federation and the Singapore  Chinese

Chamber  of  Commerce and Industry had made responses  to

the  Budget  Statement, and both these associations  have

welcomed the Deputy Prime Minister's pro-business budget.

This  is  a budget that has signified that the Government

is responding to the appeal of the private sector for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>

lowering  cost of doing business and giving opportunities

for SMEs to develop in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the Singapore SMEs have struggled since 1997

when  the economic crisis hit Singapore and the  rest  of

Asia.   Many of us in the private sector have  felt  that

the  support  from the Government is very much  welcomed,

but  for  many  of the business sectors in Singapore,  we

have  gone from a stage of relative strength in  1996  to

today where many in the private sector are in a very weak

stage.   The effort to reduce the cost of doing  business

is  welcomed, but we are also talking about Singapore now

in  the  stage where there is reduced demand,  where  the

market is not growing, demand is not increasing and where

many  people  are  much more cautious  about  consumption

because  of  their  fear of employability  and  financial

security.   So, the private sector welcomes the  lowering

of  cost,  keeping the CPF lower for the next two  years,

but we are now struggling with issues of how to transform

our businesses and make it more viable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We listen to the Government's earlier encouragement

to go regional.  But we also realise that businesses have

to  be strong in their home economy before they are  able

to  have  the resources and the capacity to go  regional.

In  Singapore,  many of the companies, the  ones  that  I

represent, also do not find it easy to grow.  May  I  use

this  opportunity  to  also illustrate  a  very  personal

experience.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the recession hit Asia in 1997/98 we see, at

Health   Management  International  (HMI),   much   fewer

patients from the region coming to Singapore.  We  are  a

medical group and we see fewer foreign patients.  We also

see  many  of the patients, who used to come to  use  our

facilities,  now  going to restructured hospitals.   They

are  going to restructured hospitals because their income

is  going  down or they fear for their own job  security.

So  they  are moving to restructured hospitals where  the

services  are  good and where they are  able  to  receive

subvention.  There is no way for a private

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>

sector  hospital  group to be able to  compete  with  the

subvention  of restructured hospitals.  For this  reason,

our  performance,  as  a  commercial  enterprise,  dipped

significantly,  especially last year, as we  got  weaker.

Last  year,  we hit a very difficult patch and  HMI  lost

money.   It  is  not news.  Many of the  members  in  the

business sector were in the losing position the last  two

years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we do in helping local enterprises

restructure and respond, and how can we ensure  that  our

local enterprises are able to build their strength in the

local economy and move out to compete regionally?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we restructured, many of us in the private sector

felt  that  our  local banking system has not  been  most

encouraging.  As SMEs restructured and struggled with the

need  to  transform and re-engineer,  we  find  that  the

banking  sector has not been supportive.  And  they  have

not been supportive also because there are fewer banks to

work with.  So, as local businesses restructured, we find

a  less  than supportive banking sector, where the  banks

are  more  concerned with how they get their  money  back

than  how they are able to fund promising local SMEs  and

how  they are able to help these local SMEs transform and

grow again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, manpower issue. Private sector companies

are  competing  with  GLCs, statutory boards,  Government

sector  and  MNCs for the same small talent  pool.   But,

private  sector enterprises are not able to  compete  and

offer  such  high  salaries, good benefits,  as  well  as

opportunities  for growth as the larger organisations  in

the  public sector, the MNCs and GLCs.  Hence we see that

the  main  problem of running local SMEs is that  we  are

working with very, very small manpower resources.  Is the

Government  able  to help us?  Yes, I  think  the  recent

budget  allocation for manpower upgrading  and  all  that

will  be  able to help us recruit more talents  into  our

workforce.   But, for many of us in the local SMEs,  this

has been, and will continue to be, most challenging.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, many of the SMEs are struggling to create new

businesses out of a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>

very  difficult local operating environment.  Many of  us

in  the  private  sector have to contend with  regulatory

measures  and  Government agencies to seek  the  required

support, permits, licensing, to get our businesses  done.

Many  of  the speakers before me have mentioned that  the

Government  agencies  have  been  very  bound  by  rules.

Whilst  I  applaud  many in the civil service  have  been

trying  very hard not to bend the rules but to help  SMEs

get along with the approval processes, this has been time-consuming.  If we are running a big enterprise, if we are

running  a  big  organisation, with  lots  of  resources,

whether  it is manpower or financial, I think the process

of  waiting for approval to happen would be okay.  But if

you  are  running a SME with very little human  resource,

very  small human resource capability, and with very thin

financial  capability,  you  find  that  the  process  of

approval  takes  so  long  and it  is  a  very  expensive

process, and SMEs would find it most difficult to be able

to  finance  the waiting process of all these  regulatory

approvals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cite some recent experiences. When the hard

times  hit HMI, we decided to transform our business from

a  health  services provider to a trainer  of  healthcare

workers.   The logic is very simple.  When you cannot  do

the  business in one sector you quickly transform into  a

sector  where there is more demand.  We have  transformed

out  of  the  services sector because of the  competition

that  we  have  from the restructured hospitals  and  the

shrinking  foreign  and  local patients  to  the  private

sector.  I think that is fine.  In businesses we have  to

switch our course fast.  But when we hit on the idea  for

training, and we still believe that it is a good  concept

because  the  healthcare sector has  a  huge  demand  for

healthcare workers, so we thought that would be something

that  is worthwhile doing.  And because of the recession,

many  of  the  people who would normally  not  enter  the

health service workforce have come forward and apply  for

opportunities to be trained as healthcare workers.  So we

have  a situation facing an SME where you have identified

a new business

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>

sector where the demand is clear, meaning people who  are

trained  for  the  healthcare  sector  actually  do   get

employed.  The employability rate is very high.   We  are

talking about 75-95% employability after training  for  a

healthcare  career.  So what problems did we  face  as  a

private sector?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem we face was that though the Government

has  been  very  encouraging in its  efforts  to  provide

training  and upgrading opportunities for the  unemployed

and  retrenched into service areas where  they  can  find

jobs  - I think the general support has always been there

from  day  one  -  what was difficult was  the  different

agencies  that were involved with this approval  process,

for  example, my experience with the approval process for

one course, the "Enrolled Nurse Training".  Singapore has

used  a  lot of foreign workers to staff the lower levels

of  the  workforce in terms of patient care.  So many  of

us,  when  we go into restructured hospitals  or  private

hospitals,  feel  that  we  could  be  anywhere,  in  the

Philippines  or China, due to the sheer number  of  these

foreign workers in our hospitals in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if we were to train our locals, what do we do?

We  went  to  the  Ministry of Health.  We  went  to  the

Singapore  Nursing Board and said that we have this  idea

and  this  is the curriculum.  We want to train  enrolled

nurses  because there is a huge demand for  them  amongst

our  local hospitals and, as we see it, many Singaporeans

who  are retrenched and unemployed would like to come and

train  for  a  career  that  has  potential  for  further

development as well as stability and fairly good  income.

The  approval  process from the Singapore  Nursing  Board

took more than six months.  And, as we waited, there were

many  changes  to  the structure.  We  need  the  Nursing

Board's  approval  before we can get  the  NTUC  and  the

Skills  Development  Fund  to  approve  the  courses  for

training  and  subsidy.  So all these approval  processes

took six months, nine months, and we are still working on

it today - many, many months after we had started.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke to our colleague, Dr Ng Eng Hen, earlier and

he said to bring it up in the House.  I said yes, I will.

I  threw away my prepared script and speak from my  heart

and  from my experience because I am not the only example

in  Singapore.   I  speak  from  my  experience  with  my

colleagues in the Chinese Chamber and the other  business

sectors.   Whilst we want to encourage local  enterprise,

we   want   to  encourage  creation  of  new  jobs,   new

businesses,  new  opportunities, I think  the  Government

needs to look not only at reducing business cost.  I hate

to  be  ungrateful when I said that, because the business

community  has  been  urging  the  Government  to  reduce

business  cost, and now that they have done  it,  we  say

that  is  not enough.  It is a very important gesture  to

reduce business cost but also to look into all the  other

circumstances  that  create a  very  difficult  operating

environment  for our SMEs and for the SMEs to  transform,

to  grow  into  strong enterprises so that  we  can  move

regionally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, using my own examples, I take the

Government's   directions  with  very   serious   belief,

conviction  and consideration.  The Government  said  the

market  here is small, go regional.  So as an  enterprise

we  went regional, not very far, just 300-400 km north of

Singapore,  we  went into another country  to  operate  a

hospital.   All is well, except that local SMEs  find  it

immensely difficult to raise funds in Singapore to invest

outside of Singapore.  And this is why earlier I said  we

have  got  to  groom  our local SMEs  to  be  financially

strong,  to  have a significant market share, to  develop

human  resource  and  accumulate financial  resources  in

order for them to compete well in the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my experience has indicated that there are

terrific market opportunities for healthcare service  out

of  Singapore,  but as a local SME how  do  I  go  there?

Local  banks  do not lend to SMEs who go regional.   They

lend  to  SMEs not on your projects outside of Singapore,

but  on  your  capability to borrow in  Singapore,  which

again  boils  down  to  your financial  resources  within

Singapore.  What is there that you can collaterise?  What

is there that the banks will find it worthwhile to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>

lend   you  in  your  Singapore  operations?   Not   what

opportunities  you have and the future stream  of  income

you  can  bring  back to your headquarters  in  Singapore

because   of   your   wise  and  good  investments   into

opportunities out of Singapore.  Therein lie the problems

that  SMEs face and SMEs are still confronted with.  Many

SMEs,  whilst waiting for pro-business measures  to  come

from the Government, have been weakened and will continue

to  weaken  if  some of these measures do not  come  fast

enough.   When these measures and policies come,  if  the

civil service, the administration arm, does not implement

these  measures fast enough, we will see many, many  more

SMEs  failing, falling on the wayside, before things  get

better.
