<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE HARBOUR BOARD</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Setting up of Court of Inquiry)</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Labour and Welfare)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock): Mr Speaker, Sir, as Minister for Labour and

Welfare,  I  have  set up under section  6  of  the

Industrial  Courts  Ordinance a  Court  of  Inquiry

consisting of a Chairman and two members  with  the

following terms of reference:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1. To enquire-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) into the causes and circumstances of the go-slow method adopted by the workers at the

Singapore Harbour Board;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) whether with regard to the claim of the

Singapore Harbour Board Staff Association



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2164</b></font><br><br>



that  it  merits recognition as  representing

all  daily-rated and monthly-rated  employees

in  the  Singapore Harbour Board, it in  fact

does  represent the majority  of  workers  in

the Singapore Harbour Board: and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To report its findings thereon."



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Hon. Members will notice of course

that  that  has reference to item 2  on  the  Order

Paper  and  if any hon. Member thinks  fit  to  ask

questions, he can do so now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  is the Minister prepared to direct the  Court

of  Inquiry to make recommendations to contain  the

dispute  pending  the final recommendations  for  a

settlement?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, under the Industrial

Courts  Ordinance, there does not appear  to  be  a

dispute  but I have set up the Court because  there

may be a dispute that is coming up and therefore it

is to apprehend a dispute that the Court of Inquiry

was set up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Is the Minister seriously

suggesting that there is no dispute in being in the

Singapore Harbour Board?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the go-slow,

as  far  as  I  know, has been the  result  of  the

withdrawal  of a pass. Since then, there  has  been

talk  of  demands  being sent in to  the  Singapore

Harbour  Board but according to what  I  know  from

later  information,  no  such  demands  have   been

submitted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is not

an  appropriate time to debate the  merits  of  the

dispute  but does not the Minister for  Labour  and

Welfare  agree  that  it is  in  the  interests  of

everybody  in  Singapore, of the Singapore  Harbour

Board  and  of the union concerned to  prevent  the

dispute from becoming a much larger one?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is for

that  very reason that I have appointed a Court  of

Inquiry.

Sir, it was my intention yesterday to add a further

limb  to  my motion. Unfortunately because  of  the

announcement made yesterday afternoon and  repeated

this  morning in this House that a Court of Inquiry

has  been set up, I am prevented from going on with

this  motion.  I would like to make this  statement

before  I  formally  beg  leave  to  withdraw  this

motion, namely, that I think the Minister-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2166</b></font><br><br>

moved,  nothing more can be said about  it.  I  did

indicate - I thought quite clearly - that if  the  hon.

Member  had something to say about it, he  had  the

opportunity  during Question time. I take  it  that

the motion is not being moved?

unfortunately  blocked. However,  I  beg  leave  to

withdraw the motion.

for recognition that they represent all classes  of

monthly and daily-rated employees of the Board, and

<div align="center"><b>COMMISSION OF INQUIRY INTO CORRUPT AND IMPROPER</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>PRACTICES BY CANDIDATES FOR ELECTIONS AND THEIR</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>CONFEDERATES</b></div>



<br><br>10.10 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the motion

which stands in my name reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House is of the opinion that the terms

of  reference  of  the  Commission  of  Inquiry  on

corrupt  practices be extended so that inquiry  can

also be made into corrupt and improper practices by

candidates  for  elections and their  confederates,

with  a  view to making recommendations as  to  how

such  malpractices  can  be  effectively  detected,

punished and suppressed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what happened in the two by-elections which we have just witnessed in Singapore

can  happen  and probably will happen 25  times  in

magnitude in the general elections next year,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2167</b></font><br><br>



and  if  in  those general elections  some  of  the

practices  which we have already seen in these  by-elections  are  repeated on that  scale,  then  the

democratic system will collapse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the most disturbing

features of these elections is that allegations  of

improper  and corrupt practices are not only  being

bandied  about  in  coffee-shops  or  bars  in  the

privacy  of conversations between intimate friends,

but  are actually being published in national daily

newspapers. Everybody knows about what is going  on

and  nothing is being done about it. This is partly

because  the law with regard to corrupt  practices,

as  laid down in our Elections Ordinance, is copied

from  the  English law. Although those  laws  would

adequately   protect  society  from   the   corrupt

politician  under  English social conditions,  they

are  completely inadequate to deal with the totally

different social conditions obtaining in Singapore.

The  by-elections led to a great number of  charges

and  counter-charges of strong-arm methods, illegal

methods, corrupt methods, but no election candidate

has   filed   an  election  petition  against   his

opponents,  nor indeed has anyone made any  serious

complaint  to the police. All this adds up  to  the

fact that unless we radically alter our approach to

corrupt  practices, then in the next elections  and

the  elections  succeeding we will find  all  these

high-handed methods getting completely out of hand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the by-elections opened, a luncheon was

thrown at a fashionable hotel in Singapore at which

the  two candidates of the Liberal-Socialist  Party

addressed  certain  journalists  who  were  invited

specifically  for  the  purpose  of  boosting   the

election campaign of these two candidates. This  is

what  the Straits Times of Saturday, June the 8th - a

paper  well-advised as to the law of libel  because

one of its directors is a senior member of the Bar,

and  therefore very careful not to publish anything

that would have made them liable to damages, and if

this is not true, it definitely is defamatory - said:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2168</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At a by-election campaign luncheon in Singapore

which  will  not figure on the candidate's  expense

sheet,  the  talk  turned to the  value  of  public

meetings and a candidate's speeches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Don't bother about meetings and speeches', said

the   candidate's   adviser.   'They'll   get   you

nowwhere.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I know', said the candidate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Get the secret society boys out', said the

adviser. 'They'll do it.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I know', said the candidate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody at the lunch heard. Everybody would

deny it if names were mentioned. Or they might  say

it  was  all a joke. But it wasn't a joke, and  the

secret society boys have been called out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr 'X' isn't the first budding politician to summon the secret societies' aid. He may get in.

But not if voters keep their heads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elections Ordinance provides penalties for

the  person who directly or indirectly, by  himself

or  by any other person on his behalf, makes use of

or  threatens to make use of any force, violence or

restraint, or inflicts or threatens to inflict,  by

himself  or  any  other  person,  any  temporal  or

spiritual injury, damage, harm or loss in order  to

influence an elector in voting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Words, words, almost meaningless words to the

average voter. All he need remember is that no  one

will ever know how he votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been talk of corruption. Not one

complaint of corruption, however, has been made  to

the police, by a candidate or by anyone else."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, there are some witnesses in this House

who  were present at that particular luncheon.  The

adviser  who said these things was also a candidate

in  the  last  general elections. He  said  openly,

albeit  in jest, that he spent no less than $60,000

in  the  last elections. He calculated that by  the

number  of votes he collected, it cost him no  less

than  $600  per vote. Now, Sir, certain things  one

can  jest  about, but when things come to  a  stage

where  one  openly  calls a  press  conference  and

bandies  these ideas about, then something must  be

done about it or we will perish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no law which says that a corrupt man

cannot stand for election. If a man is prepared  to

adopt  corrupt practices to get into the  Assembly,

it  is  more than likely that he will continue  his

corrupt  practices after he has been  elected,  and

nothing  is more certain to destroy the democratic

system  of government than corrupt politicians.  If

your Minister is corrupt, your Permanent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2169</b></font><br><br>



Secretary  will  also be corrupt in  a  very  short

while. Your Principal Assistant Secretary will also

take  something for himself. Your clerks will  take

something for themselves and finally the  peon  may

not want to deliver a letter unless you give him 50

cents with every letter. When that comes about, the

whole administrative system on which the democratic

machinery  rests will sag and collapse. That  would

be the end of the works.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Shakespeare when he wrote Hamlet wrote one

of  the greatest tragedies in the world, but if you

get  Hamlet enacted by the kind of actors  we  have

seen in the last elections, then it is going to  be

a farce. However good the democratic system, if the

dramatis  personae consist of clowns,  buffoons  and

nincompoops, it must fail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I would like Members on the other side

of  the House not to be so jubilant because  I  may

have  something to say about one or  two  of  their

colleagues.  In  case it is  said  that  I  am  now

becoming  pro-Labour Front, let me read about  what

one   of   the  Members  opposite  may  have   been

responsible  for.  "The  Mak  Brothers"  says   the

Straits Times. They are from Singapore and not from

Hollywood.  Mr Speaker, Sir, this is  one  of  the

more  delightful aspects of improper practices  but

this  is not against the law and if people want  to

resort  to such tactics to their own detriment,  it

is  entirely  their business. I would not  like  to

repeat  what I know happened because that might  be

considered  to be biased but the Straits  Times  of

June 27 reported it in these words:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr C. H. Koh ('I seek to kill a giant')

yesterday  held his first by-election  meeting  and

nearly 4,000 Tanjong Pagar residents gave him a big

hand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mak brothers - Mr Mak Pak Shee, the Assistant

Minister  for Labour, and his younger brother,  Mr

Mak Fee Hong - were there too -".



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I ought to remind

hon. Members of Standing Order 31 (9) which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The personal conduct of Members of the Assembly

shall  not be referred to except upon a substantive

motion moved for that purpose."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2170</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have given

this  particular  Standing Order careful  attention

and  what  I  have to say is completely within  the

Standing  Orders.  I  am  reading  a  report,   Mr

Speaker,  which  concerns the Mak brothers  and  is

more concerned with the younger of the Mak brothers

who  does  not happen to be the Assistant  Minister

for Labour although he is so closely related.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I did think that I heard the

name of Mr Mak Pak Shee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> That was just in-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In passing?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Yes, en passant, Mr Speaker,

Sir. This is where we come from the sublime down to

the earth:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The younger Mr Mak, before addressing the

gathering  in Cantonese, Malay, Hindi and  English,

entertained his listeners for about 10  minutes  by

playing  popular Chinese tunes on his harmonica  [a

most worthwile occupation].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd, in a happy mood, then gave Mr Koh a

tremendous ovation when he told them...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is another bit about Mr Mak Pak Shee

(the  Member  for Geylang) explaining  why  he  was

there  and what he was doing. We are not interested

in  that  but  all  this is quite  delightful.  One

person  watching  this  man playing  the  accordion

said:   "Thank   God  he  can  only   squeeze   the

concertina!"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, that was not illegal. But when

we  are  told that some of the voters were  offered

seven  dollars and five dollars for  a  vote,  that

becomes  very serious. Our law, as I have said,  is

copied  from  the  English law which  is  effective

under  English social conditions where people  will

give  evidence and denounce others in  open  court.

Here  it is impossible. Unless we give witnesses  a

guarantee of secrecy, it is impossible to get these

people  to  come forward in court. For instance,  I

have  a  little account book here which has a  very

close  connection with one of the Mak brothers.  It

records the tea drunk and the cigarettes smoked  by

about 10 or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2171</b></font><br><br>



12  so-called  helpers during the election  at  the

expense of this hon. gentleman. I can prove it  but

I cannot prove the connection between Mr C. H. Koh

and  one of these Mak brothers. Therefore I  cannot

prove that an offence has been committed by Mr  C.

H.  Koh. But if an Inquiry Commission were  set  up

which is not confined to the technicalities of  the

criminal  law of corruption, then some  astonishing

disclosures could take place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the middle of the by-election campaign, a canvasser who was going round

singing  the  democratic virtues  of  the  Liberal-Socialist    candidate    in    Cairnhill - i    hope

justifiably - was stabbed at the Esplanade.  That  is

not   by   itself  a  very  serious  thing  because

canvassers may have made mortal enemies  on  issues

other than the by-election, but says this canvasser

who  was stabbed, as reported in the Straits  Times

of 18th June:

<div align="center">

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No arrests have been made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police investigators are working on a report by

Mr  Sattar  that he was assaulted because  he  was

canvassing votes for Mr Soh Ghee Soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the General Hospital, Mr Sattar, who is

recovering from head injuries believed to have been

inflicted by a hockey stick, said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I know my assailants. They had warned me to stop

working for Mr Soh.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sattar is waiting to get out of hospital to identify his assailants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was attacked by the gang at 12.30 a.m. on

Saturday on the padang...



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sattar told the police that the gang removed $63 from his trouser pockets and some election

papers."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, all this was being published in the

Press for public consumption! And this is what  the

President  of  the  Labour  Front  (the  Hon. the

Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2172</b></font><br><br>



for  Education)  said in reply. He  is  a  man  not

without  his  strong qualities but the  ability  to

make  a sharp retort is not one of them. Here is  a

serious allegation made against canvassers  of  his

Party and he says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We much regret to hear that one of Mr Soh's by-election workers has been attacked and injured.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We extend to him our sympathy and good wishes for

a speedy recovery."



<br><br>What is going on? Does he accept responsibility for

this?



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It goes on to read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reason for the assault on Mr Sattar is not

yet  known.  If  it  is connected  with  Mr  Soh's

campaign,  it constitutes a most serious attack  on

the whole democratic process."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite right!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We hope the police will be able to complete

their   investigations   rapidly   and   bring   an

appropriate  charge against those who attacked  Mr

Sattar."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But nothing more has been heard about this

including  Mr  Sattar. Every lawyer  in  town  who

meets  the  police in court knows that there  is  a

deeper story behind this. I am glad to report  that

according  to  this  story  the  Labour  Front   is

exonerated:  it  appears that far from  Mr  Sattar

being attacked by a rival gang-



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Is the case sub-judice?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> No, there is no case

whatsoever. It is part of my complaint  that  there

has  been  no case All these allegations have  been

made-



<br><br><!-- Mr E. P. Shanks (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr E. P. Shanks):</b> On a

point  of order. It is my impression that at  least

one  man  is  standing trial arising  out  of  that

stabbing incident.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can we have confirmation of that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> There is a prosecution.



<br><br><!-- Mr Shanks -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shanks:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am able to say

this, that there is a prosecution pending which  is

connected with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2173</b></font><br><br>



this  incident. I cannot without notice say whether

the  prosecution arises out of this incident. There

is certainly a very close connection.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if there is a

close  connection, I will give the benefit  of  the

doubt  to  the Attorney-General and I will  say  no

more. But if nothing is done, then - we will not  say

as  the  Secretary-General of the Liberal-Socialist

Party  said:  "We had better pack up and  go  home"

because that seems to me to be quite defeatist  and

effete.  I say we had better shake up the  Criminal

Investigation Department. That much for Mr  Sattar

and  we  all wish him a speedy recovery. But  if  I

were the President of the Labour Front and somebody

had the audacity to suggest that we the P.A.P. have

set  our thugs to beat a man, then he is jolly well

going  to  prove it in a court of  law  or  pay  us

damages  for  it.  I am sending no  condolences  to

anybody who makes such allegations. But that is not

all. On Thursday, June 27, an analytical account of

the  whole by-elections was written up by a serious

political commentator in the Straits Times. He said

this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But by and large the electors of Cairnhill have

been  apathetic.  At  one meeting  in  Cairnhill  a

sizeable proportion of the small crowd was made  up

of young men sporting gay trousers, shirts and Tony

Curtis  hair-cuts. Half-way through the  meeting  I

witnessed  the arrival of some eight or nine  cases

of  soft drinks which were liberally passed  around

to  these  gay  young  men who by  their  demeanour

showed  that they appreciated the drinks more  than

they did the trickle of oratory."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a law about giving

people,  voters and others drinks. And  in  Tanjong

Pagar, they had the audacity not only to give  soft

drinks  but cakes as well to accompany the  drinks,

at   a  public  meeting!  There  were  hundreds  of

witnesses.  But at a public forum I could  not  get

anyone  to  give evidence who could  establish  the

link  between the candidate and the drinks and  the

cakes. It is not because we have been successful in

Tanjong  Pagar that we have done nothing about  it.

We  are against this on principle. Either we  stamp

out these practices or there will be bedlam. In the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2174</b></font><br><br>



cloistered  atmosphere  of  a  court  such  as  the

Commission on Corruption, or a court of enquiry  or

some tribunal not hamstrung by the strict rules  of

the  law  of evidence, a great deal of corrupt  and

improper practices can be brought to light.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we in this Assembly, to be

quite  honest and frank with every Member  of  this

House, are just a flash in the pan in the evolution

of  the constitutional process in Singapore and  in

Malaya.  If  in  the  next elections  all  that  we

succeed in doing is to multiply 25 elected English-educated  opportunists, buccaneers and  adventurers

by  two, to make 51, not only English-educated, but

Chinese-educated,   Malay-educated   and    Indian-educated  buccaneers, adventurers and crooks,  then

the  outcome  must  be the end  of  the  democratic

system as we intend it to be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think it is possible in Singapore, or in

Malaya,   to  adopt  Western  values  and  practice

wholesale.  We  can adopt certain principles  which

are good, but the mechanics have to be altered. For

instance, no candidate in England is allowed to put

a  symbol besides his name. No candidate is allowed

to put his party emblem. If a man is a candidate he

offers himself to his electorate. Here we have  had

to adopt a different method; we allow party symbols

by the side of a candidate's name. The whole of the

law  relating to corrupt and improper practices  is

completely  unsuitable to our  conditions,  and  we

cannot bring the crooks to book with these laws.  A

commission  must be set up to think  out  ways  and

means by which we can prevent the democratic system

from    being   subverted   by   these    political

adventurers. We have a few ideas as to how they can

be  effectively  detected, punished and  suppressed

but  this is not perhaps the forum for giving these

ideas. However, if a proper tribunal is set up,  we

will have some recommendations to put forward as to

how in future we can stop these things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I think I shall be safe in

saying  that  all hon. Members in this  House  will

support this motion on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2175</b></font><br><br>



principle  because being all honourable  men,  they

will  not  want to see dishonourable men  come  and

join   them   through  dishonourable   methods.   I

understand that Members on my side of the House and

on   the  other  side  will  have  other  ideas  to

contribute  to the theme I have chosen  for  debate

today, but I ask them to remember that if they  are

serious  about the future of the democratic  system

in  Singapore, in Malaya - and I repeat - you can  have

the  best  system in the world but if you  put  the

lousiest  of  men  to  work that  system,  it  will

collapse! If you get Mr Mak Pak Shee to  play  the

Prince  of Denmark then even Shakespeare's "Hamlet"

will become a farce!



<br><br>10.35 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise to second  the  motion  and

reserve my right to speak at a later stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>10.37 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I rise to support the motion and I know there

will be enthusiastic support from all other Members

of  this House for this motion. This is only to  be

expected, Sir, since the elections efforts  of  all

of  us  should be able to stand the enquiry of  the

Commission  on Corrupt Practices. I shall  be  most

surprised if they do not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not overlook the fact, Sir, that both

during   and  after  elections  there  are   strong

allegations  about  the  conduct  of  a  number  of

successful candidates and unsuccessful ones.  These

rumours  may  be unfounded, but on the  other  hand

they  may be true. Some of these stories, Sir,  are

still  persistent and universally known,  and  they

merit investigation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly struck by the fact that the

names of certain local politicians crop up whenever

stories of corruption are recounted. There  may  be

good reasons why these names are almost universally

associated  with corruption. No doubt,  Sir,  these

gentlemen



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2176</b></font><br><br>



may  be  unjustly  accused. Their association  with

secret  society  gangsters may be quite  simple  to

explain.  They  may  be  mixing  with  such   shady

characters with the good intention of rescuing them

from crime. But investigation of these stories will

do  much to clear the good name or confirm the  bad

reputation  of  some political  leaders.  If  these

rumours  are  true  or  even half  true,  then  the

conditions  of  honest  democratic  government  are

being seriously threatened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are at the moment, Sir, conducting

investigations  into allegations of  corruption  in

Government departments. These are only allegations,

yet the Government has quite rightly taken the view

that the integrity of the Civil Service is so vital

to  good government that even allegations are worth

investigating.   So  if  there  are   stories   and

persistent  allegations of  improper  practices  by

election  candidates and their camp followers,  the

Government  should be no less ready  to  allow  the

Commission on Corrupt Practices to enquire into the

suspicious behaviour of those who aspire  to  seize

the government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every election brings its quota of improper

practices. For example, Sir, it is not unusual  for

a  candidate to claim that either he or his helpers

have  been set upon by thugs. I believe such claims

were made in the latest by-election and also in the

last  general election. It is also true, Sir,  that

some  candidates  call to their assistance  helpers

who  look  like thugs. Until the election  campaign

starts,  these  people never show  an  interest  in

politics or in the fate of democracy. Suddenly they

are found signing the pages of democracy, or rather

that  of  candidates  who  presumably  claimed   to

personify  democracy. Some of these  gentlemen  who

failed  were  the desperate-looking candidates  who

enjoyed   an  island-wide  reputation  of   knowing

gangsters  who  for a price would let  loose  their

strong-arm  boys  among the  electors.  In  fact  a

Colonial  Officer, Mr Blythe, who is an expert  on

secret  societies, not so long ago  warned  of  the

real  danger of secret society thugs being used  by

politicians for election purposes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2177</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of all this, Sir, I maintain that it will

be  in  the public interest and in the interest  of

good government if the terms of the Commission were

extended  to  include political  corruption.



<br><br>10.41 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

allegations of malpractices have always  been  made

after  all  elections, and especially so after  the

recent  by-elections. I have observed that whenever

a  candidate in an election finds things not  going

his  way,  he  makes  a lot of allegations  against

other candidates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the recent by-election, I was not involved

personally,  and  I can therefore speak  with  less

bias.   We   have  heard  persistent   charges   of

malpractices.  At  election  rallies,  bottles   of

"Green  Spot" were given out freely by students  or

people who should be students. But nobody will  say

who were these people who passed the drinks around.

Nobody  would  say so because they were  afraid  of

retaliation; there is insidious intimidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know, too, Sir, that before a political rally

takes  place some Parties usually staged "picnics";

the gatherings would then move on to the rally. Who

paid  for  those  "picnics" which were  so  greatly

enjoyed   by  those  who  attended  and  at   which

political  speeches with a lot of  flame  and  fire

were made?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> No

lion dancing?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Not as yet. That is connected

with the Mak brothers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You could see that these "picnics" were not

genuine   social  events  but  indoctrination   and

electioneering gatherings at which the  virtues  of

the  candidate of one Party were extolled  and  mud

thrown  at  other  Parties. The  accounts  of  such

picnics  are  many and we ourselves have  witnessed

lorry-loads of youths going to such quiet places as

Tampenis.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> There were no elections in

Tampenis.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> There were no elections

there,  but  invariably all those who attended  the

"picnics"  in  those places were later  brought  to

election   rallies.   The  by-elections   were   in

Cairnhill



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2178</b></font><br><br>



and  Tanjong Pagar but it seemed all the people  in

Singapore were involved; we found youths coming  in

from  Jurong, Bukit Panjang, Tampenis,  Changi  and

other places.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> And Serangoon!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> And Serangoon too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are very serious allegations. I will

instance  a  few  more  cases  for  this  House  to

consider. In an election rally which is democratic,

every candidate should be allowed his say, and  the

people  should be allowed to listen to what he  has

to  tell and offer them. I was present at one rally

but half-way through it I heard a loud noise coming

from  a  side  street with shouts  like,  "Oom-pah!

Merdeka!"  The  voices  were  in  unison,   Sir, - in

unison.  And  I  saw about a thousand-strong  young

people approaching the election rally, which was in

Smith  Street,  apparently with  the  intention  of

breaking  it up. Was that not force, Sir? Was  that

not  intimidation? Was that not a very undemocratic

way of preventing a rival candidate from having his

say? I deplore this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course the leader of the People's Action

Party, the one well versed in law and who has had a

great  deal of political education, will say,  "Oh,

but  these boys were not connected with us. It only

so  happens  they were there." Sir,  that  is  just

another  way  of  saying it but  all  the  same  it

amounts to the same thing - there was force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then when election day came round we found that

the  voters  brought  in  cars,  instead  of  being

allowed  to  enter the voting stations  peacefully,

were  surrounded by hundreds of youths. They opened

the  car doors for the voters, escorted them inside

the  polling stations and told them, "Vote  for  so

and  so; you must." This, Sir, is the use of force.

I would say that the limits of the polling stations

should  be  extended in future so that only  voters

can enter them peacefully and will not be subjected

to  this subtle form of intimidation which is  much

more serious and lasting than an open show of force.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2179</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of course again at these polling stations we

find soft drinks being passed around, by whom we do

not  know, but all those who were there in the  hot

sun greatly enjoyed the drinks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another malpractice takes the form of "persuading" voters to come out and vote. Groups of

young  people -  five,  six,  seven  and  eight   in

each - march  up  and  down  staircases  telling  the

people, "You have to come down to vote" and so  on.

I   can  imagine  the  poor  voters,  not  able  to

withstand  such presure or daring to say  anything,

come down sheepishly to do what they were asked  to

do.  This is the type of "persuasion" we have heard

of in iron curtain countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are yet other types of malpractice. I will

just  mention  one. I understand from my  colleague

the Member for Tiong Bahru that in Craig Road a boy

named  Lee  was  caught  red-handed  tearing   down

election posters. His explanation was, "I  have  no

job  and am paid $5 a day to do this. If I  do  not

take the job where am I to get money?" Here is  one

case where money is unlawfully used.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, Sir, I would say with regret that the

elections system here is far from perfect.  If  the

allegations  are  true that candidates  spend  more

than  $60,000 for an election when legally  he  can

only  spend  $6,000 or $7,000, then  I  think  that

elections will be a farce.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> He was a Democratic candidate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> He may be one from the P.A.P.

I  have heard of many instances of this malpractice

of  spending money and they are not confined to one

Party  alone but to all political Parties. Sir,  we

must put a stop to this practice in which a lot  of

money  can  be thrown about by candidates  and  the

honest man cannot come forward. I think all show of

force, all types of "persuasion", and all forms  of

expenditure  which is not legal,  like  paying  for

picnics and other entertainment, should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2180</b></font><br><br>



also be stopped. It may be difficult to provide the

necessary laws but I think we should consider  ways

and means of combating all these malpractices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say, Sir, that the person by bringing up the

motion  charging these malpractices cannot  thereby

prove that he himself is clean. This motion can  be

brought up by any person. I remember -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Why did you not bring it up?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> -when I was a young boy

noticing that whenever two boys quarrel it was  the

one  who  started  the  quarrel  who  would  always

complain  to  the  mother that the  other  boy  had

beaten  him  up. We are grown-ups but that  can  be

repeated  here.  However, the  motion  is  good  in

principle  and  we should find ways  and  means  of

having cleaner elections and giving a chance to all

those  who  are  good,  able and  honest,  to  come

forward  to serve Singapore. We do not want corrupt

people  who use gangsters, make use of boys or  let

loose  peace  doves after winning the elections  to

rule Singapore.



<br><br>10.54 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Commission   which  is  at  present  looking   into

corruption  in  the  public service  and  in  other

public  bodies should have its terms  of  reference

expanded  to include the investigation  of  corrupt

practices  which  are  known to  have  taken  place

during  the  by-elections in Cairnhill and  Tanjong

Pagar.  Sir,  it is no use our trying to  keep  our

public   service  and  public  bodies   free   from

corruption  if we do nothing to stamp  out  corrupt

practices during elections. Sir, if candidates  are

allowed  to  resort  to  corrupt  practices  during

elections, this will reduce democracy to  a  farce,

and  if  action is not taken now to put a  stop  to

these   malpractices,  the  unscrupulous  and   the

ambitious will be led to believe that it  is  quite

lawful for them to use these despicable means in an

attempt to seize power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The support which certain candidates have

received  from  shady elements  in  the  population

during  the last by-elections has been reported  in

the local Press.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2181</b></font><br><br>



The  newspapers have also mentioned that at certain

election  rallies  those  who  attended  were  more

interested  in  bottles of soft drinks  which  were

distributed  free to all and sundry, than  in  what

the  candidates were trying to say. This may  speak

well,  Sir,  for  the  manufacturers  of  the  soft

drinks,  but  those  responsible  should  still  be

requested to explain why they had to rely  more  on

the  quality of those drinks than on what they were

trying to say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, in Tanjong Pagar a certain candidate

used women of doubtful virtue to parade in his cars

to  tempt  voters to ride with them to the  polling

booths.  All  this  shows,  Sir,  to  what   limits

candidates  were  prepared  to  go  to  gain  their

political ends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of reference of the Commission, Sir,

should  therefore  be  extended  to  enable  it  to

investigate and report on all the corrupt practices

which  were  known to have taken place  during  the

recent by-elections in Cairnhill and Tanjong Pagar.

It  is only in this way, Sir, that public attention

can  be drawn to the need for keeping our elections

clean  if democracy in Singapore is to have a  fair

chance  to  succeed.  No  one  can  deny  that  the

stamping out of corrupt practices from our election

procedure  is even more important to the well-being

of   Singapore  than  is  the  work  on  which  the

Commission is now engaged. If the House believes in

democracy as thoroughly as my Party does,  it  will

without any hesitation support this motion.



<br><br>11.00 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair (Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary (Mr M. P. D. Nair):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a person

who  has  very  close dealings with elections  ever

since they started in 1948, I quite agree with  the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar that there  are  illegal

practices and corruption prevalent during  election

time.  Sir,  I  think the problem is not  so  easy.

Illegal and corrupt practices are very difficult to

detect,  and while attempting to tidy the  law,  I

doubt  very much whether the Commission of  Inquiry

on  corrupt  practices is the proper body  to  look

into this matter. I should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2182</b></font><br><br>



have  thought  that probably the hon. Member  would

have suggested that an All-Party Committee would be

the  most appropriate body to advise the Government

to  draft  suitable legislation. I say  this,  Sir,

because  no  member of the Commission would  be  so

fully  aware  of  the corrupt practices  which  are

prevalent  during election time than the  political

Parties themselves. But I think, Sir, all these are

temporary  measures. My own view is  that  none  of

these  laws  could  prevent corruption  or  corrupt

practices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we do need in Singapore today is political

education among the masses. The way to do  this  is

not  to say, during election time, "I will do  this

or  I  will do that" or "My Party is the best Party

in  Singapore"; but to educate the  masses  on  how

elections  can  be  held  in  the  most  democratic

manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also feel, Sir, that Parties are putting party

interests first rather than the national interests,

with  a  view to seeking power. I suggest that  the

national  interests  should be stressed  first  and

foremost  during  election time rather  than  party

interests.  I would like to ask all the Parties  in

Singapore  to get together and try to  work  out  a

solution - first, to suggest to Government some  sort

of   legislation   to  end  illegal   and   corrupt

practices; and second, that all Parties should take

a  keener interest in political education among the

masses.



<br><br>11.03 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister (Mr Lim Yew Hock): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  terms of reference of the Commission  of

Inquiry under Mr Justice Chua are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To inquire into allegations of corruption against

Members  of  the  Legislative Assembly  or  of  the

public  service or against members or employees  of

the  City  Council  or  other statutory  bodies  in

Singapore  in  connection with  their  official  or

public duties;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To examine whether there is any justification for

such  allegations and, if so, in what circumstances

any   corrupt  transactions  took  place  and  what

persons were involved therein.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2183</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Commission, Sir, was appointed for a

specific  purpose, the importance of which  can  be

gauged  from  the  terms of  reference.  I  do  not

consider,  Sir,  that  this  Commission  should  be

saddled  with  additional terms of reference  which

have no connection with their original appointment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gather, Sir, from the speech of the hon. mover

that  what he aims to achieve by his motion  is  to

have  a  Commission  of  Inquiry  to  inquire  into

allegations of corrupt and improper practices  with

a  view  to making recommendations as to  how  such

malpractices can be effectively detected,  punished

and suppressed. The elections law, Sir, as the hon.

Member  has stated, is quite clear on this, but  it

is  based  on Western lines. But I think  there  is

indeed   room  for  improvement  in  the  machinery

whereby  such offenders can be brought to book.  It

is  vital  that our parliamentary system should  be

kept   above  any  corrupt  practices,   and   that

elections  should be kept clean so that  candidates

who  are  returned to the Assembly or to the  local

councils  will  be men and women of  integrity  and

honesty. To this end, Sir, I move an amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Chief Minister's amendment, as I

understand it, is for the appointment of a separate

Commission  of  Inquiry  on  the  same   terms   of

reference  as suggested by the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar. Is that correct?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> It is a little different,

Sir,   in  that  it  is  to  be  an  inquiry   into

allegations  and  not  into  corrupt  and  improper

practices.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, but the substance is still

there.  As  hon. Members know, amendments  must  be

relevant  to the motion before the House.  Now  the

motion  before  the House is merely to  extend  the

terms  of  reference of an existing  Commission  of

Inquiry.  The  Chief Minister's  amendment,  in  my

view,  is  not  strictly relevant as it  takes  the

matter completely outside the present motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2184</b></font><br><br>



I  would suggest that the proper procedure would be

for the Member for Tanjong Pagar, at the end of the

debate,  to  ask  leave  for  his  motion   to   be

withdrawn,   and  leave  could  be  given   on   an

undertaking by the Chief Minister that a Commission

of  Inquiry will be appointed with these  terms  of

reference. The debate of course can carry on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> With respect, Sir, as I said

just  now,  the aim of the motion is  to  see  that

there is an inquiry into allegations of corrupt and

improper practices. The hon. mover of the motion, I

believe, thought that since we have a Commission of

Inquiry  into  corrupt  practices  it  would  be  a

simpler  method  of  just extending  the  terms  of

reference,  but  his main purpose  is  not,  may  I

submit,  Sir,  to load this present  Commission  of

Inquiry with this additional duty. What he hopes to

achieve  is  to  see that there is a Commission  of

Inquiry  into  allegations of corrupt and  improper

practices, and if that submission is correct,  Sir,

may I respectfully beg leave to move my amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have over-ruled that amendment as

being  irrelevant. It is not relevant to the motion

which,  as  I say, merely asks for an extension  of

the terms of reference of an existing Commission of

Inquiry. If a separate Commission of Inquiry is  to

be  appointed, it must be appointed in a  different

manner.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> That would mean, Sir, that if

the hon, mover of the motion would not withdraw his

motion on my undertaking that I would move a motion

to achieve what he wants to achieve, the Government

would  be placed in the position of having to  vote

against  his  motion.  We  feel,  Sir,  that  while

agreeing  in  principle that  there  should  be  an

inquiry  into  allegations of corrupt and  improper

practices,  this  Commission of Inquiry  under  Mr

Justice  Chua  should  not  be  saddled  with  this

additional work, which is, I submit, going to  take

a  long  time. Sir, I have said that the Government

is in sympathy with the principle of the motion and

will  support  it, and it is now  left  for  me  to

suggest to the hon. mover of the motion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2185</b></font><br><br>



that  if he would just withdraw his motion, I would

give  him  the assurance that I will move a  motion

which  will  achieve his objective, but which  will

bring   in  a  new  Commission  of  Inquiry,  which

Commission will not be tied to any other  terms  of

reference.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can I perhaps make it a little

clearer? It is not necessary for the Government  to

vote  against  this motion. They may  abstain,  the

understanding being that they accept the  principle

underlying the motion and then later on proceed  to

give  effect to the undertaking given by the  Chief

Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Thank you for your guidance,

Sir. We will abstain.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The debate, of course, can go on.



<br><br>11.12 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I may not be a man with qualities

attributed  to  me by the Member for Tanjong  Pagar

and  I  may  not have the ability to give  a  sharp

retort, but at that time at least the Labour  Front

would  not and did not rush around accusing  people

or pretending to interest ourselves in something in

which we were not implicated. We were clean and  we

knew,  when  that gentleman Sattar, who  may  be  a

gangster -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think we have decided that

the  matter  is sub judice and I do not  think  any

reference to the case directly or indirectly should

be allowed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> I beg to withdraw my remark.

As  I  said,  Sir,  the  Labour  Front  fought  the

elections clean. We never heard people accusing  us

of  making use of young people or students to  come

into  the  open. We never resorted to  the  use  of

secret  societies. Although we lost the by-election

in Cairnhill, we lost it honourably.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Cairnhill there were five candidates

representing  three Parties and  two  Independents.

Therefore   when  certain  allegations  were   made

against us, we did not try to defend ourselves  but

we  left  it  to  the  police to  carry  out  their

investigations. We will know later on  the  results

of their investigations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2186</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We as a political Party support the intention

behind  this  motion, that is, to make  an  inquiry

into the malpractices that went on in the last  by-elections  and that will go on in later  elections;

but as the Chief Minister has said, we rather think

that  it should be a different Commission, entirely

divorced  from  the present Commission  on  corrupt

practices in government offices.



<br><br>11.15 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would

like  to congratulate the Member for Tanjong  Pagar

on the principle involved in his motion. We feel on

this side that the present Commission should not be

saddled  with this additional work and that  a  new

Commission  should  be appointed,  but  I  entirely

agree with him on the principle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have seen the plight of some countries

where  politics  have become so  corrupt  that  the

whole  administrative machinery of those  countries

has  broken  down,  with chaotic  results  for  the

population. Sir, as every election goes by, decent,

honest  men,  who  could  give  something  to  this

country,  look  around and are aghast  at  the  way

things are going on in elections, at the amount  of

money that is being spent, at the corruption of the

youth - Chinese youth by some Party, English-speaking

youth  by  another  Party - and  at  other  ways   of

corruption  which have been brought  to  light  but

which cannot be proved in a court of law. And these

decent  men  ask  themselves,  "Why  should  I  get

involved in these things?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the world there is a sense of values. You

cannot  get something for nothing. If a man has  to

spend  $50,000 to $60,000 to fight an election  and

if  he wins and becomes a Minister, you can be sure

that  he will try to recover four or five times  as

much - he  will be a corrupt Minister.  If  you  want

honest  Ministers, if you want honest  politicians,

you cannot expect them to spend $50,000, or $60,000

or  $80,000 on an election. If they do, you can  be

sure  what  the result is going to be.  This  is  a

warning which I am giving to this country;  when  I

see how things are moving - we are following



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2187</b></font><br><br>



the   line  of  many  countries  where   such

malpractices prevail, and it is going to be  a  sad

day  for  us  if  we  cannot preserve  decency  and

honesty in our politics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another form of corruption which no

Member  has  referred to, and that is  the  "gentle

persuasion"  of Independents to stand for  election

in  order to split votes. That also, Sir, is a form

of  corruption,  though it is not  covered  by  the

provision  of  corrupt practices in the  Ordinance;

but that does happen.



<br><br>11.18 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

agree  with the Minister for Commerce and  Industry

when  he  said that he was very grateful indeed  to

the  mover  of the motion for introducing  such  an

important motion, coming as it does on the  eve  of

the  coming  general elections. I  agree  with  the

picture painted by the Member for Tanjong Pagar - and

indeed   it  is  not  new  to  me - that   when   our

neighbouring countries have got rid of colonialism,

the  people  suffer  because  of  the  practice  of

corruption.  And  now on the dawn of  independence,

colonialism  still  has its  followers.  Sooner  or

later,  Mr Speaker, Sir, we will achieve  complete

independence,   and  if  corrupt  practices   still

prevail,  will  they  benefit the  people  of  this

country?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our public service should at all times be

deserving  of  applause by  having  no  charges  of

corrupt practice levelled at it, but if it  is  led

by  corrupt  elected Ministers, then its  integrity

will be severely jeopardised. Therefore this motion

by the Member for Tanjong Pagar has been introduced

in  time  to check any malpractice which, according

to many hon. Members who have spoken, was practised

in the recent by-elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said that malpractice assumed two

forms  in the recent by-elections: one, money;  and

the  other, "gentle persuasion". It was a shock  to

me  when the Member for Serangoon denounced in very

clear tones the malpractice actually carried out by

all the political Parties.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2188</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am much worried whether we can depend on

the  public to help Mr Justice Chua carry out  his

work  on,  the  Commission of  Inquiry  on  corrupt

practices. I heard him appeal over Radio Malaya  to

the  public  to come forward to give  evidence.  We

know  that corrupt practice is always coupled  with

bribery.  If  there  is  no bribery,  there  is  no

corruption;  but  unfortunately in  this  so-called

entrepot  centre of Singapore where  many  business

transactions  take place, there are  many  ways  to

make quick money. That is why I say that bribery is

the  twin brother of corruption and why Mr Justice

Chua can hardly carry on his work smoothly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, Sir, it is to be an inquiry into corrupt

practice  in the election. It involves hundreds  of

thousands of voters. It will be much easier for the

Commission of Inquiry to carry out its work if  the

Government   sincerely  support  this   motion   in

principal.  The Chief Minister and the Chairman  of

the  Labour Front have stated that they do  support

this motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should make full use of the Department of

Information Services and ask them to stop  printing

Ministers'   pictures   and   sending   them    out

everywhere. They should go to every nook and corner

of  Singapore  Island and inform the  public  about

this Commission of Inquiry. Top priority should  be

given to this Commission. The public should be told

that  it  is of vital importance for them  to  come

forward and give evidence to this Commission  which

is  to investigate malpractices in the election. If

the  people  want an incorruptible  government,  if

they  want  their representatives to work  honestly

for them, they must come forward and give evidence.

They should not be expected to have "Green Spot" [a

soft drink] offered to them or beautiful ladies  to

entertain them if they want a clean election and  a

clean government. They should be conscious of their

civic responsibilities. So I think this is the time

for the Department of Information Services, led  by

Mr  Thomson, to co-operate sincerely and make this

Commission of Inquiry a top



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2189</b></font><br><br>



priority job to investigate corrupt practices,  and

invite  the  public to come forward with  evidence.

Then this Commission will really mean something  to

the  people  of  Singapore  and  will  prevent  the

collapse of the democratic system.



<br><br>11.25 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I am really surprised at the accusation levelled by

the   Minister  for  Commerce  and  Industry   that

Independent  candidates who cause a  split  in  the

votes  are  corrupted. The question  of  causing  a

split between the candidates is in no way connected

with  corruption or malpractices and I  cannot  see

how it has anything to do with this motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> On a point of explanation,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the hon. Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> There are genuine

Independents and there are those who are put up  by

"gentle persuasion".



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> That explanation will not

carry  much  weight,  Sir. As  a  citizen  of  this

colony. I think everyone is eligible to stand as  a

candidate   and  it  is  wrong  to  say   that   an

Independent  candidate who causes a  split  in  the

votes  is  put  up  by  "gentle  persuasion",   and

furthermore it has no connection with this  motion.

It  may  be  that  the Labour Front  lost  the  by-election in the Cairnhill Division and that is why,

in  the  mind  of  the Minister  for  Commerce  and

Industry,   it  amounts  to  corruption   when   an

Independent candidate causes a split.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resort to malpractice, Sir, during an

election is widely known. As the Member for Seletar

has   stated,   malpractice  and  corruption   have

occurred  ever  since  the  general  elections   in

1948 - everybody knows that. They can never  get  out

of  existence. That is an open secret not  only  to

political Parties but also to voters and non-voters

as  well.  I have come across allegations  of  non-voters  receiving money. If you  give  money  to  a

voter, it is at least a corrupt



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2190</b></font><br><br>



practice, but what is the idea of giving money to a

non-voter  who has no right to vote? It  is  rather

fortunate that I myself was not involved in the by-elections  and I did not support any  candidate  at

all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Very lucky!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Yes, or else some accusations

might have been made against me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> And proved!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> And proved, thank you! I

actually attended a number of election rallies and,

as the Member for Tanjong Pagar has correctly said,

soft  drinks were distributed to those who went  to

these  rallies not for the purpose of listening  to

the  election  speeches  but  for  the  purpose  of

enjoying  a  nice drink. But apart from these  soft

drinks,  I  also  saw  lorry-loads  of  people  not

connected  with the by-election in that  particular

division  brought  to  the rallies.  What  was  the

purpose  of  bringing  a  man  from  Serangoon   or

Tampenis to Cairnhill or Tanjong Pagar to listen  to

the  speeches? What good did it make? Can that  man

vote?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Queenstown.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Yes, there were a few from

Queenstown. I doubt if you could make  a  man  from

another  division, coming to these  two  particular

divisions,  vote. All these accusations  have  been

made  every  time after an election. What  has  the

Government  done?  What have the political  Parties

done?  It  is  not only because of the by-elections

that corruption and malpractices have occurred ever

since  1948.  Why then does the Government  not  do

something  about  it, or the political  Parties  do

something  about  it?  Is  there  much  purpose  in

setting  up  a  Commission of Inquiry into  corrupt

practices? It will serve no purpose. The most  that

you  can  get  out  of  it is  a  Report  from  the

Commission  that  such  and  such  practices   have

occurred.  But  where will all this end?  When  the

general  elections  come  next  year,  again   such

accusations  will be made; but what could  be  done

about that? Cannot the Government or any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2191</b></font><br><br>



political Party do something about it? The  setting

up  of a Commission of Inquiry will not get us very

far,  although we may be able to find out something

from  the  Report of the Commission. What  I  think

should be done is this: the Government through  the

Information  Services should set up  civic  centres

and  teach  the  people that  they  should  not  be

corrupted in any election and how to vote. It is  a

question  of  the  civic course that  we  give  the

people.  It  is  not a question of  just  having  a

Commission of Inquiry and to say, "Oh, yes. So  and

so is corrupted and so and so has offered money for

a  vote  or so." Like the Democratic Party  in  the

last  general  elections which  spent  as  much  as

$60,000  as the Member for Tanjong Pagar said - I  am

sorry he did not refer to that particular Party.  I

am sorry: in some cases-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Quite right. Against you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Against me?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I am afraid that I have not

spent $60,000. I cannot afford to spend such a sum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of explanation?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the hon. Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am sure that at that time the

Member  for  Queenstown did not  have  $60,000  to

spend  and would not have spent it. I was referring

to  one  of  his  opponents  and  I  was  therefore

vindicating his character.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I thank the Member for Tanjong

Pagar very much for the compliment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, where is that candidate who spent $60,000

against me? He is not in this Assembly today.  That

clearly indicates that money could get him nowhere.

It is not a question that by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2192</b></font><br><br>



offering  money and bribes, you could get  yourself

into  this  Assembly.  It is your  service  to  the

public;  it is your sincerity to the public.  So  I

feel that the setting up of a Commission of Inquiry

will  get  us nowhere. The Hon. the Chief  Minister

has  said  that the Government is going to  abstain

from  voting and I think I will abstain  with  them

not  because  I  do  not  support  the  motion   in

principle - the motion in itself is good and  I  will

join  the  Minister for Commerce  and  Industry  to

congratulate  the  Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar   in

introducing such a motion - but because as the  Chief

Minister  has  said that the present Commission  of

Inquiry  is burdened with a heavy job and  that  in

spite  of all his appeals only 24 were prepared  to

come forward and give evidence. Now if you were  to

burden  him  with an extra job, it will extend  the

time  of his Commission and where does he land?  It

might  take another year for him to submit a report

to  this  Assembly or to the Government or  to  the

public  and by the time when that year comes around

all  of us may not be here. So why should we extend

the time limit of that Commission? Either set up  a

new Commission to inquire into this particular case

or  have  nothing at all and then give a policy  or

directive  to  the  Information Services  to  start

civic    courses,    teach   the    public    civic

consciousness, the right to vote and  how  to  vote

and that they should not be subject to corruption.



<br><br>11.37 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Hon. the Minister for Education has mentioned

that  his Party lost honourably. I do not challenge

that  statement but I must say that allegations  of

corrupt  practices have also been made against  his

Party.    When   these   elections   were   fought,

allegations have been made against every Party  and

not  against one Party only. In one way or another,

every  Party  was  alleged to have committed  these

corrupt practices or used force to persuade  people

to  vote  for  them. So much so  that  many  of  my

friends  and acquaintances - responsible people  with

limited means - have told



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2193</b></font><br><br>



me  that they are going to eschew politics and will

not  stand for election because it is too  dirty  a

game. Because of this, I do welcome this inquiry in

principle and we shall support it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my mind, such evil practices are bound to

occur at the start of any new political development

because some people always think that by the use of

money  or the might of power, they can force people

to  vote  for  them and thus make  them  support  a

system  of government against the people's  wishes.

But from what I can see as a result of the last two

elections,  I  think all the money  that  has  been

spent  or  alleged to have been spent and  all  the

practices  of  using  gangsters,  school  boys  and

school  girls  have not resulted in the  way  those

people  who  encouraged corruption have  wished.  I

think  the  voters are now learning the  fact  that

their vote is secret and that their vote cannot  be

bought; even if they do fall into the temptation of

accepting  five or ten dollars, they can  still  go

and vote in secret and nobody can touch them. That,

to  my  mind, is the only practical way of  getting

our people to go and vote as they think fit.



<br><br>11.39 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I formerly felt rather

shy  as  a Member of this House because I  hold  my

seat by nomination: but the trend of the debate has

apparently  been in the direction that it  is  more

honourable  and  cleaner to be nominated  into  the

Assembly  than  it  is to be  elected.  That  is  a

conclusion which I cannot accept.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim Koon Teck)

mentioned just now that people are saying  nowadays

that politics are too dirty and corrupt to go into.

Well  I heard that back in early 1948. A friend  of

mine  said that to me himself: "Local politics will

be  so dirty that no decent man will go into them."

When  I  heard that, I said, "Well, if that is  so,

then  I think I will go into them and find out  for

myself to see whether I can do anything about  it."

And  I  did  go in with the Labour Party which  was

formed  at the initiative of the gentleman who  was

at the bottom of the poll and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2194</b></font><br><br>



lost  his  deposit  in  the Cairnhill  by-election.

Since  1948, I have seen a good deal of  the  dirty

side  of  politics. I have mixed  with  some  dirty

people;  some of them are out of politics  now  and

others  are  still with us. It has not always  been

pleasant but I could not see any alternative. But I

have also mixed with some very decent and very good

people indeed and I have not much doubt that it  is

possible  always for a decent poor man  to  beat  a

corrupt rich man in a straight fight. The high cost

of votes has been referred to: it is usually a high

cost  of votes to the losing candidate. The winning

candidate,  if he is a decent candidate,  does  not

necessarily have to spend money in that way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think we can accept the view that

"anything  you  can do, I can do dirtier".  I  feel

pretty sure that there are quite a number of things

wrong  but  I am also sure that there are  a  great

many  things right. We should not in this  Assembly

or elsewhere take it that Singapore is tottering on

the  brink of collapse into a sea of corruption and

filth.  The standard of living is high in Singapore

as compared with many other countries. The standard

of  public conduct and public life is also high  as

compared  with  many  other  places.  Neither   the

standard  of living nor the standard of conduct  is

perfectly satisfactory. There are certainly  things

that  could be and must be improved but  we  should

not  regard  ourselves as isolated from decency  by

bottomless pits of corruption all around us.  I  do

not  think  that the civil service is in danger  of

being  corrupted and that the Permanent Secretaries

would  become corrupted because they got a Minister

who  is  not  all that he should be. I  think  they

would  bring  the  Minister up to  their  level  if

necessary; or at least see that he did not exercise

his  position in any wrongful way. What is  needed,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, is that good and decent  men  of

principle  and character should come  forward  into

politics  and  take a leading part.  Inquiries  may

show  where  the  dirt  exists  and  laws  may   do

something  to  clean up the dirt, but  no  law,  no

inquiry, indeed nothing, can take the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2195</b></font><br><br>



place  of  high  principles and high  standards  of

conduct  amongst the leadership of the country.  If

that  is lacking, the laws will not be enforceable.

If  that is there, the laws in this matter will not

make  a great deal of difference because they  will

not  be required and that is the word which I  want

to leave with the House. It is my firm opinion that

we  have  in Singapore an enormous reserve of  good

and  decent  people who should be  taking  part  in

political life; who hitherto have not taken  enough

part;  and they are the people whom we have got  to

bring  into politics because they are the salvation

and  the  future of this country. I hope that  this

proposal to examine political life and put it under

a  microscope will do something to show  them  that

they  can come in. They will see that the bad  side

is not going to get away with things. They will see

that  there is a future for a clean and decent  man

to  come  into political life and serve his country

and meet the needs of the people.

<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

a  lot  has been said about corrupt practices being

held  at the last by-elections. I must say that  in

my  experience of contesting several elections, the

last  election  was the dirtiest I have  ever  gone

through. Posters put up were immediately torn down.

Banners  were  cut  into two or smeared  with  oil.

Helpers, apart from Mr Rahim Sattar who is  not  a

gangster, were also assaulted although they may not

have  reported to the police. In many  respects,  I

think an inquiry is very useful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also glad to hear the Hon. the Minister for

Communications and Works mentioning that decent men

do  not require a lot of money to fight an election

and I therefore strongly support the motion put  up

by the Member for Tanjong Pagar.



<br><br>11.43 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

although   it  has  been  depressing  hearing   the

speeches on malpractices



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2196</b></font><br><br>



during the last by-elections, as a Member

of  the union of nominated Members of four in  this

Assembly,  I do like to associate myself with  what

the Minister for Communications and Works has said.

In  spite of many depressing speeches, Singapore is

still  hopeful of finding good honest men  standing

for election and winning the election through sheer

honesty and not by means of malpractices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been expressions of a desire to

stop the malpractices and I think in answer to that

we should all agree that a Commission of Inquiry be

established  to operate immediately so that  before

the   next   City  Council  and  District  Councils

elections  we  shall have that report  which  will

deter  people  going for election  in  future  from

applying practices that are not lawful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply?



<br><br>11.44 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Yes. Mr Speaker, Sir, every

time  we  have one of these tricky motions  in  the

House,  we find that everybody supports the  motion

for  different reasons because anybody who does not

support  it,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  is  ex-hypothesi

suspect.  Therefore, we are not  at  all  surprised

(indeed I am not) to receive such unanimous support

from all sections of the House, not least from  the

Member  for Cairnhill (Mr Soh Ghee Soon)  who  has

succeeded the ex-Chief Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, what was most interesting was the fact

that  three experienced post-Emergency politicians,

the  Member for Seletar (Mr Nair), the Member  for

Queenstown  (Mr  Lee Choon Eng)  and  the  present

Member  for Cairnhill (Mr Soh Ghee Soon) who  have

participated  in  politics  since  1948  have   now

publicly declared that since 1948 there has been  a

lot  of dirtiness going on. Sir, we are glad to say

that  the People's Action Party was formed only  in

November 1954 and that we have not been responsible

for any dirt since November 1954.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2197</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> It is dirtier, I think.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Now, Sir, I was somewhat

intrigued  by  the Liberal-Socialist Party  putting

forward  the  Member for Serangoon (Mr  Lim  Choon

Mong) to speak on their behalf, because he said, "I

am  not  involved." By implication, I  assume  that

some  others must have been involved, and therefore

it  would  have been disgusting for  them  to  have

spoken on behalf of the Liberal-Socialist Party. He

recited a few things like: we broke up one  of  the

Liberal-Socialist meetings. He went on  to  say - one

of  his wisecracks today - that he caught a boy named

Lee  who  was tearing down posters at the  rate  of

five dollars per day. Now, Sir, any Party that  can

afford  to  pay five dollars per day just  to  tear

down  posters must have a lot of reserves  and  the

People's  Action Party have not got such  financial

backing.  So I assume that this boy must have  been

employed  by somebody who does have such  financial

backing. Be that as it may, I am surprised to  hear

from  the Member for Serangoon that the Member  for

Tiong  Bahru  (Mr William Tan) caught  a  boy  who

confessed  to him that he was paid five  dollars  a

day  for  doing something illegal and that  he  had

never  sought  to  bring this matter  to  a  police

station.  Now, Sir, on the other hand, one  of  our

boys was slapped at Duxton Hill corner for sticking

up  our  posters. I will say this for the Singapore

Police  Force, that they traced the man and we  are

prosecuting him. That is the way to do it. It is no

use  alleging that illegal acts were committed  and

doing  nothing about it. As I said just now. I  can

prove  the  connection between this little  account

book  with  one of the Mak brothers  but  I  cannot

prove  the connection between the Mak boy  and  the

candidate, otherwise this thing would go to a court

of law for a proper adjudication to be made on it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I think we should clearly understand

that what we are debating today - although it has got

its  funny aspects, its lighter moments - is  a  very

sober and, in my opinion, a very decisive



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2198</b></font><br><br>



factor  in whether or not next  year  we  are

going  to  see  a fairly clean Legislature  with  a

clean, honest and effective government. If  we  do

not  see  it,  then I say that the  chances  of  it

happening in the subsequent election are even less.

In  which  case,  I say that the  battle  for  the

democratic  system  is  lost.  If  you   want   the

democratic  system,  certain  conditions  must   be

established,  otherwise  the  way   is   open   for

dictatorship. My appraisal of the situation is that

we  have  two more tries in Singapore  and  in  the

Federation, which will take us about ten years.  If

by   that   time  the  conditions  have  not   been

established, time has run out and either a military

junta of the nature of Colonel Nasser or a monarchy

of the nature of King Hussein of Jordan will emerge

as the alternative to a dictatorship of the Malayan

Communist Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am interested to hear today from the Minister

for   Commerce  and  Industry,  the  Minister   for

Communications and Works, and even from the  Member

for Paya Lebar that the attitude is: "Why should  I

get  involved?  This  is all a dirty  business."  I

think  the  people of Singapore and the  people  of

Malaya  had  better understand  this:  we  are  all

involved in this. That is the first thing  we  must

understand. If this system collapses, not only will

the  Member for Paya Lebar lose his Sembawang  Hill

Estate  with 1,000 housing units, but he will  lose

it  without  compensation, and he will lose  a  few

other physical things besides, all of a sudden.  It

is  no  use  to say, "Why should I be  involved  in

this? I am going to concentrate on architecture and

7�  per cent. I am not interested in this. I  can

find  honest ways of earning a living. Let us leave

this  business of being a politician to the rogues,

the scallywags, the vagabonds and the adventurers."

If  that  happens, let me say this: the  democratic

system  cannot  work. A dictatorship  must  emerge.

That  dictatorship will probably make things worse,

and    armed   revolution   will   be   its   final

consummation. It is inevitable. We must bring  home

to the people that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2199</b></font><br><br>



everybody is involved in it. There is no such thing

as 'I am not involved,' not even if you are a civil

servant with your pension guaranteed. That  is  the

first thing we should tell our civil servants. They

are involved; they have got to make the system work

or we all perish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of those side-effects of paternal

colonialism:  paternal only  to  a  small  section,

i.e.,  the English-educated upper class - I mean  the

Member for Serangoon, the Member for Stamford,  and

the  Minister for Communications and Works who were

speaking of their friends and acquaintances.  These

friends  and acquaintances are the English-educated

middle class, a fairly comfortably set up class who

are  honest up to a point, in the sense  that  they

would  not  do  anything dishonest.  But  they  are

lacking  in  moral fibre in that they are  shutting

their eyes and they are saying, "Well, you do that.

Keep  the  system  going. I make money  the  honest

way."  But you cannot make it the honest  way  when

the  system collapses. Everybody will collapse. The

paternal colonial government has bred this attitude

of  'You look after politics for me. I mind my  own

business, namely, to make money.' That has  got  to

stop and it will stop.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when I raised this motion, I

knew  that there would be the charges and  counter-charges  vis-a-vis Parties, but let me say this  to

every  Party in this Assembly and every Party  that

believes  in  democratic competition. They  have  a

stake in this system and have to see that it works.

It  is not going to work once you start introducing

other than straightforward competition of political

ideals and political ideas. Once you introduce soft

drinks,  girls  in motor cars to take  you  to  the

polls, money for votes and strong-arm methods, then

I say a dictatorship may be a better



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2200</b></font><br><br>



alternative to a corrupt, subverted democracy.  But

I will say one lesson for all of us which all of us

must  learn. It is not good enough to say, "Let  us

find  honest men to come forward and lead."  Honest

men  will  come forward and find that nobody  wants

them  to  lead. You must first be honest. You  must

next  have  idealism.  You must  have  convictions.

Finally  you  must  organise  to  bring  home  your

convictions to the people. If you just sit back and

say, "I am an honest man," and do nothing about it,

that  is  the end of the matter. Nobody  will  know

that  you are an honest man. Not only must  you  be

honest and have convictions but you must bring home

the  fact  that you are honest and have convictions

and  that  those  convictions  are  in  the  public

interest before you can win.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say this to the Member for Serangoon who

has  sought  to make charges against my  Party.  My

Party  may have a lot of faults, but there  is  one

fault  that it has not got - too much money. We  have

not got the money to use, but we have drive, talent

and the ability to organise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say this to the Independents. They are the

bane  of  Singapore politics. For God's  sake,  get

together,  do  something and  stand  for  something

other than yourselves, because in the next election

the stakes are higher. In 1948 the stakes were low.

All you could hope to be was the Hon. Mr So and So

in the Legislative Council. Then you get invited to

a Government House party which is what the English-educated middle class wanted - birthday parties,  the

Queen's  Birthday,  and meet the  Governor.  Either

that  kind of politician or the other type who gets

into  the  City  Council and sits on the  Transport

Committee,  the Hawkers Committee. The stakes  were

low - chicken-feed. Therefore one does not stick  out

one's neck too much. Today we have heard from three



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2201</b></font><br><br>



authoritative sources - three gentlemen who ought  to

know - if there is anybody in Singapore who ought  to

know at all - that it has been a dirty business. With

the Rendel Constitution, the stakes increased. Now,

one  could  be a Minister, and if one  could  be  a

Minister,  one  could be in charge of  A.P. forms,

import and export permits, immigration permits,  in

or  out  at $500 or $50 per time. One could  be  in

charge  of  contracts and tenders. The  stakes  are

going  up. In the next election, the stakes  go  up

higher  because  we  are  taking  over  the   whole

internal  machinery. Let me put it to these  small-time  politicians  in  this  way:  they  are  after

chicken-feed, $5,000 per bus licence or $50  for  a

hawker's  pitch, and all these little  things.  One

takes  a long time to get rich that way, and  every

time  you  take  a risk, there is a risk  of  being

caught. But if you could be a Minister for Commerce

and  Industry  in  a  completely  internally  self-governing administration-



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> A Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> - and it you could also be a

Prime  Minister  and everybody set up  nicely,  you

could  by just a few book deals swipe a few million

dollars  very  quickly.  Now  that  is  worth   it.

Therefore  in the next election, if we allow  these

types  to  win,  then I say within five  years  you

either  knock  them  out  completely  and  start  a

revolution  before they do damage, or  within  five

years the damage that they would have done would be

of such a permanent nature that you would never get

the  people  to believe in a democratic system.  We

are  not  dealing with a highly educated  political

electorate, not at the moment. But like electorates

anywhere  in the world, they judge institutions  by

the  results they produce. It is no use arguing the

theory  of  democracy,  the  right  of  freedom  of

speech,  the right of freedom of association,  etc.

If  it  does  not provide benefits  to  him  as  an

individual, it  has no meaning. If internal  self-government next year means that this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2202</b></font><br><br>



beautiful  Assembly building renovated  at  a  high

cost  with  red  plushed  leather  seats  and  foam

cushions  and all the dignity and the paraphernalia

of  a  parliament with wealthy Ministers and junior

Ministers - that    the   people    associate    this

institution  with  corruption and  oppression,  and

after five years, if that is their attitude to this

institution, then I say that we cannot start  going

at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year, we can start a fresh page. We can say,

"The  past was because of colonialism. We down it."

We  shove  all the rubbish to one corner  and  say,

"There  you are, this evil, the white men did  it."

If  after five years there is a lot of rubbish,  we

have  got to decide where to shove it to, and  then

they  will say of the corrupt politicians that they

were  the agents of colonialism. Then where do  you

go from there? But the third time it is all over.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, I say that it is our duty as

constitutional  political Parties to  preserve  and

improve  the conditions on which democracy must  be

hoisted before it can hope to flourish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am asking for a division on my motion but on

this  understanding, Mr Speaker, Sir,  because  of

the  technical difficulties involved, that if  this

motion  is  carried, it means that  the  Government

will  appoint  a separate Court of  Inquiry.  I  am

quite  satisfied to have a separate Court  provided

that there is sufficient protection given for it to

make a complete and thorough inquiry. There must be

complete  privilege,  sympathy  if  necessary,  and

extra judicial powers in the sense that it can hear

evidence which would not otherwise be received, and

can hear second-hand evidence if necessary. On that

understanding, I would ask not only  this  side  of

the  House  to vote for it, but also the Government

side to vote for it.
