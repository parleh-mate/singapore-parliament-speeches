<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>HOUSING LOANS OF CPF MEMBERS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Acting

Minister for Manpower what is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2591</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the number of people who use all their incoming

CPF  contribution to pay for housing loans monthly;  (ii)

the  amount of cash each of these individuals is required

to  top  up  for their housing loans once the  total  CPF

contribution rate is cut to 30%; and (iii) the  estimated

impact  of  this  reduction in cash  circulation  to  our

economy.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen (Acting Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as at 30th June this year, about 577,000

members  (45%  of total active members) serviced  housing

mortgage  payments  from their CPF  accounts.  Of  these,

221,400  members  (17.4%  of total  active  members)  had

monthly  mortgage payments that were equal  to,  or  more

than,  their monthly Ordinary Account (OA) contributions.

This  represents the number of members who currently  use

all  their  incoming CPF contributions to pay  for  their

monthly housing loan instalments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member's question on the amount of cash

required to top up their housing loans once the CPF rates

are  cut  and the estimated impact of reduction  in  cash

circulation based on the CPF cuts, as the Prime  Minister

(PM)  has yet to announce the changes, I will not be able

to provide the specific details.  I suggest to the Member

that he may defer the questions after the PM has made the

announcement.

<div align="center"><b>INVESTMENT IN AND OUTFLOW FROM SINGAPORE</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister for

Trade and Industry since 1997 (a) how many companies have

migrated  from  Singapore to lower  cost  countries  each

year;  (b) what is the amount of investment outflow  from

Singapore  to these countries; and (c) what will  be  the

estimated investment in and outflow from Singapore if the

employer CPF contribution rate is cut by 6%.

<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government does not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2592</b></font><br><br>

survey  companies  that  are set up  overseas  without  a

presence in Singapore.  As companies cease operations for

many different reasons, the number of companies that have

left Singapore for lower cost countries is not tracked.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, information on relocations is obtained from

survey  data  in the Labour Market Survey,  which  covers

private  sector establishments with at least 25  workers.

According  to  this  survey, between 1998  and  2002,  an

average  of  66  establishments each year had  retrenched

workers  due  to  relocation.   However,  most  of  these

companies retained a presence in Singapore.



<br><br><i>Singapore Companies' Investments in Lower-Cost Countries</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia asked for the amount of investment

outflow  from  Singapore  to lower-cost  countries.   The

stock  of  total  direct  investment  by  Singapore-based

companies  in China stood at $16.5 billion  in  2001,  an

increase  of  $6.1 billion from that in 1997.  For  ASEAN

countries,  Singapore companies' total  stock  of  direct

investment was $26.8 billion in 2001, an increase of $8.1

billion from that in 1997.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to highlight that Singapore-based companies invest overseas for a variety of reasons,

with cost-saving being one of them. A recent survey by IE

Singapore suggests that, in addition to cost saving, much

of the outward investment by Singapore-based companies is

to increase sales by serving the growing customer base in

these markets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, investment outflows do not necessarily

reflect   `hollowing out' due to high  costs.  Often,  it

reflects  the drive of our companies to internationalise.

This drive will benefit Singapore firms in many ways - to

expand into overseas market, to diversify their risk  and

revenue,  and to upgrade their offerings of services  and

products.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While some companies have scaled back operations in

Singapore,  there have also been investment inflows.  For

example, between 1997 and 2002, EDB

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2593</b></font><br><br>

managed  to  attract  net investment commitments  in  the

manufacturing sector worth $51.7 billion, of which  $38.3

billion  was foreign investment. Total business  spending

by  foreign  services firms was $7.4  billion  over  this

period.  As a result of these inflows, there has  been  a

rise   in   the  stock  of  net  inward  foreign   direct

investment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia, however, has raised a very important

issue  of  the  competition  from  lower-cost  economies.

Indeed,  many new emerging economies, such as  China  and

India, have improved their capabilities and the skills of

their   workers.   Although  our  workers   have   better

capabilities  in  many  instances,  if  our   costs   are

uncompetitive, many companies will relocate operations to

lower-cost countries, and new investments would not  come

into Singapore.  We would then eventually see a hollowing

out of the Singapore economy. Jobs would be lost, and new

jobs would not be created. It is therefore vital that  we

restructure our economy to meet these challenges.



<br><br><i>Impact of CPF Cut on Investments</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chia asked what the estimated investment in and

outflow  from  Singapore would be  if  the  employer  CPF

contribution rate is cut by 6%. A CPF cut alone will  not

ensure  that  Singapore  stays competitive.  Nor  can  we

quantify  the  impact of a cut in CPF rates in  isolation

from other measures to boost investments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Review Committee has addressed a wide

range    of    issues   that   impinge   on   Singapore's

competitiveness.    These   measures   include   external

measures  to  enlarge  our economic  space,  as  well  as

internal  measures to build new capabilities,  invest  in

our  people through education and training, and to ensure

that our overall costs are competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several measures have already been taken to lower

costs.  These  include  cuts in  corporate  and  personal

income tax rates, competition in the energy market and  a

programme  of  industrial land sales to ensure  that  our

land  costs  are  kept internationally competitive.   The

corporate tax

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2594</b></font><br><br>

rate has been cut to 22%, and will be brought down to 20%

by  2005.  Last year, the price of industrial space  fell

by 8%, while industrial space rentals fell by 7%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wages constitute, on average, over a quarter of

total business costs excluding the cost of materials  and

purchases.   A reduction in CPF would lower the  cost  of

doing business here. It would be an integral part of  the

comprehensive strategy to attract and retain  investments

in  Singapore. More importantly, it would make  our  wage

system  more  flexible,  thereby  making  it  easier  for

employers to hire workers when conditions improve.  Taken

together,   these   measures  will  enhance   Singapore's

attractiveness to investors. This will lead to  more  and

better jobs for Singaporeans.

<div align="center"><b>DISCONNECTION OF UTILITIES SUPPLIES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Assistance schemes for affected households)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Dr Mohamad Maliki bin Osman</b> asked the Minister

for  Trade and Industry (a) what is the breakdown of  the

number  of  households whose utility supplies  have  been

disconnected in the last six months, by flat size and the

average period and amount for which these households have

been  in  arrears; (b) whether SP Services Ltd will  work

with  the Community Development Councils (CDCs) in making

a  proper  assessment  of the family's  situation  before

deciding  to  disconnect  their  utility  supplies;   (c)

whether  for genuine financial hardship cases as assessed

by  the CDCs and social service agencies, SP Services Ltd

will  consider deferring their payments for  the  arrears

and  allow  them  to only pay the current  charges  until

their financial situation improves or a reasonable period

of  time  has elapsed; (d) whether SP Services  Ltd  will

consider introducing a stored value system like those  in

the  US  and  Britain to help Singaporeans take  personal

responsibility for their utility usage.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for water utilities, PUB's

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2595</b></font><br><br>

policy,  since late 2002, has been to thimble  the  water

supply  instead of disconnecting it. There have therefore

been  no  disconnections for occupied households  in  the

last six months. This practice will be extended until the

economic situation improves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For electricity utilities, from January 2003 to June

2003,  there  have  been  a  total  of  24,786  cases  of

electricity disconnections.  This works out to an average

of  4,131  cases per month.  The House would be  glad  to

note  that  households in 1- and 2-room flats make  up  a

very  tiny  proportion of these disconnection cases.   In

fact, they constitute only 0.06% of those that have  been

disconnected.  This reflects the fact that such  families

are  helped,  to  a  very large extent,  by  the  various

community  assistance schemes that are already  in  place

and act as a safety net for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On average, electricity accounts get reconnected

after  12  to 15 days. This happens when households  make

arrangements  with  SP  Services  to  pay  up  on   their

accounts. Households will get reconnected when  they  pay

off  their  current bill. Previous arrears  can  then  be

repaid through instalments.



<br><br><i>Working with CDCs</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SP Services takes disconnection of the utilities

seriously. Before disconnection, SP Services delivers  at

least two reminders (pink notices) and a final notice  of

intended  disconnection.  SP Services works very  closely

with  the  CDCs. When customers inform SP  Services  that

they are facing financial hardship and are unable to make

any  payments, SP Services will recommend them  to  their

respective CDCs for financial aid.



<br><br><i>Deferring Payment for Genuine Hardship Cases</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After CDCs or social agencies have assessed cases as

facing  genuine hardship, SP Services will not disconnect

but  allow deferment of payment of the arrears, up  to  a

maximum of three months, until the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2596</b></font><br><br>

household's   financial  situation   improves.   However,

households  must pay their current charges.  This  is  to

prevent a snowballing of debt. At the end of the day, the

arrears in utilities charges have to be paid. The crux of

the matter is that households in difficulty will have  to

make  attempts to reduce their consumption of electricity

and  water.   Those  in hardship should  seek  assistance

either  from within their family circle or from the  CCCs

and CDCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has multiple schemes to help low

income  households  in financial hardship  to  pay  their

utility  bills. The Rent and Utilities Assistance  Scheme

(RUAS)  helps households renting 1-, 2- and 3-room flats.

The Interim Short-Term Financial Assistance Scheme (IFAS)

is applicable to households owning 1-,  2-, 3- and 4-room

flats.  If  eligible, the CDCs administering the  schemes

will  help  households pay for up to six  months  of  the

households' utilities.



<br><br><i>Stored Value Metering System</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stored value meter system which Dr Maliki

proposed has in fact been considered in the past.  It  is

a  very  expensive system. The average cost of  a  normal

electricity meter for individual households is  $35.   In

comparison,  a  basic stored value metering  system  will

cost  about  $500 per household. For stored  value  water

metering system, a normal water meter costs an average of

$18;  a  stored  value water meter would cost  more  than

$1,500. If the cost of the stored value metering were  to

be borne by only those households opting for it, it would

be  an  expensive burden for them. If the cost is  spread

across  the whole system, we will be raising the  overall

system cost and electricity tariffs will have to rise  as

a result.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, we will continue to track developments

on  this and if there are other cost-effective solutions,

we will certainly be prepared to re-consider.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Sir, point

of   clarification  and  supplementary   question.    The

Minister  of State mentioned that SP Services is prepared

to defer payment of arrears by a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2597</b></font><br><br>

period of three months if the cases are assessed to be in

genuine  hardship by the CDCs.  The CDCs usually take  an

average  of  two  months to process  a  case.   Would  SP

Services withhold any action with regard to disconnection

or  impending disconnection until the CDCs have completed

their  investigations  and  assessments  and  made  their

recommendations?

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> Sir, once a household has

made  contact  with  the relevant  agency  and  is  being

evaluated,  SP  Services will not rush in to  disconnect.

The  crux of the point here is to ensure that efforts are

being  made  to  moderate usage and to restructure  their

finances  so that this debt can be repaid.   As  long  as

genuine  attempts  are being made in that  direction,  SP

Services   has  been  and  will  continue  to   be   very

forbearing.

<div align="center"><b>NEW INVESTMENTS AND JOB CREATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Strategy and plans)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Gan Kim Yong</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  if  he will elaborate on (i) his  strategy  and

plans  to  bring in new investments and create  jobs  and

(ii) the progress made so far.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the global economic

landscape  is changing dramatically. The rise  of  China,

India  and  other  emerging  economies  has  created  new

challenges  for  us. The competition for investments  has

become  more  intense.  But  there  are  also  many   new

opportunities  not  available  to  us  before.  We   have

therefore  to reappraise our strengths and weaknesses  in

the light of this new situation and reposition ourselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our strategy to attract investments and create jobs

has  two  components  - the external  component  and  the

internal component.  First, our external strategy  is  to

work  for  the economic integration of ASEAN,  strengthen

our  linkages to the advanced economies and  develop  new

links  to China, India and other emerging economies.   To

date, we have already

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2598</b></font><br><br>

signed  Free  Trade Agreements (FTAs) with  New  Zealand,

Japan, the European Free Trade Association, Australia and

the  US.   We are currently negotiating FTAs with Mexico,

Canada,  India  and  Jordan.  We are  also  part  of  the

negotiations  for an FTA between ASEAN  and  China.    We

have  commenced negotiations with New Zealand  and  Chile

for  a  trilateral  FTA.  We are  also  likely  to  start

negotiations with South Korea soon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together, these FTAs expand our economic space,

improve our connectivity to the major economic centres in

the world, and strengthen our position as a major hub for

manufacturing  and  services.  Our  FTAs  complement  our

Investment  Guarantee  Agreements  and  Double   Taxation

Agreements   and  reduce  the  friction  to   trade   and

investment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second component of our strategy is internal.

There  are many things that we have to do to upgrade  our

capabilities  and  to  improve  the  efficiency  of   our

economy.   These  were  covered  comprehensively  by  the

Economic  Review  Committee.  Let me summarise  the  four

main thrusts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we must ensure that our infrastructure and

factors   of   production   are   priced   competitively.

Corporate  and  personal income taxes  will  have  to  be

reduced.  Our CPF contributions should be restructured to

reduce  the  statutory burden on employers while  meeting

basic retirement needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we will develop the services sector as a

major  growth engine of our economy.  The services sector

will   create  jobs  both  in  traditional   areas   like

logistics, ICT, financial services and tourism,  as  well

as  in  new  areas  like healthcare,  education  and  the

creative industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we have to push for greater creativity and

entrepreneurship.   We  have  deep  strengths,  and   our

international reputation has never been higher.  We  need

creativity and entrepreneurship to convert our  strengths

and  reputation  to economic value.  We  need  many  more

Singaporeans and Singapore companies

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2599</b></font><br><br>

to exploit new opportunities in the region, China, India,

the Middle East, Central Asia and Latin America.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, we will upgrade our human capital by

investing  heavily  in  the  education  and  training  of

Singaporeans,   and  by  attracting  global   talent   to

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan Kim Yong also asked about the progress made

in our investment promotion efforts.  Notwithstanding the

competition    and   the   uncertain   global    economic

environment,  EDB  has  managed to  bring  in  last  year

manufacturing fixed asset investment (FAI) commitments of

S$9  billion, and services total business spending  (TBS)

commitments of S$2 billion.  These investment commitments

would create 21,000 jobs when fully implemented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first half of 2003, EDB secured S$3.7 billion

worth of manufacturing FAI commitments, and S$1.1 billion

of  services total business spending commitments  despite

SARS.  These would create an additional 9,000 jobs.   EDB

is on track to bringing in S$7.5 billion of manufacturing

investment  commitments this year and  S$1.9  billion  of

services  total  business spending  commitments  for  the

whole of this year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> The

Minister  mentioned  that one of the  strategies  was  to

promote the services sector.  Could the Minister give  an

update on the status of promoting the services sector  in

Singapore?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> The three new areas that we

identified in the ERC are education, healthcare  and  the

creative   industries.   Recently,   I   made   a   media

announcement  on  our  moves to promote  education  as  a

growth  sector.  For healthcare, we will be doing  so  in

the  near future.  For creative services, I believe  MITA

is  heading this project and some presentations  will  be

made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The services sector requires coordination across a

number of Ministries, and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2600</b></font><br><br>

DPM Lee Hsien Loong chairs a Ministerial Committee on the

promotion   of  the  services  sector  to   ensure   that

coordination across Government Ministries and departments

is well carried out.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Sir, could the Minister give an

update  on  whether  any services investments  have  been

brought to Singapore?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> I do not have the details

now  but  I  have  just given the total  numbers  when  I

referred   to   total  business  spending  for   services

investments.   They  refer to the investment  commitments

that  we  have gotten in the services area.  We  are  not

doing badly.  We are achieving our targets.

<div align="center"><b>CHANGI AIRPORT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Competitive advantages)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</b> asked the Minister for

Transport  (a)  what  are the competitive  advantages  of

Changi  Airport  and  (b) what plans and  strategies  are

there for the Airport and its operators, to mount a  pre-emptive  programme to minimise the impact of  competition

from the region and to remain the airport of choice.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Transport) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Transport (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir,

as I had informed Members late last year, my Ministry had

reviewed   and   refined  Changi  Airport's   competitive

strategy.   Our  goal is to anchor our  airline  partners

here,  attract  more airlines to use Changi  Airport  and

position Singapore for the long haul.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me stress to Members that an airport does

not  exist purely on its own merits.  What do I  mean  by

this?   Let  me  illustrate.  If tomorrow, we  are  given

permission to build an equivalent of a Changi Airport  at

the  South  Pole  and we offer airlines all  the  airport

services  free  of charge, can that airport automatically

become  a  hub airport?  I think the answer is  obviously

no.  Airports succeed only when there is enough passenger

demand in the locality that the airport is located.   And

airlines will always fly to airports

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2601</b></font><br><br>

where  there are passengers to be served.  Changi Airport

has  grown over the years because Singapore is a  tourism

centre and a regional business hub.  The large number  of

MNCs  located  here, the significant number of  Singapore

businessmen  and  professionals who travel  regularly  to

serve their regional customers, the many Singaporeans who

travel  abroad each year on holiday and the seven million

tourists we attract every year, all add up to a huge base

load  of  air  travellers.  As long as the base  load  is

here,  airlines will continue to serve us  regardless  of

competition from other airports.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge is how to remain as a key hub airport

for  the region.  Here, connectivity and quality  of  the

airport  are vital factors.  International airlines  that

serve  the  region  in a limited way  will  look  for  an

airport  that  has a good base load and good connectivity

to  the  key cities and attractions in the region.   This

allows  them  to  fly into the selected hub  airport  and

distribute their passengers through other airlines to the

final  destination in the region.  They also look for  an

airport  that their passengers will feel comfortable  and

happy transiting or transferring through.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of connectivity, Changi Airport ranks very

high.   Today, Changi Airport serves 63 airlines  and  is

connected  to  137 airports in the region and  throughout

the  world.   We  will continue our efforts  to  increase

Changi's  connectivity, both in terms of  attracting  new

airlines  as well as actively working with them to  serve

more destinations.  In terms of passenger comfort, Changi

Airport  enjoys significant competitive advantage through

state-of-the-art   infrastructure   that    is    managed

efficiently  and  effectively.  Passengers  using  Changi

find the speedy clearance, the shopping mall environment,

the friendly service and the various passenger facilities

provided a very pleasant experience.  Many contrast  this

with  the  experience  in other airports.   We  therefore

coined  the term "the Changi Experience" to describe  our

airport.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our lead in terms of comfort and service level,

however,  has  been  narrowed in recent  years  with  the

building of newer

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2602</b></font><br><br>

regional airports.  We must therefore continue to upgrade

our  facilities,  raise productivity, improve  operations

and enhance our customer orientation.  As our competitors

catch up, we have to learn from them as well.  The Changi

Experience  is  a  unique  one and  we  must  continually

revitalise and enhance it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that Changi remains ahead of our

competitors,  we have set up a 3-year S$210  million  Air

Hub  Development  Fund in January this year.   Under  the

scheme, we have launched a number of initiatives targeted

at  our  industry  partners  which  will  further  anchor

Changi's  position as the premier regional air hub.   For

example,  CAAS, the Singapore Tourism Board  and  various

agencies  are  collaborating  with  airlines  to  further

stimulate  demand  for air travel to,  through  and  from

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, cost competitiveness is another relevant

factor.    We   will  keep  our  costs   competitive   by

benchmarking internationally and regionally.   Where  the

situation  demands it, we have not hesitated to  step  in

early.   For  example,  CAAS was  one  of  the  first  to

introduce  a  S$45  million  SARS  relief  package   and,

subsequently,  a  S$10  million air  traffic  development

scheme.   Both schemes help the industry to  lower  their

operating  costs.  We will continue to look at  our  cost

structure  to  ensure that our airline partners  find  it

profitable to operate at Changi.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also developed the Airport Logistics Park,

or  ALPS.   Located strategically in Changi's Free  Trade

Zone,  ALPS  leverages on the excellent connectivity  and

superior  handling  efficiency of  Changi  Airport.  This

enables the logistics companies to enjoy rapid turnaround

with  minimal  customs formalities thereby  strengthening

our position as a leading air logistics hub.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In preparation for the longer term, I have tasked my

Ministry  to look at how we can further develop Singapore

as  an International Aviation Centre.  Working with other

agencies,  our vision is to create a vibrant  cluster  of

aviation  and  aerospace companies and activities.   This

will then provide another engine of growth for our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2603</b></font><br><br>

aviation sector.  I can therefore assure Members that  my

Ministry and the CAAS will proactively ensure that Changi

retains its competitive position in the years ahead.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, the success of

Changi  Airport, in short, boils down to satisfaction  of

passengers and our ability to connect with other airports

and  anchor airline partners.  In the Minister's plan  to

continue  to develop the vibrancy of Changi Airport,  how

does  he  propose  to incorporate programmes  that  would

continue to enthuse the service providers to continue  to

deliver  excellent  service, which is  a  very  important

factor  in attracting tourists and passengers to come  to

Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the CAAS engages in close

consultation with all their airline partners.  From these

consultations, they get a better understanding of what is

needed  by not just the airlines but the travel  industry

as  well.  So, by having all these dialogue sessions,  we

are  able to formulate programmes to address areas  where

further improvements are needed.  And I think that is how

Changi Airport has managed to achieve continual progress,

and we will continue to do that.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I understand

that many domestic airlines in Indonesia and also some of

the budget airline operators in the region would like  to

hub in Singapore.  But they are complaining that the cost

of  hubbing  in Singapore is too high.  Are  we  reacting

fast enough to ensure that we are able to attract them to

hub  in  Singapore?   Or are we going  to  wait  until  a

situation arises like PSA where we lose the customers and

then  we take measures to attract them back to Singapore?

I would like to get the Minister's input on this.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, as I explained just now, if

the passenger load is here, airlines will want to operate

through Singapore.  Mr Ravindran mentioned about low-cost

airlines wanting to hub here.  If he

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2604</b></font><br><br>

knows which of these airlines, please let us know and  we

will definitely reach out to them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, budget airlines like ValuAir said that they want to

use  Changi Airport as its hub.  But how can they  do  it

when,  according to the CEO of that budget  airline,  the

landing fees are so high, and that they actually need  to

use  Paya  Lebar Airport instead of Changi Airport.   Can

the Ministry clarify?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I do not know what he is

talking about, because Paya Lebar Airport is not meant to

be  a  civilian  airport.   We are  in  discussions  with

airlines   that  are  interested  in  operating   through

Singapore.   As  I  mentioned just  now,  Changi  Airport

serves over 60 airlines, and they have operated here very

profitably.   If  the budget airlines are  interested  in

operating  here,  I  am  sure they  will  find  Singapore

equally profitable for them.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2604</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>HDB RENTAL FLATS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Dr Mohamad Maliki bin Osman</b> asked the Minister

for  National Development (a) what is the number of  one,

two  and three-room rental flats currently available; (b)

how  many  appeals have been received by the Housing  and

Development Board (HDB) from single mothers with  custody

of children who have been barred from renting a flat from

HDB arising from a sale of their flats due to divorce and

how  many  of  these  appeals have been  successful;  (c)

whether  HDB  will consider reviewing the income  ceiling

for   eligibility   for  rental  flats   to   take   into

consideration   the  total  number  of  people   in   the

household,  such as the per capita income  instead  of  a

generic household income ceiling of $800; and (d) whether

HDB  periodically  reviews  the  financial  situation  of

tenants  such  that  those whose  incomes  have  improved

significantly can be encouraged to purchase  flats,  thus

making  more  rental  flats  available  for  those   more

deserving.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2605</b></font><br><br>

at  end July 2003, HDB has 3,100 1-room, 2,600 2-room and

1,800 3-room vacant rental flats which can be let out.  1- and  2-room flats are rented out to families earning $800

or  less a month under the Public Rental Scheme;  and  3-room  flats  to  households with monthly incomes  between

$800 and $2,000 under the Rent and Purchase Scheme.   The

rents are heavily subsidised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing policy, HDB lessees who have sold

their flats are not eligible to rent a flat from HDB  for

a period of 30 months from the date of sale.  The purpose

of  this  is to ensure that subsidised rental housing  is

targeted at those who are genuinely unable to afford home

ownership.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for cases where the flat is sold due to

divorce, HDB will waive the 30-month debarment and  allow

the divorced mother who has custody of at least one child

to  rent  a  flat  from HDB if she meets the  eligibility

conditions.  Over the past three years, HDB has  assisted

about 1,000 divorced mothers who were granted custody  of

their children to rent flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MND and HDB have just conducted a review of our

rental housing policy.  The review addresses, among other

issues, the MP's questions on whether the current  income

cut-off  of  $800  per  month  is  relevant  and  how  to

encourage rental tenants whose financial situations  have

improved  over  time to buy a home ownership  flat.   The

outcome of the review will be announced shortly.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Sir, if there are more

than 4,000 rental flats that are available right now, why

is  it  that  a lot of my residents keep telling  me  the

response  from HDB is that there is a long waiting  list?

Is there really a long waiting list?  And would the cases

of  single  mothers  who  have a tendency  to  live  like

nomads,  unless they get housing, because they have  been

chased out of their homes, be given priority based on the

circumstances that they face?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I get the Minister correct, the single mothers

are  helped.  Under what circumstances are single mothers

not given

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2606</b></font><br><br>

rental housing or told that they have been debarred,  and

some  of  them have been debarred permanently?  For  such

cases, will HDB also consider their circumstances?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is with regard to single mothers

who are permanent residents (PRs).  I know the policy  is

that  PRs are not eligible for rental flats, but some  of

these  single  mothers do have custody of their  children

and their children are Singaporeans.  But yet, because of

the  policy, they are not allowed to rent those flats and

they are still moving around looking for housing.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, yes, there are 5,700 1- and 2-room flats which are available for renting. However, on

the  other  hand, there is a huge number of  Singaporeans

who  are  also  asking  for such rental  flats  and  they

include  not  just the single mothers, which  the  Member

talked  about, but senior citizens who have  been  chased

out   of  their  homes  by  their  children,  and   other

Singaporeans  who have sold their flats  and  because  of

financial hardship are not able to purchase another flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, there is indeed a long waiting list of

Singaporeans wanting to rent flats from HDB.  And that is

the  reason  why  some of the requests  or  appeals  from

Members  may  not have been acceded to.   There  are,  of

course,   eligibility  criteria  which  HDB  applies   in

processing   these  appeals.   For  example,  citizenship

status,   because  we  do  make  a  distinction   between

Singaporeans  and  permanent  residents,  and   household

income.    There  are,  of  course,  other  disqualifying

criteria,  for example, debarring Singaporeans  who  have

already   benefited  from  two  or  even  three   housing

subsidies  from  applying  for  rental  flats.    It   is

important and necessary for HDB to have these eligibility

criteria   and   debarment  criteria  because   subsidies

involved  in public housing are huge, and we have  to  be

able  to direct the subsidies to those people who require

most.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Member would understand why there is a

need  for such criteria and also why the supply of rental

flats is less

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2607</b></font><br><br>

than  the demand for such flats and for that reason,  not

all  eligible  Singaporeans can be given  a  rental  flat

immediately upon request.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Sir, given the

long  waiting list for rental flats, is there a case  for

increasing  the number of rental flats, especially  given

the   fact   that  there  is  an  increasing  number   of

downgraders as a result of economic hardship?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Budget debate, I have also asked for a

review  of the income ceiling of $800.  And HDB had  then

informed  me  that  it was already  reviewing  it.   And,

today, the Minister said that they just reviewed it.  Can

I have an assurance that HDB will announce the outcome of

the  review  soon?   Because many  Singaporeans  who  are

caught  by this $800 income ceiling criterion desperately

need a HDB rental flat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Yes, the Member did hear me

correctly.  HDB is reviewing it, and I would like to  ask

the Member to be a bit patient.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, the Minister has

mentioned  about  the 1,800 units of 3-room  flats.   Are

they  rental or purchase flats and are they  old  or  new

flats?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> These 1,800 flats are actually

rental  flats.   They are actually for people  under  the

Rent  and  Purchase Scheme.  Under the  Rent and Purchase

Scheme,  we rent these flats to families whose  household

incomes are below $2,000, with the proviso that over time

we will sell them these flats at a discount, so that they

can  become  home-owners as well.  The 3-room  flats  for

purchase are actually a separate matter.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Sir, may I clarify?

On  the  5,000-odd rental flats that are  available,  are

these currently vacant flats?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> No, available.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2608</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> "Available" meaning

they  are  already  occupied  or  they  are  vacant   and

available?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> No. They are available flats. Not

all of them are occupied, but there is a waiting list for

such flats.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, can the Minister

clarify  if  rental  rates could be set  according  to  a

percentage of the applicant's household income like, say,

10%,  instead  of  a heavily subsidised rate  across  the

different income levels, so as to better manage and  meet

the demands from the long waiting list?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I am not sure whether the Member is

aware  of the rental rates that we are charging.   If  he

has  checked them out, I think he will find that they are

actually  much more generous than what he has  mentioned.

To  follow his recommendation, I would be quite happy  to

consider.   But  I  do not think it would  be  very  well

received.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> I want to ask the Minister: if

these  rental flats are still available, why is  there  a

queue?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, it does not mean that all the

applicants  who apply will be given a flat  straightaway.

I am not sure whether the Member is aware of this.  But I

have  come  across  such cases in my own  meet-the-people

sessions where a person is given a flat in Jurong, but he

says,  "I don't want a flat in Jurong.  I want a flat  in

Bedok or Tampines."  So we tell him that there is no such

flat  available.  And he says, "No, I do not wish to have

this  flat."  The flat is available for him but  he  does

not want it.  But, on the other hand, there are those who

want  the flat anywhere but are not eligible.  So,  as  a

result  of  this,  there is always this mismatch  between

supply and demand.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Sir, I am sorry, I

still  do  not  quite understand.  There  are  5,000-over

flats  available.  Does it mean that they  are  currently

available in the market for applicants to apply to  rent,

ie, they are vacant, they are available, but

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2609</b></font><br><br>

not the total number of rental flats that HDB has?  Am  I

right?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Let me start from the beginning.

There  are  3,100  1-room flats and 2,600  2-room  flats.

These  1-  and 2-room flats, totalling 5,700  flats,  are

available for rental under the Public Rental Scheme.  Not

all  of  them  are occupied, but there is a long  waiting

list  for  such flats.  If tomorrow we say that everybody

on  the queue overnight would be given a key, then all of

these flats will be taken up.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> To rephrase or

understand  it, it means these 5,000-plus flats  are  the

total  number  of  flats that HDB has for  rental.   What

proportion  of  it is currently available or  vacant  for

people to rent?  And, at the same time, can I also ask if

the  Minister can provide information on what is the size

of the waiting list for us to know the extent of the wait

that  our residents will have to endure?  Also, based  on

the  waiting  list, has HDB certain kinds  of  assessment

criteria  to  look  at the seriousness  as  well  as  the

urgency  of the needs of such families, for example,  the

single  mothers  who really do not have anywhere  to  go,

except  to  rely  on the sympathies of  friends  and  the

goodwill of others?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I do not have the exact number of

flats that are currently vacant, but I will check up  and

give the Member the number.  But I think that is not  the

point.   The  point  really is  that  our  rental  scheme

carries  a  heavy  subsidy.  And, because  of  that,  not

everybody who shows up at his meet-the-people session who

asks  for a rental flat will automatically be given  one.

That  is not possible.  However, there are those who  are

eligible.   As I said, for those eligible and  when  they

come  to  us, we will offer them these flats  when  their

turn is due on the queue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, there are two separate matters. One is the

number  of  flats which are currently in stock under  the

Public  Rental Scheme.  There is a separate matter  which

the  Member is alluding to, that is, we should change our

criteria and we should be more generous in allowing, say,

single mothers to rent HDB flats.  I think that is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2610</b></font><br><br>

a separate matter.  It is a policy issue.  I have earlier

explained why we have to have certain criteria,  and  not

everybody  who  sells  a  flat straightaway,  or  who  is

divorced  and  applies for a flat, will be  automatically

given a flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, a Singapore permanent resident with a child who

is  a  Singaporean is in need of a flat.  But  under  our

current  criteria, we would not give that family  a  flat

automatically.    However,  if  there   are   extenuating

circumstances,  if  it is a matter  of  severe  financial

hardship,  we would consider it on a case-by-case  basis.

But, as a general policy, the answer is no, we would  not

give.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> May I ask the Minister

whether  he  would also consider renting flats  to  those

young couples who may not want to commit to buy new flats

when  they  get married due to the trend of  unemployment

and the prospects of the present job market?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, currently we do not cater to

this  group  of  people  because  our  rental  flats  are

subsidised flats and they are really meant for  those  in

the  lower  income groups.  However, I do recognise  that

what the Member has suggested is something that we should

look  into  and HDB is looking into it, and  we  will  be

making some announcements.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Could I ask the

Minister?  Obviously, there is so much mismatch  -  there

is  a queue, there are vacant flats.  Would HDB, in fact,

be  doing a review?  Because the Minister is saying  that

right now there are certain criteria and because of that,

we  do  not  accommodate a lot of people.  But  it  would

appear that there is quite a need out there.  Would there

be  a  review  done?  Is there review in the  works?   If

there  is not, would he consider that it might be  timely

to  do a review?  I think for many of the criteria put in

place  in  years  past, circumstances  have  changed  and

society  has changed to some extent.  So, would a  review

not be timely?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I am not exactly sure what the

Member has in mind when she talks about a review in terms

of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2611</b></font><br><br>

eligibility  criteria.  We have certain very  fundamental

criteria.    For  example,  the  criterion  on  Singapore

citizenship.   I think that is a very fundamental  point.

Singaporeans enjoy significant public housing  subsidies;

permanent  residents do not.  That is a distinction  that

we  have made and we are sticking to that distinction for

good reason.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What other eligibility criteria are we talking

about?   The  30-month debarment which many  Members  are

familiar with.  Why do we have a 30-month debarment?  For

the  simple  reason that we do not want to have  somebody

who is not deserving of this subsidy, or somebody who has

just  sold the flat, or somebody who has sold his private

property  and  comes  on  to the HDB  queue  straightaway

overnight.   We say, "No.  If you have sold your  private

property and you are eligible for HDB flat, you  wait  30

months."  I think that is a reasonable criterion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are any specific areas where the Member

would   like  us  to  review,  in  terms  of  eligibility

criteria, we would be pleased to consider it.  But as  it

stands at the moment, the criteria are very simple.  Over

and above that, I have said many times in this House that

HDB  is  always willing to look at specific  cases  where

they   pertain  to  individual  hardship,  or   financial

hardship, where it is due to unforeseen circumstances, or

demise  of  a  family  member,  etc.   So  there  are  no

situations,  as  far as I know, where we have  absolutely

said no, where severe individual circumstances warrant us

to look at those cases.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, may I

ask the Minister whether he will consider converting some

of  the  unsold  new flats, for example, in  Jurong  West

area,  as  temporary rental flats for those  Singaporeans

who need to rent the flats?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Is the Member talking about

subsidised or non-subsidised rentals?

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Subsidised rentals.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2612</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> In other words, it is an extension

of the rental scheme.  We are looking at some arrangement

along these lines.  If he could be patient, we will  give

him the answer.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Could I

ask  the  Minister how many appeals have HDB  acceded  to

where this 30-month waiver is concerned?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I do not have the number with

me.   But  I  can  tell her that it is quite  significant

because I do come across individual cases where the  case

report   was  brought  to  my  attention  and   HDB   had

recommended and the relevant committees had approved.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, would the Minister

look  into  allowing the establishment of  a  HDB  rental

market by relaxing the rules for rental of the whole  HDB

flat?   This  will increase the supply and  lower  rental

cost   and,  indirectly,  reduce  the  demand   for   HDB

subsidised rental units.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, this is one of the suggestions

that  we  are  looking into, so if the  Member  could  be

patient.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think we have taken too long on this

Question.  I will allow two last questions by Dr Lily Neo

and Mdm Cynthia Phua.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister whether he will

consider  moderating  our  HDB  home  ownership   as   an

enhancement   policy   due   to   our   present   changed

circumstances that Singaporeans are facing?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I think the Member is talking about

something else entirely.  It is not about rental housing.

Is she talking about upgrading?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> It is rental flats per se. If you do

not  need to invest in HDB property, then you can provide

more rental flats.  It is related.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I think the Member has to be

patient.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2613</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Sir, since the

Minister is so generous, could he even consider the new 4- and  5-room  flats  as rental flats?   I  am  just  being

realistic.   Could he consider more 3-room  flats  to  be

rental flats?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> We do not have 4- and 5-room flats

for rental.  Our rental schemes do not extend to 4- and 5-room  flats.  We have 3-room flats for rental,  but  they

are  specifically for those families whose  incomes  fall

below  a  certain level, and they are meant to facilitate

them  to  buy  that flat in later years as  their  income

levels  improve.  So we do not have 4- and  5-room  flats

for  rental.   I  am not sure whether I  gave  the  wrong

impression to the Member just now.

<div align="center"><b>SETTING UP OF PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</b> asked the Acting Minister for

Education (a) what is the rationale for rejecting our own

proposal to open a fourth local university in view of the

Economic Development Board courting such a deal  with  an

international  university; (b)  how  can  the  Government

ensure  that such international universities will  be  of

equivalent  academic standards as our  own  universities;

(c)  whether  Public Service Commission scholarships  and

other  Government scholarships will include these private

universities   in  their  eligibility   list   for   such

scholarships.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (Acting Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam):</b> Sir, the idea of a fourth publicly-funded university was studied by the Committee to Review

the  University  Sector and Graduate  Manpower  Planning,

chaired  by Dr Ng Eng Hen, as part of its overall  review

of the sector.  The Committee, which completed its report

earlier   this  year,   concluded  that   there   was   a

sufficiently  large pool of good students  to  sustain  a

high-quality public university sector catering to 25%  of

our  primary  one cohort, higher than the 21%  currently.

However, the Committee also pointed out that a new fourth

university will find it difficult to attract good quality

students  and  faculty staff.  The commitment  of  public

funds is likely to yield far

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2614</b></font><br><br>

better  results if we were to leverage on the  value  and

reputation   already  created  in  our   three   existing

universities - NUS, NTU and SMU.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By expanding NTU to become a comprehensive

university  and  by transforming NUS into a  multi-campus

university,  we  are  setting out  to  achieve  what  the

earlier  fourth university proposal aimed to  accomplish,

that  is,  creating university capacity for  25%  of  our

primary one cohort, while maintaining high quality.   The

Review  Committee  also supported  allowing  a  few  good

quality  private  universities to  provide  undergraduate

education   in   Singapore   beyond   the   25%    cohort

participation   rate.   The  Government  accepted   these

recommendations in May this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreign university that EDB plans to attract is

therefore  not  a  substitute  for  the  earlier   fourth

university  idea.  A foreign university, if  established,

will  be  privately-funded.  It would provide  access  to

university  education in Singapore  over  and  above  the

target  cohort participation rate of 25% in our publicly-funded  universities.  And it will not detract  from  the

initiatives that our own universities are taking to build

excellence.   Instead, a Singapore campus of a  reputable

foreign university, by expanding the choices available to

students  and  faculty, can add to the  vibrance  of  the

university sector as a whole.  To support this objective,

MOE  will  work  closely with EDB  to  ensure  that  only

quality  universities with good academic credentials  are

invited to establish a campus here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Mdm Ho's query on scholarships, PSC

or  MOE  does  not  decide on the  universities  for  our

scholars.  It is the scholar who decides where  he  wants

to study.  The scholar is allowed his choice provided the

university   is   of  good  standing,  known   to   offer

sufficiently rigorous curricula to its students, and  the

courses pursued meet the needs of the organisation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Will the Minister

elaborate on what he meant by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2615</b></font><br><br>

quality students and quality staff in the context of  the

analysis?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> The Committee, in its

study, had assessed the pool of students coming out  from

our  schools  and  polytechnics and  had  concluded  that

catering to 25% of Primary 1 cohort will not diminish the

quality   we   expect  to  see  of  our   publicly-funded

universities in Singapore.  As for staff, it  is  a  more

fluid  matter because the universities can attract  staff

from  around the world.  So the key criterion  is  really

the   students.    Establishing   quality   undergraduate

training  in Singapore requires that you ultimately  have

students   who  are  able  to  benefit  from  a  rigorous

university education and meet the graduate manpower needs

of the economy.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> I would like to clarify with the

Minister.   Since  this  university  is  going  to  be  a

privately-funded  one, and we are also  going  to  ensure

that  it  is a university of quality standing,  we  could

expect  therefore that the students that would  be  drawn

into  this  university would also be the  better  quality

students  who can afford to enter this university.   What

would be the outcome for us?  Would we end up promoting a

very elitist society?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> I would not at all

assume  that  the  students who enter  the  campus  of  a

foreign university would be superior in quality to  those

entering our existing publicly-funded universities.  I do

not  have any reason to expect that.  In fact, I  do  not

expect that.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister, in view of

international universities coming in, together  with  our

local universities, would there be an accreditation  body

for  universities  that will be set up  so  that  we  can

regulate    matters,   like   quality   and   curriculum?

Otherwise, there will be some disparity over time and  it

is  very  hard then to try to make sure that  we  are  of

comparable standards.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2616</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Singapore is a small

city.   We have only a few universities.  I think  rather

than  set  up  an  elaborate system for  accrediting  the

quality  of  universities, it is more useful  if,  first,

within  our publicly-funded universities, MOE works  with

the  universities  to establish that  they  have  a  good

quality  assurance  system in place.   There  is  a  high

degree  of  transparency about the quality of degrees  in

Singapore.   Employers know the universities,  they  know

the different faculties in the universities.  We have  to

ensure  that  we  do  not  spare  resources  on  ensuring

continued improvement on quality within the universities.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> May I seek

clarification from the Minister?  I believe  we  classify

SMU  as  a private university, but yet we have subvention

from  the Government.  Can I understand that this concept

of  the  fourth university with international  university

would  be  truly a private university, in the sense  that

there is no Government subvention, or would there be  any

Government subvention of some kind?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> MOE would not provide

subventions   to   a  privately-funded  university,   for

instance, a foreign university attracted by EDB.  Whether

EDB  provides some incentives for this university or  any

other  educational institution that they seek to  attract

to  Singapore  is a separate matter.  That is  a  broader

matter of investment promotion and building Singapore  as

an  education hub.  MOE does not intend to subsidise  the

education  provided  by  any private  university  or  any

private education provider generally.

<div align="center"><b>POLITICAL APPOINTMENTS IN GOVERNMENT</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Prime Minister

(a)  what  are  (i)  the  reasons  for  keeping  so  many

Ministers  in  the Prime Minister's Office and  (ii)  the

duties  and responsibilities assigned for each  of  these

Ministers; and (b) whether the number of senior political

appointments   in  Government  can  be  cut   to   reduce

Government expenditures.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2617</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Sir,

there  are seven Ministers in the Prime Minister's Office

(PMO),  excluding  the  Prime  Minister.   Each  one  has

specific duties and responsibilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew. The Cabinet taps

Senior  Minister's  wealth of experience,  knowledge  and

insights  on a wide range of issues.  Senior Minister  is

also  the  Chairman  of  GIC, the  Government  investment

management  company  which  invests  Singapore's  foreign

reserves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is the

Minister   for  Finance  and  Chairman  of  the  Monetary

Authority of Singapore.  He is under PMO because he  also

looks  after  the Public Service Division, which  handles

the personnel matters and policies of public officers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan is the Co-ordinating Minister for Security and Defence. We created

this new appointment because of the grave threat posed by

terrorism.   The  threat cuts across  the  work  of  many

Ministries, and requires overarching supervision.  Dr Tan

chairs  the  Inter-Ministerial Committee on Security  and

Defence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan is also in charge of university education.

In addition, he chairs the Inter-Ministerial Committee on

Developing Research and Professional Manpower.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Minister Lee Yock Suan, as Second Minister for

Foreign  Affairs,  helps the Foreign Minister  in  policy

issues  as well as some of his many overseas travels  and

meetings.   The  Ministerial appointment  in  PMO  is  to

reflect  Mr  Lee's  status as  a  senior  member  of  the

Cabinet.   It  carries  more weight  when  he  represents

Singapore overseas than the title of Second Minister  for

Foreign Affairs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Minister Lim Boon Heng is the Secretary-General

of  the  NTUC.  Because of the important role our workers

play in the economy, the NTUC Secretary-General holds  an

appointment in PMO.  He reflects the views of workers  to

the Cabinet.  In

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2618</b></font><br><br>

turn,  he  transmits the thinking of  the  Government  on

economic and labour-related issues to the unions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) For the same reason, Mr Matthias Yao Chih,

Deputy Secretary-General of NTUC, is a Senior Minister of

State in PMO.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Minister Lim Hng Kiang is Minister in PMO

and  Second Minister for Finance.  Within PMO,  he  looks

after  the  issues  of  aging  population,  marriage  and

procreation,  and the attraction of international  talent

to   Singapore.   These  population-related  issues   are

crucial to the long-term survival and prosperity  of  the

country, and they cut across several Ministries.  Mr  Lim

also  runs  the  day-to-day affairs of  the  Ministry  of

Finance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no immediate plans to reduce the number of

senior political appointments in the Government.  All  of

them have substantive responsibilities.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would the

Deputy  Prime  Minister agree that  there  is  a  growing

public perception that the Prime Minister's Office is the

holding   ground  for  older  Ministers  awaiting   their

retirement, and that something should be done  to  change

that   perception?   It  does  not  matter  whether  that

perception is correct or wrong, but something has  to  be

done to change the perception.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> I am not aware of any such

perception.   If  anything,  people  accuse  the   Senior

Minister of being too active rather than waiting for  his

retirement, and I think that is not a bad thing.

<div align="center"><b>SEXUALITY EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Dr Mohamad Maliki bin Osman</b> asked the Acting

Minister   for   Education  whether  the   incidence   of

pregnancies and abortions among school-going teenage

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2619</b></font><br><br>

girls  are  on  the  rise  and whether  his  Ministry  is

evaluating  the  effectiveness of the  current  sexuality

education implemented in schools to address the issue.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, may I ask a

supplementary question on Question 8?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have already called for the next

Question, Mr Low.  Mr Shanmugaratnam.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Sir, the incidence of

teenage pregnancy and abortion among school-going teenage

girls  is  not  rising.  The number has, in fact,  fallen

slightly  over the last three years for all females  aged

17 and below, and remained fairly constant for those aged

18-19.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sexuality education provided in our schools aims

to   provide   pupils  with  essential  knowledge   about

sexuality  matters,  including  consequences  of  teenage

sexual activity, pregnancy and abortion.  It equips  them

with  the skills to make informed and responsible choices

on sexuality matters.  It also challenges teenagers to re-examine their values and attitudes on issues and persuade

them to adopt a more value-based standard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sexuality education in schools should help, but will

not  be  a  panacea.  There are many factors involved  in

teenage  pregnancy and abortion.  They include a lack  of

family support and cohesiveness, sexual abuse and a  lack

of  understanding  of responsibilities in  relationships.

It is a complex issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is early days to assess the impact of the

sexuality   education  programme.   But   teachers   have

reported  that  our pupils have responded well.   Pupils'

responses   to  pre-  and  post-programme  questionnaires

indicate  significant increase in their understanding  of

sexuality matters, including the negative consequences of

teenage sexual activity.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2620</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also getting good support from our parents.

Although  parents have the choice to opt  their  children

out  of  the  sexuality education programme, the  opt-out

rate  is  less than 1%.  We will continue to monitor  the

overall impact of the programme on pupils' sexual  values

and attitudes, which will take longer to ascertain.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Sir, I just wonder

whether the sexuality education programme in the Ministry

of Education includes information on the avenues that the

girls can go to should they end up being pregnant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, are schools equipped to deal with such

pregnancy  situations, ie, if a girl  gets  pregnant  and

goes to the teacher, what does the teacher do?  What kind

of  advice does the teacher give, and what happens to the

girl?   Is  she  allowed to continue schooling?   If  she

wants  to carry the pregnancy to full term, what are  the

avenues for such a person?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> First, I should say that

the  teachers  who  are  involved in  teaching  sexuality

education are specially chosen and specially trained, and

they   are  backed  up  by  a  cross-disciplinary   team,

including  Ministry  of  Education guidance  specialists,

psychologists,  medical  and  even  legal  professionals.

Obviously,  when it comes to a case of actual  pregnancy,

it is something which requires very specific counselling,

and  we  do  refer  our students to counsellors  who  are

trained for the purpose.

<div align="center"><b>EN-BLOC DEVELOPMENT SALES</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon</b> asked the Minister for Law

whether  he will take steps to ensure in cases of en-bloc

development sales that (a) all owners of strata units  in

a  development are informed (i) progressively  and  on  a

regular basis of the percentage of owners who have  given

consent  for  the  sale  prior to reaching  the  required

approval  percentage and (ii) of further developments  on

the  proposed en-bloc sale regardless of whether they had

given their consent or not; and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2621</b></font><br><br>

(b) a maximum period for the required percentage approval

to  be  obtained be specified, and where this  cannot  be

obtained, a reasonable period should lapse before another

attempt to obtain approval is made.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Senior Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Law):</b> Sir, our ground

feedback  is that there are no serious problems with  the

procedures to secure consent for an en-bloc sale.  By and

large, the procedures set out in the Land Titles (Strata)

Act have worked well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, my Ministry is reviewing the

procedures  on  en-bloc  sales, in  light  of  experience

gained,  since  the law was enacted  in  1999.   We  will

consider Mr Tan's suggestions in this review.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we are unable to state definitely now what

will  be  the specific amendments which we will make,  my

Ministry  is  sympathetic to Mr Tan's  call  for  greater

transparency  in  the  process of securing  the  required

majority to get an en-bloc sale.  We will also favourably

consider  his  idea  of  fixing  a  maximum  period   for

obtaining the required percentage approval.

<div align="center"><b>RETUNING THE CPF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Prime Minister)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, from time to

time,  a  nation comes to a crossroads.  The people  must

then  decide which road to take, to continue the journey.

One  road  may lead them up to the sunny highlands.   The

other road may go deeper into the gloomy valley.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is at such a crossroads.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down one road, the view is familiar. We see, as part

of  the landscape, our present policies and practices and

our  high wage and CPF systems.  This is the easiest road

to take.  Politically too, it is the most convenient.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But maintaining the status quo means carrying a

heavy  load of costs, and relying on outdated  models  of

economic  growth.   This  will weigh  us  down.  We  will

descend into the gloomy valley.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take the second road, which leads to the

highlands, we will have to shed some of our load, through

wage and CPF

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2623</b></font><br><br>

reforms  and  other measures.  We will then  be  able  to

travel lighter, and move more nimbly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But shedding our load will involve sacrifice and

pain.   We  may  have  to  adjust  our  aspirations   and

lifestyles.  Moreover, there is no guarantee of  success.

How  we progress will depend on what our competitors  do,

and the state of the world economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This second road of reform and restructuring is

unpaved  and  difficult  to  travel.   It  will   be   an

uncomfortable journey, even painful at times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I know that taking the first road will lead us

deeper and deeper into gloom.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why I want Singaporeans to come along with

me  on  the  road of reform and restructuring.   On  this

road,  we stand a much better chance of economic recovery

and sustained growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are we in this tough spot? The reason is

globalisation.     Products   and   services,    capital,

investments,  companies  and  people  are  moving  across

borders more and more freely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globalisation has benefited Singapore immensely. We

have attracted many MNCs to Singapore, created many jobs,

and  sold  our products and services to the rest  of  the

world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these same forces of globalisation can also work

against us.  Globalisation is not just about exports.  It

is  about  producing goods and services wherever  in  the

world  it  can  be done most cheaply and efficiently.  So

when   lower-cost  players  emerge,  and   we   are   not

competitive,  investments will  flow  into  these  places

rather than to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reorganisation of the global economy has been

going  on for some time.  But the process has accelerated

in  recent  years.   Jobs  are migrating  from  developed

countries  to  developing  countries  faster  than   ever

before.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2624</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore too has been affected. For example,

Maxtor,  a disk drive manufacturer, will be reducing  its

Singapore workforce once its China plant comes on-line in

2005.  Maxtor will produce entry-level disk drives in the

China  plant,  while  keeping  its  production  of  high-capacity drives here.  Maxtor's competitors, Seagate  and

Western  Digital,  have also reduced  their  presence  in

Singapore. Seagate has shifted its manufacture of low-end

drives to China.  Over the last five years, its Singapore

workforce has been reduced from a high of 25,000  workers

to  9,000  workers today.  Western Digital shifted  2,500

jobs to Malaysia in 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not just blue-collar jobs that are moving

offshore.  White-collar jobs are also migrating  to  low-cost  countries like the Philippines, Thailand and India.

Our  graduates  and yuppies are feeling the  heat.   Last

year,  for  the first time, more professionals, managers,

executives  and  technicians  (PMETs)  were   laid   off,

compared  to production and related workers.  PMETs  form

43%  of  all  local workers retrenched.   Production  and

related  workers  form  34%, while  clerical,  sales  and

service workers made up the remaining 23%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The migration of white-collar jobs will pick up

speed in coming years.  Analysts expect many jobs in data

entry, data reconciliation, call centres and other  back-end functions to move to lower-cost countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you can see, our economy is restructuring

rapidly, whether we like it or not, whether we are  ready

for  it  or not.  It is, therefore, important for  us  to

have  some  levers  to pull, to influence  the  pace  and

direction of this restructuring. Then we can minimise the

negative impact on Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These levers include reforming our tax regime,

moderating  our  land  prices and rentals,  investing  in

education  and skills training, moving into research  and

development,  constructing the Biopolis  to  nurture  the

life   sciences   and  pharmaceutical   industries,   and

developing   other  growth  sectors  like   medical   and

educational services.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2625</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these changes will not be enough to stem the

outflow  of  jobs.  We will also have to  keep  our  wage

costs competitive, and not too far out of line with those

in  the  region.    Presently,  for  every  manufacturing

worker  in Singapore, a company can hire 13 in China  and

18  in  India. For every accountant in Singapore, a  firm

can  hire two in Malaysia and six in Thailand.  The large

wage  differential will push jobs out of  Singapore,  and

discourage new investments from coming in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why we must go beyond the recommendations of

the  Economic  Review Committee (ERC), and  make  further

changes to the CPF scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF retuning will affect all Singapore workers.

It  will  be  painful, which is why  I  have  decided  to

present  the  CPF  changes myself.  At the  National  Day

Rally, I outlined the changes. Today, I will lay out  the

details.



<br><br><i>Social objectives</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF is Singapore's most important social safety

net.  Its first and principal objective is to provide for

the  retirement needs of Singaporeans.  Later,  we  added

other  social  objectives like saving for home  ownership

and healthcare.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These objectives remain valid today. In fact, the

needs have grown.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, retirement expenses will go up because

people  are  living longer.  An article in the  New  York

Times talked about the possibility of living to 600 years

old,  because  of the promises of genetic  medicine.   It

explained   that  our  organs  might  break  down.    But

scientists  were now breeding special animals that  could

grow replacement human hearts and lungs.  Scientists have

also  found a chemical in red wine - for those  who  love

red  wine, please note - which may slow down ageing.  And

gene  therapy  will allow us to conquer  many  previously

incurable diseases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think many people relish the idea of living

to  600.   Can you imagine having to face your enemy  for

600 years?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2626</b></font><br><br>

But I think most people would not mind living to 100.  In

fact, a good number of Singaporeans are already living to

near  a  century. Today, 40,000 Singaporeans are over  80

years old.  Of these, 5,000 are over 90!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prolonging lives will lead to new social problems,

and  certainly, a need to save more for a longer old  age

and higher medical expenses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from the social perspective, the higher the CPF

contribution rate, the better.



<br><br><i>Economic concerns</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But increasingly, we must also consider the impact

of the CPF on our cost competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 70s, 80s and 90s, cost competitiveness was

not an overriding concern.  We had good growth year after

year. During those 30 years, we grew by 8% annually.  Our

salaries  too  rose by an average of 8%  every  year.  We

could afford to put a lot into the CPF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our business costs then were lower than those in

developed  countries.  And we faced limited  competition.

Many  of  today's emerging economies were under communist

regimes  at  that time. Others were highly regulated  and

protectionist.  China and India, for instance,  were  not

open and attractive to foreign investments. Singapore, in

fact, was one of the earlier and most ardent advocates of

an open, MNC-based economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But times have changed. China and India, with a

combined population of more than two billion people, have

entered  the  economic  race.  So  too  have  many  other

countries, like in Central and Eastern Europe.  They  are

following  our  MNC-based strategy for  economic  growth.

Their  low cost of doing business is extremely attractive

to investors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the cost of doing business in

Singapore  has  reached First World levels,  as  has  our

standard of living.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2627</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Cost competitiveness is a key worry for Singapore today.</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, from the economic perspective, we should

keep  the  CPF contribution rate as low as possible.  The

lower  we go, the less the pressure on companies to  move

out  because  of high wage costs.  Wages account  for  as

much  as  20-30%  of  total  business  costs  in  certain

industries.



<br><br><i>A new balance is needed</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why we need to retune our CPF scheme - to

strike a better balance between our social objectives and

our economic concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will need to address four aspects of the CPF

system:  the contribution rates, the salary ceiling,  the

CPF  and Medisave Minimum Sums and the withdrawal at  age 55.



<br><br><i>CPF contribution rates</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the CPF contribution rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF rate is currently 36%: 20% from the

employee  and 16% from the employer.  The Government  had

intended  to  restore the CPF rate to 40%  when  economic

conditions permit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But looking forward to the future competitive

environment, this is no longer advisable.  It would price

us  out of the market. We would lose more jobs. We should

give up the 40% target, to save jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government did not rush into this decision. We

struggled between our commitment to restore the CPF  rate

to  40%  and  the economic reality.  You see,  the  trust

between  the people and the Government is paramount.   It

is  the  basis upon which we have carried out many  tough

but  necessary  measures  to improve  the  lives  of  our

people.   It  is therefore not an easy decision  for  the

Government to give up a commitment it has made.  It risks

breaking the trust between the people and the Government.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2628</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we have no choice. If investors think that we

are  going  to  restore the 40% rate in the future,  they

will  factor this into their cost calculations. They  may

not  come. Even those who are here may make plans to move

out to cheaper locations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope Singaporeans understand why we are not

restoring  the 40% contribution rate.  Our priority  must

be to save jobs for our people.



<br><br><i>Longer term variable rate of 30-36%</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: what CPF contribution rate is

appropriate?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, the world economy changes rapidly. It is

not  practical to try to identify a single  number  as  a

long-term  rate.  No one can be sure how the  competitive

situation will evolve. We must also expect our economy to

run into rough weather from time to time.  We should thus

make  our  system flexible, so that we can put more  into

the CPF in good years and cut the rate in bad years. This

will  give  us  room to respond quickly to  the  changing

economic environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel, therefore, that it is better to set an upper

limit and a lower limit for the CPF contribution rate for

the long-term, instead of a single rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We propose that this range of rates be from 30% to 36%. The employee contribution rate will be fixed at 20%. The employer contribution will vary between 10 and 16%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not have any formula to decide what the

actual CPF rate should be at any point in time.  We  will

look  at  the prevailing economic conditions, and  assess

accordingly.   If there is to be a rise  or  cut  in  the

rate,  we will give as much notice as possible, to  allow

for  advance planning.  I do not envisage fine-tuning the

rate  every  year.  We will only adjust it from  time  to

time, when conditions have changed significantly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our analysis shows that even at a 30% contribution

rate,  the large majority of Singaporeans will  still  be

able to save

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2629</b></font><br><br>

enough  for  their retirement needs, healthcare  expenses

and  housing.   For  instance, a worker  earning  a  50th

percentile income, or $2,000 per month, will be  able  to

purchase a 5-room HDB flat.  This is provided we  tighten

the withdrawal rule at age 55, as I will explain later.



<br><br><i>Long-term variable rate of 24-30% for workers aged  above 50 to 55</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For older workers, we will set a lower range of

rates.  Last year, the ERC established the principle that

the  CPF  contribution rate for older workers  should  be

lower  than  that for younger workers.  This is  to  help

older  workers  keep their jobs, and for  those  who  are

unemployed, help them find new jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those aged 50 to 55, we will set the long-term

range  for  the  CPF  rate at 24% to 30%.   The  employee

contribution will be 18%.  The employer contribution will

vary between 6% and 12%.



<br><br><i>No change in CPF rates for workers above 55</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not change the CPF rates for workers above

age  55.  The rates are already low.   They are 18.5% for

those  aged  55 to 60; 11% for those aged 60 to  65;  and

8.5% for those above 65 years old.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now ask the Clerk of Parliament to

distribute a Table, and further Tables later on,  showing

the  long-term  target  CPF contribution  rates  for  the

various age groups.  [Copies of Table distributed to hon.

Members.]

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2630</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Immediate cut of 3% in employer rate</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having looked at the long-term CPF rates, let us

look at our immediate situation.  Is our current CPF rate

of  36%  appropriate?   Is it the  best  rate?   Is  that

optimal?   If not, what should it be?  The Cabinet  spent

more  than  two months grappling with this question.   We

also brainstormed with the PAP Members of Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Ministers and MPs felt that the current CPF

rate  of  36% should remain.  They were of the view  that

the external outlook was brightening. Singapore companies

were feeling more upbeat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, a cut in the CPF would not solve our

immediate problem, which was the lack of demand.  On  the

contrary,  it would dampen domestic demand  further.   It

might also have a negative effect on property prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second group of Ministers and MPs argued that our

economic  difficulties had dragged on for far  too  long.

The competitive landscape had changed fundamentally.  Our

costs   were   now  much  higher  than  our  competitors.

Singapore needed to respond quickly and decisively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Ministers were also worried that if our wage

costs  were  too  high, we might see a jobless  recovery,

like  in  the US.  This is a situation where the  economy

grows, but few jobs are created.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This second group of Ministers and MPs felt,

therefore, that we should cut the CPF rate immediately to

30%.   It would save many companies from going under,  in

particular, SMEs.  It would draw in more investments.  It

would spur job creation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third group of Ministers and MPs agreed that

demand  was the immediate problem.  But they argued  that

cost  competitiveness was a problem  that  we  must  also

start to fix now.  They felt that we should bring the CPF

rate down to 33%, and even lower later, if necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a vigorous debate, the Cabinet decided that

the  best way forward was a moderate cut to the CPF.   It

should be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2631</b></font><br><br>

enough  to help companies save costs, but not so  drastic

as   to   puncture  domestic  consumption.   The  Cabinet

concluded that the more immediate problem was a  lack  of

demand  for our goods and services.  This is the external

demand   for   our   goods  and   services.    But   cost

competitiveness  was also a problem,  and  it  would  get

worse in the coming years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With effect from 1st October 2003, the CPF rate will

be  lowered  from 36% currently to 33%.   Employees  will

continue  to  contribute 20%.  Employers will  contribute

13%,  3  percentage points less than now.  Table 2  shows

CPF contribution rates for workers aged 50 and below.

<pre>

Table 2:  CPF Contribution Rates for Workers Aged 50 and

                          Below

         1 Oct 03 33%       20%       13%

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For older workers aged 50 to 55, we will bring the

CPF  rate  down  to  27%, ie, 6% lower than  for  younger

workers.   But to cushion the impact, we will not  do  it

immediately.  Their CPF rate will come down to 33% on 1st

October  2003, the same as for younger workers.   On  1st

January 2005, it will be reduced further to 30%: employee

contribution  will  be  cut by  one  point  to  19%,  and

employer contribution by 2 points to 11%.  On 1st January

2006,  the contribution rate will be reduced by a further

three  percentage points: again, one point from employees

and   two  from  employers.   This  will  bring  the  CPF

contribution rate to 27%: 18% for employees  and  9%  for

employers.  Table 3 before you gives the details.

         1 Jan 2006 27%     18%       9%

</pre>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2632</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cut in CPF rate will save employers $1.3 billion

a   year.    It  will  boost  our  efforts  to  draw   in

investments, and create jobs.



<br><br><i>Revised Special and Medisave Accounts Contribution Rates</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the contribution rates for the Special and

Medisave Accounts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC had earlier recommended higher Special

Account rates for CPF members.  The proposal was  5%  for

CPF members aged 35 and below, 7% for those aged 35 to 45

years,  and 9% for those aged 45 to 55 years,  ie,  three

steps, 5%, 7% and 9%.  This was to help members set aside

more cash savings for their retirement.  Higher rates are

needed  if  we  allow  members to  withdraw  50%  of  the

Ordinary and Special Accounts at age 55.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if we change the policy on CPF withdrawal

at age 55, as I will explain later, we can afford to have

the  Special  Account  rates lower than  the  ERC  target

rates.  The new target Special Account contribution rates

will  therefore be 5% for members aged 35 and  below,  6%

for  those aged 35 to 45 years, and 7% for those aged  45

to 55 years.  This is shown in Table 4.

<pre>

Table 4:  Special Account Target Contribution Rates



               35 and Below Above 35 to 45 Above 45 to 55



       Old        5%               7%             9%

       New        5%               6%             7%

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Medisave. The Medisave Account contribution

rates  will  remain  at 6% for CPF members  aged  35  and

below, 7% for those aged 35 to 45, and 8% for those above

45  years  old.  We had earlier planned to  increase  the

Medisave  Account  contributions, up to  the  ERC  target

rates  of  7, 8 and 9%, but we will now defer this  move.

The figures are given in Table 5.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2633</b></font><br><br>

<pre>

       New           6%             7%           8%





     1Existing contribution rates are 6%, 7%, 8% for

respective age groups.  The Government had

      earlier accepted the ERC recommendation to change

to target rates of 7%, 8%, 9%.

</pre>

<br><br><i>CPF Salary Ceiling</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to the CPF salary ceiling. The ERC

established  the  principle that the  CPF  scheme  should

focus  on  workers  earning between  the  10th  and  80th

percentile incomes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lowest 10% of wage earners cannot rely on the

CPF  alone  for their retirement needs.  They  will  need

other social support schemes.  On the other hand, the top

20%  of  wage  earners  should  be  able  to  look  after

themselves.  If they want to save more for their old age,

they  should do so on their own.  We should not  make  it

compulsory  through the CPF scheme.  Otherwise,  it  will

add  rigidities to our wage system, and impose additional

cost burden on businesses.



<br><br><i>Lower Salary Ceiling to $4,500</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the ERC review last year, we had already

decided  to  reduce the CPF salary ceiling in two  steps.

First,  from a monthly salary of $6,000 to $5,500 on  1st

January  2004.   Second, from $5,500  to  $5,000  on  1st

January 2005.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, $5,000 is still higher than the 80th

percentile monthly salary, which is currently $3,700.  We

will,  therefore, lower the salary ceiling  further  from

$5,000  to $4,500 on 1st January 2006.  It is $4,500  and

not  $3,700, and there is a reason for this.  Assuming  a

reasonable rate of wage increase and inflation, by  2006,

$4,500  will  be just a little above the 80th  percentile

income.   The  phasing in of the CPF  salary  ceiling  is

shown in Table 6.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2634</b></font><br><br>

<pre>

     Table 6:  CPF Salary Ceiling



Current         $6,000

1 Jan 2004      $5,500

1 Jan 2005      $5,000

1 Jan 2006      $4,500

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salary ceiling for additional wages, consisting

typically of bonuses, will be adjusted proportionately.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pensionable civil servants have lower CPF rates and

a  higher  salary  ceiling than non-pensionable  workers.

Their salary ceiling will also be adjusted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original plan to reduce the CPF salary ceiling

from $6,000 to $5,000 will save businesses $260 million a

year.   The  additional reduction  to  $4,500  will  save

businesses   another  $137  million.    In   total,   our

businesses will save $400 million in wage costs annually,

come 1st January 2006.



<br><br><i>Reward workers through variable pay</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in this difficult economic environment, some

companies  are doing well.  The cut in the CPF rates  and

the  lowering  of  the  salary  ceiling  will  give  them

windfall  profits.   I urge these companies  to  use  the

savings to reward their workers through the variable  pay

component.   This could be in higher performance  bonuses

or monthly variable components.



<br><br><i>CPF and Medisave Minimum Sums</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes to the CPF rate and salary ceiling will

give  employers substantial wage savings.  But they  will

mean  less CPF savings for workers.  This makes  it  even

more important that the savings be used only for housing,

healthcare  and  retirement  expenses.   To  ensure  that

members  have  enough for healthcare and  retirement,  we

must  adjust  the  CPF  and Medisave  Minimum  Sums,  and

tighten up the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2635</b></font><br><br>

withdrawal  rules  at age 55.  These are  the  third  and

fourth areas of change.



<br><br><i>Raise CPF Minimum Sum to $120,000</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Minimum Sum gives CPF members a monthly

payment after their retirement at age 62 a certain sum of

money.   It  is  the nest egg that will see them  through

their old age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Minimum Sum is $80,000. Half of this

can  be  in a property pledge.  So most CPF members  have

only  $40,000 in cash in the Minimum Sum.  This will fund

a  monthly payment of only $252 from age 62 to 80.  It is

a  small fraction of most workers' last drawn pay, and is

not enough for their basic needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will, therefore, increase the Minimum Sum from

$80,000 to $120,000 in today's dollars.  As before,  half

of  this  can be in a property pledge.  The other $60,000

in  cash  will yield a monthly payment of $378.  This  is

still not much, but more adequate than $252 presently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Table 7 gives the details of the phasing in of the

Minimum Sum.

<pre>

     Table 7:  CPF Minimum Sum (in today's dollars)



Current           $80,000

1 Jul 2004        $84,000

1 Jul 2005        $88,000

1 Jul 2006        $92,000

1 Jul 2007        $96,000

1 Jul 2008       $100,000

1 Jul 2009       $104,000

1 Jul 2010       $108,000

1 Jul 2011       $112,000

1 Jul 2012       $116,000

1 Jul 2013       $120,000

</pre>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2636</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Minimum Sum will be raised by $4,000 a year,

and  adjusted for inflation, starting 1st July 2004.   It

will reach $120,000 (today's dollars) by 2013.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the life expectancy of Singaporeans is about

80 years.  We will, therefore, adjust the monthly payment

amounts,  to make the Minimum Sum savings last around  18

years  for most members, from retirement at age 62  until

they are 80 years old.



<br><br><i>Maintain purchasing power of Medisave Minimum Sum</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the CPF Minimum Sum, there is also a

Medisave   Minimum  Sum.   This  is  currently   $25,000.

Minister  Khaw  Boon  Wan  will  do  his  best  to   keep

healthcare costs reasonable.  But we should still  expect

costs  to  increase over the years.  We will,  therefore,

adjust  the Medisave Minimum Sum every year to take  into

account   inflation  of  healthcare  costs.   This   will

preserve its purchasing power.



<br><br><i>Enforce Medisave Minimum Sum</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, under current rules, a CPF member who has less

than  $25,000 in his Medisave Account is not required  to

top  it  up to $25,000.  This is the case even if he  has

excess  balances  in  his Ordinary and  Special  Accounts

which he can withdraw at age 55.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Medisave Minimum Sum is to make

sure  that  we  have  enough  money  set  aside  to  meet

healthcare  expenses  in  our  older  years.    As   life

expectancy  increases, Singaporeans will  spend  more  on

healthcare.   Furthermore, on average,  someone  aged  80

spends  three  to  five  times more  on  healthcare  than

someone  aged  62.   Each additional year  of  life  adds

considerably to healthcare expenses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, unsatisfactory to allow CPF

members  with excess balances in the Ordinary and Special

Accounts to withdraw the money at age 55 without  topping

up  the  Medisave  Minimum Sum.   We  will  progressively

require them to do so, as shown in Table 8.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2637</b></font><br><br>

<pre>

	Table 8:  Medisave Minimum Sum to be Topped Up

  Before CPF Withdrawal at Age 55 (in today's dollars)



Current             $0

1 Jan 2004        $2,500

1 Jan 2005        $5,000

1 Jan 2006        $7,500

1 Jan 2007        $10,000

1 Jan 2008        $12,500

1 Jan 2009        $15,000

1 Jan 2010        $17,500

1 Jan 2011        $20,000

1 Jan 2012        $22,500

1 Jan 2013        $25,000

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1st January 2004, we will require CPF members

to  top  up their Medisave Minimum Sum to $2,500,  before

they  make any CPF withdrawal at age 55.  Over  the  next

ten  years,  we  will increase the top-up requirement  by

$2,500  every  year,  adjusted for inflation.   In  other

words,  on  1st January 2005, Singaporeans  must  top  up

their  Medisave  Minimum Sum to $5,000;  on  1st  January

2006, it will be $7,500; and so on.  By 1st January 2013,

CPF  members  will have to top up their Medisave  Minimum

Sum to $25,000 (today's dollars), before making their CPF

withdrawal.



<br><br><i>Withdrawal rule at age 55</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final area of change is the CPF withdrawal rule

when   a  member  turns  55.   This  is  to  ensure  that

Singaporeans  will  have  enough  for  their  retirement,

healthcare  and housing expenses, despite the  lower  CPF

rate.



<br><br><i>Meeting Minimum Sums before cash withdrawal</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, at age 55, CPF members can withdraw 50%

of their combined Ordinary and Special Accounts balances.

They can do so even if this leaves them with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2638</b></font><br><br>

less than $40,000 in the CPF, which is supposed to be the

cash portion of the current CPF Minimum Sum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 50% withdrawal rule will leave many members with

insufficient CPF balances to see them through  their  old

age.   Now  that  we  have to lower the CPF  contribution

rate, the problem will be even more acute.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will amend this rule. We will still allow

members  to withdraw their CPF at age 55, but only  after

they meet the CPF and Medisave Minimum Sums requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, CPF members will continue to be able to

withdraw  the first $5,000 in their CPF accounts,  as  is

the  case now, even if they have not met the Minimum Sums

requirements.



<br><br><i>No change for next 5 years</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the changes to the CPF withdrawal rule

will  upset  many plans.  Older Singaporeans are  looking

forward  to  a tidy sum of money at 55, to do  what  they

have  yearned for a long time.  Some will use it  to  pay

off  outstanding mortgages, or their debts.  Others  will

use  it to go on a long holiday, or to invest in business

ventures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we will not make any changes to the

withdrawal  rule for the next five years.   We  will  not

upset the plans of those who are over 50 today.



<br><br><i>Phase out 50% withdrawal by 2013</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will start to phase out the 50% withdrawal rule

only from 1st January 2009, and then do so over a further

period  of five years.  This is shown in Table  9.   From

1st  January  2009, members turning 55 can only  withdraw

40%  of their Ordinary and Special Accounts, and then the

remaining balances, if any, after they have met  the  CPF

Minimum  Sum  and the Medisave Minimum Sum  requirements.

This  percentage  of  withdrawal  will  go  down  by   10

percentage  points  each year.  In other  words,  30%  in

2010, 20% in 2011 and so on.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2639</b></font><br><br>

<pre>

	Table 9:  Withdrawal of OA and SA Balances at Age 55



Until 31 Dec 08        50% (unchanged)

2009                         40%

2010                         30%

2011                         20%

2012                         10%

From 1 Jan 2013               0%

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come 1st January 2013, CPF members who reach 55 can

withdraw  the  balances  in their  Ordinary  and  Special

Accounts only after setting aside the CPF Minimum Sum and

the  Medisave  Minimum Sum.  This means  that  the  first

group of Singaporeans to be fully subject to the new rule

will be those who turn 45 on 1st January 2004.



<br><br><i>Help measures</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the worries of Singaporeans. From

feedback, I know that they have been anxiously re-looking

their  finances  since I announced  the  changes  at  the

National  Day Rally.  Most Singaporeans will be  able  to

cope.  But many may have to do some belt tightening.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will help ease their adjustment pain.

We  have  put  together an assistance package.   It  will

include measures to help homeowners cope with their  loan

repayment, which may be affected by the cut in CPF.   The

package  will also contain further measures to  help  the

low  income and unemployed, and tide businesses over this

period  of  slow economic growth.  DPM Lee will  announce

the details later in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been speculation whether the Government

will  postpone  the  implementation  of  the  one-percent

increase in GST scheduled for 1st January 2004.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, we will not. We will be proceeding as planned.

We  have  delayed it by one year already.  We should  not

delay the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2640</b></font><br><br>

increase  any further.  The GST increase is part  of  our

economic restructuring.  It is to make up for the loss of

revenue  from our lowering of income taxes.  The Economic

Restructuring Shares will enable Singaporeans  to  offset

the GST increase for several years.



<br><br><i>Conclusion - Teamwork</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me conclude.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes I have announced are the most drastic we

have  ever  made to the CPF system.  They  are  necessary

because we are seeing the most drastic changes yet in our

external  environment.  China and India especially,  pose

formidable competition, with their abundant, skilled  and

low-cost manpower.  We have to lower our costs to  remain

attractive  to investors, even as we embark  on  a  wider

exercise to lift our economy to a higher plane.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that Singaporeans are worried about the

future.  They wonder whether we can ever return to  sunny

days, given the strong competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But remember, we transformed ourselves from Third

World  to  First in just 38 years, against all odds.   We

have  developed many strengths and advantages  along  the

way  -  the  common  use of English,  the  rule  of  law,

harmonious  labour  relations, excellent  infrastructure,

and a good reputation.  These strengths will continue  to

stand us in good stead as we face stronger competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most importantly, we have a strong team, working

together for the success of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, our workforce is first class. We have

established  companies  that  are  well-run,  financially

sound   and  expanding.   At  the  same  time,  we   have

entrepreneurs  who are starting a variety  of  businesses

and  venturing  beyond  Singapore.   Our  grassroots  and

community leaders help keep our nation united.   And  our

media  plays  a constructive role in helping  our  people

understand our surroundings and challenges better.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2641</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We owe our past success to teamwork - the people,

the  employers and the Government working hand  in  hand.

As a team, we have won many matches for Singapore.  If we

continue to pull together as a team, we will also triumph

over the upcoming challenge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we must also alter our strategy and improve our

capabilities,   because   the  competition   has   become

stronger.   If  we do not, we will surely not  reach  the

highlands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, the changes to the CPF scheme are an

important component of our wider re-strategising for  the

economy.   They  will go a long way to improve  our  cost

competitiveness.  We must implement the changes,  and  at

the same time, help those who are affected to adjust.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the changes and your co-operation, I am

confident that we will not revert to being a Third  World

country  again.  On the contrary, we will strengthen  our

position in the First World.  [Applause.]

that  excludes  the Ministers.  So I would appreciate  it

very   much  if  Members  refrain  from  making   lengthy

speeches.  Mr Yeo Guat Kwang.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2642</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

listening  earlier  to  PM's statement,  I  am  now  more

convinced  that  the  changes  to  the  CPF  scheme   are

inevitable.   This move will further enhance  our  labour

market  flexibility and thus help save jobs  and  sustain

economic  growth.   I  am happy that the  Government  has

struck a good balance with structural changes in the long

term  and softer impact on workers.  We are reassured  by

PM  that most Singaporeans would be able to cope with the

changes  made to the CPF.  And the fundamental objectives

of  financial  security in retirement and home  ownership

would not be compromised with the proposed changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure that workers will applaud the

Government's  decision  to take  a  gradual  approach  in

implementing these changes.  This is most welcomed as  it

helps workers to adapt to the changes and retuning of the

CPF  scheme.   I am also pleased that the Government  has

also  shown  consideration  with  the  implementation  of

changes  made on the withdrawal age of 55.Those  who  are

now  51 years old need not have to worry that their plans

after 55 years old will be affected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope employers will respond positively to PM's

call  to plough back the savings, particularly for  those

companies which are doing well, to workers in the form of

variable payment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the CPF changes this round would be most

drastic.    The   changes  will  affect  various   groups

differently.  Based on the feedback I received  from  the

union  leaders,  the  main  concerns  across  the  entire

workforce  are that the cost of living is high and  their

commitment  on housing will be affected.  It  is  a  very

difficult transition for many people, a large part of  it

is  emotional.  Most people would require more  time  and

more help to face this hard reality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Union leaders, in general, agree that the CPF reform

is  necessary at this point of time.  But they hope  more

could be done to help those who face difficulties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, as we acknowledge the urgency to

restructure our economy and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2643</b></font><br><br>

reform  wages  and retune CPF, we also  need  a  thorough

review and reform in the way we address the social  needs

of  the workers.  The Government needs to commit and take

concrete  efforts in refining the social  safety  net  as

well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grassroots and union leaders agree that wages are

high.  However, they feel that the cost of living is also

too   high  and  thus  it  would  be  difficult  to  make

adjustments to the wages.  Whilst workers are prepared to

accept restructuring and CPF reform, what they have heard

from   the  Government  is:  be  prepared  to  pay  more,

particularly  in  areas  such  as  public  transport  and

healthcare.   I am pleased that the Acting  Minister  for

Health has recently announced that MOH will take steps to

address  the issue of medical cost. But there is still  a

strong perception that the Government had not done enough

to bring the other cost components down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take public transport as one example. The bus

companies  have  to pay for the costs of maintaining  the

bus  interchanges and terminals.  But the advertising and

rental  revenue from these areas goes back to  LTA.   The

public  does  not understand why this revenue  cannot  go

directly to the operator to help defray part of the costs

so as to bring public transport costs down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the economic landscape is very much different

from  that of the 1990s.  It is therefore timely for  the

Government  to  really consider doing another  review  to

look  into the cost of living again and the areas of  key

concern,   such  as  health,  education,  transport   and

housing.    More   importantly,   to   seriously   review

Government policies, for example, rules and requirements,

that  have  an  impact on or are likely to  become  cost-driving factors to our cost of living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the changes to the CPF will also affect many

Singaporeans   who  have.already  made   commitments   on

housing.  We have to have something more concrete to help

them.   As  the Government announces changes to  the  CPF

system, some union leaders have also asked

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2644</b></font><br><br>

whether  we  can also make it easier for  those  who  are

affected  by  the  economic  situation  to  downgrade  to

smaller  HDB flats.  The lower income workers  will  need

more help in such a difficult time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the business community should do more,

and  we  think they can contribute to and supplement  the

Government's  efforts to help the  needy.   For  example,

NTUC FairPrice has given $1 million worth of vouchers  to

the Advisors of all the CCCs and grassroots organisations

to reach out to their residents and help the needy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, the public transport operators gave a 5%

rebate  to the commuters.  This time round, I would  like

to  urge  the  public  transport  operators  to  consider

sharing the savings from the CPF cut with families  which

are  facing  difficulties, especially those with  school-going  children,  in  the form of  vouchers  or  rebates,

either  through  the unions or grassroots  organisations,

for  them  to purchase their monthly tickets.   Such  CPF

savings should not go to the shareholders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, moving ahead, union leaders can play a part by

advocating our workers to face the challenges,  adapt  to

changes, and to opt for simplicity and affordability. The

Government  can further help by sending a  strong  signal

that  it  cares.   Our workforce is  the  world's  No.  1

workforce.   Thus,  I am very confident  that,  together,

Singapore and Singaporeans will make this transition  and

get through this difficult period to a better life.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, this debate on the retuning of CPF is obviously very

important as the policy statement itself is presented  by

the  Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister has said that

we are now at the crossroads.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I think the House should thank the Prime

Minister for his decision to take personal responsibility

to  carry  this  burden  of presenting  the  painful  CPF

changes to the people, and to see through its passage  on

implementation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2645</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The topic of CPF changes is an emotional issue

because they impinge on the livelihood of the individual.

The  pain  is  therefore felt at the  personal  level  by

almost every person and his family members, because every

wage earner is affected.  However, at the national level,

we  unanimously agree that it is a crucial policy  change

that   has  a  deep  and  long-lasting  impact   on   the

survivability  of  the  country, in  the  face  of  fast-changing   competitive  pressures  from   huge   low-cost

countries like China and India.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to state that I support the proposed

changes,  as  they are much needed to ensure  Singapore's

survival.   Fundamentally, what  are  these  CPF  changes

about?   They are about remaining competitive,  they  are

about  survival  and, ultimately,  it  is  about  jobs  - keeping our jobs.  Yes, it is painful to cut CPF,  but  I

think it would be more painful if we have to cut jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after listening to the Prime Minister, I am

very  relieved.  As widely anticipated by the  press  and

many  corporations,  it was thought that  the  Government

would  implement a hefty 6% CPF cut.  The Prime  Minister

has  announced that there is a target of reaching the  6%

eventually.   But  according to the  table  that  he  has

circulated, there will only be a 3% cut in October  2003.

It  will  be a great relief to the people, as  a  6%  cut

would  have a tremendous shocking effect on the need  for

people to adjust their housing mortgages and livelihood.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me to the next question. As the Prime

Minister  has  said  that  the target  is  to  lower  the

employers' CPF contribution to 10%, the question  to  ask

is:  when  will be the next 3% cut, because there  is  in

this Table 3 a mention of only one cut to 13%?  I do hope

that we would be able to survive the economic downturn to

maintain the status that there would be no further  cuts,

if possible, that would affect the employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question I would like to pose, Sir, is

that  looking  at Table 3, for those aged between  50-55,

there are actually proposed three cuts:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2646</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) 3% in October 2003;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) 3% in January 2005; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) 3% in January 2006.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I note that those in the older age group

are  probably worst affected.  For age 50-55 group,  they

have to endure three cuts over the next four years.   So,

maybe the Government would like to look into how to  help

this  group  of older workers.  What kind of reliefs  and

assistance could be given to them to relieve them of such

burdens?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Prime Minister, there will be a

saving   of   $1.3   billion,  ie,  savings   earned   by

corporations, employers and the public sector.  These are

huge  savings  of $1.3 billion a year.  In contrast  with

previous years, where the cuts are possibly one-time with

a  possibility of restoration, these are cuts  forever  - they  stay with us.  Therefore, in fact, the savings  are

not  just  $1.3  billion a year.  If we  take  a  10-year

timeframe and we multiply the $1.3 billion by 10,  it  is

$13  billion savings for corporations and companies  over

the   next  10  years.   So,  these  hefty  savings  will

definitely have a very stimulating effect on the economy.

It  is  almost like an off-Budget measure, much like  the

stimulation  measures that were introduced  in  the  past

when the domestic economy was in recession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this occasion, I think not all companies are

doing  badly.  In fact, some companies, such as those  in

the  IT,  electronics, banking and several other sectors,

have been performing well.  Speaking for workers in these

companies,  I  would  like  to  urge  employers  of  such

companies that have done well to share their savings,  by

giving back either in the form of variable pay or as year-end bonuses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed CPF cut has the effect of taking

about $1.3 billion per year away from the pockets of  the

people.   This  is  not  a  puny  sum.   Naturally,  many

affected  will  feel the pain.  I would like  to  suggest

that  besides putting the burden of economic recovery  on

the people, the load should be shared amongst the people,

the Government and companies.  What I mean

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2647</b></font><br><br>

is that, for the Government, there will be a need to look

at  the  Government rates and fees so  that  there  is  a

lowering  of  cost of doing business for companies.   For

companies themselves, they would also have to look at how

to  keep  themselves lean and trim.  So, they would  also

have  to  minimise  their  excesses  and  not  call  upon

employees to share the burden of their inefficiencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this debate, I would like to focus a bit

more  on  the impact of the CPF changes on older workers.

I  would like to speak for those in the age group of  50-55,  because  I am myself in this age group,  ie,  in  my

early  50s.  I can feel for them.  I empathise with them.

Many  of my friends and associates are in this age  band.

But  this  does  not  mean  that  I  do  not  think  that

Singaporeans  of other age groups, such  as  the  younger

workers, are not impacted or are of lesser concern to me.

But  I  do  feel that those in the 50-55 age  group  have

suffered  a  lot in the last few years and, therefore,  a

CPF  cut on them would make it worse.  In fact, as I said

earlier,  they are going to suffer three cuts,  not  just

one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me elaborate a bit further on these people in

the  50-55 age group.  They have suffered a lot in recent

years.    Some   have   lost  their   jobs   because   of

retrenchments  or companies closing down.   At  the  same

time,  they have to have heavier property mortgages,  the

increase  in  the cost of their children's  education  as

they  grow  older.  Some of them even have to sell  their

houses  or their assets to support their children through

university.  Now, their employers' CPF contribution  will

be cut, especially when they go beyond 50 years old.  So,

these  CPF  cuts  are  eroding their savings,  and  there

should  be  a need for us to look into how to  help  this

particular group of older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, while the 3% cut would have a

saving of $1.3 billion for corporations, I would like  to

caution  about the dampening effect of this $1.3  billion

being taken away from the pockets of the people.  It is a

bit  of  a  plus  and minuses.  So, if we could  help  in

introducing some

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2648</b></font><br><br>

kind of stimulating measures, such that at least the $1.3

billion  dampener  effect on consumer spending  could  be

lessened,  it  would be helpful.  Perhaps, some  kind  of

Government spending or pump-priming of projects would  be

of help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further to the 3% cut, for those workers who are

affected  and  cannot manage their housing  mortgages,  I

would  like  to propose that workers be allowed  to  draw

from  the  CPF  Special Account to top up their  mortgage

payments,  if  they  have  insufficient  money  in  their

Ordinary  Account.  This is one measure  which  can  help

them to overcome their difficulties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to say that I support the Prime

Minister  that we should have clarity on our  longer-term

CPF  rates.  The rate has been stated as between 10%  and

16%  for  the  employers, and 20% for the  employees.   I

concur  that  the lower rate of 10% for the employers  is

appropriate.  It will also give us more flexibility  that

in  good  years  we can urge the employers and  introduce

higher  rates for employers, so that employees themselves

can benefit in good years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would like to express my keen

support for these CPF changes.  I earnestly appeal to the

Prime Minister to look into some of the suggestions  that

I have made.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

thank you for allowing me to join in this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister has said that Singapore is

now  at  the crossroads and is making important decisions

with  regard  to CPF.  He also says that the CPF  changes

made  are  the  most drastic to the CPF system.   In  the

light  of these comments, this topic that we are debating

on is of course very important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I commend that, in future, if we do have such

important debates, Members of Parliament, especially  the

Opposition, have a look into the changes, so that we  can

be more prepared to debate them,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2649</b></font><br><br>

and  not  be given at the last minute this table  and  we

hardly know what it is all about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1954, the PAP, when it was in the

Opposition, stated in its Party Manifesto, that it  shall

resist  any attempt to pass on to the workers by  way  of

wage  cuts  the  burden of any economic  recession.   The

Minister for Labour in the 1980s told this House that the

CPF  was  sacrosanct.  They were the wages of the workers

and that the CPF rate could not be cut.  He said that the

cutting  of  CPF  rate  was  tantamount  to  cutting  the

workers' salary.  At that time, the CPF rate was  50%  of

the  workers'  salary.  Many, including  myself  at  that

point  of time, thought that the CPF rate of 50% was  too

high.   I asked for the CPF rate to be lowered, with  the

hope  that  the  take-home pay of  the  worker  might  be

higher.  I was roundly told off for recommending the  CPF

rate to be cut.  It can be seen that the ruling party has

said  many things about preserving the CPF rate, but they

have not been consistent with what they have said.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our problems in Singapore today are, one, high

unemployment  and,  two, high cost of doing  business  in

Singapore.  The Government proposes to take the easy  way

out  by  slashing the CPF rate.   The question  is:   can

this  help? Wage cut is only one component of  the  total

cost  structure.  The Government should look at the other

factors  which  keep  costs in Singapore  up.   They  are

mostly  due to Government policies.  High wage  cost,  in

the  first place, was due to Government policy.   It  was

thought in the early days that the Government should only

attract higher value industries, but they did not come in

the  numbers  expected.   The  costs  in  Singapore  have

remained high since then.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting up business in Singapore is also high.

Rentals,  land  cost,  transport and  utilities  are  all

higher than our neighbouring countries like China,  India

or Vietnam.  However we cut the CPF rate, we still cannot

make our wages lower than the neighbouring countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this step of cutting the CPF rate can cause

grave hardship to our workers and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2650</b></font><br><br>

should  not be implemented at one go.  It should be  made

gradually.    The  Government should not again  make  our

workers bear the full brunt of reviving the economy.  The

Government  should  seriously  look  at  other  areas  of

reducing costs, such as lowering of rentals, keeping land

prices  affordable and keeping transportation, utilities,

administrative,  legal  services  and  other  operational

costs down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the last elections in November 2001, there was

a   slew   of  price  increases  in  rentals,  transport,

utilities, health and other operational costs.   None  of

those  price  increases have been trimmed  down  at  all,

making   the   cost  of  doing  business   in   Singapore

prohibitively  high.   It is high  time  that  Government

relooked  at those cost increases and trimmed  them  down

whenever it can be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GST is another high cost factor. The GST, as

originally  proposed, was supposed to be revenue  neutral

and  not painful at all for the people to accept it.  But

it  is  now no longer revenue neutral.  It has  become  a

lucrative source of income for the Government, especially

now  that  we  hear  the Government  is  going  ahead  to

increase  the GST by a further 1% next year.  I  am  just

wondering why the Government needs to build mountains  of

surpluses every year.   The surpluses are supposed to  be

national  savings for rainy days, but we are  now  seeing

black  clouds and showers thundering down on us.   Still,

the  Government wants to accumulate wealth,  all  at  the

expense  of  our  workers.   Singapore's  surpluses   are

purportedly estimated at about US$150 billion.   If  that

is  truly the case and Singapore is such a small country,

it has the world's second largest surpluses - second only

to  Japan  -  which has about US$200 billion.   It  would

appear that the Government's exercise of accumulation  of

wealth is for its own purpose, and not for the purpose of

helping the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that even the interests accrued from the net

investment income are untouchable.  SIA, DBS and  SingTel

all  say that they shall benefit from the CPF cut.  Their

savings range from $18-$45 million.  It would appear then

that the biggest beneficiary of the CPF cut shall be the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2651</b></font><br><br>

Government,  since it is the biggest owner of Government-linked companies in Singapore.  The Government must share

its gains with the workers of Singapore.  I hope that the

Government-linked  companies will pay good  bonuses  this

year to the workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A CPF cut, originally touted at 6%, shall not solve

our  cost  problem.  Someone wrote in the Today newspaper

that  a  6 percentage point cut in CPF would only  reduce

our wage rate by 2%.  We still cannot compete with China,

India or Vietnam.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have now heard that the Government is not

implementing the 6% but only cutting it by 3%, from 36 to

33 percentage points, and also on a staggered basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Minimum Sum scheme, I see that the

cash  component of $40,000 would eventually be  increased

to  $120,000  by  2013.  My feedback  in  this  difficult

economic  climate is that, in fact, many CPF members  are

clamouring to have their cash component paid out to them.

They said that they should be allowed to use their money,

especially  for legitimate purposes, such  as  for  their

children's education, to pay their debts or even to start

a  business.   I hope something along this  line  can  be

considered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Political Economic Risk Consultancy

Limited's  (PERC)  report,  I think  the  Prime  Minister

should  not be unduly disturbed by it when it  says  that

Singapore's wage cost is higher than those of America and

Australia.  That report is not very accurate in  that  it

takes   into   account  the  higher  paid  workers,   ie,

executives   and  white-collar  managerial   workers   in

Singapore.   Those  people  are  paid  higher  than   the

equivalent in America and Australia.  But the  pay  of  a

general  worker or a tradesman in America  and  Australia

is,  on average, much higher than those in Singapore  by,

at  least, I would estimate, 30%.  Those of us  who  have

visited  America and Australia know that the  workers  in

those  countries  are  definitely  paid  more  than   the

Singapore

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2652</b></font><br><br>

workers.   It is true that the cost of doing business  in

Singapore  is high, but certainly not due to the  alleged

high cost of wages of our factory workers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

thank you for this opportunity to join in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After PM spoke about more changes to the CPF at this

year's National Day Rally, there has been much discussion

and  speculation on the ground as to the details. I  have

met  with  various groups of union leaders from different

industries, and listened to their feedback.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, the fear of job loss is topmost on workers'

minds,  as  the economy continues to be weak.  Many  have

been   retrenched,  or  know  of  people  who  have  been

retrenched.  Many have seen business being lost to lower-cost  competitors. They know that if the  situation  does

not  turn  around soon, more jobs will be at  risk.   And

they  themselves could be next in line to be axed. Hence,

workers  really hope that the Government would find  ways

to boost prospects soon, and relieve their anxieties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Union leaders understand the big picture. We know

that  unless jobs are saved, there will be no income  for

the  workers  and without an income, high CPF  rates  are

purely academic.  So the priority is to save jobs, and to

foster  an  attractive environment to  create  new  jobs.

Lowering  business costs is an important part of  serving

this  purpose  and we accept that lowering the  CPF  will

form part of such a package.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, no worker likes a pay cut, no matter how

necessary  or  helpful  it may be because  it  just  goes

against the grain to part with one's money this way,  and

they  have their practical concerns and worries.   And  I

would like to reflect these concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some said that they may run into immediate problems

with  their housing mortgage payments, and they  want  to

know  how they can get help.  Others wonder if they  will

be  able to save enough for their retirement years  after

these cuts and caps.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2653</b></font><br><br>

Yet  others  wonder how they are going to cope  with  the

cost of living, because Singapore is a city, and being  a

small  city-state, there is really no way to go into  the

countryside  for a lower cost of living.  Therefore,  for

lower-income people, I think they will find it harder  to

cope, and they keep hearing that companies must make good

profits for their shareholders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also workers who fed back that payroll is

not  the  only  cost  to  business,  but  they  have  the

impression  that  payroll  is often  targeted  for  cost-cutting.   And they want to know what has the  Government

done about other fees and charges under its control,  and

what more it is going to do to reduce its cost burden  on

the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers feel that as the environment becomes more

uncertain  and  volatile, people have  to  find  ways  of

upgrading  and downgrading more flexibly alongside  their

financial  fortunes.  So they ask that our policies,  for

example, in housing and medical services change faster to

accommodate   this  reality.  There  may  be   a   larger

proportion of people who need rental housing, instead  of

bought  housing.  I think earlier, this  House  has  gone

into  quite a bit of questions and answers on that point.

Some  others also feel that it would be good to  make  it

easier   for  people,  whose  fortunes  have  waned,   to

downgrade  to a lower class ward more easily  within  our

hospital system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those impacted by the across-the-board CPF rate

cut,  the  lowering of the contribution ceiling  and  the

consequential  increase  in  taxable  income,  and   that

belongs  to  the  upper-middle and higher  income  group,

their   feedback  has  been  that  they  hope  for   some

consideration to minimise the impact.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But overall, workers want to know if their

swallowing  this  bitter pill will really  help  to  spur

economic recovery and improve job security.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, just as companies and shareholders expect a

good  return  on their invested funds, Singapore  workers

are  also  looking  at  these  CPF  cuts  as  a  kind  of

investment

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2654</b></font><br><br>

in  their collective security and prospects.  They do not

want  this opportunity created by the CPF savings  to  be

squandered  by companies merely enjoying a pause  in  the

pressure. They want to know, or at least have as  good  a

sense as possible what the likely yields are going to be,

and  how  these  yields are going to be achieved  by  the

companies.   They  have expectations  of  the  employers.

Workers  want to know what are employers going to  do  to

get  more  business because clearly, companies cannot  be

profitable  in  the  long run just  by  cutting  workers'

wages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, they want to know what employers are going

to do to restructure costs. Restructuring is not the same

as merely cutting.  It means finding new ways to organise

cost  drivers so that they are more responsive to changes

in  competitive  landscape and market demand  conditions.

In  this,  they  want to see more leadership  and  useful

ideas coming out from the employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers have also asked if employers are alert to

new   opportunities.    Because  being   alert   to   new

opportunities and being able to seize these opportunities

is  a  critical  quality for success.  For instance,  how

many employers have plans to make use of the US-Singapore

FTA  and  other FTAs that Singapore had signed to improve

their  business?  According to a report  in  the  Straits

Times  on  4th  July, a certain chamber  of  commerce  in

Singapore  did  a  survey among its membership.   And  of

those  companies who responded, 71% said that they  could

see  no  gains  flowing from the US-Singapore  FTA.   The

business  community's response to the  latest  Singapore-India Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement is not

any more reassuring.  A veteran businessman was quoted in

a  Channel  NewsAsia report dated 26th August as  saying,

"This is a weakness in our system.  Businessmen leave  it

to  the  Government to decide everything. They should  be

pushing  for  what they want.  Some of them do  not  even

know what they want."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am saying this not because of any other

purpose  than  to  say that this CPF  cut  gives  us  the

savings so that we could

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2655</b></font><br><br>

improve  our  competitiveness, so that  our  economy  can

rebound.  Workers hope for this to happen.  But in  order

for this to happen, employers must play their part and go

and  get  that  business.   Otherwise,  it  is  a  wasted

opportunity  and  it is a high price that  workers  would

have  paid  in  vain.  And we must not let such  a  thing

happen to sink our hopes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are in a no-holds-barred global and regional

fight.   We  have  to  remove  our  gloves  because   our

competitors are coming at us with bare knuckles,  if  not

knuckle-dusters.  If we lose, we will have to accept much

lower  conditions of living.  We therefore have no choice

but  fight.  So, I support these CPF changes, even  as  I

feel the pain together with all workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the side of the NTUC, we will support

constructive  efforts to improve the  competitiveness  of

companies because we want to save jobs and to attract the

creation of new and better jobs for Singaporeans.  And we

will  do so on the basis of fair play for workers.  Here,

I  want  to  thank the Prime Minister for supporting  the

stand  taken  by NTUC in asking that companies  that  are

doing  well be fair to their workers and share the  gains

with their workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NTUC cooperatives will continue to play their social

role and help hold down the cost of living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of the Central Singapore CDC, besides

the  usual  assistance schemes, I  will  also  set  aside

additional  funding  to reinforce  the  accounts  of  the

Community Resilience Fund at constituency level  so  that

our MPs on the ground can offer help more responsively as

required.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But most of all, I urge immediate and clear action

from  employers.  Do not waste the opportunity and become

complacent just because the CPF savings have bought  some

time  and  offered some reprieve.  Show our workers  that

you   have   concrete  plans,  and  are  taking   active,

systematic and resolute action to improve the odds.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2656</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that in these days of intense competition,

employers  have  to  watch their  monthly  and  quarterly

bottom lines like a hawk.  But I want to remind employers

that  the best companies that triumph in the end are  the

ones  who  not only know how to make big money,  but  who

also  know  how to treat their people right while  making

big money.  Those who think that rewarding loyalty is out

of date will pay a price for it when the market turns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The March issue of Fortune magazine featured a list

of  the  world's  "Top  50  Most Admired  and  Successful

Companies"  as  compiled by the  Hay  Group.   Among  the

characteristics of the winners is their encouragement  of

teamwork, loyalty and collaboration.  Smart employers  do

not  pay  lip service to people development and  loyalty.

Workers   are  not  stupid.   They  know  whether   their

employers  are treating them as valuable members  of  the

company or as disposables.  And they will reciprocate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we set about implementing these difficult

but  necessary  moves  to energise our  economy  and  job

market,  I urge everyone to keep our eyes firmly  focused

on  achieving  the  common good and creating  our  shared

destiny.   And as we do, we will keep the trust  and  the

respect of our workers and our citizens.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Sir, like Mr Chiam,

I too did not have access to PM's speech.  Therefore, PAP

MPs do not have any undue advantage over Opposition MPs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the turn of the new millennium, the world

is  now  a different place.  We may not have gone through

the  severe economic shock of the Asian financial crisis.

But  we  have weathered perpetual storms in the  form  of

September  11, global terrorism, SARS and the  gulf  war.

The  recent bombing in Jakarta, one year after  the  Bali

tragedy,  underscores the fragile and uncertain world  in

which we live.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the economic front, we face keener competition

from  the  global marketplace.  Singaporeans,  in  recent

years, have had to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2657</b></font><br><br>

face  wage  freeze, salary cuts and, most  unfortunately,

rising  structural unemployment.  The picture  is  indeed

not a rosy one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there has been a pick-up in sentiment in the US

and  Japan  economies, and the economic numbers following

the  slowdown  in  the second quarter of  this  year  are

starting to look up.  However, we must not be complacent.

Without clear and decisive actions to combat the costs of

doing  business in Singapore, or sending the right signal

to  the international business community, we run the risk

that  any nascent economic recovery may pass us  by  this

time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Sir, I feel that the proposed CPF

changes,  whilst they may appear untimely and harsh,  are

necessary.  I agree with many Singaporeans that  the  CPF

changes  alone  will  not solve our  high  business  cost

problems and make Singapore competitive again.  Wage cost

is   but  only  one  cost  component.   Our  other   cost

components, like land costs, rental, utilities, taxes and

Government  rates  and  fees,  are  also  important.    A

simultaneous effort to review all these costs and  reduce

them  is  indeed necessary if we are to be successful  in

making Singapore competitive again.  I therefore urge the

Government  to  consider measures  beyond  CPF  cuts  and

implement  these reductions if we are to  send  a  strong

signal to investors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PM mentioned that in the course of this debate, DPM

Lee  will announce a package of measures to alleviate the

adverse  impact that the proposed CPF cuts  may  have  on

Singaporeans.    I   hope  these   measures   will   help

Singaporeans rework their cashflow on their mortgages and

yet  leave  them  with  sufficient disposable  income  to

maintain a reasonable standard of living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the CPF changes announced by the PM, I am

glad  that  we stay focused on the retirement aspects  of

CPF  in a way that there are enough retirement funds  for

Singaporeans  as  well  as help reduce  overall  cost  to

employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support an immediate reduction of the employer's

CPF contribution by 3% to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2658</b></font><br><br>

send  the  right signal to companies and workers  on  the

urgency  of wage reforms.  I also advocate the  principle

of flexibility in CPF contribution rates, as explained by

the   PM.    While  the  workers'  fixed   salary's   CPF

contribution  rate will now be capped  at  30%  with  the

proposed  changes, I propose that we consider allowing  a

higher  CPF  contribution rate for  the  variable  bonus.

Indeed, we should encourage companies that are doing well

and could afford to pay performance bonus to pay a higher

CPF rate for their employees if they so choose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, together with a more flexible CPF rate, I urge

the  Government to introduce tax incentives to  encourage

companies   to  implement  a  wider  range   of   private

"retirement"  plan  options for their  valued  employees.

Through  this  arrangement, the CPF can stay  focused  on

providing basic retirement needs, while employers  should

be  encouraged  to develop individualised programmes  for

their employees based on individual needs and abilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming back to CPF cuts, the proposal has the

effect of reducing disposable income of Singaporeans.   I

would  like to suggest that measures to reduce costs,  to

free  up  cash and improve cash flow for Singaporeans  be

implemented.   By  this, I refer  to  the  need  for  the

Government  to  review some of its rates  and  fees  that

affect  household expenditures.  One specific area  would

be  the maid's levy.  A reduction in the maid's levy  may

not  fully  offset the cash depletion impact of  the  CPF

cuts, but will serve to offset the inelastic costs due to

economic  needs imposed on families.  And in  this  case,

the  services of a maid.  I am, therefore, proposing that

perhaps the Government could consider at least a $100 cut

in  maid's  levy  to  make up for the reduction  in  cash

following  the CPF reduction.  This cut could be  limited

to  one maid per household.  This would certainly go some

way towards the cash top-up for mortgages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, besides the maid's levy, I urge the Government

to also consider other measures to assist Singaporeans in

cash top-up following the CPF cuts.  I propose

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2659</b></font><br><br>

that the Government review its various rates and fees and

taxes  including utilities costs, property taxes,  petrol

taxes  and road taxes.  With the upfront cost of  vehicle

ownership  already  loaded in the COE  system  now,  such

reduction  in petrol and road taxes would again  free  up

cash for Singaporeans, who require vehicles as a means of

facilitating  business.   For Singaporeans  who  rely  on

public   transport,   transport   companies   should   be

encouraged to pass on such savings to the consumers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are aware that many of the Government rates

and   fees   were  imposed  to  achieve  various   social

objectives.   While  we  may  have  been  successful   in

achieving   these  objectives,  they  have  inadvertently

resulted  in higher costs of business and in higher  cost

of  living in Singapore.  And as PM has mentioned in  his

speech  earlier, we need to strike a fine balance between

the  objective of economic survival versus social  needs.

I  therefore suggest that it is perhaps timely  that  the

Government reviewed some of its social policies that  may

have  resulted  in  higher  cost  of  doing  business  in

Singapore today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to touch on the changes relating

to   raising  the  threshold  of  the  Minimum  Sum   and

tightening the rules concerning CPF withdrawal at the age

of 55.  I appreciate the Government's effort to phase out

the  changes so that it minimises the impact it will have

on Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whilst I support the need for Minimum Sum, I

always  question the need for lumpy adjustments to  raise

the  Minimum Sum from time to time.  Indeed, the  concept

of  the  Minimum  Sum  may be a useful  one  in  that  it

attempts to set a benchmark for what an individual  needs

upon  retirement.   However, that magic  number  is  also

difficult  to  pin  down, as different  individuals  have

different  choices  and needs.  The revisions  to  adjust

for,  say, longer lives of Singaporeans from time to time

may be disruptive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the PM, I know of many Singaporeans planning to

use their CPF money

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2660</b></font><br><br>

upon  reaching the age of 55.  Some are planning to start

a  business,  some planning to use CPF  funds  for  their

children's  tertiary education, some planning  to  invest

their  money  in  various  investment  instruments,  some

planning  to go on a long holiday with their  family,  as

the PM has said, some planning to go on a pilgrimage, and

so  on.   The impact of this change on the CPF withdrawal

plans  on  individuals may thus be more  widespread  than

envisaged.   I  am however glad that the  Government  has

decided  to  phase out the implementation of  the  higher

Minimum Sum and tightening rules concerning CPF withdrawl

at the age of 55.  Indeed, I feel that the 10-year phase-in  period  is reasonable.  But I feel that the  proposed

gradual  adjustment of the CPF Minimum Sum of $4,000  per

year  appears  high  in the initial years,  because  this

works  out to an inflation rate of 5% per year, which  is

very   high,  given  the  record  of  our  inflation   in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would prefer an automatic adjustment mechanism be

built  into  the  CPF system whereby the Minimum  Sum  is

automatically  adjusted  based  on  future   annual   CPI

changes.  This will avoid lumpy adjustments from time  to

time  as  has  happened in the past, and  will  certainly

facilitate planning by Singaporeans on the use  of  their

CPF funds upon retirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would like to point out that

even  with these CPF changes and assuming other  business

cost  components,  like land costs, utilities  rates  and

fees  are being lowered, we must continue to expect lower

end  company operations to continue to migrate  to  other

low  cost  countries like India and China.  We can  never

compete in those areas.  If we do, we will forever remain

a  third  world  country, as the PM has said.    What  is

important is for our Government to continue to provide  a

favourable   environment  to  continuously  attract   new

investments,   create   employment   opportunities,   and

continue with our skills upgrading programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the CPF changes and urge the

Government  to  consider  my  various  suggestions  on  a

flexible  CPF rate and on measures to free  up  cash  and

improve cash flow for Singaporeans.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2661</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose I will never know whether the white wine

will allow me to live up to 100.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Red wine!

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Or the red wine. I do

not  drink  either.  But I do not know whether  the  non-alcoholic halal white wine or red wine will allow  me  to

use  some  of the palliatives rather than to keep  asking

the same questions about our reserves.  Because I am glad

that  we  have  those  kinds of  reserves  in  Singapore.

Otherwise,  our currency and our assets would  have  been

halved by now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I could not believe my ears when

last  night, a grassroots leader told me that he heard  a

friend using an old caricature in the 60s to express  his

anxiety   about  CPF  changes  and  the  gloomy  economic

picture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caricature was about a lightning striking and

cracking up a rice bowl.  I think some of you of  my  age

will remember that caricature.  I do not know who did the

caricature,  but  I  guess it  was  done  by  the  ruling

Alliance Party then, which wanted to frighten voters from

supporting  the opposition PAP then.  Well, we  know  the

story.  PAP went on to win handsomely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess this person must have exaggerated the

position but, nevertheless, to highlight his anxiety  and

worries  about  the  proposed CPF cut  and  uncertainties

regarding  employment and the economy.  After  all,  many

Singaporeans now realise that the days of the  iron  rice

bowl,  even in Government service, are over.  So, as  the

Prime  Minister said just now, he knows the  feeling  and

thus the compromises made in fixing the CPF cut from what

people expected to be 36% is now 33%.  Singapore workers,

I  am  sure,  will feel very relieved.   I  do  not  know

whether the private sector will react the same way.   And

I am sure they will say, "Cut not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2662</b></font><br><br>

enough."   But, I am sure, for most workers,  "Money  not

enough" is more supreme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, judging from the feedback and views expressed

during the dialogue sessions Malay MPs held for activists

and  community leaders, the fears and concerns are  real.

Even  though the recent announcement by the PM may  be  a

relief,  I  am sure many are still asking, "What's  next?

And  when  is the next cut?"   Many are simply frightened

by  what is to come.  One even described the dreams of  a

Swiss standard of living Singaporeans were chasing for as

a nightmare now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, that was an exaggeration too, as I

believe  Singaporeans have shown the steel they are  made

of and the best is yet to be.  But no matter how much one

hypes the mood or the challenges, it takes much more than

promises  to  satisfy Singaporeans.   Many  Singaporeans'

confidence regrettably has been shaken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am sure all is not lost. Singapore

Government's  track  record of overcoming  problems,  the

1985  recession  for  one,  must  be  the  saving  grace.

Although it was a problem by itself, as Singaporeans have

gone  round to expect the Government to turn the  economy

as  fast as it did a decade ago, the situation, as we all

know,  is  not  as  simple  as  before.   The  effect  of

globalisation  has  cut  deeper  now.   China  and  India

threaten  to blunt further Singapore's competitive  edge.

Cyclical  changes and unemployment have gone  structural,

dumping  thousands  of our workers as irrelevant,  unless

they retrain and upgrade.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even if we can convince and assuage Singapore

workers to accept that this is the new order of the  day,

and change their mindsets, at peace with the need to make

short-term  sacrifices  for  the  long-term  gains,  many

Singaporeans feel they need help, at least for the  short

term.   They fear the CPF cut will affect further   their

capacity to pay for their dream homes, and I do not  mean

just the landed properties and condominiums but, in fact,

the  modest  `under one HDB roof'.  Many also fear  about

what they see as escalating

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2663</b></font><br><br>

health  and  transport  costs, meaning  cost  of  living.

Here, Acting Minister Khaw Boon Wan's strategy to look at

the  eight priorities, including cutting costs and making

the   medical  care  system  more  efficient   and   cost

competitive, I am confident, will be well received.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no matter how convinced the Government is about

the  need for the CPF retuning, the Government should not

rush  into  the  fast  lane of changes,  as  the  PM  has

announced  today, to avoid unexpected ramifications  that

will  upset  the apple cart.  Investors,  I  think,  have

always  had  tremendous  respect for  Singapore  and  the

Government  for  its hard-nosed and hard-headed  approach

when  faced  with difficult decisions.   Send  the  right

signals  we must, but phase in the changes so as  not  to

make  the effects too razor-like and in the process bleed

many  people unexpectedly and the consequences  difficult

to cope with.  On this note, the phased changes announced

by the PM will be welcomed by many.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the effect of the proposed changes in the mind of

the  Government  is  marginal or tolerable,  Singaporeans

need to be told so and in clear terms.  Take some time to

go  to  the ground through more dialogues and information

sessions.  I learned that the PM will also be having  his

own  dialogue sessions with the ground.  I think that  is

an excellent idea and I trust more people will understand

further and appreciate those critical needs for change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not think only the lower 10-15% of the population

will  face  the brunt of these challenges.  I have  heard

some  of  the concerns of the middle income squeeze  too.

In  fact,  many of them feel that they are the  ones  who

will suffer most, and without much help from the existing

programmes mostly catered for the needy, which the middle

income would not qualify.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the proposed changes in

the CPF but would like to urge the Government and all its

implementing agencies to watch the follow-through

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2664</b></font><br><br>

developments closely and to give feedback that would help

fine-tune the system further, if necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realise that the Government has said repeatedly

that  most, if not all, of the cost-cutting measures have

been taken, including reducing other cost factors such as

land  price, taxes and other measures, to help  alleviate

the interim pains felt by many, but the Government should

go  through  with a thin comb the cost of Government  and

trim  whatever else necessary.  MOH's recent announcement

to  do  so  is  a good example.  This will reassure  many

Singaporeans  that  Government is  not  too  cost-cutting

happy  elsewhere but indeed ready to work  hand  in  hand

with the people to overcome these challenges together.

<div align="center"><b>RETUNING THE CPF</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr A Nithiah Nandan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A Nithiah Nandan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, first, allow me to thank the Prime Minister

and his Cabinet colleagues for having a lower CPF cut  by

just  3%,  and  not  all  the way  to  6%,  and  bringing

progressive  changes  to  other  components  in  the  CPF

scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have to accept the fact that under the

current   economic  uncertainty  and  the   increase   in

unemployment,  any  measure taken by  the  Government  in

order to save jobs and maintain our competitiveness  and,

in  this  instance,  to cut wage costs  through  the  CPF

component,  is done out of necessity.  The  workforce  is

fully  aware of the volatile situation in the job market.

We  understand and fully comprehend how crucial it is  to

act   now  and,  therefore,  I  sincerely  endorse  these

recommendations.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2665</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday night we had a discussion and a dialogue

with  our  group of union leaders.  We had a  very  frank

discussion  for  two  hours.  At  the  end  of  the  day,

everyone  realised  how  bad the  situation  was  on  the

ground,  and  they  realised that changes  needed  to  be

brought  immediately, and they supported unanimously  the

changes.    But  they  also  highlighted  a   number   of

viewpoints.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to express some of my viewpoints and their

concerns too:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) It must be accepted that any cut in CPF would

cause pain and hardship to workers.  Workers are required

to  make  sacrifices to save jobs and  to  help  increase

competitiveness.   Workers understand these  reasons  and

support  the steps taken.  But workers' sacrifice  should

not  go  to  waste  or  just to increase  the  employer's

profitability.  Workers wish to see a drastic drop in the

number   of  workers  retrenched.   To  this   end,   the

Government-linked companies and large MNCs  must  set  an

example  in  not  resorting to  retrenchment  as  far  as

possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Government must go public on the full

package of cost-cutting measures and introduce additional

measures, if necessary, that it needs to put in place  in

order  to  maintain  our competitive edge  and  not  just

highlight  on  wage  cut, CPF cut and retrenchment  only.

The  ground must be given a full picture, only  then  can

they be convinced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Employers, on the other hand, must not take

advantage  of  the situation.  They must acknowledge  the

sacrifice made by the workers during these hard times  by

compensating them equitably during good times.  Employers

who  are  currently profitable and accumulate  additional

gains because of the CPF cut, should give back to workers

part of the additional gains in the form of special bonus

or  other methods.  Profitable MNCs and Government-linked

companies should publicly support this call, rather  than

giving  lame  excuses.  In this context,  I  support  and

fully  appreciate  the  Prime Minister's  call  for  such

companies to come forward to reward such workers in these

industries.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2666</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The Government must give a clear signal to MNCs

that they are really operating in our island state and to

potential  investors that it is prepared to look  at  all

possibilities  to  help  the  companies  maintain   their

competitiveness and that they have a stake in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very reassuring to hear that

the  Government expressly states that no Singaporean will

lose his or her home or be denied of medical care because

of  the cut in CPF contributions, and that the banks have

also stated that they will be flexible if it affects  the

servicing  of  the  housing loans.  The  Government  must

introduce  long-term  help to those with  mortgage  loans

rather than deferring the payments.  Any deferment  would

cost  additional  expenditure in the  form  of  interest.

Government  should  consider the  reduction  of  interest

rates  to  mortgage loans of HDB, and  I  think  this  is

within  the  capacity of the Government.  The  Government

has  always  shown  a lot of concern  for  our  Singapore

citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come back to the announcement made by the

Prime   Minister  earlier  on  on  contributions   rates,

especially  for workers aged 50 to 55.  In fact,  at  the

National Day Rally, the Prime Minister had again  made  a

call for employers to employ older workers.  But I do not

like  to  use the term "older workers" because  sometimes

that puts off a lot of employers also.  And I also belong

to  that  age  group.   So I would rather  use  the  term

"workers aged 50 to 55 and beyond".   The problem here is

not  just  cutting CPF.  Because if you can cut  CPF  and

bring  results, we will support it.  If you want to bring

it  lower,  that  is  a  three-step  reduction  for  such

workers.  And if it brings the desired results,  we  will

definitely  go all the way.  It is better to have  a  job

than not to have a job, and a lower CPF does not matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the problem here is because a lot of employers

have  a  cheaper  alternative, that is, foreign  workers.

They give all kinds of excuses in employing them.  One of

the  excuses  is  that they say the workers  are  choosy.

That  is  not true for every worker.  We should not  just

across-the-board label all Singaporeans as being  choosy.

There

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2667</b></font><br><br>

are  many workers who are desperately in need of  a  job,

and  I  have  come across many in my work as a  unionist.

And  it  really pains me because there are  a  number  of

people  requesting and pleading for jobs,  and  they  are

even  prepared  to  work  for $800  to  $900.   But  many

employers  just give all kinds of excuses, and they  just

give  them  a very political answer, "We will  definitely

call  you  back."  The answer is actually  they  are  not

going to call them back.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I think Government needs to do something drastic

rather  than just make statements.  I really support  the

Prime Minister's call.  I know he feels for such workers.

But  feeling  alone is not enough, he must do  more  than

feeling. So we hope that he would do more than that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Minimum Sum and Medisave Minimum Sum,

I have a quick look at it.  By year 2013, a lot of lower-income workers will not be able to draw any sum when they

reach  55 - it looks like that - unless there is a  hefty

wage  increase.  For such workers, they depend a  lot  on

age  55  to withdraw for their essential needs, and  they

actually  postpone these essential needs  until  55.   So

maybe  the  Government should look at how it  could  help

them.   I am not suggesting help for those who are  going

to  Batam or squandering their money with another family.

I  am talking about those who really need the help.  So I

think  they have to take a look, and maybe the Government

can give projection figures - in 2013, how much will such

workers  be able to draw out.  That will give  them  some

level  of  comfort.  So just figures alone would  not  be

enough.    I  hope the Government will come up with  more

information in these areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore workers have stood by the Government

through  a  number  of  crises, and  that  has  been  our

greatest advantage in attracting investments and  keeping

investments in Singapore.  And we will continue to do so.

There   is   no  reason  that  the  workers  will   react

differently.  We have the ground feel and we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2668</b></font><br><br>

know that the workers will rally behind us.  But, at  the

same time, the workers would also like the Government  to

do  whatever it can to ease their pain.  It must look  at

the  current  costs of essential goods  -  medical  cost,

public transport, and the cost of education - and see how

best  it  could  be  adjusted to  defray  the  day-to-day

expenses of the workers in taking care of themselves  and

their   families.   To  what  extent  is  the  Government

prepared  to absorb such costs?  This is what the  public

expects the Government to seriously think about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, this is a very painful

adjustment and Singaporeans will definitely rally  behind

the  Government and the Government must equally give  all

the  support.   The employers must not be  providing  lip

service  but really clear-cut support to workers who  are

employed under their hands.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I would like

to  make two general comments relating to the CPF changes

and discuss two specific implications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, as a supply-side measure - the CPF changes

are  blunt but effective.  The PERC survey and other  job

data  comparisons, regardless of how one  would  like  to

interpret or qualify the results, with anecdotes, such as

what Mr Chiam has done, point to the reality that we have

indeed   priced  ourselves  out  of  the  global  market.

Because  of  this reality, there are really no  two  ways

about  it  in  that we do not have the  luxury  of  time.

These  changes  would have an immediate  impact  on  wage

costs  unlike tax cuts, which are contingent on corporate

profitability.  Yet, we must be fully conscious that this

move  to  retune  the CPF scheme is no  panacea  for  the

unemployment  challenge;  it  merely  seeks  to  mitigate

further  loss  of  both blue and white collar  jobs  from

uncompetitive wage levels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as many of my colleagues have emphasised, we

must  also recognise that a holistic approach is  needed,

not  just  a restructuring of wages, which is inevitable,

but  a  concerted  effort  to  lower  all  components  of

business costs, including

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2669</b></font><br><br>

Government levies and charges and real estate  costs,  to

complement  the  CPF changes and the tax cuts  that  have

already  gone before them.  Specifically, the  Government

needs  to address the rigid, seniority-based wage  system

for  the public sector, beyond these CPF changes,  since,

firstly,  the  public sector competes  with  the  private

sector  for manpower during tighter employment situations

and,  secondly, expenditure on manpower is a  significant

component  and  affords  room for  cost  cutting  by  the

Government itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, dipping into reserves. Sir, many

Singaporeans have asked why does the Government  not  dip

into  the  reserves  -  does the  present  situation  not

constitute a rainy day?  The Government needs to  explain

more.   Having  said that, unlike Mr Chiam,  I  recognise

that   the   current  unemployment  challenge   is   more

structural  than  cyclical.  Hence,  changes  are  needed

rather than a dip into the reserves to help ride out  the

downturn.   However, it is still necessary  to  have  the

package  of measures to help cushion the otherwise  harsh

impact, especially for mortgage servicing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Singaporeans have accepted the need for

CPF  cuts  not because they are not going to be adversely

affected but because they see the wisdom of taking short-term  pain  for a long-term benefit, which is  ultimately

the survival of Singapore.  But they are also asking,  if

these changes are not sufficient and do not help to lower

the  unemployment  rate,  what is  next?   Another  three

percentage  point reduction to 30%, and then  what  else?

What  other  levers can we pull?  Sir,  it  is  important

therefore  to rally Singaporeans behind every effort  and

for  the  Government  to continue to  instill  confidence

through a clarity of purpose for each and every move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, Sir, talk about two of the more significant

implications of these changes for Singaporeans.  Firstly,

the  threat  of negative equity for property assets  and,

secondly, financial sufficiency for old age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negative equity and structural erosion of

affordability.  Sir, unfortunately, many

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2670</b></font><br><br>

Singaporeans   have   based  their  property   investment

decisions  on assumptions which were drawn up during  the

heady growth phase of the 1990s, where we had a steady 5%

to  10%  wage increase every year, continuous  employment

and  frequently more than one income stream.  We now know

that   for  any  of  these  assumptions  to  fail,   some

Singaporeans may no longer be able to hold  on  to  their

property.   Wages  have  not only not  risen,  many  have

actually  been  cut  - and these lower  CPF  contribution

rates  would  aggravate  the  situation.   Besides,  with

retrenchment  and  contract work being  increasingly  the

norm,  Singaporeans now have to factor in periods  of  no

income in between contracts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures that the Government would be announcing

would  hopefully help many, even if they  have  currently

negative  equity on their property, that  is,  where  the

loans  they have taken out far exceed the current  market

price,  if  they were to sell the property on the  market

now.   However, the larger issue is whether  there  is  a

real threat that we would end up with negative equity for

property, like Hong Kong or Japan.  If so, these are  not

just  problems for the affected Singaporeans,  they  also

spell challenges for our banks as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what about those who have made the wrong

assumptions  and  who  have  found  their  purchasing  or

servicing  ability  so impaired that they  simply  cannot

continue  with  ownership?  For those who  have  borrowed

from  banks, I guess this is an issue that banks have  to

address.   I hope the Deputy Prime Minister will  address

the  situation for those who have, for example, purchased

bigger  HDB flats from the resale market at the peak  and

who  have simply no means of servicing these loans  right

now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the implication on financial sufficiency

for  old age.  Sir, before these changes, we were already

concerned with there being financial insufficiency  post-retirement,  especially  in the  context  of  our  ageing

population  against  a  longer  life  expectancy.   These

changes would simply mean even less CPF contributions  on

an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2671</b></font><br><br>

overall  basis,  be  it in the Ordinary  or  the  Special

Account    balances,   unless   income    levels    climb

substantially.  But we know that that is unlikely because

competitiveness will always check any steep rise  in  our

income level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite all the radical changes to the CPF scheme,

we  have,  if I may suggest, one more sacred  cow  to  be

slaughtered, that is, the management of the CPF balances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has shied away from managing CPF

balances, preferring to allow individual Singaporeans  to

decide  their own risk levels and allocation  strategies,

down  to  picking  their own stocks.  Thankfully,  we  no

longer allow investment gains to be withdrawn.  But there

are  still  some  gaps and I would like to  elaborate  on

these.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, by guaranteeing a minimum interest rate on

both   Ordinary   and  Special  Account   balances,   the

Government  is  already managing CPF monies  by  default.

Secondly,  there  is  sufficient  anecdotal  evidence  to

suggest  that  a  balanced portfolio, including  all  the

different  asset classes, would generate, on  average,  a

higher  return in the longer term.  Sir, we need to  grow

the  nest egg, not through higher contributions  in  good

times,  or  distributions of New  Singapore  Shares,  but

through  the  compounding effect  of  a  higher  rate  of

return.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, a diversification across different

markets would reduce the incidence of double jeopardy  in

the   event  of  a  slowdown  in  Singapore.   Currently,

individual  Singaporeans do not have  the  motivation  to

attempt  any  diversification as they  have  a  risk-free

alternative  and they simply have no scale.  And  neither

do  fund managers have the scale to mount such aggregated

products as they have no assurance that CPF members would

want to take the risk.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I am proposing once again that Government

seriously  consider, firstly, managing CPF on  behalf  of

members,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2672</b></font><br><br>

enlisting the help of fund managers where necessary, and,

secondly,  over time, to have the minimum  interest  rate

more  reflective of prevailing market trends.  If  we  do

not   proactively   ensure  that  CPF   balances   return

attractively,  lower  contribution  rates  would   almost

certainly aggravate our ageing challenges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, Sir, I am optimistic that the changes

will   send   the   right  signals,   boost   Singapore's

competitiveness and investors' confidence in our  resolve

to  tackle  economic challenges.  Already, analysts  have

applauded  the  move  and  are expecting  on  average  an

encouraging 1%-3% point boost in margins, to as high as a

10%   jump   in   profits   for  the   manpower-intensive

industries.  The move will also better position Singapore

for the economic recovery, signs of which, though patchy,

are nonetheless encouraging.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the overall intent of

the CPF revisions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the scenario painted by our Prime Minister

a  moment ago at the introduction of his speech  in  this

House  and  also the report in yesterday's Straits  Times

where  DPM Tony Tan registered his alarm about  the  PERC

report citing Singapore's labour costs being ahead of the

United States and Australia are clear indications that we

really  have  a wage cost burden that needs  to  be  very

quickly  addressed.  Not taking immediate action will  be

irresponsible on our part as it would mean that more jobs

would  eventually  be  lost as our  cost  competitiveness

further erodes.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>5.26 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore of the view that a number of drastic

measures  need  to  be taken quickly to  bring  down  our

overall  business costs, including wage costs, to  remove

rigidity so that the market can more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2673</b></font><br><br>

flexibly   find  its  equilibrium.   This  understandably

includes  retuning our CPF contribution rates  along  the

lines  which the Prime Minister has outlined.   Based  on

several  dialogue  sessions which  I  attended  and  also

conducted,  I  believe this message has sunken  in  among

Singaporeans and they understand that we must act quickly

to prevent more job losses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, Singaporeans have been nervously and

keenly awaiting for the final prescriptions of what  they

are expected to swallow, the extent of bitterness and how

this is going to impact on their livelihood.  It pains me

to  think about citizens who have gone through thick  and

thin  with us all these years, perhaps more of  the  thin

side  of things these last few years who will be impacted

by the CPF changes.  As we act for the collective good of

Singapore and all of us, it is imperative that we provide

lifelines  and help for those who are particularly  going

to be affected by what the Government finally decides.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there are many MPs who are speaking on this

subject,  allow  me  to just focus  on  two  points  with

respect  to  the imminent changes to the CPF  model.   My

first concern is the ability of Singaporeans to meet  the

obligations of housing loans as a result of the  changes.

The  measures proposed are a necessary requirement in our

quest for competitiveness internationally.  However,  the

trade-off on a social scale would be quite onerous.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Government must balance its move with one that

will   help  reduce  the  hardship  our  residents  might

potentially face. As mentioned by the Acting Minister for

Manpower  earlier in this House today, a large number  of

our  active workforce, 577,000, or approximately  45%  of

them,   service   their   housing   loans   through   CPF

contributions.   From  this, there  will  be  a  sizeable

number  that will find it difficult to meet their monthly

obligations  although  the 3%  imminent  cut  is  not  as

drastic as anticipated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest, Sir, that a tax relief be

considered for home owners on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2674</b></font><br><br>

interest  paid on mortgages on homes used  as  a  primary

residence.   This will supplement the burden on  existing

home owners affected by the CPF changes while encouraging

potential buyers to also not distance themselves from the

market.   A  tax  relief would not  only  encourage  home

ownership  but  also  help spur growth  in  the  property

market.  Tax relief of such nature is not new and  exists

in countries, such as the United States.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In implementing the CPF changes, our society should

gradually  move  from dependence on a managed  retirement

plan  that  was started in the late 50s to  one  that  is

tailored  individually.  Perhaps, there is a lesson  from

our  early  years of self-government and nationhood  when

the  CPF  rate was a mere 10% as we struggled to  find  a

balance between savings and competitiveness.  Times  have

changed,  but  our  commitment to  our  citizens  remains

steadfast.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In helping them overcome the double blow of lower

CPF  rates  and  higher Minimum Sums,  I  would  like  to

propose  the  consideration to include  monies  saved  in

individual retirement schemes as part of the overall pool

of savings to meet the requirements of retirement and old

age.  Doing so could perhaps justify a review of the need

to  progressively raise the Minimum Sum from the  current

$80,000 to $120,000 by 1st July 2013.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) is a part

of our Government's multi-pronged strategy to address the

financial  needs  of  a  growing  population,  which  was

highlighted   in  the  report  of  the  Inter-Ministerial

Committee  on the Ageing Population released in  November

1999.  As it stands, the SRS complements the CPF.  As  we

know,  the  CPF savings are meant to provide for  housing

and  medical  needs  and  for basic  living  needs  after

retirement.     Unlike   the   CPF    scheme,    however,

participation in the SRS is voluntary.  Participants  can

contribute a varying amount to the SRS, subject to a  cap

at  their own discretion.  The contributions may be  used

to  purchase various investment instruments, and it  also

offers  attractive tax benefits as it defers tax  payment

upon retirement.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2675</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, there are retirement plans that

are offered by insurance companies, banks and independent

financial  advisers  that work  on  the  same  principle.

Unfortunately,  awareness of  the  SRS  is  low.   As  of

December  2002, there were less than 17,000  SRS  account

holders.  Our citizens have depended excessively  on  the

CPF  to finance their retirement needs and have not  seen

the  incentive for alternative planning.  We can do  more

to  encourage  this and other schemes  to  highlight  the

benefits  along  with the risks of independent  financial

planning.  With the change in our CPF model in  the  push

to  encourage  greater  self-reliance,  I  suggest  going

further  to fine-tune the SRS as well, to enable  greater

participation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the Government's

proposal to retune the CPF.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, Singaporeans intuitively understand that their wages

are  high  in  comparison  with the  countries  that  are

competing  with  us  for  the  same  investment  dollars.

Singaporeans  are  a rational lot.  They  travel  to  the

neighbouring ASEAN countries, China and India.  They know

that, like water seeking the lowest point, investments go

to  the  location yielding the best returns.   They  know

that we have a high standard of living not simply because

Singaporeans  are  by nature somehow better  or  cleverer

than  others.   We  managed  because  we  have  a  better

Government in Singapore.  The Prime Minister had  earlier

mentioned  about India and China, and why these countries

were  not competing in the world a decade ago.  Now  that

these countries have adopted identical strategies that we

had  pursued  successfully in the past,  the  competitive

scene  has  changed completely.  So, Singaporeans  accept

that,  one  way  or  another, the  cost  base  for  doing

business in Singapore must be reduced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is reflected in the findings of the Feedback

Unit.   70% of a group of respondents, representative  of

the   Singapore  population,  supported   the   idea   of

restructuring the wage system for Singapore to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2676</b></font><br><br>

remain competitive.  71% supported the idea of setting  a

range  of CPF rates to allow for flexible adjustments  in

response  to  changing economic conditions.   61%  agreed

that  the  CPF system should be changed to help Singapore

remain  competitive.  64% agreed to the retuning  of  the

Singapore CPF system to save jobs.  Only 56% agreed  that

in  order to keep business costs low, CPF should be  cut.

In  other  words, Singaporeans are in support of retuning

the CPF to remain competitive and to save jobs.  However,

to  keep business costs low, most believe that more  than

just a cut in wages is needed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to go beyond a CPF cut has been raised by

those  who  have  spoken ahead of  me.   They  have  also

touched   upon   how   to  deal  with  the   difficulties

Singaporeans  will face in their housing mortgages  as  a

result of these cuts.  I am confident that the Government

would  have considered all these and would have  counter-measures in place to deal with them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would focus instead on the question of what

we are trying to achieve in this cost-reduction exercise.

Are  we,  firstly, attempting to stem  the  tide  of  job

losses?   Or are we trying to turn around the job  losses

and  try to entice industries that have already left  for

cheaper locations to come back to Singapore?  Or  are  we

trying  to  prepare ourselves to catch the  wave  of  the

recovery when it surely would eventually come?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, the proposed reduction in the

employers'  CPF  contribution rate from 16%  to  13%,  an

effective  reduction of only 2.6% of the payroll  burden,

is,  by  itself,  unlikely to swing  things  one  way  or

another.  While this small reduction is a relief  to  all

workers  in Singapore, I must confess that I am  not  too

clear what the Government is trying to achieve with  this

reduction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me paint a scenario. Consider a gymnast on a

trampoline.   In order to reach a higher point,  I  think

the gymnast would press the spring harder, go down lower,

so  that, on the rebound, he would reach higher.  So, let

us assume that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2677</b></font><br><br>

Singapore  needs a system-wide reduction of at least  10%

to  make  the world sit up and take notice.  Where  would

the   balance   come  from?   That  is  a  billion-dollar

question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could we have done something about land cost, which

is  of  course,  as we all know, a major  cost  of  doing

business  in  Singapore?   The  Government  has   already

indicated  that if we were not careful in our attempt  to

reduce  land cost, we could bring about asset  deflation.

As  we  know,  more  than 80% of Singaporeans  are  home-owners.   Asset  deflation would surely adversely  affect

all  of  us.   Already, bankruptcies have hit an  18-year

high,  as reported in the news media.  If asset deflation

were to happen, the evaporation of billions of dollars in

the  value of assets will surely put our economy  into  a

tailspin.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we profess that we could not readily

reduce  high land cost, I thought it would be  useful  to

point  out that the Government's land sales in  the  past

have  actually accumulated some surpluses from  the  high

value  of  land.  In fact, if we recall, Government  land

sales  were timed to maximise revenues.  By our budgetary

process, the proceeds from these land sales are below the

line  when  the  Budget is presented to Parliament  every

year.  Therefore, it becomes part of our reserves.  After

the  dissolution  of every Parliament,  these  land  sale

proceeds  could no longer be touched without  the  second

key.   However, the impact of these sales at a high value

lingers  on, as leaseholds of these lands are either  30,

60  or 99 years.  Thus, we pay in advance for the use  of

land  and  we are now living with the aftermath  of  high

land cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is my view that the way we manage our

surplus   from   the  land  sales  puts  an   unnecessary

constraint on the way we manage the economy.  The life of

every  government  is  at most five years,  but  property

cycles  are typically 10 years.  The economic cycles  are

shorter at three to four years, but they are not in  sync

with  our  political cycles.  Thus, what we put  away  in

boom  times, we cannot use in lean times.  Even if  there

is a willingness today in the Government to explore

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2678</b></font><br><br>

means to help businesses to deal with high land cost, the

Government might not have the means to do so,  as  it  is

reported  in the press that we are encountering a  Budget

deficit  of close to $3 billion for the first six  months

of this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Government is known to loathe using the

second  key, unless the situation is truly desperate.   I

would  like to ask the question: is it possible  that  we

have forsaken some policy options that could help in this

recession  because  of  this budgetary  constraint?   For

instance,  have  we  considered  capital  allowance   for

commercial  properties?  Capital allowance  is  now  only

granted to plants and machinery that generate income  for

a company.  Except for hotels, most commercial properties

do not qualify for capital allowance.  On the other hand,

if  a  company uses a commercial property to operate  its

business, then it claims rental expense as a reduction in

its tax computation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, recent corporate governance

guidelines  also  require  diminution  of  the  value  of

commercial properties be provided in the profit and  loss

statement.  With the decline of the property market since

1997,  this  has  been a drag on the performance  of  all

companies owning commercial properties.  In this respect,

if  we do not deal with the drag of high land cost on our

economy, we are like a boxer jumping into the boxing ring

with one arm tied behind our back.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must hasten to add that I am not suggesting that

we  raid the reserves the moment we run into trouble.   I

am  just pointing out that the unnecessary constraint  we

put  ourselves  into by locking away the  reserves  every

four  or  five years while the other components affecting

our  economy have longer life cycles.  During  the  times

when our economy enjoyed 8-10% per annum growth, that was

not an issue.  But, today, I believe, it stares us in the

face.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister has also touched upon the

various  aspects  of  changing the CPF  scheme  affecting

older  workers.   At  this point  in  our  recession,  an

immediate

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2679</b></font><br><br>

issue  of  addressing  how  we  can  help  the  long-term

unemployed, ie, people who have been unemployed for  nine

months or more and have very little prospect of finding a

job in the immediate near term, we might have to face the

fact  that  jobs would be hard to come by  for  a  while,

especially for these older workers, even though there are

those who do not like the words "older workers".  At  the

moment,  our assistance to these long-term unemployed  is

through providing training opportunities and, if they  do

show  up at the MPS of PAP Members, we will provide  them

through   some  cash  disbursements  using  our   welfare

schemes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question many of these affected persons have

been  asking is: why can they not draw on their CPF money

to  make ends meet if they have already enough savings in

their accounts to look after their old age?  Since we are

changing the CPF scheme - quite drastically I must say  - maybe we should consider this one change.  There is  this

provision of a Minimum Sum in the CPF scheme and which is

being  adjusted  upwards year by  year.   For  those  few

individuals - I am not sure if there are many of  them  - but  for  those  few  who have amounts  larger  than  the

Minimum  Sum, maybe we should look at the possibility  of

allowing  them  to withdraw the balance  from  their  CPF

scheme  before  reaching the age of 55 years  old.   This

will  alleviate their pressing needs when they hit a long

period of unemployment.

To  prevent  abuse, we could put a limit  to  the  amount

withdrawable  or  consider this  withdrawal  as  deferred

income  from  previous years and render them  liable  for

income tax.  If we are truly prepared to let Singaporeans

take  greater ownership of their own lives, as the  Prime

Minister  has  urged in his National  Day  Rally  speech,

perhaps  we should consider this one option.   I  do  not

think it is a withdrawal of their old-age savings if they

have met their Minimum Sum requirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even as the world recovery takes place and the

Singapore economy returns

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2680</b></font><br><br>

to  positive  growth,  together with  this  recovery,  we

should  take  the  challenge that we face  today  as  the

harbinger  of  things yet to come.  The  world  has  been

changed  by  IT and the Internet. The historical  hurdles

preventing  free flow of knowledge and services  such  as

time,   distance   and  geography  have   been   rendered

irrelevant.  By allowing the individuals to tap into  the

world  market,  even  Government is becoming  less  of  a

consideration.   Witness the success  of  the  Indian  IT

industry  despite  the same old Indian  political  system

that  hampers  the other aspects of the  Indian  economy.

So,  in  the  case  of  Singapore, while  having  a  good

Government  allows us to enjoy a premium, I believe  that

the  quantum  of this premium is reducing and diminishing

rapidly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good government remains important, but in exploring

new  frontiers,  the  individual is now  the  key  motive

factor.   I  am glad to note that the Prime Minister,  in

his  National  Day Rally speech, has indicated  that  his

Government  is now prepared to change to a  new  mindset.

He said that only what is prohibited in the future is not

allowed.  Everything else is fair game.  While the  Prime

Minister  did  not use the term "No U Turn  Syndrome"  or

NUTS, in effect, this is what he was talking about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, in my view, we must go beyond getting

rid  of  NUTS.  We must become a fun city with creativity

and  vibrancy.  Only then would the Singapore  goods  and

services command a premium in the world market.  I  think

the  Government must relax and allow our people  to  have

more   fun.   The  uncertain  response  of  the   various

regulators on the issue of bar-top dancing indicates that

the  old  mindset dies hard.  I call this old mindset  of

the  civil servants, the "NO VOWels After S (NOVOWAS)  on

licence plates syndrome".  Let me elaborate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did Members notice that as our car licence plate

numbers changed, running through the series of "SDZ", the

next  series  actually started with  the  letters  "SFA"?

What  has  happened to the "SEA" series?  The  answer  is

that years ago, we changed from the SY series to the SBA

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2681</b></font><br><br>

series,  skipping  the SAA series.  This  was  presumably

because  someone  in  the  decision-making  position  had

decided  that there should be no vowel after "S"  on  our

licence  plates. The question is:  why?   No  reason  was

offered  except perhaps the civil servant in  charge,  or

even  the Minister in charge, looked into the future  and

decided  that  it  was  no good  to  have  "SEX"  on  the

Singapore  licence  plates.   So to  avoid  the  fuss  of

having  to deal with SEX, it was decided to do away  with

all  the  vowels after S.  In so doing, the decision  has

deprived Singaporeans some opportunities to have fun with

our  licence  plate numbers and it has also deprived  the

LTA  some  opportunities to make some money from  selling

some  interesting  licence plates.   For  instance,  some

vehicle  owners will be very willing to pay a high  price

for a licence plate such as SEX 999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while this is not a life and death issue, it

does represent the mindset in the civil service and maybe

even  ultimately, in the Cabinet itself.  Is it  possible

that  this  mindset in our decision-makers  has  deprived

Singapore of innumerable opportunities to take our  place

in  the  sun, because we do not want to deal with one  or

two  possible  occurrences of unpleasant events?   If  we

truly  want  a  breakthrough into the next phase  of  our

development, not only do we need to get rid of  NUTS,  we

also need to get rid of this "NO VOWels After S (NOVOWAS)

syndrome".   Let us start by putting back the  vowels  in

our  licence plates and have SADs, SEXs and SOBs  on  our

vehicles  running  around in our city roads.   When  that

happens, we could shake off the straitjacket that we have

strapped  on ourselves and truly liberate the  creativity

and energy in our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this recession presents

daunting  challenges  to the Government.   On  the  other

hand, it is comforting that the same Feedback Unit survey

indicates that eight out of 10 Singaporeans believe  that

Singapore can overcome the current challenges.  67%  have

faith in the new team of leaders and 69% are upbeat about

the Singapore future.  Therefore, Sir, if this Government

could provide the leadership, our people

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2682</b></font><br><br>

would  rally around and Singapore will come through  this

valley  of gloom.  The retuning of CPF is just the  first

step in this journey of recovery.

<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, thank you for the opportunity of  allowing

me to participate in this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I considered the CPF cuts, I asked myself:

would  I support it?  After some thought, the answer  was

yes.   The reason is that doing nothing is not an option.

If  doing nothing is not an option, then the question is:

how do we move forward?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My position on the CPF cuts is that I support it,

but  wish to sound a cautionary note and to say that  CPF

cuts are not the be-all and the end-all.  There are other

things  that have to be considered and I would  touch  on

that in a moment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just coming back to the cautionary note, when we

started off with the CPF scheme, its original purpose was

for  social  security  -  savings  for  retirement,  home

ownership,   medical  expenses  and,  to   some   extent,

education.  That was its original purpose and remained so

for  a long time until the mid-1980s when we had to  make

the  first  CPF  cut.   In  the  1980s,  because  of  the

difficulties of remaining competitive, we had to do a cut

and,  more  recently, in the late 1990s, we had  done  it

again twice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the significance of the Prime Minister's

announcement today actually marks a fundamental shift  in

what we have done before.  By saying that CPF rates would

be  a range between 30-36%, we are formally endorsing the

use  of  cutting our CPF rates or using CPF  rates  as  a

macro-economic  tool.   It may  move  from  its  original

purpose   of  purely  social  security  to  an   economic

calibrator.  The two purposes are very different and they

serve different purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not oppose the usage in the new way simply

because  circumstances have changed and  we  are  plugged

into  the global economy.  And because the global economy

moves so quickly and it is so

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2683</b></font><br><br>

volatile, we have to be able to react quickly.  But  what

these  changes mean is that, in good times,  the  savings

function of CPF takes precedence because you put in more,

but  in  bad  times,  the macro-economic  function  takes

precedence because you try and retune the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These have certain consequences for the average

Singaporean in the street because he is at the  receiving

end  of this.  At the Government level, when we tune  the

economy using CPF, we can see from an economic level  why

it is necessary.  But from the poor guy in the street, it

is  very  difficult for him to adjust  to  this  because,

going  forward in the long-term, it is difficult for  him

to  plan.  So the consequences would be the difficulty in

long-term   planning.   It  also  means   that   when   a

Singaporean  buys  a property, he should  never  use  the

maximum  amount allowable because he must always  provide

for  a  buffer, as he cannot tell, going forward, whether

or not this rate is going to go up or down.  That message

needs to go out to Singaporeans because for decades, they

have  planned on the basis of a reasonably certain  rate.

But  now,  going forward, he is not certain and  he  must

allow himself a buffer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next consequence of this is that, given that the

rate  is  fluctuating and given that in 10-20 years,  the

amount that you have in CPF is subject to inflation,  the

$30,000  today would not be worth $30,000  in  10  years'

time.   There is then an urgent need for Singaporeans  to

understand the importance of financial planning.  In  the

past, they have depended on their CPF and looked to  that

as  something that would take them through their old age.

Now, this is no longer possible.  CPF would take care  of

some  part of it, but they certainly have to see how they

can   provide  for  themselves  in  terms  of   financial

planning.   We would think that this is an obvious  thing

and  that Singaporeans understand that.  Let me tell  you

that   some   Singaporeans  understand   it,   but   many

Singaporeans do not see the importance, or understand the

urgency  or  need  for  it.  All Singaporeans  are  equal

citizens. All

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2684</b></font><br><br>

Singaporeans have equal rights under the law, but not all

Singaporeans have equal understanding of the economy, the

financial  consequences of what we do, or the  importance

of financial planning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very important, therefore, for the Government

to   get   this  message  out,  especially   to   younger

Singaporeans,  and make them aware of the  importance  of

it.  I would go so far as to suggest that the Ministry of

Education actually look to introducing this as a subject,

but not as an examinable subject, as students have enough

on   their   plate,  to  make  students  understand   the

importance of this, going forward, so that we educate  an

entire  new  generation of Singaporeans on  the  need  to

supplement their CPF savings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move on now from the consequences of this to some

of  the  feedback that I have received in respect of  the

proposed CPF changes.  I spoke with my grassroots leaders

a  couple  of  days back in anticipation of this  debate.

The  first and most important piece of feedback that came

in  was  that  it  is  really the  middle  income  group,

especially the lower-middle income group, that  would  be

affected.   I  think  my  Parliamentary  colleagues  have

already  touched  on the points about housing  loans  and

repayment of mortgages. So it would not be necessary  for

me  to  elaborate  on  that.  But I would  just  like  to

highlight that this is a strong feeling on the ground.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other strong feeling on the ground is the cost

of living.  Singaporeans, as a whole, can accept the need

for  CPF  cuts.   As a general rule, when  faced  with  a

problem, Singaporeans will rally round together.  But  in

order  for them to feel that they are really part of  the

team,  they also need to feel that if we are asking  them

to  accept the pain of CPF cuts, why is it, at  the  same

time,  the cost of living is not going down but, in fact,

it seems to be going up?  A few days back, in the Straits

Times and, I think, in Streats, it was reported that  the

Consumer  Price Index has reported a jump.  One  of  them

reported a 0.4% jump in prices and the other a 0.6%  jump

in prices.  I am not sure

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2685</b></font><br><br>

which  indicators they were referring to, but it is clear

that there has been a jump in prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feedback from the grassroots leaders is whether

the  Government  can  look  at the  costs  of  utilities,

transport and rentals to see whether these can be brought

down.   When  we  talk about the cost of doing  business,

there  is also an urgent need to see whether the cost  of

rental of commercial properties can be brought down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, at the end of the day, if

Singaporeans  feel that they are being asked  to  make  a

sacrifice, they can appreciate that, but they would  also

appreciate  it if something can be done to alleviate  the

pain.  In this connection, I would like to mention that I

applaud  the  announcement  by  the  Acting  Minister  of

Health, Mr Khaw Boon Wan, about cost cutting measures for

the  Ministry of Health in order to reduce  the  cost  of

providing healthcare.  That was a very important  message

to  send  to  Singaporeans that at least one Ministry  is

looking   at  reducing  costs.   What  about  the   other

Ministries?   We have not heard anything from  them.   It

may well be that the other Ministries are looking at cost

cutting.  If they are, Singaporeans need to hear it,  and

if  they  are not, then they should hurry up  and  do  it

straightaway.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an urgent need to have intelligent cost

cutting  that would translate into savings  that  can  be

passed on to the average Singaporean in the street.   Not

all  cost  cutting is good.  If a Ministry  spends  on  a

project  which results in a contract being  awarded,  the

contractors  get the job, the contractors' employees  get

jobs  and  they get their salaries, income is  generated,

that  is fine.  That is why I say there is an urgent need

to look into intelligent cost cutting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should not just be the average man-in-the-street

who  pays  this price because it should be  a  collective

effort.   Employers, obviously, need to play their  part.

They  should pass on the savings that they get  from  the

CPF  cuts.   The banks and HDB should seriously  look  at

what can be done

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2686</b></font><br><br>

to  either convert payments to only interest payments  or

deferment  of  repayment of instalments  in  cases  where

there is difficulty in making repayment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, I would just stress that the CPF cut

is  only one part of a much wider issue and a much  wider

debate.   The wider issue really is how to make Singapore

more  competitive,  how  to  generate  business,  how  to

generate  jobs.  The CPF cut is not, by itself, going  to

be  the  magic  formula that immediately solves  all  our

problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are obviously many other things that we have

to  do.   And  one of the things that I would suggest  is

that  there  be  a new policy introduced across-the-board

for  all  the  Ministries, which I call the common  sense

policy.  Basically, how it works is:  when in doubt,  use

common sense.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just take an example. I read in the

newspapers  the  other day that there  was  this  company

called  Wash  Wash  that had applied to  the  HDB  for  a

corporate licence to do car washing in a HDB multi-storey

car  park.  When they first broached the idea to the HDB,

it  was reported that HDB rejected them giving, among the

list  of  reasons,  "no  such licences  have  been  given

before."   What kind of reason is that?  If we  use  that

kind of reason, we will never be able to do anything new.

And there was also, "car washing is only permitted at the

car washing bay."  I really like this one, "the detergent

run-off will weaken the concrete".  It was only after the

owners  of  Wash  Wash appealed to their  MP,  Dr  Vivian

Balakrishnan, who is also the Minister of  State  of  MND

and   the  Government  pro-enterprise  panel,  that  they

eventually succeeded in getting their licence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is this. It should not take all this

convulsion  of  effort in order to get  a  licence.   The

bottom  line is:  every Ministry, every statutory  board,

every  Government agency should have a policy that if  an

idea generates jobs, if an idea can generate business, if

an  idea can do something to boost the economy, it should

be given serious consideration.  Do not make the poor guy

jump through so many hoops

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2687</b></font><br><br>

and  hurdles before he eventually gets to it.    But,  of

course, we are happy to say that in that case, there  was

a  happy  ending.  And I read in the newspapers that  128

licences have been issued.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, CPF cut is only one part of

it.   There  are many other things that we  have  to  do.

Singaporeans need to feel that we are all part and parcel

of  the  common  enterprise.  When we fought  the  battle

against SARS, everybody had their part to play.  I  think

the  average Singaporean in the street needs to feel that

he is not the only one bearing the brunt in the battle to

revive  the  economy.  The average Singaporean  needs  to

feel  that he is part of the team.  He will feel that  he

is  part  of the team if we hear that the Ministries  are

doing  various  things, if we hear  that  Government  and

other agencies are doing various things, if we also  know

that  employers are on board, if the banks are on  board,

if  the  property owners are on board.  And if we can  do

this, there is no reason why we cannot pull ourselves out

of our economic doldrums.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani (Hong Kah):</b> Mr

Deputy  Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak.

Looking at the number of speakers, I would just deal with

two or three points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, understandably, many employers I spoke to

welcomed  the  CPF  cuts, although I am  sure  they  were

hoping  for a 6 percentage point reduction as opposed  to

3.   But  to them, I have this message.  I urge employers

to  utilise  the  forthcoming savings  in  a  responsible

manner.  To companies who are doing well, I urge them  to

return  their  savings,  or at  least  a  part  of  their

savings,  to  their workers  -  this return made  in  the

form   of   bonuses,  higher  budget  for  upgrading   or

retraining or other schemes that suit the peculiar  needs

of their workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with such savings, I also urge companies to

refrain from resorting to retrenchments.  I do appreciate

that  some  companies do have to downsize notwithstanding

the CPF retuning.  But I do hope

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2688</b></font><br><br>

that   retrenchment  is  done  only  where  it  is  truly

unavoidable.   I  believe these  points  were  raised  by

speakers  before and, in fact, even by the Prime Minister

himself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think employers owe it to the country and to

the  workers  to  do  their part in  this  exercise.   If

employers do not act responsibly by utilising the savings

in a responsible manner, they would undermine the efforts

of  the Government and the sacrifice of the workers.   We

need to remind employers of this obligation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a report in a recent edition of the

NTUC  News, union leaders call on employers to share  the

benefit  of savings with their workers.  And I understand

that union leaders would continue to remind employers  of

this  call.   I  applaud  this  effort  and  I  ask   the

Government to use its influence and good office to remind

the employers of their role in this process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the workers, I have this message - the unions

hear  you, your MPs hear you, your Government hears  you.

And I am sure the Government and all of us will do all we

can  to help where it is proper to do so.  But such  help

does  not  mean  that all the workers' problems  will  be

solved.   That  certainly is not  the  intention  and  it

should   not  be.   In  this  exercise,  no  one  escapes

completely unscathed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduction of the CPF contribution by 3

percentage points is not that devastating to most people.

And  even as of now, various schemes are already in place

to  assist Singaporeans who are in need, and I  urge  the

Government  to  ensure that these schemes  continue.   In

addition,  there  is the HOPE scheme, which  will  be  of

great  help  to  poor small families to  get  out  of  an

otherwise intractable poverty situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also urge workers to maintain their

productivity  in spite of the CPF retuning.   If  workers

respond  otherwise, ie, they slacken  because  their  CPF

contribution  by  employers is reduced, then  it  renders

this exercise futile, as there would be no real advantage

for  employers or investors to come in.  All  workers   - and,  of  course,  this  includes those  working  in  the

Government   -   have to moderate their expectations  and

adjust their lifestyles.  Already

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2689</b></font><br><br>

we  are reconsidering our attitude towards work.  We  are

replacing the concept of life-long employment with  life-long  learning.   With  this CPF  retuning,  we  have  to

rethink our retirement plans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the CPF retuning is perhaps the most widely and

drastically  felt among a slew of reforms  undertaken  by

the  Government in the last couple of years.   The  rapid

changes  strike  fear and worry among  the  people.   The

uncertainty is quite disconcerting.  Speakers  before  me

have  elaborated on the kinds of uncertainty that workers

face.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people need to be reassured that although there

are  many  things uncertain, that in spite of  the  rapid

changes,  many  things will remain the same.  Ironically,

perhaps  many things need to be changed so  that  we  can

ensure the more fundamental things remain the same.   And

among  the things that ought to remain the same and  have

to remain the same and are intended to remain the same by

these steps are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That our system of governance and Government

will  remain, ie, we have a Government that listens, that

has foresight and that acts responsibly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the future of our country and our economy

remains  in  our hands, even though it is hot  at  times.

There is a Malay saying that goes:  gengam para api, biar

sampai  jadi  arang.  It means that when we hold  burning

ember,  we  have to hold it until we snuff out the  fire,

until  it returns back to charcoal.  If we let it go,  it

will  continue burning and become ash, which will not  be

of much use to us anymore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Our country will remain a safe and peaceful

place for us to live in, even if we are going to be  less

cash rich.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Our families will remain strong and that pro-family policies are firmly upheld.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) That we will continue to help those in need and

there will be policies remaining in place to ensure  that

every  Singaporean matters and every Singaporean is cared

for.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2690</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I am in support of the proposals

tabled by the Government.

<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the retuning of our CPF

system.  Although the medicine is bitter, it  has  to  be

swallowed.   The proposed changes to the  CPF  may  bring

financial pressure to our people.  But if we tighten  our

belts,  this  new  system will help us  to  maintain  our

competitiveness,  save jobs, and  even  create  more  job

opportunities.   Because  of  the  high  labour  cost  in

Singapore, even higher than that in the United States and

Australia, we must make quick adjustment to adapt to  the

investment changes in the international market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I hope that the Government will avoid

making  too  many  changes to the CPF system  in  future.

Although flexibility in the CPF system will enable us  to

deal  with  the  investment trend more  nimbly,  frequent

changes  to  the CPF system will send unclear signals  to

the  business  community  and the  investors,  making  it

difficult  for them to make long-term plans.  This  would

also  cause confusion to the investors, and give them  an

unfavourable  impression of Singapore.  As  a  matter  of

fact, our CPF system has been subjected to many rounds of

adjustments over the past few years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, salaries and remuneration should be

decided  between  the employers and  employees.  The  CPF

contribution  rates  do not make any distinction  in  the

industries  and  companies.  The  performance   of   each

industry, company and employee is not uniform. If you cut

the  contribution rate of employers, it will amount to  a

pay cut to the employees.  This is unfair to the workers.

Not  many  employers  will tell the  employees  who  have

performed  better  that,  "This  time  round,  your   CPF

contribution  rate is reduced, let the  company  pay  you

cash  every  month to compensate your losses."   Whatever

the  CPF  contribution  rate may  be,  the  employer  has

already provided for it in his budget.  Any change to the

contribution rate can only bring more procedural work  to

the  employers. I would suggest that the CPF contribution

rate

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2691</b></font><br><br>

should  be  maintained at a low but reasonable level,  so

that the employees will have enough savings to look after

their retirement and healthcare needs in their old age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also hope that the Government will encourage those

companies  which have done well to give more  bonuses  to

their   employees,  through  the  grant   of   some   tax

incentives.  The persuasive power of our leaders  is  not

enough.   To  many  companies,  the  appraisal  of  their

shareholders on them is of paramount importance, and  the

remuneration of workers is secondary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make sufficient provision for old age is the

responsibility of the individuals rather than that of the

Government.  Although I understand  that  the  Government

wants  to maintain relatively high CPF contribution rates

to  ensure that every citizen has enough savings for  his

old  age,  this has caused our labour cost system  to  be

inflexible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you an illustration. A long time ago in

ancient  China, there was a rich merchant who made  every

effort  to  cultivate his son and prepared him thoroughly

for  the Imperial Examination.  Unfortunately, when  this

son of his sat for the examination, he failed to make the

grade.   The rich merchant asked to see his son's  answer

sheet,  and was shocked to find that there was no writing

on  the  sheets, except for some watermarks.  It happened

that  in  the past the father would always grind the  ink

slab to make the ink for the son to write with his brush-pen.  At  the  examination, the father was not  there  to

grind  the  ink  slab, so the boy did  not  know  how  to

generate the ink from the ink slab, and he simply  wetted

his  brush with water and wrote his essay.  Thus, a blank

paper was submitted as the answers were illegible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans should set aside part of their monthly

salary  as  savings, and not depend  solely  on  the  CPF

savings for their old age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the package to buffer the impact of the

CPF retuning exercise will be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2692</b></font><br><br>

adequate  to  help our people deal with the  changes.   I

hope   that   the   Government  will  help   the   poorer

Singaporeans,    particularly    in    their     housing,

transportation and healthcare needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to express my

appreciation to Minister Khaw Boon Wan for his  announced

intention to cut healthcare costs in Singapore.   I  hope

that other Ministries will also do their best to cut down

the  various charges to lighten the burden of the  people

in meeting the high cost of living.

<br>6.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mrs Fang Ai Lian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Fang Ai Lian (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, since the

Prime Minister is here, let me first congratulate him  on

an  outstanding National Day Rally speech.  It  was  very

heart-warming  and  inspiring  and,  indeed,   many   had

commented that it was his best speech ever.  As was  like

good wine, he gets better with age!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Businesses and investors, of course, wanted to hear

the Prime Minister's views on the economy and the signals

that he was trying to send out.  So, it is not surprising

that  the  PM  concentrated much of  his  speech  on  the

present  economic  difficulties.   Yes,  very  true,  our

landscape  has changed dramatically.  Yes, we  took  away

jobs  from  others.  But, today, that fantastic  economic

strategy  is increasingly and ferociously being  followed

by  even  more  lower  cost regimes in  the  region,  and

specially India and China.  Their economies are so  large

that  they can impact other economies in such a  big  way

and  in  a  very  adverse way as  well.   Being  a  small

economy,  we  just  cannot escape the  onslaught.   Other

skill  gaps  and  advantages have also been  eroded.   We

seriously need to address our competitiveness and  revive

our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the warnings of multi-national

corporations, like IBM, cannot go unheeded  because  they

are  very  real.  In my  business too, I see  our  global

clients   disappearing,   either   scaling   down   their

operations  or just pulling out.  It is not because  they

do  not  find  us attractive anymore.  It  is  just  that

globalisation has

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2693</b></font><br><br>

made  it  unnecessary for them to be here.  This tide  of

globalisation  is  very  real,  very  strong   and   very

powerful.   And those of us who can ride this  tide  will

prosper with this trend, and those of us who cannot  will

simply struggle against the current.  Therefore, we  need

to change, and the business community really welcomes the

proposal to retune our CPF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up until the Prime Minister's National Day Rally

speech, the business community thought that it would just

be  a  maintenance  of  the rate.   And  after  the  PM's

announcement, there has been great debate - how far  will

this  go?   Of  course,  everybody  has  expected  a   6%

reduction but the PM has just announced that it will be a

moderate  3%.  We respect the decision, and we appreciate

that  move.  The Prime Minister also touches on the  part

of  home-owners,  what will this do  for  their  mortgage

payments.   And  then  there  is  also  the  worry  about

consumption  and  its  effect on  other  sectors  of  the

economy, calls for cuts in Government fees and taxes, and

also  even  for  the  size of the  civil  service  to  be

reduced.   I  think  that  all these  are  not  frivolous

comments,  and  I am sure the Government  will  take  all

these in its stride.  And, in fact, the PM had said  that

the  CPF cut is just part of a large package of  business

costs which the Government will be seeking to reduce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to add to this debate. But I think it

would be helpful and valuable to recognise that the  PM's

proposals are really steps in the right direction, and we

should fully support the proposals which have been  made.

The  Prime  Minister did mention Jack Neo  twice  in  his

National  Day  Rally speech.  So I might paraphrase  Jack

and say, "Prime Minister and the Government not stupid".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the Prime Minister's track record has been a

very  excellent one, although we cannot say  that  it  is

entirely  flawless.   It  is not possible  to  achieve  a

flawless  track record as well.  This move to modify  the

CPF  system is, in fact, a recognition that the high wage

policy   has   contributed  to   our   present   economic

difficulties.  Also, many commentators have remarked that

the Government has

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2694</b></font><br><br>

played  too big a role in our economy, too big a role  in

our  society,  and that is why Singaporeans  are  by  and

large  very reliant on the Government and run to  it  for

solutions to all problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, of course, this is easy to say with the benefit

of hindsight.  The high wage policy did serve us well for

a  long  time,  many  aspects of it, and  benefited  many

Singaporeans  as well.  Likewise, many Singaporeans  feel

very  comfortable to be hand-held, to be led  and  to  be

molly-coddled  by the Government.  But the circumstances,

as said by so many people, have changed dramatically, and

it  is  also  time for us, Singaporeans,  to  assume  new

mindsets,   new  attitudes  and  really  be   much   more

entrepreneurial,  much  more  self-reliant  and  also  to

understand the real meaning of adding value.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also enlightening to note that the Government

too   has   changed  -  heeding  feedback,   looking   at

shortcomings and being ready and willing to correct them.

I  am  quite  amazed at how quickly the  PM  changed  his

stance on bar-top dancing.  A lot has been done - undoing

red  tape  and  bureaucracy; taking away  cumbersome  and

stifling  regulations.  Of course, we continue  to  gripe

that  it is not far and fast enough.  But it will be fair

to  say,  at  least, all these measures are  being  taken

seriously  and there is no pretending that  it  does  not

exist.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This CPF retuning is a classic example of a good

solution  -  breaking  down  the  rigidities,  making  it

flexible,  and  taking  away  the  statutory  burden   on

businesses  and  also not putting our  older  workers  at

risk.   Of  course, it will produce uncertainty,  but  we

live in a very uncertain world.  Just the last six months

alone,  we  had  been  wrecked by so  many  crises,  SARS

included.   So, we need just to recognise that  certainty

is  a  luxury which we cannot take for granted.  But  the

CPF  retuning  will  produce a  lot  of  adverse  results

because it is so linked to many aspects of our lives.  We

are  glad that the Prime Minister has said and recognised

that this retuning is just not about re-scaling of dreams

but it will bring about real and considerable hardship to

many.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2695</b></font><br><br>

We  are all looking forward to hear additional assistance

measures that DPM would be announcing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a few remarks about the HOPE programme which

has  been said to be comprehensive, and yet there  was  a

Straits  Times' report about a family with an  income  of

$680 who was not able to qualify because they had two "0"

levels  too  many.  So, here again, because  we  live  in

exceptional  times, it is important that the  bureaucrats

exercise flexibility and, as Ms Indranee has said, common

sense in the implementation of policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot has been said, but I would like to commend the

Government  for the courage shown, to take  on  difficult

and   unpopular  decisions,  and  this  retuning  of  CPF

squarely  falls into it.  It will cost you votes  if  you

have  an  election  tomorrow.  Fortunately,  we  are  not

having an election tomorrow.  It will not be until a  few

years'  time,  by  which time, the benefits  of  all  the

changes which are being proposed would have been felt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have used a lot of tools already, but these tools

have  to  be relooked, like the tools relating to  taxes,

levies  and so on.  But the CPF is one far-reaching  tool

that  will  have immediate effect.  On hindsight,  again,

perhaps we were too hasty in restoring the CPF cuts which

were  introduced  before.  As  I  said,  it  is  a  blunt

instrument  but  it is a very effective  instrument.   It

will  produce  a whole range of adverse effects  and  new

solutions have to be found.  I do not think we can tackle

all  problems at the same time.  Some have to be  put  in

the parking lot.  The main thing is that there must be  a

recognition that we have a problematic situation here and

there  is a need to change, and new solutions got  to  be

found.   The  original objectives of the  CPF  cannot  be

fully  met  by  the  old  model.   So  there  must  be  a

transition from the old model to the new model  and  help

needs to be injected here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future is never going to be certain. But there

have been a lot of debates

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2696</b></font><br><br>

already,  and a lot of time spent on debating about  what

our  future should be and the solutions needed, like  the

Remaking  Singapore,  the ERC, and the  debates  in  this

House.   I  am confident we do have a blueprint  for  the

future  which looks promising.  In businesses, we  always

say  that  our competitors are also not stupid.   We  all

have  the  same strategies.  At the end of the  day,  the

team that comes together, the team that executes well, is

the  team  that  wins.  So, let us execute  together  and

support the Prime Minister and the Government.

<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

thank you for allowing me to join in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF cuts are bitter but necessary medicine and,

in  some  ways,  I believe that we can take  this  bitter

medicine  analogy  a little further.  The  challenges  we

face are not going to be a simple flu.  Recovery can only

come  when  the patient, that is our people, acknowledges

the  problem  and  takes steps to  address  the  problem.

After acknowledging the problem, the bitter medicine  may

need  to  be taken over a period of time, and  there  may

need  to  be more than one medicine with a bitter  after-taste,  no matter how sugar-coated.  And after that,  the

patient  may  still need rehabilitation and physiotherapy

to  recover  the use of flabby muscles, stiff joints  and

maybe  a  flabby mind.   Some medicine may appear  to  be

less  painful but may not be so effective.   Just  as  no

physician  can  do a good job if he has an  uncooperative

patient, I fear that the Government's fiscal measures and

CPF  retuning  will  not bear fruits unless  Singaporeans

acknowledge  that we as a people and a  country  need  to

recognise we have a problem in competitiveness  and  take

all necessary steps to address the matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other MPs have spoken about the steps that the

Government may need to take, but I would like to focus  a

little bit differently and say that the onus is now  upon

our  people  - our workers - to recognise the steps  that

the  Government has done and to take their own  steps  to

recognise the problem.  My grassroots leaders still  keep

telling me how difficult it is to recruit

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2697</b></font><br><br>

waiters  and  waitresses, even when the pay is  $1,200  a

month.   Singaporeans, it seems, are not prepared to  put

up  with  split  shifts and having to work  on  weekends.

Other grassroots leaders tell me about difficulties  with

recruiting for shipyards, even when they are prepared  to

offer  training.   And when our Town Council  decided  to

employ more Singaporean workers for cleansing operations,

residents started complaining that actually local workers

were spraying water and not scrubbing, unlike some of the

foreign  workers.  When the water dries up, the corridors

are still dirty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we upskill the younger and more educated workers,

I  think the only way for us to maintain low unemployment

for older and less educated workers is for them to accept

the  manual  service and less convenient  jobs  that  are

currently being taken by some of our foreign workers.   I

think  we  need  to relearn the dignity of honest  manual

labour.  We can outsource a lot of jobs, but certain jobs

cannot  be easily outsourced and have to be done  in  the

country and onsite.  I do not think there is any shame in

honest labour, even when some aspects of the job may be a

bit  demeaning.  As doctors and healthcare professionals,

this  is the creed which doctors and nurses have to learn

to  accept  - unpleasant sights and smells, and sometimes

unreasonable behaviour of people who are ill and need our

help.   I  do  not  think people think any  less  of  our

profession  for the fact that we have to  deal  with  all

these unpleasant things.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call upon the Government to have a campaign to

change  societal values, to re-emphasise the  dignity  of

labour, the principle that any job is better than no job,

and it is better to be at least partially employed and to

receive  some  help  financially than  to  look  out  for

handouts   alone.   We  manage  to  change  Singaporeans'

attitude to a military career, and I think we can do  the

same  for manual labour and service sector jobs.   Having

misplaced pride and a handout mentality would not be good

for us in the long term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of CPF cuts would be to lower our labour

cost and make our labour more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2698</b></font><br><br>

competitive.  However, cost alone is not only the  issue.

Our  products,  as  a  whole, as a country,  have  to  be

cheaper and better, or at least give better value for the

price.   Factories in China, India and the former Eastern

bloc  have found out that when cheaper and better quality

foreign   goods  started  appearing  in  their   markets,

discounting  obsolescent  product  lines  alone  did  not

ensure sales.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a potential employee, if what you have to offer

is  a  set  of  old-fashioned and limited skills  do  not

expect  an  easy  time  on  the  market  for  new   jobs.

Singaporeans like ai pea ai chi.  Your potential employer

is  also  looking  for a better, cheaper,  more  reliable

labour  product, just as you want to have it cheaper  and

better.    Many of our citizens decry the fact that  many

employers  would like to have people to have facility  in

Chinese  or other languages.  Others find that  employers

want  to  have good looking frontline staff.  Instead  of

complaining  that people are discriminating against  you,

perhaps we should learn to give employers what they want.

If you read in today's papers, people in the call centres

are  now  learning how to speak American English so  that

they  are actually able to do a better job even when they

are far away from sight.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way that many older workers embrace

computers to deal with marketplace realities, I think the

CDCs  can  help  non-Chinese Singaporeans get  a  working

knowledge of Mandarin to make them more employable.   The

MPs who are not so good in Mandarin manage to learn a bit

more too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want a frontline counter job, you might want

to  attend  a course that helps you project the  pleasant

personality and good inter-personal skills and also gives

tips on dressing right.  If you look frumpy and you sound

grumpy,  do not blame people for not giving you the  job.

Again, CDCs can help in this regard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last bit is just a suggestion for HDB. As we

have asked the people to cut their cloth as they are able

to  afford  it, and cut their clothes according  to  what

they can afford, perhaps now we are actually

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2699</b></font><br><br>

asking  people  to live more within their means.   People

who  are  downgrading and unable to service large housing

loans   need  to  be  looking  at  cheaper  alternatives.

Between  a highly subsidised rental market with  arguably

lots  of  necessary restrictions and the free  market,  I

think  a  lot  of  people in distress would  really  look

forward  to an alternative where HDB will have  minimally

subsidised rental flats which are maybe a bit bigger  but

which  would fill the need or gap, much in the  same  way

that  NTUC  FairPrice  supermarkets  manage  to  moderate

prices.   Perhaps,  that  is one practical  measure  that

would help many hard-pressed Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I support the statement.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for

allowing  me to join in this debate.  We were  geared  up

this  afternoon to hear drastic changes to CPF.   It  was

thus  a great relief to hear from the Prime Minister that

the changes would be phased in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very reassuring that the Government leaders

understand   and  acknowledge  the  pain  and  sufferings

attendant  with  the  CPF changes and  have  taken  these

concerns   into   consideration  and  ameliorated   them.

Although  the pain and sufferings are reduced,  they  are

not entirely eliminated.  I therefore urge the Government

to  look  into  ways to help those who  are  affected  to

overcome these problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bear with me while I repeat a point made by other

hon.  Members.   The  CPF is used by many  to  pay  their

housing  loans.   I  hope that the  Government  can,  for

instance,  work  with the banks to extend  the  repayment

period  and lower the monthly repayment in line with  the

reduction  of the CPF contributions.  I look  forward  to

hear the measures that DPM Lee Hsien Loong would announce

shortly on how they can help the people who are affected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this should not distract us from the

seriousness of the challenges

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2700</b></font><br><br>

that  we  face  as  a  nation.  We must  therefore  brace

ourselves for the needed changes to remain competitive in

a  very  fast changing world.  It beholds us  to  realise

that  Singapore  is a small place where  the  margin  for

errors is also small.  If we miss the boat, it may  be  a

long  while before the next arrives or, worse  still,  it

never comes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thus urge all Singaporeans to understand the

gravity of the problems that confront us, to support  the

Government and to do whatever needs to be done to  ensure

that  Singapore  continues to prosper so  that  Singapore

will  have  a  home  not only for us, but  also  for  our

children and their children as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I support the proposed changes to

the CPF.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

when  the  Prime  Minister made the announcement  in  his

National  Day Rally that the CPF rates would be  reduced,

many  Singaporeans  were worried.  When  I  spoke  to  my

grassroots   leaders,   they  said   jin   cham   meaning

"Terrible!"  But  today,  having  heard  what  the  Prime

Minister announced, I called them up and  they said heng-ah, or "Phew, lucky!"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, Singaporeans understand the purpose of

the CPF reduction.  I believe this would be supported and

accepted by the people in general.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reduction in CPF contribution rates, I

hope,  would  help  to  reduce  the  business  costs   in

Singapore.   On  the one hand, this would help  save  our

jobs  and  prevent further retrenchments.  On  the  other

hand,   we   would  be  able  to  attract  more   foreign

investments here, and thereby creating more jobs for  our

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a policy may be good, but it has to be

implemented effectively so as to obtain the best results.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would suggest we set up a nation-wide

unemployment  register.  We  can  make  use  of  all  the

community centres and community clubs in our 84

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2701</b></font><br><br>

constituencies  to  effect  a  nation-wide   unemployment

registration exercise.  By so doing, we would be able  to

better   understand   how  many  people   are   genuinely

unemployed  and  what are their needs  and  requirements.

Then,  we  can make a study of it and come out  with  the

appropriate  measures  to  effectively  help  them.   The

unemployed will have better chances of getting jobs  that

are  available and suitable to them.  In this way, we can

achieve the best results in combating unemployment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also help those unemployed workers who are

in financial difficulties.  We could perhaps give them  a

once-off unemployment benefit of, say, $2,000 or  $3,000.

Apart  from that, we should also try to reduce the  other

costs of living, such as PUB charges, and rentals.   Only

then, can we effectively help our workers to settle their

problems  while  making every effort to  attract  foreign

investors to come in and create more jobs for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we should step up our efforts to promote

Singapore  overseas.  Here, we must commend our  Minister

for  Trade  and Industry, BG George Yeo.   Under  such  a

gloomy  global economic climate, he has still managed  to

attract  a  lot of foreign investments to Singapore.   We

should  have some good incentive packages, and  encourage

more  civil servants to go overseas to promote  them   to

the  prospective foreign investors.  Nowadays, a  lot  of

people  go  to China to invest.  The reason is that  many

leaders  from  China  came to Singapore  to  promote  the

various  investment opportunities in China.  I  think  we

should  learn  from them, and encourage our senior  civil

servants  to  go  overseas,  particularly  to  China  and

India,   to  promote  our  incentive  packages   to   the

entrepreneurs  so  that they will come  to  Singapore  to

invest.  Then we will be able to create more jobs for our

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should work like the bees. Even when the weather

is  bad,  the bees do not stop working. If the  immediate

vicinity  is  no  good, they will  fly  further  away  to

collect  more pollen from the flowers there to make  more

honey.   I  think  we should also learn  from  them.   We

should go overseas to promote our incentive

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2702</b></font><br><br>

packages.   Only  then, can we link up with  the  foreign

entrepreneurs,  persuade them to bring their  investments

here, and create more job opportunities for our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we should adapt to changes. No industry

can prosper forever and in every industry, there will  be

ups  and downs. Prior to the 60s, Singapore's main output

was  in farming and agricultural produce. In the 60s  and

70s,  we  promoted industrialisation and concentrated  on

labour-intensive industries. In the 80s and 90s, we moved

towards  high  value-added industries which  paid  higher

wages,  and our people enjoyed better standard of living.

That  has resulted in a very high wage level in Singapore

today, where the labour cost is significantly higher than

the  other  countries in this region. I think  we  should

make  use  of this period of economic downturn to  change

the  mindset of our people.  In the meantime, we have  to

seek avenues for our businessmen to expand overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we should look into the field of education.

We  can promote our universities so that we can become  a

hub  for  higher  learning and cultural activities.   Our

educational standard is the envy of many countries in the

world.   I  think  our  NUS and NTU should  cooperate  to

provide  more opportunities for students to  study  here.

According  to  a report, the President of  the  Singapore

Management University, Mr Tan Chin Tiong, mentioned  that

it  would  cost a Singaporean some $70,000 to  $80,000  a

year  to  study  in  a university in the  United  States,

whereas  he  needs to pay just $6,000 if  he  studies  in

either  NUS or NTU in Singapore. At this time of economic

recession, we should encourage more Singaporeans to study

in  Singapore.   That would help to solve  the  financial

problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, attraction of foreign students. We should

develop  Singapore  into a hub for  higher  learning  and

attract  foreign students to study here. In this way,  we

can  earn more foreign exchange too.  Recently, I was  in

Ganzhou City, Jiangxi Province. I had the opportunity  to

speak to some high school  students there.  I asked  them

where they would like to go for further studies

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2703</b></font><br><br>

after  their  graduation. They named four destinations  - Canada,  United States, England and Singapore.  Singapore

has  a  very good brand that is well known overseas.   We

should  make use of this foundation to expand and improve

our   university   education.   We  should   seize   this

opportunity.   We  should not  wait.   I  think  for  our

economy  to  prosper, we should resume the  old  name  of

Nantah   for  our  NTU.    The  Nantah  spirit  is   very

important.   With the new President, Prof. Su Guaning  at

the helm, we should be able to make further progress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me turn to tourism. Tourism is a very

important  component of our economy.  The development  of

tourism   will  bring  more  business  for  the   hotels,

restaurants, transport and retail business. These are all

inter-linked   and   tourism  will   provide   more   job

opportunities  for  Singaporeans.  The Government  should

try  to  establish more tourist attractions in Singapore,

make  use of our surrounding environment and improve  the

service quality of our workers in the tourism industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, with this announcement of CPF cut, some

people  will  naturally be worried.  Now,  the  repayment

period for HDB loan is for only 30 years, and the lessees

have  a  rather short repayment period for  the  mortgage

loan  they  took.  I  think we should grant  them  longer

repayment  period, say, 35 or even 40 years.   With  this

downturn, many HDB lessees could not service the loan for

their  present flats.  Many of them wish to downgrade  to

smaller flats.   The HDB should consider building more 3-room flats to satisfy their needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned by the Prime Minister just now, the 3%

cut  in  CPF  amounts  to a hefty $1.3  billion  for  the

employers  in Singapore. If we convert this to  Renminbi,

it  amounts  to five Renminbi for every one  of  the  1.3

billion  people in China. This is indeed a  huge  sum  of

money.   Those  companies which are doing  well,  the  3%

saving  in the employer's CPF contribution is a windfall.

They should make full use

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2704</b></font><br><br>

of these windfall savings  to help their workers.  So,  I

suggest  that  those companies which are  making  profits

should  set  aside at least 1% as a training  or  welfare

fund for the workers.  This would enable  the workers  to

share the windfall.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, we should change the work attitude of our

workers  so  that  they  can  keep  up  with  the  times.

According to the Ministry of Manpower, some companies are

still having difficulty recruiting workers.  For example,

now  there are about 4,600 jobs where there is no  taker.

Yet,  we have 80,000 people who are unemployed.  I  think

we  should  change the attitude of our workers.   In  any

job,  there is always dignity and professionalism in  it.

Nowadays, there is still a good number of jobs which  are

shunned  by  Singaporean  workers.   As  a  result,   the

companies have no choice but to employ  foreign  workers.

For  example,  more  than  30% of  our  bus  drivers  are

foreigners.  Most of the Town Councils' conservancy works

are  also taken up by foreign workers too.  Even  in  the

hawker centres and factories, it is the same. So, I think

our workers should be more realistic.  They should enrich

themselves  and  make  some  compromises  and   be   more

flexible.   Only  then  can they survive  in  this  ever-changing environment and be self-reliant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote an example. When I completed my

secondary  school, I wanted to go to the  university.   I

was  worried that my family could not support me  for  my

university  education.  So, I worked in a provision  shop

in  Taman  Jurong to earn some money before I joined  the

university.  While in the university, I spent my vacation

working  in a plywood factory. My employer told  me  that

the  only  vacancy was in the sawmill which was the  most

dirty  and  dusty part of the factory, and I  had  to  do

night  shift.  I  took the job.  My nightshift  was  from

<br>11.00 pm to 7.00 am. The proprietor of the plywood

factory was a Taiwanese.  He was in the habit of visiting

the  factory in the middle of the night to check  if  the

workers  were working.  At that time, I was a  young  man

who needed the money desperately, I dared not play truant

and was always working. The proprietor saw that I was

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2705</b></font><br><br>

a  conscientious   worker and was also an  undergraduate.

He  recognised my efforts and promoted me to be a quality

inspector, and my wages were raised from $2.50  to  $3.50

an hour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if you are prepared to work hard and earn our

keeps,  there  is no need to feel ashamed. As  the  Prime

Minister said, we would not die when we lose face.  It is

only when we cannot breathe that we will die.  So, when a

job  is  given to us, we should take it.  We  should  not

think  that  it is a lowly job and refuse   to  take  it.

Every  job is sacred, so long as it is a good and  proper

job.   This  is  what  we call the "Nantah  spirit",  the

spirit of self-reliance.
