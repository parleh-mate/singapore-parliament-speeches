<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>CLOB SHARES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

whether the equivalent volume of $229 billion worth of Malaysian

equities  traded  on CLOB International quoted  in  a  Malaysian

White Paper will go to the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange now  that

there is no CLOB International and whether there will be greater

liquidity for Singapore equities traded on the Stock Exchange of

Singapore in the absence of CLOB International.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

whether  he  will  give an update on the status of  negotiations

with  the  Malaysian government on the US$2.6 billion  worth  of

frozen Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) shares.



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, with your permission, I will take the  first  two

Questions together.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Heng Chiang Meng has asked whether

past investor interest in Clob Malaysian shares would now go  to

the  KL  Stock  Exchange, since Malaysian shares are  no  longer

traded  on Clob; or whether this investor interest will  migrate

to the SES.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retail investors actively traded Clob Malaysian shares for

two  main reasons.  Firstly, historically close ties between the

two countries gave Singapore retail investors a keen interest in

Malaysian   companies.   They  wanted  to  invest  in  Malaysian

companies  even after the KLSE and the SES parted ways  in  1973

and  Malaysian counters were delisted from the SES in 1990.  And

secondly,  Clob  made  it  much more  convenient  for  Singapore

investors  to  buy  Malaysian  shares.   Investors  here   could

transact  in S$ without being exposed to foreign currency  risk;

and  they  could deal through Singapore brokers, with whom  they

were more familiar.  This was why Clob was successful.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1545</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the cessation of the trading of Malaysian shares on

Clob in September 1998, retail investor interest has shifted  to

Singapore shares listed on the SES.  This can be seen  from  the

increase  in  the turnover on SES.  From October 1998  to  March

1999, SES recorded an average monthly turnover of S$9.8 billion.

This  figure,  without  Clob trading, is  63%  higher  than  the

average of S$6.0 billion per month transacted in the same shares

during  the  8-month period (from January 1998 to  August  1998)

before  Clob  ceased  trading in Malaysian counters.   The  main

reason  is loss of convenience with the closure of Clob and  the

imposition of capital controls in Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It therefore appears that investors on Clob have for now

shifted their interest from Malaysian to Singapore shares.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been accusations that Clob investors shorted

Malaysian shares, and were responsible for the collapse  of  the

Malaysian  stock market.  But very few institutions invested  in

Malaysian  shares  through Clob.  SES figures  confirm  that  an

overwhelming majority of Clob investors (in fact more than  98%)

were individuals rather than institutional investors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent comprehensive analysis by the Singapore Business

Times, based on data obtained from SES, conclusively refuted the

charge that Clob caused the decline in the KL Stock Exchange.  I

have  circulated the full BT analysis to Members.  You can  find

it on your seats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BT found no evidence of significant short-selling on Clob.

Judging  by  share buy-ins by SES, short-selling of Clob  shares

had been negligible.  BT also analysed trading data on the three

days  each year which showed the largest falls in the KLCI,  for

the last five years. It found few Clob counters among the top 30

losing  stocks on those days.  Further, turnover in  these  Clob

counters was much lower than the corresponding turnover

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1546</b></font><br><br>

on  the  KLSE - generally less than 5% of KLSE turnover for  the

same  counters.   This is hardly the picture of  rampant  short-selling on Clob.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BT studied more closely the period from the end of 1996,

before  the  Asian crisis, up to 31st August 1998,  just  before

Malaysia  imposed capital controls.  Mr Speaker, Sir, with  your

permission,  I will ask the Clerk to distribute a chart  showing

how  the KL stock index as well as Clob investors' shareholdings

move  during  this  period.  [Copies of chart (Cols.  1665-1666)

distributed to hon. Members.]  Members will see from  the  chart

that  over  this period Clob holdings of Malaysian  shares  rose

steadily,  even as the KL Composite Index declined  continuously

and  steeply  together with other regional stock  indices.   The

KLCI  lost  three quarters of its value, falling from  1,238  on

31st  December  1996  to  302 by 31st  August  1998.   But  Clob

investors doubled their holdings of Malaysian shares,  from  5.7

billion  on  31st December 1996 to 11.7 billion on  31st  August

1998.   This  is  counting the total number  of  shares.   Their

holdings  increased  steadily quarter by  quarter,  despite  the

decline  of  the KLCI and the deepening economic crisis  in  the

region  and  in Malaysia. The sell-down of Malaysian shares  did

not take place in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the recent rally in the Malaysian market, at

today's  prices  many  Clob investors  are  sitting  on  losses.

Whether  they  decide to sell, hold or buy more  shares  on  the

Malaysian  stock market once their trading accounts  are  opened

will depend on their assessment of the value of their shares and

of the rules governing their trades.

<br><br><i>Update on the Clob Issue</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay Beng Chuan has asked for an update on the frozen

Clob  shares.  I last briefed Parliament on the status  of  Clob

shares  during  the  Committee of Supply  in  March  this  year.

Yesterday,  SES issued a press statement setting out the  events

leading to the signing of the Agreement,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1547</b></font><br><br>

and  the  background to the cash offer by Effective Capital  Sdn

Bhd  to  buy over Clob shares from investors.  I have circulated

copies of the SES statement to Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that SES' Central Depository Pte Ltd

(CDP)  signed  an  agreement in September  last  year  with  the

Malaysian Securities Clearing Automated Network Services Sdn Bhd

(SCANS), a subsidiary of KLSE.  The agreement provided  for  the

migration  of  all  Clob  shares to  investors'  own  securities

accounts  with the Malaysian Central Depository (MCD), based  on

procedures  determined and announced by the KLSE.   As  the  SES

statement explained, the SES and CDP have done what is  expected

of  them  under  the Agreement.  But till today  SCANS  has  not

fulfilled  its  part of the agreement, which would  enable  Clob

investors to have their shares in their own securities  accounts

and to trade their shares on the KLSE.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, certain "private sector" solutions have

been   proposed.   One  is  by  Mr  Akbar  Khan,  a  Singaporean

businessman  resident  in Malaysia.  He has  formed  a  company,

Effective  Capital Sdn Bhd, which on 30th April 1999 offered  to

buy Clob shares from investors for cash.  The prices offered are

on  average 58% lower than the prices quoted on the KLSE  as  at

30th April.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have also been media reports of other possible

offers,  including an offer to Clob investors  of  shares  in  a

closed-end investment fund, to be listed on the KLSE, and  which

will gradually divest the shares.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SES statement yesterday gave details of its discussions

with Mr Khan on his offer. This was to inform Clob investors  of

the  background  to Mr Khan's proposal, and of SES'  discussions

with  Mr  Khan and his Singapore lawyer, Mr Sat Pal  Khattar  of

Khattar Wong and Partners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SES has maintained throughout that "private sector"

offers  by  Mr Khan or any other party cannot and do not  affect

CDP's Agreement with SCANS.  This is the advice of SES' lawyers,

who have also consulted Queen's Counsel on the offer.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1548</b></font><br><br>



The  lawyers have also advised the SES that Clob investors were,

and  remain, legal owners of their shares.  The Agreement signed

by  SCANS recognises that Clob shares have the same legal rights

as the same classes of shares listed on the KLSE, and gives full

effect to these legal rights.  Indeed Clob shares have continued

to receive dividends and offers for rights issues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SES has therefore insisted on clear and reasonable

arrangements being made for Clob investors who do not accept any

private  offers.  They should have their shares  transferred  to

their own accounts with the MCD and be allowed to trade them  on

the KLSE.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Khan's offer, which is a cash offer for Malaysian

securities, does not need to comply with regulatory requirements

in  Singapore.   However,  in view of  the  considerable  public

interest, the SES has pointed out where the offer documents fall

short of generally accepted international standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SES' lawyers have advised that the CDP has a duty to

disseminate  details of any offers made to Clob  investors,  and

convey  acceptances  of the offers to the  offerors.   CDP  will

carry  out this obligation to inform Clob investors and  collect

their  responses to Mr Khan's offer.  In so doing,  neither  SES

nor   CDP   will  be  sponsoring,  sanctioning  or  making   any

recommendation  to  Clob investors as to whether  to  accept  or

reject the offer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clob investors should carefully study the offer by Mr Khan,

before  deciding  for themselves whether to take  it  up.   They

should consider all relevant factors, including the prices  that

Effective Capital has offered for their shares.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clob investors who do not wish to sell their shares on the

terms  offered  by  Mr Khan, or to accept any  other  subsequent

offers,  do not have to do so.  Their legal ownership  of  their

Clob shares is not in issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SES will continue to press the KLSE and SCANS to meet

their obligations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1549</b></font><br><br>



under  the  migration  Agreement.  As the SES  has  stated,  the

respective  obligations of the two parties are  not  matters  of

opinion, but a legal question which can be determined.  SES  has

obtained  legal  advice that the agreement is a legally  binding

and enforceable contract.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also taken up the Clob issue with the

Malaysian Government at the political level.  Prime Minister Goh

Chok  Tong  discussed  the Clob issue  with  Prime  Minister  Dr

Mahathir at a bilateral meeting in Hanoi in December last  year.

Both  PM  Goh and Dr Mahathir subsequently told the  press  that

Clob  would be included in the package of outstanding  bilateral

issues to be discussed and resolved by the two Governments.   Dr

Mahathir  said  at a press conference in Hanoi on 17th  December

1998, and I quote: "I thought that it is best that we resolve as

a package, including of course the problem of CPF and Clob."  Dr

Mahathir also said, and again I quote: "We would rather like  to

settle the whole thing as a package so that the water supply  is

linked to the problem of the railway, CIQ, CLOB and CPF".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Malaysian Government subsequently changed its

stand.   On  13th  March 1999, Reuters quoted Malaysian  Finance

Minister  Tun  Daim  Zainuddin saying that  discussions  between

Singapore and Malaysia on the Clob issue should be left  to  the

KLSE  and  SES,  and were not part of the overall  "package"  of

issues  to be discussed at the government level.  Reuters quoted

Tun  Daim: "I've always maintained it's between KLSE and SES.  .

As far as I know, it is not part of the package; if they want to

include  it  in  the  package, it is up  to  the  parties,  both

governments."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysian and Singaporean senior officials have met twice

this  year  on 11th March and on 21st and 22nd April to  discuss

the  proposed  package  deal.  At both meetings,  the  Malaysian

delegation asked that Clob be removed from the agenda as it  was

not a Government-to-Government issue.  Singapore's response



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1550</b></font><br><br>



on  both  occasions  was that the Clob issue should  not  remain

outstanding when the package is finally resolved.  This  remains

Singapore's stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government and SES will make every effort to resolve

the  Clob  issue  expeditiously.  Clob investors  have  provided

support  for  Malaysian shares over the  years,  even  when  the

market was declining over the two years before the imposition of

capital  controls.   It is not to anyone's  advantage  for  Clob

investors to feel that they are being treated unfairly,  or  for

the international markets to perceive so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, I have a number of

supplementary questions for the Deputy Prime Minister.  (1)  May

I  ask the Deputy Prime Minister, since the statistics from Clob

show a diametrically opposite picture from that in the Malaysian

White Paper, whether SES or even the Government would inform the

Malaysian   government  of  these  statistics   through   normal

channels?  (2) May I also ask the Deputy Prime Minister  whether

the issue of frozen Clob Malaysian shares could be brought up to

international   organisations  such   as   WTO   or   even   the

International Court of Justice for resolution since it was clear

that  the  trading  of Malaysian shares on Clob  was  all  along

completely legal and the freeze was because the MCD had  changed

its  rules regarding nominee shareholdings on 31st August  1998,

coupled  with  SCANS  not  fulfilling its  legal  obligation  of

transferring the shares to individual accounts with MCD?  (3)  I

would  also  like  to ask him why CDP, as the  umbrella  nominee

holder for Clob Malaysian shares, has not taken any legal action

on this issue so far?  (4) Since any private sector party is not

precluded from making an offer for Clob Malaysian shares,  could

an organisation such as GIC or Temasek make an offer to purchase

the  shares at reasonable prices?  In this respect, why  is  SES

even  considering the offer from an individual such as Mr  Akbar

Khan?   Who  is he?  Does this mean that any future  offers  for

Clob  shares by any individual, regardless of the background  or

standing,  will  also  receive the same consideration  from  the

Stock Exchange of Singapore?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1551</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we will of course

extend copies of the analysis from the Business Times as well as

the  statistics I have given to Members today and the  graph  to

the  Malaysian  authorities.  We hope they would be  helpful  to

them when studying the problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for bringing the matter to the World Trade Organisation

or  the International Court of Justice, this is not a matter  in

the  purview  of  the WTO, nor is it a treaty  between  the  two

countries, because the agreement was signed between SCANS on the

Malaysian  side and CDP on the Singapore side.  But  as  I  have

informed  Members, we are taking legal advice, including  advice

from  QC,  on our rights in this matter.  That also answers  the

question on legal action.  We are taking advice on our rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could GIC or Temasek offer to buy? Mr Speaker, Sir, I

think  that  would  be  very  dangerous.   Individual  investors

invested  on  Clob  on their own.  This was  over  the  counter.

These  were not shares which were listed on the Singapore  Stock

Exchange.  They were shares listed elsewhere and not subject  to

our   disclosure   rules  or  corporate  governance   standards.

Investors  went in hoping to make a good return.  There  was  no

arrangement  that  if  they made a good return,  the  Government

would  collect  a small percentage, and if they went  down,  the

Government  would bear some of the loss.  So for the  Government

to  go in with GIC or Temasek to offer to buy these shares  from

Singaporeans,   I  think,  would  be  a  very,  very   dangerous

precedent.    The   whole  idea  that  individuals   must   take

responsibility for their investment and must consider  carefully

and decide and take the rough and the smooth is there.  What the

Government can do in this circumstance, which has arisen, is  to

take up with the Malaysian authorities to try and get the matter

resolved and that, as I have explained to Members, we are in the

process of doing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does the SES consider Mr Akbar Khan's offer? Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  short answer is  that  we  have  reason  to

believe, and we satisfied ourselves, that Mr Akbar

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1552</b></font><br><br>

Khan   was   acting  with  the  endorsement  of  the   Malaysian

authorities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have  two supplementary questions for the DPM.  Firstly,  I  see

that  we cannot go to WTO.  But could we explore the possibility

of  arbitration in a third country?  Secondly, would SES demand,

and  I  use  the word "demand", MCD to comply with the agreement

reached  on  18th September between SES and KLSE  SCANS  on  the

question  of  migration of Clob shares, especially as  the  Clob

shares have been transferred to an omnibus account?



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we will explore all

possibilities and take QC's advice as to what our rights are and

how they can be given effect.  The QC's advice is that this is a

legally binding enforceable agreement and that, in fact, we  are

entitled to specific performance from the other party.   How  to

get  that  done, whether arbitration or not, these  are  matters

which I leave to the lawyers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for demanding that MCD complies, indeed that is what we

have been raising with MCD.  It is not  a matter of raising  our

voices.  It is a matter of getting rights recognised.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> The graph which the

Deputy Prime Minister has provided shows conclusively that there

was no dumping of Malaysian shares on Clob.  I presume it is the

volume  of  shares.  I have two questions in order to  make  the

picture  complete.  The first question is the volume  of  shares

that  he has provided on this graph.  What is the percentage  of

this volume compared to the volume of those respective shares on

the  KLSE?  Is it a large volume?  Or is it a small volume?  Can

significant movements on the Clob really affect Malaysian  stock

prices that much?  The second question I have is that the  graph

and the details which have been provided here show, for example,

the  increase  in  the volume of Clob shares.   What  about  the

statistics  on short selling as such?  Are there any  statistics

on the volume and value of short selling?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1553</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not have the

figures  on  what percentage the Clob shares accounted  for  the

corresponding  total  number of shares in  these  companies.   I

believe it would be small, probably around a quarter.  But I  am

hazarding a guess.  Most of the trading with Malaysia and KL and

nearly  all  of  the institutional investors, who  are  the  big

players, invested in KL rather than in Clob.  Clob was providing

a facility for Singaporean investors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the volume of short selling, as I said in my reply,

it  was small.  We do not have direct numbers for this.  What we

have are the figures for share buy-ins because when somebody  is

short  and  unable  to  recover his position  by  the  time  the

delivery is due, then the Exchange will go in and buy-in on  his

behalf  in order to meet his obligations.  The volume of buy-ins

on  Clob  has been very low and, therefore, we believe that  the

volume of shorting has been very low.  The fact is that overall,

Clob  shareholders have increased their total holding of shares.

Each  time,  the stock market fell, they bought into  a  falling

market.   Over two years, it shows that overall, they  were  not

dumping  Malaysian  shares.  They were  investing  in  Malaysian

shares and they doubled their holdings in two years.



<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> It seems that from this

incident,  Singaporeans  are  being  singled  out  and   treated

differently from other investors in other countries.  I have two

questions.  Firstly, are there any other investments other  than

the Clob shares that have been affected by the controls that the

Malaysian  government has placed specifically for  Singaporeans?

For  example, I recall that we have some ringgit holdings.  What

has  happened to them?  Secondly, is there any message from  the

Government to Singaporeans regarding investing in the  Malaysian

market  in the future?  Even if he invests directly in the  KLSE

today, will he be treated differently again in the future?



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, other investments in

Malaysia would of course be affected by the capital controls,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1554</b></font><br><br>



in terms of movements of float funds and withdrawal of funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the ringgit holdings, I do not have the latest

position.   But I understand that they have been converted  into

commercial  deposits and have gradually been  withdrawn  over  a

period  of  time in a way which has not caused a disturbance  in

the market, and which the Malaysian authorities were aware of.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether other investments in Malaysia now will be

affected by future uncertainties, I am in no position to  answer

that question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House endorses the Vision for Singapore in the

21st  century  as  set  out in the report of  the  Singapore  21

Committee  "Singapore  21: Together, We  Make  The  Difference",

contained   in  Paper  Misc.  2  of  1999,  as  the  basis   for

strengthening  the  heartware  of  Singapore  and  meeting   the

aspirations of Singaporeans.". - [Minister for Education].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br>12.55 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Cyrille Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cyrille Tan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish

to  commend  the  Minister and his team  for  an  excellent  S21

Report.  Many Members of this House have debated extensively  on

the  Report.   I will focus my speech on the "Opportunities  for

All".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Report on "Opportunities for All", it was

mentioned  that  as a society Singaporeans must  give  a  second

chance  to those who want to try again, and Singaporeans of  all

ages  will always have  opportunities to upgrade and renew their

knowledge and skills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC has always subscribed to this principle. Through

various schemes, we have been encouraging our workers to upgrade

their  skills  and  be  relevant to the workplace  and  society.

Examples are the Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP), the NTUC-Education  and  Training Fund and other funding  schemes.   Many

workers  have  taken opportunities available to  them  and  have

benefited from the various schemes, getting for themselves trade

certificates that are recognised nationwide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, while the NTUC, together with the Government, is

stressing  the  need  to  give the lower income  Singaporeans  a

second  chance, there are still many cases of older Singaporeans

who  have  been denied such chances when it comes to  a  crunch.

Age  seems to be the main determining factor of entry into  many

companies,  for  example, those from the wafer  fabrication  and

semi-conductor industries.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1556</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of how skilful, flexible and adaptable an

elderly  Singaporean  may  be, he may  still  have  very  little

opportunities   in   contributing  in  such   companies.    Many

recruiting   companies  have  specifically  asked  for   younger

workers,  even  though  there are older  workers  with  relevant

skills.   As  a result, such good paying jobs go mainly  to  the

younger  job seekers.  We must not forget that our older workers

are willing and ready to try again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to give a scenario which is very common in

Singapore,  particularly  now when restructuring  exercises  are

conducted by companies adversely affected by the recent economic

downturn.   A  skilled  worker in the electronics  industry  was

retrenched  at  the  age  of  45.   Probably,  he  is  the  sole

breadwinner of the family.  He has the necessary skills and even

the certificates.  However, in job fairs conducted by recruiting

companies, he is told, although he has what it takes to fit into

some  of  the  recruiting companies, that they are  looking  for

young  individuals who are below the age of 40.  Sad, but  true,

that  mid-career  workers  who are retrenched  are  facing  such

problems.  Does it mean that if I am a skilled worker, but  over

40  years old, and retrenched, I will have to settle for a  low-paying  cleaner's job, a packer's job, something that  will  not

tap into the knowledge and skills that I had acquired over my 20

years of working life?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are facing a growing pool of older workers, and we, as a

nation, must not see that as a problem, but to capitalise on  it

as  an  opportunity.   Such  older  workers  have  a  wealth  of

knowledge  and  skills that the nation can tap  on,  instead  of

facing premature redundancy in society.  Statistics show that in

the electronics industry, 61.2% of those still looking for a job

said that they cannot meet with the minimum age requirement  set

by recruiting companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore must remain committed to developing the full

potentials  of  its  citizens,  as  stated  in  the  report   on

"Opportunities for All".  I think it is time for us  to  examine

the  next  step.   And  after realising the  potentials  of  our

citizens, through



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1557</b></font><br><br>



training and upgrading, how can Singapore, as a nation, make use

of  these  human  resources to further push the country  another

step ahead?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, human resource personnel should not be

allowed to make a mockery of our plans for life-long learning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

before I go into the subject matter of this debate, let me  take

this  opportunity  to  give my response  on  the  issue  of  SAP

schools.   This  issue  has been discussed  on  many  occasions.

However, I think the more important thing is whether or  not  we

could  have a feasible policy.  Some people suggested  that  the

SAP  schools  and the other schools could become sister  schools

where  some  common activities can be carried out.   However,  I

feel that even if it is done in this way, some people will still

feel  that  it is not enough.  In my view, a more direct  method

would  be like what Senior Minister proposed not long ago,  that

is, to allow some top students from the minority groups to study

in the SAP schools, that is to say, to break through the present

situation in which only Chinese students are studying in the SAP

schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support such a proposal because this would eliminate some

of  the  doubts  which people have on the SAP  schools.   By  so

doing,  we would allow the top students from the various  ethnic

groups  more  options to study in a number of top schools  other

than  the handful of traditional "branded" schools such  as  the

Raffles  Institution, etc. This would not  affect  the  original

mission of the SAP school.s.  It is a positive development.   It

is  an  enlargement of the roles of the SAP schools.  As in  the

days  of the old Nanyang University (Nantah) which also had  the

Malay  Studies Department, it did not affect the characteristics

of  Nantah at that time.  So I feel SAP schools today  would  be

willing to accept this proposal and this is perhaps the time for

the minority ethnic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1558</b></font><br><br>



groups  to indicate their willingness to participate in  such  a

proposal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would like to speak on the Singapore 21 report and

to  give  my personal views on it. We can be said to be  at  the

threshold of the 21st century.  As we are stepping into the 21st

century,  this  Singapore 21 report has  highlighted  two  major

dilemmas that we will be facing.  First, the dilemma inherent in

our social structure and the other is the dilemma that will come

with  our  globalisation  effort to  develop  Singapore  into  a

cosmopolitan  city.   However, both these dilemmas  concern  one

very  basic  question, that is, how to enhance  our  social  and

national cohesion and to reduce the centrifugal force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Prime Minister Goh mentioned the basic conflict

in  our  social  structure, that is, the tension or  perhaps  we

could  say the pulling force in our multi-racial society.   This

is an inherent conflict.  Secondly, while we are globalising and

developing  Singapore into a global city, on the  one  hand,  we

have  to  encourage our people to venture overseas and,  on  the

other  hand, we spare no efforts to attract foreign  talents  to

come  here.   This has actually created a conflict  between  the

centrifugal  force  and centripetal force.   To  the  bona  fide

Singaporeans,  those who were born and bred here,  they  have  a

very  special  passion  for Singapore.  This  was  stated  in  a

sentence  from  the  poem entitled Ascending the  Tower  by  the

famous      poet      of      the      Tang      Dynasty,      "

",  Wang Chan, which translated loosely means, whether a  person

is  doing well or not, he would have a special emotional feeling

for  the land on which he was born and bred.  Therefore, we  can

see that many of our Singaporeans who were posted overseas would

become  very  homesick during the festive seasons.   They  would

miss  the  dear ones in Singapore, and also from time  to  time,

they  will  miss  the  food we have in  our  hawker  centres  in

Singapore.   How  do we enhance this feeling of Singaporeans  so

that  they can feel passionately about Singapore, even when they

are overseas?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1559</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the very naturally nurtured feelings for those

who  were  born  and  bred in Singapore, I feel  that  the  most

important  thing is that we have to make everyone feel  that  he

loves  his  country and the country loves him.  Everyone  should

feel  that  he  has a share in this country.   On  the  national

level, we have this Home Ownership Scheme.  That is a very  good

example  of  how to make everybody feel that he has a  share  in

this  nation.  National service has also reminded every  citizen

that  he  has  a  share in this nation and that is  why  we  say

everyone has a responsibility in the destiny of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to enhance our people's sense of belonging and

ownership, I feel that the Government should enlarge this policy

to reach to the people, particularly in the business sector.  We

should  encourage  more companies to have this "Employee  Shares

Ownership" scheme, that is to say, let the employees own  shares

in  the  company  they work for.  Nowadays, some  companies  are

already  implementing this system.  Every employee, irrespective

of  the position in that company, would have some shares in  the

company.   So  they are both employees and shareholders  of  the

company.   This  would naturally give them a stronger  sense  of

belonging  for the company.  If this company has  only  a  small

minority  of senior officers owning shares in the company  while

the vast majority of the employees have none, and you want these

employees  to  develop a sense of belonging to  the  company,  I

think this would be a very difficult task.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is like an army going to war, and after the war, all the

credits  go  to the general, and his soldiers who  risked  their

lives  fighting  in the frontline were given no  recognition  at

all.   How  are  we  going  to cultivate  in  them  a  sense  of

belonging, and I am sure that the morale will be very  low  too.

However,  to  make a person cultivate his sense of belonging  to

his  country,  I  think it concerns not only  the  materialistic

aspect.   Spiritual and cultural factors are equally  important.

In  this  aspect, I must emphasise the importance of a  cultural

sense  of  identity.   As a multi-racial society,  we  must  pay

particular



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1560</b></font><br><br>



attention  to  the sense of cultural belonging  of  the  various

races, that is, to allow all the communities to feel comfortable

in  their own cultural environment.  Just as what Prime Minister

Goh  Chok Tong said in this House yesterday, Singapore is not  a

nation  yet.  Therefore, we have to work harder in   forging   a

national  identity  to promote better unity  among  the  various

races  and  to establish in them a sense of loyalty towards  our

nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, while we are seeking a common identity, we should

also  allow  diversities to exist.  We should allow the  various

races  to preserve their own cultural traditions.  This  is,  in

fact,  our  current policy.  Culture is the spiritual pillar  of

the  individuals.  That a person has a strong  passion  for  his

country,  to  a  large extent, is due to the foundation  of  his

cultural identity.  A cultural sense of belonging would  enhance

his  feelings and passion for the land on which he  lives.   Any

differences  in the various cultures would undermine  our  unity

and it is something that we could not completely eliminate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we should do is to try and forge better consensus and

to have a better sense of belonging.  What I want to say is that

the  policy  which  is implemented by our Government,  that  is,

obtaining  consensus while maintaining diversity, is  a  correct

policy.  When we are moving towards the 21st century, we  should

try  and strengthen this policy and not to weaken it.  It is not

feasible to try and have a homogenous society because each  race

and  community  will treasure and defend its  existing  culture,

habits, traditions, customs, language and religious beliefs.  To

the  Chinese  community,  which is the  majority  here,  or  the

minorities such as the Malays or Indians, it is the  same.   For

example,  our Malay brothers have this saying, biar  mati  anak,

jangan  mati adat.  Cultural tradition is actually the  soul  of

the  tribes,  or we could call it the tribal soul.   They  value

this tribal soul more than their children. Multi-culturalism  is

actually an important component part of the Singapore heartware.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1561</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that in our multi-cultural social environment, this

is  also  a  very  important factor to attract foreign  talents.

Because I discover that many permanent residents or new citizens

from  other  countries  who come and settle  down  in  Singapore

actually do not come directly from their native countries.  Many

of  them have actually gone to countries which they believed  to

be  ideal  societies  such as the United States  of  America  or

Europe.   After  staying  there for  some  time,  they  came  to

Singapore  and eventually decided to settle down permanently  in

Singapore.    Why?    It  is  because  of  this   multi-cultural

environment which makes them feel very comfortable and at home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some of the activities or gatherings organised by the

Residents'  Committees  and  at the  new  citizens'  oath-taking

ceremony  organised  by  the  Immigration  Department,  I  would

normally take the opportunity to ask these new citizens why they

have decided to migrate to Singapore.  Generally, they will tell

me that they perceive that in Singapore they would receive equal

treatment and equal opportunity.   Most of them are bilingual in

their  mother  tongue as well as English.  In our multi-cultural

environment, they feel at home and very comfortable.  It is very

easy  for  them to merge into our society here.   On  the  other

hand, in other countries, they may be able to earn a living, but

they  could  not help having this feeling of being  second-class

citizens.  This type of personal experience was mentioned by  Dr

Lee Tsao Yuan yesterday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 3rd May 1999, there was a report by the Straits Times

entitled  "Racial Tone to US Handling of Spy  Story".   In  this

article, it mentioned that just because of one isolated incident

where  a  Chinese  scientist was alleged to  have  stolen  their

secret and passed it to China, now everyone in the United States

is  saying that all the Asian migrants, particularly the Chinese

in  the US and those who have obtained US citizenship, are spies

from  China and their loyalty for the United States is in doubt.

I believe that many foreign talents would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1562</b></font><br><br>



come  to  Singapore  from  the United  States  or  the  European

countries not without a reason.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on our present policy of forging an

identity while maintaining diversity, I must reiterate that this

is  a  correct  policy.   When we are moving  towards  the  21st

century,  what  we  need  to do is to  strengthen  this  policy.

However, we cannot deny that, as I said just now, every race and

every  nationality would have its own identity, and there  is  a

certain  conflict  between the existing "tribal  soul"  and  the

"national soul" that we want to establish.  As we cannot  use  a

pressure cooker or a big melting pot to melt all the races  into

one,  the conflict between the tribal soul and the national soul

would take a long time to be amalgamated.  What we need to do is

to maintain the present situation of harmonious living among our

races.    We   have   to   enhance  the  communication,   mutual

understanding  and unity among the various races.   That  is  to

say, our present policy must be maintained and sustained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I feel that we need to have a very strong

Government  to  maintain  such a  pluralistic  policy.   In  our

present  situation of harmonious living among the  races,  to  a

large  extent, credit must be given to our strong Government  in

giving  equal treatment to all the various races, and to protect

the  interests of the minority groups.  In the past few decades,

the  Government has been hitting hard at the racists  and  tried

its  best  to eliminate the conflicts among the races to  reduce

the  centrifugal force and to enhance the centripetal  force  to

promote  unity  among  the various races.   We  have  emphasised

participation  of  all citizens.  In such a  complicated  social

structure like ours, we need to have nothing short of  a  strong

Government.   Whether it is in the family or in  a  company,  we

need  to  have  very fair and strong parents and  management  to

avoid confusion.  I think it is the same for a country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we are moving into the 21st century, we need to

have  a consensus.  I believe the Singapore 21 Committee led  by

RAdm Teo held various discussion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1563</b></font><br><br>



panels  and dialogue sessions and in the process, the  consensus

has  been  forged.   This is definitely of  great  help  to  the

enhancement of the Singapore heartware and definitely beneficial

to our development in the next century.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng (Minister without Portfolio) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister without Portfolio (Mr Lim Boon Heng):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  a  Straits Times journalist, after  hearing  the

Prime Minister yesterday, wrote in her column this morning: "why

the  sobering  message?"  She reflected not only her  views  but

those  of  some of her colleagues as well.  This, after  what  I

thought  was  a  very  clear message from  the  Prime  Minister,

supplemented by personal accounts from other Members,  that  our

society  is  one with many fault lines.  These fault  lines  are

fundamentals as we continue with nation building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The journalist said that the Prime Minister did not give

examples to explain why he delivered his sobering message.  Yet,

I thought he gave many, from other parts of the world, to remind

us  that our fault lines can give way as disastrously.  At least

one  Member, Mr Zainul Abidin, gave the example of Malays in the

SAF as one indicator of our fault lines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, is there a gap between those above 50 years of age,

and  those  a  generation younger in  their  30s?   Have  we  so

succeeded  in blurring ethnic lines that the younger  generation

already  accepts race as a non-issue?  As a Backbencher  in  the

80s, I attended several clan functions.  For one who is English-educated, it meant hard work preparing to speak in Mandarin, and

there was always not enough time.  There was only one Lim in the

Backbench, me.  How I wished there were more, so that  the  load

could  be  shared.  At one of these functions, I said  I  wished

there were more Lims in Parliament.  I did not get to finish  my

sentence to express my sentiment, because I was drowned  out  by

the  applause!  All I could do after that was to meekly say that

I  wished  in future there would be more Lims.  And, again,  big

applause.   So,  it  taught  me that whilst  we  have  enshrined

equality of race, language



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1564</b></font><br><br>



and  religion as the cornerstone of our nation, we disregard the

fault lines at our peril.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, last year, as part of our May Day celebrations, we

put up a live TV programme.  As we did not have the money to put

up  separate programmes in the four languages, we insisted  that

TCS  8 agree that we have items in English, Tamil and Malay,  in

addition to Chinese.  Of course, everybody knows that TCS 8 is a

Chinese  channel.   We thought we were being  sensitive  to  the

minority  races  in  making sure that  it  was  a  multi-lingual

programme,  but we got a very negative reaction  from  a  Berita

Harian journalist!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we need a more recent example to remind us, it is the

emotion with which Members spoke in this House on the subject of

SAP schools and the nurturing of a Chinese elite.  If we use the

Prime  Minister's imagery of the four interlocking circles,  the

emotions  raised  over  SAP schools pose  us  a  very  pertinent

question: How much non-overlapping space will each circle  allow

the others?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should all be very pleased if the primordial forces the

Prime  Minister referred to have mutated to benign  forms,  like

spent  volcanoes.   But  the  Prime Minister  reminded  us  very

clearly  yesterday that dormant volcanoes can  erupt,  and  with

great  force.   This  is why we must set realistic  expectations

about  Singapore 21.  We must start with the correct  assessment

of what we are, and build from here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore 21 is about building a nation with hearts that

beat  as  one.   It means citizens feeling they belong  here  so

deeply  they  will defend it.  It is about developing  roots,  a

thick  web of roots, so that the tree will stand even  when  the

storm  is fierce.  What does this mean in practical terms?   Our

roots  are  our  families, our friends,  the  networks  we  form

through  churches,  mosques or temples,  the  networks  we  form

through  other community organisations, and the bonds we develop

through  friendship struck in school.  It is also about  getting

Singaporeans to feel they too have created a piece of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1565</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by any account, the S21 Committee has reached out to a

very large number of Singaporeans.  Yes, the Committee practised

"consultation"  and  distilled  what  6,000  Singaporeans   have

contributed into one document.  But there will be the balance of

the  3.1 million Singaporeans, who are not among the 6,000,  who

will  feel that they have not been consulted.  Indeed, Mr  Chiam

reflected this the day before yesterday, when he said his  party

had no part in it!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be some among the 6,000 who are left

dissatisfied  because their pet ideas are not  included  in  the

final document.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be expectations of greater consultation as part

of  public policy formulation.  So we have to understand what is

possible,  and what is not.  Those of us who work in  the  trade

unions  engage  union leaders and workers in  numerous  dialogue

sessions, as many as our diaries would permit us.  Yet we cannot

avoid the comment from time to time from some union leaders that

there was a lack of consultation!  So let us be quite clear that

consultation does not mean every citizen is to be consulted, and

that  every  point  each citizen brings  up  will  be  included,

because it is impossible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet every citizen wants to participate and feel part of

Singapore.  But participation does not only mean being  directly

consulted.  Participation also means doing things ourselves, for

our  benefit,  and  for  society.  I  think  this  is  far  more

important.  We have to create that sense among Singaporeans that

they  play  a  part actively in our society.   Never  mind  what

priorities  Government  may have, so long  as  we  are  able  to

contribute what we think is meaningful to ourselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a group of Singaporeans who participate in this

way,    through   community   groups   and   voluntary   welfare

organisations.  They go beyond discussing issues  and  expecting

Government to do something about it, to make things



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1566</b></font><br><br>



happen themselves.  And they do not wait to be invited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want something done, will we shake out of our

inertia,  and  do something about it?  The older  generation  of

Singaporeans  had no choice but to do things for themselves,  be

it  to  set up funds for the needy, or to build schools.   If  a

poorer  educated  group of Singaporeans could do  so,  there  is

absolutely no reason why a better educated group now cannot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It all depends on whether we are prepared to make the

effort.   Sir,  let me cite a simple example.   You  might  even

regard it as trivial.  26 of my primary one classmates meet once

a  year,  with our form teacher.  We are a real mixed  group  of

people  - workers, shopkeepers and one politician!  How  did  it

happen?   Was  it  started by the school principal,  or  by  the

teacher?   No,  we were brought together by three close  friends

from  the class.  They had met regularly every Sunday since they

left  school.  One day one of them thought it would  be  a  good

idea to organise a class get-together.  So from the names in  an

old  school magazine, they set about contacting the class.  They

called  up people with the same name in the telephone directory,

sometimes  getting scolded for their trouble!   There  are  more

than one person with the same name, and those with the name "Lim

Boon Heng" in the directory are not mine.  The three of them did

not  wait for others to act.  They took the initiative, and even

now  each year, they organise the get-together.  So my point is,

if  we feel strongly about something and are prepared to do  it,

we  can,  and we can make a difference, and we enjoy  doing  the

things that matter to us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I said developing roots also mean the bonds we develop

through  school.   Here, I believe that there  are  considerable

merits  in  the old school system, when a child can  study  from

primary  one  right through to `A' levels.  I went to  one  such

school.   Twelve  years  in the same school  must  surely  allow

stronger bonds to develop than a six, four or two years stay  in

different  schools.  And it is not just bonds of  friendship  of

students in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1567</b></font><br><br>



same  year, but inter-generational as well.  So should we review

our  systems  and do those things which would allow Singaporeans

themselves to develop such bonds?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I said the sense of belonging to Singapore means doing

things ourselves.  It depends on each of us.  And there are many

things  to  do.  If anyone is looking for ideas of what  to  get

involved in, let me point out one - the support system  for  the

elderly, in view of the ageing population.  It is an area  where

Government has not got itself too deeply involved as yet.  It is

an  excellent  area to be left for those who  want  to  see  the

development of a civil society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are already some practising the spirit of civil

society.  They are the grassroots organisations, the unions, the

co-operatives  and  the voluntary welfare organisations.   There

are  many who sacrifice a lot of time to do things for the  good

of others.  My definition of civil society may be different from

others.   Some  think civil society excludes government  or  the

establishment.   I  have no such qualms.  I believe  in  getting

things  done,  either by ourselves or with  Government  and  the

establishment.  If it helps to get things done by  working  with

Government,  I see no objection to it.  The satisfaction  is  in

getting things done, not in the exclusion of Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rooting Singaporeans also means getting Singaporeans to

feel  that  this is the land of opportunity.  Some  Singaporeans

migrate  because there are better or more exciting opportunities

elsewhere.  These are Singaporeans who apparently have the self-confidence to compete as foreign talent elsewhere.  On the other

hand,  we have Singaporeans - mostly descendants of migrants  or

foreign  talent  - who object to foreign talent competing  here.

If  we are to be a land of opportunity, we need the talent  mass

here  for it to happen.  So the vision of Singapore 21 means  we

Singaporeans  developing  the self-confidence  to  compete  with

foreign  talent on our own turf, absorbing foreign  talent,  and

moulding them into Singaporeans, and if not possible, pro-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1568</b></font><br><br>



Singaporeans.   It  is this critical mass of  talent  that  will

enlarge  that sphere of opportunity for our younger  generation.

If we are able to bring the best and brightest in the world like

a  magnet  here, then our own will be able to compete with  them

and derive the satisfaction of competing with the best.  Just as

some  of our top talent right now feel they want to compete with

the  world's best elsewhere.  So I think it is for us  to  bring

talent here to Singapore and not to exclude them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, I think, to me, it is quite clear that

the Prime Minister is right.  It will be a long road to S21, and

we  must  persevere  in  this effort,  for  our  good,  for  our

children's good, and for our grandchildren.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Bukit Timah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I would like to support the motion standing in the

name of RAdm Teo Chee Hean and the Singapore 21 report presented

by the Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned by Prime Minister Goh yesterday and many of my

colleagues  who  spoke before me, the basic  principle  of  this

report  is  how to cultivate in our people the sense of  loyalty

towards our nation.  That is on the basic foundation established

by  our  first  generation of leaders in Singapore.   They  have

taken  the  decision to build up Singapore on  this  foundation.

What  decisions will the second generation leaders and the third

generation leaders take?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the most important reminder to us is the pledge

that  is being taken by our students every morning at the  flag-raising ceremony.  Although this pledge was worded by our  first

generation leaders some 30 years ago, it is still relevant to us

now,  and I believe it will continue to be relevant in the  next

century.   The  pledge  reads: "We, the citizens  of  Singapore,

pledge  ourselves  as  one united people,  regardless  of  race,

language  or  religion, to build a democratic society  based  on

justice and equality so as to achieve happiness, prosperity  and

progress for our nation."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1569</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that at one political gathering, some people

commented  that  the survival of Singapore was  an  accident  in

history.   But  if  you  look at our  nation  building  and  our

survival,  it  can be said to be the result of a very  important

decision  taken by our leaders.  We live by this  decision.   We

treasure  this  will  to build up our nation.   It  is  not  the

responsibility of just the Government but the responsibility  of

everybody.  The second generation leaders and people, the  third

generation leaders and people, do they still maintain this  will

of survival?  So when we are talking about a multi-racial, multi-religious and multi-lingual society, the feasible way is  to  be

like  in the past, to exercise tolerance, mutual respect, mutual

understanding of one another's culture, to observe the festivals

and  the religious celebrations of the various races.  Just like

what  the  Prime Minister said yesterday and what my  colleague,

Minister Lim Boon Heng, and Mr Goh Choon Kang have said, we want

to forge a common identity while maintaining diversity.  This is

something  which  is  repeated  over  and  over  again  in   our

Parliamentary debate.  This is characteristic of Singapore.   We

can treat this as an advantage but it could also turn out to  be

a  disadvantage  to us.  It depends on how we want  to  continue

with our policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, we have many Parliamentarians from the

Commonwealth countries coming to Singapore for the CPA  meeting.

I  asked them what they felt was the characteristic in Singapore

that they found to be most attractive.   Almost everyone of them

told  me  that the most attractive feature of Singapore  is  our

multi-racial society.  They were amazed that our people who  are

dressed  in  the  Malay national dress, the Chinese  or  western

dresses   were  happily  chatting  away  at  a  common  function

together,  using English as the common language.   Yet,  in  the

next minute, they would turn and speak in their own languages to

people of their own community.  It is simply fantastic!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One expert who has been doing research on the history of

the various



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1570</b></font><br><br>



countries remarked that he  envied our bilingual policy.  We are

an  amalgamation  of  the strong points of  the  various  races.

Singapore  is one of the very few countries in the  world  where

the  people could have command of a first language and a  second

language  which  are of completely different backgrounds  -  our

Chinese,  English, Malay and Tamil.  Other people consider  this

as  some  great assets to us.  Then why do we want to give  them

up?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is that we must learn to forge a

common  identity  while maintaining diversity.   As  what  Prime

Minister  Goh  has  said, we must be able to  communicate  among

ourselves  in English and, at the same time, allow  the  various

communities to maintain their traditional cultures and  customs.

And  this  is an advantage and a unique characteristic  for  our

future  survival.  So in places where there are differences,  we

should have mutual tolerance and understanding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past 30 years, we have succeeded in maintaining

harmony.   I  feel that in the future, we could  still  maintain

this  racial harmony.  Now we have this S21 Report.  Many people

are  asking  why we need to discuss this Report.   Have  we  not

lived  harmoniously all this while?  But our leaders  have  very

good  foresight.  They feel that even in this peaceful time,  we

have  to be prepared for any crisis that may come in the future.

We must learn how to overcome all the problems and challenges in

our process of nation building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such major premises, I would like to deliberate on

some  details of the Report.  In the last few days, we have been

discussing  how  to  make  everyone identify  with  the  nation.

Because of the upgrading of their educational and skills  level,

and the globalisation of our economy, many people feel that they

are  now  citizens  of  the whole world.   This  is  inevitable.

According  to some preliminary survey, about 10% to 20%  of  our

people have such a feeling.  But the majority, the other 70%  to

80% of our people, are busy hovering around the basic things  in

life.   They  want  to have a stable job, a  stable  society,  a

pleasant living environment and a house



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1571</b></font><br><br>



or  flat of their own, and have no problem in their daily needs.

Perhaps,  some people will ask: why are they not concerned  with

this  S21  Vision?   Why  are  they  not  participating  in  the

discussion  on  this  issue?   It  is  not  that  they  are  not

concerned.   They are actually concerned with the  matter.   One

elderly  person told me  that when we are on board a plane,  our

life  is  committed to the pilot.  We would not  ask  the  pilot

whether he has been adequately trained, how many hours of flying

time  he has clocked, is he experienced, or is he confident that

he  would fly us all safely to our destination.  We do not  need

to  go  into  all  that.  So in our case, we  have  elected  our

leaders. They are the talented people.  They have the ability to

lead  us.   We  are in good hands.  It is not that  we  are  not

concerned.   But  we  feel confident, because  we  have  a  good

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have contacted the People's Association and the Ministry

of  Education to find out what are the feelings of  our  people,

the ordinary citizens of Singapore.  Singaporeans are very busy.

They  are  busy  attending classes, training,  busy  with  their

family  and a lot of things to do.  And the People's Association

reported to me that last year, for the RCs, the CCCs, the CCMCs,

ie,  the grassroots organisations, the participation rate was  7

million.   Of course, many people participated in more than  one

event.   On  the average, our Residents Committees conduct  some

200  to  300 activities in a year.  The Sports Council  told  me

that  the participation rate was 1.2 million in their activities

last year. The National Arts Council said its audience was about

700,000.  Besides, we have the activities organised by NTUC, the

welfare organisations and the religious organisations.  I  think

we could easily gain an entry in the Guinness World of Records.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can safely say that Singapore is a nation where the

people  are  actively participating in various community  works.

Just  now  Minister  Lim has also mentioned  that  participation

could  be  of different levels.  How do we make them  feel  that

their views and ideas are being reflected?  As I said just  now,

we must recognise that there is a limitation in every country,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1572</b></font><br><br>



particularly  in  our  country, taking  into  consideration  the

environment  around us.  Under such circumstances,  we  need  to

elect  some able people to lead us.  It is not possible for  the

people to be directly involved in all activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our children, irrespective of their background, are assured

of  places  in the school.  Every child will have a place  in  a

school.   There is no one in Singapore who has to stop schooling

because of financial difficulties.  I believe that our political

leaders  can make such a promise. There is no one who  has  been

denied  medical  treatment  because of  financial  difficulties.

There is no one who has no place, nowhere to go to, no place  to

stay  in.   I think if we conduct a thorough survey, we  can  be

found to be quite a successful nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to religion, not many countries in the world

can  have  a  Sikh temple, Chinese temples,  Catholic  churches,

mosques  or  Protestant churches, all within the radius  of  one

kilometre, as in our Waterloo Street area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone told me a very interesting observation. She

noticed  that a good number of believers who had gone to worship

at  the  Guan  Yin  Temple at Waterloo  Street,  passed  by  the

Krishnan Temple next door, and spontaneously took out some money

and  dropped it into the donation box outside.  This is  a  very

special  situation  in Singapore where our  people  respect  one

another, and respect the religions of the other races.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now I mentioned that in the schools, our students are

actively  participating  in  all  the  activities.   How  do  we

maintain  such  a  practice?   In  a  family,  my  Parliamentary

colleagues have already deliberated on it.  So I do not want  to

waste  time  repeating  it.  But I want to  mention  one  point.

Whenever we talk about the family, foreign talents, and an aging

population,  these are the key issues.  We are Singaporeans  and

if  we do not want foreign talents, how many babies have we  had

in  Singapore?  In the 70s, it was about 22 to 23  per  thousand

per year.  In 1997, it was about 15 per thousand per



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1573</b></font><br><br>



year.    According   to  a  Japanese  report  on   International

Statistics, this figure will be dropping every year.  The  birth

rate may drop to 12 per thousand per year.  Can we find a way to

break through?  We always talk about solving this problem of  an

aging population.  But have we given a thought to increasing our

birth  rate?  Now that most women are working, can we  encourage

them  to have more babies?  So this is one area we need to  look

into.   The  mindset of our people is such that many people  are

thinking  that they are citizens of the world.  But the majority

of  our people are still identified with Singapore.  Then,  when

we  have  foreign talents, how do we make them  settle  down  in

Singapore and  merge into our society?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The younger generation of Singaporeans must understand

this.  We have our limitations.  We have to be sensitive of  our

environment  and  we  are a small population.   If  we  want  to

maintain  our  position as one of the top ten countries  in  the

world in terms of economic development and standard of living, I

think  we  must  attract foreign talents and we must  feel  that

everyone  of us has a share and a part and role to play  in  our

society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to raise is that just now, when we

talked  about participation and we said that we are  a  closely-knit  society, one thing we can improve is that we  may  perhaps

set  up  or  establish a systematic "Emotion  Contact  Station".

While we are all busy, very naturally, we take our interpersonal

relationship for granted.  Many voluntary workers told  me  that

they  have  been volunteering for their whole life.  People  who

have  been donating blood for the past 20-30 years have  enjoyed

some  priority  when  they  go  for  medical  treatment  in  the

polyclinics or hospitals.  When they reach the age of 60,  their

blood  will not be accepted.  So at  61, they cease to be blood-donors,  and simultaneously all the special treatment previously

given to them will be suspended.  I would like to say that  when

we  want to cultivate the spirit of care and concern, it is  not

only in the families but also in the community.  Now all the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1574</b></font><br><br>



schools are built by the Government.  Our ordinary citizens  can

only   participate  in  the  school's  management   consultative

committee.   I  think  we  should give the  parents,  and  well-wishers, more roles to play in the management of the schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, a former Principal of the Chinese High School, Mr

Cheng  An  Lun  passed  away.  At his  funeral,  the  Old  Boys'

Association and the School Board arranged for his hearse to pass

through the school ground for the teachers and students  to  pay

their  last  respects, and many people in the educational  field

are  very touched by such an arrangement.  It is a very touching

show  of respect and recognition for someone who has contributed

enormously in the field of education during his lifetime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Government has rich financial resources. We could

well  afford  to  spend some money to recognise  those  who  had

contributed  to  our society in other fields,  such  as  sports,

arts,   music,   education,  etc.   Together   with   the   clan

associations,  Old  Boys' Associations and the  other  community

organisations,  we  can  show some form  of  respect,  care  and

concern  for former sportsmen, sportswomen, artists,  musicians,

etc.   Recently,  we read in the newspapers that some  sportsmen

who had in their heyday won honours for our nation, but in their

old age, they lived in isolation and poverty with nobody to look

after  them.  Perhaps the Sports Council could set up some  sort

of  "Emotion Contact Station".  In our society where everyone is

very   busy,  where  the  economy  is  prosperous,   we   should

systematically  try  to  have some sort  of  communication  with

people who have contributed to our society in the past.  We have

spent  a  lot  of  time and effort to develop our  economy.   We

encourage  foreign investors to invest here and to  create  jobs

for our people.  However, as we have stable and strong reserves,

we  should  seriously consider tying up our economic development

with the development of our heartbeat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, we should also put some of our local artworks or

local songs on the Internet, so as to show to the world what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1575</b></font><br><br>



we  have.   For  example,  it is very  difficult  to  plant  our

national  flower,  the orchid.  I have not conducted  a  survey.

Perhaps  the  National  Parks Board may think  that  it  is  too

difficult  to have orchids planted everywhere in Singapore.   It

is  very  difficult to make the orchid flower bloom,  so  it  is

easier  to  have some greenery instead.  There is nothing  wrong

with  it.  But I think we should spend more effort and money  on

the  propagation of our national flower.  At least, have  it  on

the Internet.  With Singaporeans travelling to all places in the

world, a look at our national flower on the Internet, will bring

back fond memories f things back home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also to cultivate our arts bodies, like the dance

groups  and the various arts groups.  We should spend more  time

and  effort  to  cultivate them.  If  you  go  to  the  European

countries,  you  will see a lot of these arts festivals,  choral

festivals, dance festivals, and what have you.  When we have the

"Sing Singapore" campaign, perhaps we could tie up with the CDC.

As  a  matter of fact, on the 5th of June, the Bukit  Timah  CDC

will  have a "Singspiration" involving some 10,000 people.  This

may  not have an immediate effect or attract  immediate response

from the people.  But if we were to promote this in a systematic

manner, we could have very good results.  Recently, we have  the

support  of NAC, that is, if we raise $5 million, the Government

would give us another $15 million to promote our arts activities

and  many  of these arts groups were also very envious  of  this

grant to us.  I feel that when our economy has developed to such

a  level,  we should also try to promote this sort of  Singapore

heartbeat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Committee for the Implementation of the

Singapore   21  Committee's  recommendation  would   take   into

consideration what has been  discussed in these few  days.   Our

first generation leaders built up Singapore when we had no  army

and no reserves, but we survived. Now that we have a strong army

and strong reserves, we should do better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1576</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam):</b> Sir, I would like to start

by  congratulating  RAdm Teo Chee Hean  and  his  team  for  the

excellent Singapore 21 report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore 21 Committee has stated quite clearly and

unequivocally,  and this is fundamentally critical,  that  every

Singaporean  matters.  Singapore would be given up  as  lost  if

there is any Singaporean who feels that the affairs of Singapore

do not matter to him.  We are well aware that our society is the

strongest  if  every  Singaporean feels  himself  a  part.   The

alienation  of  any member can only serve to weaken  the  social

fabric  of our society.  Therefore, if there was previously  any

doubt,  it should be put to rest that every Singaporean  counts.

In  Singapore, there is a place for everyone, regardless of  his

station in life, race, language or religion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is also enlightening to know in the report that

"the  methods  of  steering cannot remain as  they  have  always

been".   By  making  that  point, it is  a  presumption  and  an

acknowledgement  that our people will and have matured  to  take

the   right  decisions  in  the  collective  interest   of   all

Singaporeans.   But I note the caution that the  Prime  Minister

made  yesterday, and just now, Minister Lim Boon Heng  cautioned

Singaporeans that the presumption and acknowledgement are  based

on  our  maturity as a people, and that we cannot expect changes

to  be  made unless we are ready to make the right decisions  in

the  collective interest of all Singaporeans.  We all know  that

the  best  way to govern Singapore is to get the involvement  of

all  the  people,  and  not on the few.  We  need  to  focus  on

persons,  and  not  on property.  Ultimately,  the  strength  of

Government  is  on the free development of public opinion,  from

the bottom-up approach, and not based on authoritarian rule from

the top.  It is demonstrating the trust and faith we have in the

maturity of our people.  It is also based on the belief  that  a

state  and  society with the means of some change  provides  the

means of its conservation, and I think it is heartening that the

Singapore  21 report is also trying to shape the change  in  the

way  Government  responds  to the interests  and  needs  of  the

people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1577</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before our people can become active citizens, they really

need  to possess the requisite citizenship skills.  And we  take

for granted that every Singaporean actually possesses the skills

to  become active citizens.  Our citizens need to know  how  the

national   economy  works,  what  constitutes  GDP  growth   and

recession,   the  annual  Government  budget   of   income   and

expenditure.   On  issues like healthcare, the  environment  and

important truths about public policies, safety and security, law

and  justice systems, the citizens should be educated  on  these

important  national issues through public education  programmes.

Even  if  they have been taught in schools, but because  of  the

changes  made over the years, it is important that our  citizens

be updated and continually be educated on the current affairs of

our  country.  Even then, as alluded earlier, a citizen will  be

making  an important contribution when he is able to look  after

himself and his family.  The shared pursuit of happiness,  peace

and prosperity gives meaning to living in a community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our hope actually lies in Singapore with a growing middle

class.   A  larger  middle class should contribute  to  a  safe,

secure   and   orderly  society.   A  society  can   easily   be

destabilised  if  the  demagogues are allowed  to  play  up  the

feelings  of  the less successful, and the lower  income  groups

against  the rich and successful through the politics  of  envy.

It  is important, as it has been our aspiration in Singapore, to

grow the middle-class in Singapore.  It is, therefore, important

for  us  to  upgrade  the talents and capabilities  of  as  many

Singaporeans  as  possible, so that they can  benefit  from  our

growth and prosperity and a better quality of life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those of us who work in the corporate world have been

challenged  to  measure  our corporate performance  through  the

concept  of  Economic  Value  Added  (EVA).   In  the  area   of

Government, we can also measure the performance of public sector

through, perhaps, a modified version of Social Value Added.   We

need to set stringent performance quality standards



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1578</b></font><br><br>



on  the  public sector to deliver the public and social good  of

the  highest  value  in  the most efficient  and  cost-effective

manner.   The  civil  service has an onerous  responsibility  to

ensure  that  the  public funds are used in the  most  judicious

manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to promote active citizenship participation, the

public  sector must, and can take the lead and set the  example.

It  is really the attitude and conduct in rendering services  to

the  public  that  show whether the Government,  Ministries  and

agencies are taking the public seriously.  For example,  in  the

area  of  healthcare, it is important that the  specialists  and

senior  consultants  continue to treat  `C'  class  patients  in

restructured and Government hospitals, showing that we care  for

the poor.  In education, improving the teacher-student ratio  to

help  the  weaker students, and the provision of  facilities  to

make   it   easier  for  disabled  students  to  attend  school,

demonstrate  our  concern  for the  weak  and  disabled  in  our

community.  In housing, the provision of lifts to stop at  every

floor  is  beneficial to the elderly residents.   These  efforts

serve  to  inspire and motivate the public.  The  citizens  will

actively  respond  to  give  useful and  constructive  feedback,

because they have seen and heard the actions taken.  The  public

funds are not wasted but devoted to meet priority areas of  need

in our community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience of the PAP Town Councils has produced

favourable and beneficial outcomes.  Our HDB housing estates are

better  maintained.   The Town Councillors who  are  drawn  from

among grassroots leaders and volunteer professionals have helped

to  make  judicious decisions in the use of limited Town Council

funds,  and the choices necessary in meeting the many  competing

needs  to  beautify  and improve the living environment  in  the

housing estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next important step would be to strengthen the

work  of  the Community Development Councils (CDCs).   In  fact,

Singapore  has  long had the people sector and the  organisation

that   has  been  playing  that  role  is  really  the  People's

Association.  The CDCs, through the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1579</b></font><br><br>



People's Association, should be seen as the body linking all the

civic groups that represent the people sector.  And I share  the

same  view  with Minister Lim Boon Heng earlier when  he  talked

about  the civil society and the groups should not work  to  the

exclusion  of  the Government and the establishment.   In  fact,

here,  I would argue that it is so very important that the civic

groups work with a Government body like the People's Association

to get things done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should encourage the social clubs, golf and country

clubs,  arts  and  culture  groups,  interest  groups,  all  the

organisations  and associations in Singapore  to  adopt  a  more

proactive  approach in sponsoring and participating  in  sports,

art,  culture, the environment and social services sectors.   In

fact, there is already a very large sector and large groups that

are  involved in many social service activities.   And  I  think

what  is needed is to get them more organised, to get them  more

networked, so that their resources are better used.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, citizenship does not only apply to the individuals.

The  corporations  are also important, and we  should  encourage

more companies to be good corporate citizens.  Incentives should

be given to encourage them to set up charitable foundations.  In

today's  Straits  Times  Life section, they  reported  the  many

beneficiaries  of  foundations  which  give  scholarships,   for

example,  and  the  many  courses that foundations  are  already

giving  in  Singapore.  We think there are many more foundations

that could be set up by companies and individuals.  What we need

is  to  have support on a regular basis, both financial  and  in

kind.   Here,  I  will  echo Mrs Yu-Foo  Yee  Shoon's  call  for

Government to give greater incentives and support to bodies that

want  to  serve  charitable  and  public  causes.   Perhaps  the

Ministry  of Finance and the Inland Revenue Authority  could  be

more generous in this regard.  Corporations need not necessarily

be  thinking of the advertising and commercial value  in  giving

such  charity, or at least directly.  There will  be  a  lot  of

goodwill in their work.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1580</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs) also need

attention,   and  they  need  to  be  managed  by  professionals

qualified  to  handle the issues and activities on  a  sustained

basis.   VWOs usually started out with a vision and  mission  of

the  founders  in  meeting a need in the community.   We  should

encourage as many talented and bright young Singaporeans to take

up career positions in the VWOs.  Unless the VWOs themselves are

well  managed,  it  would  be  difficult  for  them  to  attract

volunteers willing to devote time and energy to serve  in  these

agencies.  The beneficiaries will be well taken care of if there

are committed professionals and dedicated volunteers serving  in

the  VWOs.  Sir, as we hope that there will be volunteers,  VWOs

should first be professionally  and better managed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also alternative approaches in serving the needs

of  the  community.  The area that has successfully  tapped  the

spirit   of   volunteerism  and  self-help  is  the  cooperative

movement.   The NTUC has been highly successful in  spearheading

cooperative projects in Singapore.  Perhaps other bodies  should

also  consider the cooperative approach as a way to  participate

in  the  people  and  civic sector.  It was a pleasant  surprise

really  when  the  virus affected the pork  business,  the  pork

merchants  actually organised themselves as  a  cooperative,  to

find   solutions  to  their  business  problems.   And   it   is

interesting  to  see a group of merchants organising  themselves

and,  of  course, we have our ex-colleague, Mr Ho Kah Leong,  as

the adviser.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cooperative approach is really a formidable approach

because  there  is a social responsibility in  its  mission  and

profit  maximisation is not its ultimate objective.  The  mutual

self-help  community  approach has a  role,  even  in  a  highly

competitive globalised trading environment.  Perhaps  an  active

cooperative  movement can revive the spirit of volunteerism  and

self-help as we move into the 21st century.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the S21 Committee has set the direction with the

vision and strategies.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1581</b></font><br><br>



I  hope that all Singaporeans will rally behind this vision  and

make  it  a  reality, and we, Singapore, become a  gracious  and

compassionate society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  rise  to  register  my  support  and  commitment  as  a

Singaporean to the vision for Singapore in the 21st century.   I

congratulate Minister Teo Chee Hean for his leadership and thank

the  various  committees for the numerous hours which  they  had

sacrificed to process this project of people and ideas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not disagree with any of the good things already

said  of  this  Report.  I ask myself when I walk  out  of  this

House,  do  I  feel a recharged energy to want to operationalise

these five ideals in my personal and corporate life?  There  are

93  of  us  in this House, and therefore altogether 93 families.

Assuming we have an average of four per household, then whatever

each  of us has learnt in this House will impact on 372 persons.

At  the broader level, as leaders in corporations and MPs taking

charge  of thousands of Singaporeans, how do we, in our  various

positions,  create the environment for these five ideals  to  be

translated into actionable programmes and manifest measures,  so

that  they become real to our company staff and to the  man  and

woman in the street?  That is the energy I am raking and I would

like to see it being harnessed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister said that there will be no implementation body

and he hopes that the people sector will respond and take charge

where  it seems fit.  This seems to indicate a move from a  top-down  management  style to one that is bottom  up.   This  is  a

significant paradigm shift.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam may not agree with me, but if we, as lay

citizens,  seize  the spirit and act on it, we are  shaping  the

beginning of an open society.  It is clear that people are asked

to exercise active



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1582</b></font><br><br>



citizenry, not as "armchair critics" as what Mr David  Lim  once

said, but as "ready to act and willing-to-do Singaporeans".   We

do  not  need to wait for the Government to take the  lead.   We

seek  consultation and form partnerships with  Government  where

possible,  but  we  can independently serve through  appropriate

channels and cease to live as consumers expecting our desires to

be always made known and to be satisfied by the authorities.   I

totally agree with Minister Lim Boon Heng just now asking us not

to wait to be invited to serve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must, as professionals, civil servants, corporate

personnel, volunteers, advocates and lay citizens, all  roll  up

our  sleeves,  wet our feet, dirty our hands, and serve  at  the

frontline  with  other Singaporeans to problem  solve  and  find

solutions together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore would make a call to all Singaporeans and

corporations,  including each of our Ministries, to  show  their

commitment  to  S21 by putting down the top five  to  10  things

which they will do in 1999 to translate and operationalise these

five  ideals.   Minister  Tarmugi  took  the  lead  to  do  this

yesterday,  and  I  thank  him for that,  and  I  hope  he  will

seriously consider leading a Family 21, a proposal which I  made

during  the Budget debate and reinforced again yesterday  by  Mr

Sinnakaruppan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, on "every Singaporean counts", my company will

focus  on  human  resource development  and  examine  where  the

potential  of  each  of  my staff can be enhanced.   On  "strong

families",  I  have already started flexible time for  staff  to

report  any time during 8-10 am for working mothers who need  to

take their children to school, or have other family schedules to

attend  to.  Personally, I will work harder with my children  to

translate  the  five family values created by  the  Ministry  of

Community  Development,  which I believe  form  the  pillars  of

strong families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On promoting multi-culturalism, I try to include many

ethnic  groups  as I can in my social and business  network,  to

expose



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1583</b></font><br><br>



my  children and staff to different cultures and ways  of  life.

These are small examples and I would like to build on them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that we take this Report further and invite the

whole  country  to  contribute their ideas on how  to  translate

these five ideals and share them through the Internet.  What  we

get  will be an astounding range of actionable ideas, I am sure.

By engaging in this process, we are spreading the S21 energy and

let people buy into it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if some of the specific recommendations made by the

6,000  contributors require partnerships between Government  and

the  people, then I would like to highlight a few needs.  First,

the  need for constructive engagement.  To be true to the spirit

that  every Singaporean counts and we must work together to make

the  difference, the Government and the people sector must learn

to  find  answers  to  our problems and  work  together  as  co-producers  of  community.   Indeed, not  all  civil  bodies  are

unconditional  blessings to society, but we  cannot  stop  their

growth   and  rising  expectations.   How  does  the  Government

moderate  the cacophony of voices and collectivise  the  diverse

views  into cooperation without conformity?  It is not  an  easy

process, but it is something we have to deal with.  The  process

will  always  be untidy and a continual struggle,  like  in  all

aspects  of  life.  That is not what we need to  fear  about  or

avoid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inevitably, I think we will swing from a fear of

hyperdemocracy that paralyses action due to unresolved  opinions

on  major  issues to a dread of hypodemocracy where people  grow

accustomed  to  the "I don't think, I don't care  and   I  won't

help"  attitudes.   These attitudes reflect a  dependency  ethos

grafted  in kiasu Singaporeans too used to believing  that  "the

Government will do it and control all anyway."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need a breakthrough. We need to confront this

apathy and perceived fears.  We need to learn to engage with one

another in a constructive mode, which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1584</b></font><br><br>



includes  sharing  information,  conducting  two-way  dialogues,

enablement and access to resources.  In my own experience  as  a

volunteer advocate for the last 10 years, I will rate the  level

of  "constructive  engagement" between the  Government  and  the

people sector at an average 5, on a scale of 10 points.  I  have

good  stories gathered from grassroots experiences.  I also have

negative ones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, "constructive engagement" is key to active

citizenry, because when people feel engaged, they will serve and

stay  active.   Being  engaged is not  merely  fund-raising  for

welfare  organisations or following what is already  decided  by

the  Government.   Engagement for many young  professionals  and

executives means having meaningful two-way dialogues with policy

makers   to  test  new  ideas  and  offering  helpful  feedback,

sometimes  criticisms  to  Government without  being  ostracised

afterwards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to truly encourage open engagement, it is helpful for

the  Government, in particular the bureaucracy, to refrain  from

hurling  discouraging remarks at its critics that they "did  not

have  the  big  picture"  or they "did  not  do  their  research

thoroughly" or they "did not know enough of the legislation"  or

were  simply "ignorant of what went on in the field."   Instead,

Government officers must check their arrogance and defensiveness

and  instead  adopt  the attitude that it  is  the  job  of  the

Government   to  use  State  resources  and  its  administrative

machinery  to gather and share information for policy decisions.

What  follows  is  the need to persuade the public  towards  its

convictions.  This belief in public persuasion requires a  first

principle  belief, not to believe that "the Government  has  all

the answers".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope, Sir, when people do put up their ideas, the

Government will not put them down, in the spirit of S21.  People

do  not  want  to  follow   -   they  want  to  join.   Even  if

Government's decision turned out to be the best option, and this

was  indeed often the case, the ripple effect caused  by  giving

people more time and space to reach the same conclusion on their

own, is just as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1585</b></font><br><br>



important  as the goals themselves.  It makes people feel  "they

count", even though they do not see eye to eye on some matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the need for higher level of tolerance for

differences.   Sir,  when two persons get  together,  there  are

differences.   And in active citizenry, there are  going  to  be

strong and different ideas, but we must be prepared to negotiate

and balance.  I was heart-warmed by the way DPM Tony Tan and  PM

openly  dealt  with their differences of opinions regarding  the

scrapping  of  scholarships.  I hope to see  such  pluralism  of

ideas being tolerated at all levels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pluralism creates and generates creativity. The ability to

think  out-of-the-boxes during brainstorming  stages  in  policy

decisions  must  know no boundaries and fear.   The  authorities

must  let  go for people to respond nimbly, with competence,  to

social problems.  Notwithstanding that national cohesion must be

guided  by  an  underpinning of common values to  serve  as  our

compass  to  serve and act, it is the pluralism of thoughts  and

dreams  as  well  as action models that will generate  the  much

sought  after  creativity in our search for fresh approaches  to

problem-solving.  It takes time for us to find a  balance.   But

it  first  takes big hearts and strong minds to accept  feedback

and suggestions, including criticisms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, is the need for sustained commitment to service. I

urge  the  civil  bodies not to believe at the  onset  that  the

Government is insincere about civic involvement.  It is as  much

our  duty to engage attention of policy makers by seeking shared

perspectives  without assuming that "people are  always  right".

Much  too often we exaggerate our differences and fail  to  work

hard  at developing our overlapping interests.  We need to  stop

criticising a half glass of water as half empty, instead  accept

that it is half full and we want to fill it up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to identify people processors for creating

successful links between



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1586</b></font><br><br>



networks,   whether   top-down  or  lateral   ones.    Sustained

engagement  across  sectors  and within  sectors,  even  in  the

Singapore context of managed activism, requires strong minds and

a positive spirit all round to believe that service to community

is   about   comprehending  the  problem,   deliberating   tough

decisions,   setting  realistic  goals,  following  through   by

learning to work together and adopting a high level of give-and-take  attitude.  These are human resource matters  that  require

focus and strengthening.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, to create what I would call a "Singapore

Connected",   or  precisely  a  human  website.   I   urge   all

Singaporeans to make visits to their neighbourhood voluntary and

grassroots  organisations to see how they can add value  to  the

community.   So  much has been done by our MPs  in  facilitating

volunteer  involvement and improving the lives of  Singaporeans.

A  lot  more  can be done with the help of everybody.   I  fully

support  what MP Mrs Lim Hwee Hua said in the recent publication

of  CONTACT - that "Neighbourhood Committees can be an important

link  among residents and community leaders . the residents know

their  own and mutual needs best.  The old kampong spirit  is  a

strong  underpinning and helps define the larger  family  beyond

our family members.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to use five Chinese words

strung  up in one meaning to sum up my commitment to the  vision

of  Singapore  21.   It  is "wo men de guo jia",  translated  in

English  to  mean  "our  country".  Idiomatically,  the  Chinese

phrase  "wo  men  de  guo jia" encapsulates several  components,

including "wo" the self; "wo men" the collective "We"; "jia" the

family;  and "guo jia" the country.  You have to get  all  these

components in to make sense of the words "our country" - "wo men

de  guo  jia".  The link word between people and country is  the

centre  word  "de" which means "ownership".  Like DPM  Tony  Tan

said  not  long  ago, what you do not defend, you  do  not  own.

Therefore, to call Singapore a country of our choice, we need to

nurture  the individuals and strengthen the families so that  as

stakeholders  of this country, they will bond and band  together

to safeguard its future.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1587</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no "Me" if there is no family, and if there are no

families,   there  is  no  country.   In  Chinese  we   say,   (

)   "mei  you  jia na hui you wo", "mei you jia na hui  you  guo

jia".   It  is  these  linkages from  the  self  to  family  and

extending  it to society and the nation that shape the heartbeat

and robust health of Singapore.  I travel a lot, Sir, and I only

travel on SIA, because after a few days in foreign land, as soon

as  I  get  into an SIA plane, I immediately feel "at home".   I

need  a  "Singapore  touch", the batik  clothes,  and  even  the

"Singapore Smile".  When the SIA aircraft landed on home ground,

I  felt  the  "warmth and safety" of home.  These  are  precious

feelings that this little piece of land gives me and my  family;

nowhere  else  do I feel this way.  And I realise we  must  work

hard to prevent it from being torn apart.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister is so right that we still have a lot to

do.    Let  us  go  forward,  irrespective  of  race,  language,

religion,  gender  and  age, in a pathfinding  process,  through

adventure   and  mutual  strengthening,  become   S21   citizens

pulsating in one strong and dynamic heartbeat, and develop  from

country to nation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Harun bin A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Harun bin A. Ghani (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  allow  me to join in the debate in respect of  the  motion

moved by the Minister for Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not easy to embark on the task of

mobilising  the  forces of our multi-racial, multi-cultural  and

multi-religious Singapore society to give feedback,  suggestions

and  inputs  which could become the platform for  the  lives  of

Singaporeans in the years ahead, namely, Vision 21.  It is  even

more  so  after  having  dialogues  and  interviews  with  6,000

Singaporeans   to  follow  up  on  their  ideas  and   opinions.

Therefore,  I  wish  to place on record my  congratulations  and

thanks  to  the  S21  Committee for  their  unyielding  efforts,

chaired  by RAdm Teo and his Committee members.  I am  sure  the

findings and proposals of the Committee will be well received by

the  people of Singapore and, hopefully, translated into  action

fully.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1588</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, active citizens will determine the

heartbeat of our society.  In order to achieve this, we need  to

give full support and overcome any impediments that could affect

the   active  participation  of  the  people.   For  the  Malays

particularly,  I  wish to quote from the speech  of  the  Deputy

Prime  Minister  and Minister for Defence, Dr Tony  Tan,  as  it

appeared in the Berita Harian issue of 28th February 1999:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is not reasonable for employers not to employ persons

of  suitable  skills  and talent simply  because  they  are  not

Chinese or for the SAF not to appoint or award promotion on  the

grounds solely of being Malays.  It is stupid on our part to  do

such things."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, on 11th March 1999 in Berita Harian, Deputy Prime

Minister and Minister for Defence, Dr Tony Tan further said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are many Malay commanders, officers, warrant

officers  and specialists in the SAF.  They serve  in  the  same

field  as  their  non-Malay counterparts and others.   When  the

Malays  continue to climb up the education ladder, they will  be

qualified to fill more and even higher posts in the SAF."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on 1st April 1999, Berita Harian made a report from

Jakarta  concerning  remarks made  by  the  Singapore  Chief  of

Defence Force, Lieutenant-General Bey Soo Khiang:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, President Habibie has received the wrong

information.   We  practise a system of  meritocracy.   All  SAF

staff  are  accorded equal treatment on the basis  of  equality,

regardless  of race.  In fact, there are many Malay officers  in

the  SAF  and  they  have  made contributions  towards  national

defence like other races."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am deeply touched because I was greatly elated after

reading  the  speeches which I quoted above.  Why?  Because  all

this  while,  the topic of Malays in the Singapore Armed  Forces

has  been a very sensitive issue, a grey area which is difficult

to  put  light in the open, not only by the Singapore community,

but  even  myself; perhaps also my MP colleagues.  Such concerns

and  sensitivities from these speeches, I think, will be a  sort

of  encouragement  and  stimulant  which  will  spur  the  Malay

community  to  attain greater heights and work together  in  the

national arena.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scepticism and misgivings, which have abated confidence on

meritocracy, are obvious.  New horizon has arisen and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1589</b></font><br><br>



meritocracy is no longer an instrument to avert misunderstanding

but  it has been shown to be exercised fully.  So I am sure  the

Malay  community, which has always been loyal  to  this  beloved

country,  will  bury any feeling of suspicion and  apprehension.

We  must  put  our  shoulders to the wheel in order  to  acquire

knowledge.  Speeches made by our leaders should be used  by  the

Malay  community as a yardstick to build a more  meaningful  and

excellent  life,  especially  with  regard  to  the  issues   of

retraining,   the   knowledge  based  economy  (KBE),   lifelong

education and others which will enhance the credibility  of  the

Malay society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch upon the dearth of

Malays participating in grassroots activities.  For example,  on

the  basis  of participation ratio, I think less than 6%  Malays

take  an active part in grassroots activities.  Now that we have

Vision  S21,  I hope more Malays will participate in  grassroots

activities  because the People's Association has identified  and

analysed the reasons for the inadequate participation of  Malays

in  grassroots  activities, such as problems  of  prayer  times,

halal food issues and the frequent dinners and festivities which

they have to pay for to attend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that the obstacles which I have mentioned above

have  been  addressed  by  the People's  Association  and  local

grassroots  organisations by providing halal  food  and  holding

meetings  after 7.30 pm, after prayer times.  When Singaporeans,

including  the Malays, work together as a nation, more  benefits

will be garnered.  Otherwise, the ingredients are incomplete and

the  end result is simply not delicious.  I therefore feel  that

there  is  no reason for the Malay community not to be  able  to

work hand-in-hand and to participate in national activities such

as  in the Residents' Committees, Community Development Councils

and others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, with more active participation of Malays in

grassroots organisations, many local and national issues can be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1590</b></font><br><br>



comprehended  and  adopted  resulting in  stronger  inter-racial

relationship.   Besides, more feedback will be  made  available.

Thus, a part of S21 Vision would have been fulfilled and a  more

harmonious living is bonded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very much impressed and it is

therefore  incensed in my heart by the speech made yesterday  by

PM  Goh  Chok Tong in this House.  He spoke at length concerning

the  Singapore  nation.  He said that Singapore  is  not  yet  a

nation  and he foresees the possibility that something  untoward

might  happen  if  we are not on our guard and prioritising  our

country  and society above our own self-interests. I  feel  that

the  sense of belonging of Singaporeans has existed and has been

proven  by  the  fact that Singapore has participated  in  every

field  of activities.  The sense of pride of being a Singaporean

is  more  evident when they are abroad.  I believe that if  this

spirit  is  nurtured  and inculcated, the  hopes  of  our  Prime

Minister will certainly be realised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I feel that whilst the national leaders practise

the policy of working hand-in-hand, we should be on the look-out

and  ensure that those entrusted with this policy work together.

I  fear  there may be some of them who are in disagreement  with

each  other.   In this event, certain sectors of the  population

will  point  a  finger at the Government whereas, in  fact,  the

policy  of the Government is correct and is made in the interest

of  the  people.   When this eventually happens, the  scepticism

towards  the word "trust" will emerge and will become a question

mark without a full stop.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge that Singaporeans use and exercise the word "trust"

as  a  panacea, which can cure all ailments, great or small,  in

our  multi-racial,  multi-lingual and  multi-religious  society.

Hopefully,  the  hopes  of our Prime Minister  and  Singaporeans

alike  will  be  realised  when  we  continue  to  practise  our

fundamentals  of  life.  As the Malay saying  goes,  "Living  by

mutual help which will help to stabilise our stance to create  a

one nation and people of Singapore ".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Majulah Singapura.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE 21</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Motion)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, thank you for

allowomg  me  to join in the debate on the motion.   Firstly,  I

would like to congratulate Minister Teo and his team for a  very

good  report which contains simple yet meaningful messages which

all  Singaporeans can relate to.  It is extremely  difficult  to

crystallize abstract ideas into simple messages, and I think the

committee has done an excellent job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a country with very little resource, and the

main resource we have is manpower, and hence people are its most

important   asset.   For  Singapore's  future  to   be   bright,

Singaporeans must take an active interest in Singapore's future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember why I first got involved in politics in the mid-80s. I have always believed that Singaporeans must take an

active  interest in Singapore if Singapore was to have a future.

At  that  time in the 80s, I have felt that many in the  younger

generation had a different viewpoint from the views espoused  by

Government.   I  had two choices.  I could have either  been  an

armchair  critic  or  joined the party to make  different  views

known.  I chose the latter.  While in politics, I was not a  yes

man,  but  more  often  than not, I was  willing  to  express  a

different  view  whenever I thought that the  different  view  I

expressed was a viable alternative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a firm believer of active citizenship where every

Singaporean  is  encouraged to take an  active  role  in  making

Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1592</b></font><br><br>



a  better place to live in.  However, the reality is that it  is

tougher  than what it seems.  I remember that when I was working

in   a  Government-related  institution,  it  was  amazing  that

sometimes,  senior officers act contrary to what the  Government

preaches.   The  policies formulated within the institution  ran

against the grain of the principles that we have been taught  to

believe in.  If you had a valid point that they could not rebut,

they  will use a different approach; they will send your  report

to  a  committee which will just sit on your report and not make

any  decisions  on  it.  If I, as a Member of Parliament,  could

feel  the frustration of being an active citizen, what more  the

man-in-the-street.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making active citizenship a reality requires a major change

in  the  mindset.  The first thing to do is to  have  an  active

response  to opinion.  The public sector must take the  lead  in

promoting active citizenship as invariably all Singaporeans will

come into contact with Government agencies.  And where should we

begin?  I  think  this House should lead by  example.   If  good

suggestions are thrown up, let Ministries be bold enough to  say

yes.   It is often easier to say no than to say yes.  Sometimes,

the  reply is no, but the suggestion resurfaces later as  a  new

policy  of the Ministry.  I am glad that the Singapore 21 report

states  that  a  difference  of  views  should  be  seen  as  an

opportunity  to benefit from the diversity of ideas,  and  there

should  be  no loss of face if good ideas come from the  people.

This  active response to opinion must filter down to the  public

sector.  We  must  go beyond the service quality  committees  to

people  sector  committees, comprising  of  individuals  in  the

public, private and people sectors, whose role is to ensure that

the  public sector is promoting active citizenship in a positive

manner.   I believe that the task ahead is a gargantuan one  and

changing this mindset will require tremendous political will.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating an active citizenship culture goes beyond just

creating  an active response to opinion.  We have to start  from

the very young, right from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1593</b></font><br><br>



kindergartens,  the schools and the universities.   We  have  to

change  the  entire mindset.  I remember that in  my  days,  the

teacher  was always right, and teachers did not take too  kindly

to  students who pointed out their mistakes or took a  different

view.   The  educational  institutions  must  create  the  right

environment  for our young to be active citizens.   Singaporeans

must  learn that the future of Singapore lies in the citizenship

that  is able to look beyond the individual and the family.   We

must  build  a  citizenship that is able to  contribute  to  the

nation  and believe that their future is invariably tied to  the

future of the nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in promoting active citizenship, we must not

forget  that  access  is  also  important.   People  wishing  to

participate  in giving feedback or being involved  in  community

projects  must  be  able to find access easily.   Although  many

Ministries  or  organisations have tended to  promote  high-tech

access via the Internet, we must not forget that there are  many

Singaporeans  who  are not Internet savvy.  A  simple  toll-free

phone  line will probably be an easier alternative.  If we  want

to  promote  and make active citizenship a reality,  it  has  to

start  from the two key sectors that have a major impact on  all

Singaporeans  and  all Singapore families. Firstly,  the  public

sector,  which every Singaporean will have to come into  contact

with,  and secondly, educational institutions which will nurture

our young and mould their minds.  If we can succeed in these two

areas,  we  will have planted the seeds for active  citizenship.

May it one day grow like a mighty oak and spread its branches so

that  it  will  touch the hearts and minds of all  Singaporeans.

The day this happens, I think we will have succeeded in creating

a Singapore tribe.



<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> As I read

the S21 report, amidst the background of a very troubled region,

I  immediately became aware of the very key lesson contained  in

the  report, that is, about the need to accommodate change.  One

of the reasons for the political problems in the region, I feel,

is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1594</b></font><br><br>



inability  of  Government  to deal  with  inevitable  forces  of

changes, both within the Government and within the society  that

they   govern.    As  a  result,  the  process  of   change   is

unnecessarily   accompanied  by  chaos,  anger,   violence   and

revolution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, S21 is about accommodating change. Some of the

ideas  and  concepts  contained in  the  report  indeed  require

accommodating  a very revolutionary change in mindset.   If  you

measure  the  S21  report against past  trends,  it  may  appear

revolutionary  because the ideas may be a  very  vast  departure

from  past and present mindsets.  If you measure the S21  report

against  the expectations that accompanied it, it can  be  quite

pessimistic  because  of the sheer overwhelming  task  ahead  to

achieve  this  vision,  and  because  of  the  many  conflicting

dilemmas and issues that we must hurdle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But herein lies the real value of this report; one that

recognises  and  accommodates the diversity of views;  one  that

provides  for opportunities for all Singaporeans to participate;

one that allows us to deal with the very uncomfortable conflicts

and dilemmas as we go through a peaceful evolutionary process of

change through consensus and collective effort.  Whether  it  is

foreign talent, SAP schools, multi-culturalism, Malays in SAF or

Simei  Briskwalkers,  the important thing is  that  there  exist

avenues for discussions, debate and a fruitful engagement.   But

we  must be aware of the responsibility that accompanied it, and

that  the evolutionary process cannot be compromised and allowed

to tear our society apart.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam is here today, because

yesterday,  he  said he cannot recall any public  discussion  on

S21.  Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam may wish to know the feedback group of

which  I  chaired,  the  mass media group,  devoted  its  entire

activities  last year on S21.  In fact, I recall a  report  from

the  Feedback  Unit's annual conference papers  last  year,  and

amongst  other  suggestions, it called for the increase  in  the

number  of  NCMPs  so  that  Opposition  Members  in  Parliament

constitute  at  least 10% of the Members of Parliament  in  this

House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1595</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also remember that when these suggestions were brought

forward,  there  were many who had reservations  and  hesitation

about  putting  their names to these suggestions,  because  they

feared about making such revolutionary proposals.  But I assured

them that a genuine and sincere feedback is indeed welcomed,  as

indeed  is  the purpose of S21.  It may be a very new experience

for  these people, but I am sure they, like the 6,000 others who

were  involved  in  the process, have experienced  not  only  an

increase   in   the   avenues  and  channels  for   constructive

consultation  and  feedback, but also in participating  in  what

many see as a new arena in public discussion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the moment, only those with exceptional high-level of

seriousness  and  commitment are likely  to  enter  this  arena,

because   of   their  perception  of  OB  markers,   their   own

interpretation  of  defamation laws,  and  issues  of  political

discussion  and  discourse.  But seen from this point,  one  can

appreciate   that  the  experience  has  indeed  been   a   very

significant milestone in the feedback and consultation  process.

To   me,  the  S21  consultation  process,  in  its  spirit  and

character, will hopefully set the tone, pace and style of public

discussion in Singapore in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, S21 to me is also about changing mindset. I

wholeheartedly welcome the call by the Minister for more  active

citizenship  and for greater involvement of civil  societies  at

the  grassroots level.  But for this to happen, we need a change

in  mindset.   Civil societies should seize this opportunity  to

become more engaged at the neighbourhood level.  But a change in

mindset on the part of the Government and civil service is  also

needed.  I venture to suggest that we turn the community centres

to  be centres for civil societies outside the management of the

People's   Association.   Very  much  like  the  town  councils,

privatising  its  operations to private managing  agents,  civil

societies can and should take the lead to provide a whole  range

of programmes and services to help the community.  The community

centres can become a virtual office, a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1596</b></font><br><br>



home  for  all  civil  societies  at  the  neighbourhood,  civil

societies working in tandem with the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we also need a change in mindset on the way Government

communicates with its constituents.  A Western diplomat, whom  I

had   lunch   with  yesterday,  on  learning  about  the   daily

proceedings  of  a  Member of Parliament in Singapore,  remarked

that  the  Members of Parliament in Singapore indeed  work  very

hard,  and  is worth every penny that they are paid.   And  this

drew  a  response from another Roundtable colleague of mine  who

said  that democracy is calculated or measured by the number  of

contacts  that  Members  of  Parliament  here  have  with  their

constituents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore could indeed be the most democratic nation in the

world.  However, my sense is that, even this, we need to have  a

change   of  mindset.   Many  Singaporeans  want  to  go  beyond

feedback,  beyond  submitting  survey  forms,  beyond   dropping

suggestions  at  suggestion boxes at  Ministries  and  statutory

boards.  The meet-the-people session is perceived by some to  be

a  place  that  you  go to when you have a  problem.   But  most

Singaporeans do not have a problem that they need to go  to  the

MPs.   They  want to talk, discuss, listen and engage their  MPs

and    Ministers   beyond   press   statements   and    official

announcements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was told by a friend recently that he finds it very

refreshing  to hear, while he is driving to work, Mr David  Lim,

Mr Lim Swee Say and Mr Inderjit Singh on Radio Chat Show.  It is

such  a thrill for Singaporeans to now realise that at the press

of  a  button, while driving to work, they can have a chat  with

their  Ministers on the radio.  And the value is not so much  of

those  participating in these chat shows, but the  demonstration

of  the accessibility, the spontaneity and the human touch  that

this  new  communication provides.  Again, I venture to  suggest

that Ministries and statutory boards tap on this new opportunity

in  media  communication with the public.   Press  officers,  as

official  spokesmen,  are  not merely messengers  of  Government

announcements.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1597</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But really the biggest enemy, to me, in changing our

mindsets  is  in ourselves, when we measure others  by  our  own

standards, especially when they fall far short of our own ideals

and  values,  As a Board member of the Singapore Cooperative  of

Rehabilitative  Enterprises (SCORE), it frustrates  me  to  face

walls  after  walls of obstacles when trying to  find  jobs  for

rehabilitated  drug offenders.  Many would  not   even  want  to

consider them as cooks or other manual labour.  Yet, I  find  it

very  paradoxical that a security guard who looks after millions

of  dollars  of  inventories are seldom  scrutinised  for  their

background.  Even the stringent background checks carried out by

statutory boards, Ministries and the civil service may sometimes

act  as  a  barrier to do mundane jobs and those which  are  not

exposed to security threats.  We must change this mindset.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask every Singaporean to find a place in Singapore 21

because  it  is  the  collective response of society  that  will

determine  the  progress that we will make out of  this  Report.

Being   active  citizens  need  not  necessarily  being   active

committee  members  of social organisations,  although  this  is

certainly preferred.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing that I wish to change mindsets as far as

civil  society is concerned is also the fact that sometimes  the

civil  society is preoccupied with the notion that  to  maintain

independence,  they  need  to operate  outside  and  apart  from

Government.   I  think  civil societies  need  to  change  that,

because what is important is not so much to be operating outside

Government  but to really give value to the people who  rely  on

the  services.  And this is where I call on civil  societies  to

really  take  a  look  at  their  mode  of  operation  and  tell

themselves  that  our independence and our  conviction  and  our

ideals  for  civil society rest very much on our conscience  and

our  belief  in the cause that we do.  Never mind the perception

that working with Government may sometimes make people feel that

we are being co-opted into Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1598</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, to me, S21 is about being Singaporean. It is not

just about, like I said, being active members of committees, but

we  can  also be good citizens of Singapore just by  being  good

neighbours,  being a helpful colleague and being  a  responsible

corporate  citizen, being a decent person, being a  Singaporean,

any  Singaporean, so long as you are not indifferent or so  long

as you are not disinterested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the motion, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

support  the motion on Singapore 21.  No one in his  right  mind

would  oppose  S21.  No one would want to oppose the  clear-cut,

wholesome,  motherhood  statements.  To  oppose  would  be  like

turning against what is good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it need not necessarily mean that motherhood

statements  could  not be the powerhouse of ideas  nor  that  it

could not be the mother of all visions.  It can be all that  and

more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pertinent question is: does it mean that it is widely

accepted   on  the  ground  and  permeates  through  Singaporean

society?  Honestly, not.  Not being opposed is one thing.  It is

another  to  be rooted and anchored in the hearts and  minds  of

Singaporeans, in the souls of all Singaporeans.  Sir, it is  yet

to  be etched and ingrained in the collective will and psyche of

the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked some grassroots leaders and residents about S21.

It  is  of not much interest to them.  Some have not heard about

it.   In  the kopi tiam, they are not bothered, honestly.   They

say,  boh  chap.   It is not a bread and butter issue  to  them.

They  are all too busy making a living for themselves.    Others

could not understand.  It is too chim, too deep for them.   Liak

boh  kew,  they  say.   It  is too abstract,  philosophical  and

perplexing.  They are indeed put on the horns of dilemmas,  when

we  talk  about the five dilemmas.  One told me that it is  like

the literati talking to the literati, and it is of no concern to

the  ordinary   folks in the street.  This may not,  of  course,

reflect everything and not an entirely accurate summary, but  it

is a perception on the ground.  Some say,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1599</b></font><br><br>



please, talk as much as you want on S21, but remember do not  be

like  NATO   -   No  Action  Talk  Only.   What  they  are  more

interested in is what happens after this.  Sir, may I ask:  what

can  be  done to change this mindset and make Singapore 21  part

and parcel of the Singaporean way of life?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent interview, RAdm Teo Chee Hean was reported to

have said in the papers that S21 has no target, no set programme

and  no  agency to drive its implementation.  I want to ask  how

then  can we measure the success or otherwise of S21?  How  then

can  S21 touch the hearts of Singaporeans, reach all sectors  of

Singaporean  society,  and  be the  cornerstone  of  Singaporean

society?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things do not just happen overnight. The fact that S21 is

formulated   and  debated  indicates  that  it   needs   to   be

crystallised  and be given a push.  We need a  facilitator.   We

need an organising genius.  We need an agency with the resources

and the network to connect up the people, to uphold and keep the

vision alive in the hearts and in the heartland, in particular.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore, in reality, is a city state, not a nation,

with  a  big population or a big hinterland.  We are the  Sparta

and  Athens of the East.  Singapore is a city state with a  tiny

piece   of   property  and  a  small  multi-racial   population,

surrounded by much bigger neighbours.  We must not forget  that.

Yesterday,  the Prime Minister put this issue in perspective  in

this  House.   We have to compete fiercely in order to  survive.

We  have  to  make  ourselves useful to the world  in  order  to

survive,  while at the same time dedicate enormous resources  to

defence and security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debates on values, priorities, aspirations and OB markers

must  take  into account these fundamental parameters  governing

Singapore.  We cannot run away from the strategic imperatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the preface to the text of S21, it is proclaimed

that  the  five  ideas, arising from the five dilemmas,  form  a

vision for the future.  It states:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1600</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'They are ideals that we strive for, to add to the timeless

ones  we  already  hold  as  a  nation   -   meritocracy,  clean

government, racial and religious harmony.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to differ on this point. It is an exaggeration

and  a  misplaced  optimism, to catapult  and  categorise  clean

government, racial and religious harmony as the "timeless ones".

This  "timeless" quality or qualification seems to suggest  that

they  are given or solidly anchored in the context of Singapore.

If we believe they are, we are sadly mistaken.  Clean government

and  racial and religious harmony are not given.  They  are  far

from  being  internalised or institutionalised.  It  will  be  a

mistake to presume or pretend that they are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chew Swee Kee scandal, involving the then Minister for

Education and $700,000 of "political gift", helped to bring down

the Lim Yew Hock government and propelled the PAP into power  in

the  1959  General Elections.  The PAP, elected into government,

proceeded  to  fulfil  its  election manifesto  and  made  clean

government a touchstone and unshakable pillar of the Government.

From time to time, erring officials are taken to task.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not plain sailing. We have to keep an eye on things,

especially  when in some other countries, to be on the  take  is

part of the political culture.  It is an intrinsic part of their

system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I met some officials from another country and was told

that  being  elected is a ticket to wealth and prosperity.   You

need funds to get elected in the first instance.  After you  get

elected,  you need to repay your benefactors, and  the  gate  is

wide  open for patronage, for lining your own pockets.  This  is

indeed a contagious environment for greed and corruption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nadesan Chandra, a Singaporean football referee,

exemplified the Singaporean non-corrupt ethos, when he  rejected

a bribe to fix a match in Kuwait in 1987, and he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is just not Singaporean to be corrupt. Taking "dirty

money"  has never been my cup of tea.  I am proud that I reacted

and behaved like a genuine Singaporean.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1601</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, in Singapore, are clearly and absolutely against

corruption.   We  would have no part in such corrupt  practices.

And  it  is  this  clean  government  policy  that  won  us  the

investments and helped us to create jobs for our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A clean government is able to lead with authority,

sincerity  and is able to inspire and galvanize the people,  who

will  respond  to  calls for sacrifices and  belt-tightening  in

times of crisis, as during this economic downturn.  But it is  a

constant  battle  of vigilance and of conviction.   Surely  this

deserves  to  be enshrined in S21, as an intrinsic and  integral

part  of our Singaporean way of life, and not just mentioned  in

passing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is even more critical to highlight, emphasise and

reinforce  racial  and  religious  harmony,  rather  than   just

mentioning it again in passing.  Racial and religious harmony is

vital.   It  is  the very foundation for our internal  cohesion,

bonding and indeed prosperity.  Without it, everything else will

fail and fall.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest we forget, there were the Maria Hertogh riots of 1950,

the  racial riots of 1964 and across the Causeway, the May  13th

riots  of 1969, which had spillover effects on Singapore  during

that  time.   I  remember  I  was a first-year  student  in  the

university.  Outside the campus, there were soldiers in  uniform

with  their  rifles ever ready to patrol the  streets.   Further

afield,  there are racial and religious conflicts in Sri  Lanka,

Lebanon, Bosnia, Yugoslavia and Indonesia, nearby.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Racial and religious harmony is precious. It must not be

taken  for granted.  It does not just happen.   We have to  work

at  it constantly, day in and day out, in our place of work,  in

our  neighbourhood  and  in  our very  own  homes.   Racial  and

religious  harmony  is  fragile.   Agent  provocateurs  or  some

disgruntled  and misguided fundamentalists or chauvinists  could

easily stir the pot and arouse the emotions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must, Sir, at the same time, commend the S21 Committee

for taking



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1602</b></font><br><br>



the  open  and consultative approach, and for reaching  out  and

touching  base  with 6,000 Singaporeans.  This is the  bottom-up

approach  and  consultation at its best, and is indeed  laudable

and very welcome.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some members of the public are glad and detected a shift in

S21 towards a more open society, and a trend towards giving more

space  to individuals, with the battle cry of "Every Singaporean

matters".    Every  Singaporean is precious  and  matters.   His

views  matter.   His  interests matter,  and  his  contributions

matter.   One  can say that it is one for all and all  for  one.

Together,  we  make the difference.  We make the difference  for

our families, for our society, and for our nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But individual interests must be balanced by community

interests and national interests.  Individual interests must not

be allowed to ride roughshod over community and national

interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the "Shared Values" paper, which was published and

debated in Parliament in 1991, it was clearly stated that one of

the  five  core values is "Nation before community  and  society

above  self".  The "Shared Values" paper expounded that,  and  I

quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Singapore is an Asian society. It has always weighted

group interests more heavily than individual ones.  This balance

has  strengthened social cohesion, and enabled  Singaporeans  to

pull  together  to  surmount difficult challenges  collectively,

more  successfully  than other societies.  An  emphasis  on  the

community  has  been  a key survival value  for  Singapore.   We

should preserve and strengthen it."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While strengthening communitarianism, the "Shared Values"

paper  recognises  that  the individual also  has  rights  which

should  be  respected, and therefore added another  core  value:

"Regard and Community Support for the Individual".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the end, it is a matter of accommodation and a

matter  of  balance.   S21 should address this  and  put  it  in

perspective.   Otherwise, individual interests may  loom  larger

than community and national interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the civil society, where active citizens participate

fully in all sectors and make a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1603</b></font><br><br>



difference  to  society, civic groups, charitable organisations,

clans,  and non-government organisations, all have relevant  and

unique  roles  to play.  Each group has special and  significant

contributions  to  make and no doubt can make  a  difference  to

society,  provided they are not self-interested and not  blinded

and obsessed by self-interests.  We should not support those who

use  civic  groups as hobby horses to advance their own  selfish

interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, over the years, a quick succession of strategic

roadmaps or compasses.  In 1984, we had `Vision 1999'; in  1991,

we  had  `Shared Values'; and last year, the National  Education

Programme was in full swing with the Singapore Story Exhibition.

And  now  Singapore  21.  Each of these, I  must  say,  has  its

specific purposes.  But it is all rather bewildering to the man-in-the-street.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the way forward to the 21st century? How could we

sell  S21 to the people?  How do we make sense of S21?  How many

of  us,  for  example, remember the five core values  of  Shared

Values,  which were debated in this House in 1991?  Honestly,  I

could  not  remember all the details.  I have to  hurry  to  the

Library  to dig out the five core values in order to incorporate

it.  Incidentally, the five core values, for the record, are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nation before community and society above self.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family as the basic unit of society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regard and community support for the individual.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consensus instead of contention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Racial and religious harmony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, therefore, the real test of S21, that is the point I

want to make, is whether any one of us could remember what it is

all  about in a couple of years' time.  This is why I say if  we

are  serious  about  S21, we should revise  it  and  incorporate

elements  of Shared Values and National Education,  and  have  a

national civic body, or even a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1604</b></font><br><br>



non-government body, to chart its course and promote it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S21 is our compass for the 21st century, and this compass

will  only  work well and guide us to the right path  if  it  is

founded on the fundamentals of Singapore and the geopolitics  of

the region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Putting aside our different approaches, at the end of the

day,  S21 is about ownership of Singapore, S21 is about  passion

for Singapore, S21 is about commitment to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said in his National Day

Rally  speech  in  1996,  "You have to feel  passionately  about

Singapore.  Being Singaporean should resonate in our hearts  and

minds."   If  S21 helps us to feel passionately about Singapore,

it  is worth it.  Let us together then make it happen, and  make

the  difference  for  Singapore, for  our  children  and  future

generations of Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<div align="center"><b>(Motion)</b></div>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of

all,  let  me  congratulate  the  S21  Committee  and  all   the

participants   involved  in  preparing  the   report   and   the

recommendations contained therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is no easy task to identify the heartware

Singaporeans want and to put these intangibles in writing.   The

five  key  issues identified encapsulate well the main  dilemmas

faced  by  Singapore as we move closer to becoming  a  developed

state.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1605</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I read the report, what went through my mind was: what

difference  will  this report make to the lives of  Singaporeans

immediately and later?  Twenty years later, when I look at  this

report,  will I see it as a landmark report that really  made  a

difference  to  the lives and soul of Singaporeans?   Will  this

report  be seen as a defining moment in the history of Singapore

where  Singaporeans really felt a difference?   Will  we  see  a

golden era of active citizens who care and share with others  in

the  wider community?  Will there be a difference thereafter  in

the political process and participation?  Is politics and public

policy  debate going to be only for politicians or for  everyone

who  has a stake in Singapore?  Will this new trinity of people,

public  and private sector consultation and cooperation  be  the

new political theory to be expounded and practised?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, is Singapore ready to undertake an adventure into

uncharted  waters  to define the parameters  of  greater  public

involvement in policy-making, yet without upsetting  some  norms

and  conventions built over the years?  Many, Sir, both  locally

and  internationally, will be watching, whether these  are  mere

propaganda  statements  for  public  consumption  or  a  genuine

programme to bring about real change.  I am confident  that  the

composition  of the S21 Committee and the many participants  who

took  part  in it had Singapore and Singaporeans at  heart  when

they  deliberated  the  report and  its  recommendations.   They

reflect  the future Singapore Singaporeans want.  I am confident

that the Government and the people can make the quantum leap  to

achieve the vision and the many goals defined in the S21 report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I originally intended to speak on the topic of active

citizens,  but when the Hon. Prime Minister spoke  yesterday,  I

was taken aback, to be candid, because he stated that we are not

a nation yet.  But earlier on, when I heard Hon. Minister Mr Lim

Boon  Heng speak, he had mentioned that he was surprised by  the

article written by a journalist in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1606</b></font><br><br>



yesterday's  Straits  Times  where  she  stated  that  she   was

surprised at what the Prime Minister had said, and that  perhaps

she  said that there was a difference in viewpoint between those

in  the  30s  and 50s.  And that brings me, Sir, to  the  fourth

issue   that   is  raised  in  the  report,  that  is,   feeling

passionately for Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must confess that when the Prime Minister said yesterday

that we are not a nation yet, I was surprised because I grew  up

in  the post-independence generation, and for me, all I know  is

Singapore  is  my  home.  Perhaps there is  this  difference  in

understanding what is Singapore all about and what is  Singapore

as  a nation, and whether it means different things to different

people.   Sir, I belong to the post-independence generation.   I

underwent a school system where day in and day out we were  told

that:  This  is our home, this is our nation.  This was  carried

through   secondary  school,  pre-university,  in  my   National

Service,  and  the university.  That is how we all were  brought

up,  Sir.  So for the young, I am quite sure, just like me, many

Singaporeans  who  read the Prime Minister's  speech  yesterday,

they  would have been equally surprised because to most  of  us,

Singapore is our nation.  But I understand the context in  which

the  Prime Minister made his speech - that Singapore is a  young

nation and that there are pitfalls to be worried about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I endorse the speech of the Prime Minister in respect

of  being on guard against fault lines in society.  But we  must

continue  to  ensure  that Singapore as a  nation  continues  to

become  stronger  and that the Government continues  to  develop

this  trust  and  in  being a fair Government  to  everybody  in

society.   Singapore is a complex society comprising  people  of

different  races,  religions, languages  and  backgrounds.   One

thing  that  has stood out, and I speak to everybody  who  comes

from   different  racial  backgrounds,  language  or   religious

background, is that what we have is a fair Government and it  is

a  Government that we trust.  And I think this is something that

is  peculiar and something that all Singaporeans would  like  to

cherish.   I  would like to encourage all Singaporeans  to  work

towards



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1607</b></font><br><br>



ensuring that we continue to have a Government that is not  only

fair but there is something also which is trustful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I elaborated earlier, I grew up in the post-independence generation. To me, the definition of Singapore

right  up to the 1990s was that I did not see the difference  in

being  Chinese, Indian or Malay.  But somewhere in the 1980s,  I

felt  that there was a difference in Government policy and  that

we had started focusing on issues regarding the different racial

groups  in  Singapore, and that there we took a divergent  line.

And  perhaps  one  of the concerns that the Prime  Minister  has

raised  in  regard  to  these  differences  that  may  arise  is

something  that  could have arisen in the  course  of  different

policies that have been implemented by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, things like community development organisations, we

have  to re-look whether they go towards building Singapore into

a cohesive, united society, or do they in the end, end up making

our  society  a  divisive society.  I would  like  to  share  an

example.   I met the CEO of Sinda earlier this week and  he  had

informed  me that when they placed an advertisement  asking  for

individuals  to  sign up for their skills retraining  programme,

90%  of  those who called Sinda called and complained.   90%  of

those who called were Chinese.  When they were told that Chinese

could  not  sign  up  for  this programme,  because  this  is  a

programme organised by Sinda, they had complained, "Why are  you

discriminating  because  I am a Chinese?"   This  gives  a  very

peculiar picture in Singapore, because it makes us look back and

wonder  whether  some of these measures that we have  introduced

over these years have led to a more cohesive society, or we  are

in  a  way  inadvertently leading to a society which may  become

divisive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I endorse the call of the S21 Committee that we make

Singaporeans  feel passionately about Singapore.  My  generation

is a generation that grew up and did national service.  And if I

asked  many  of  my friends who had undergone national  service,

push comes to shaft, "Will you stand up for your country?"  And



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1608</b></font><br><br>



I  will tell you that, do or die, they will stand up and die for

this  country,  because this is the only nation  that  they  all

know.   I  endorse the call of the Committee to develop stronger

ties and a stronger commitment to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to the topic which I came to speak

about, Sir, which is active citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now share with the Members of this House on

what are some of my thoughts to encourage Singaporeans to become

active  citizens and what can be done to ensure that this report

and its recommendations do become milestones in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, is the question of whether we should develop

national or international citizens.  The report states  that  an

active  citizen is one who takes an active part as a citizen  in

making the country a better place to live.  I wish that the term

"our  citizens"  would have been even more  broadly  defined  as

people who make both the country and the world a better place to

live.   There  are  many  Singaporeans  who  have  distinguished

themselves internationally in making the world a better place to

live.  I hope, Sir, many more Singaporeans would be involved  in

international  volunteer work besides local volunteer  work,  so

that  Singaporeans are known not only as active citizens locally

but also internationally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, here I see great potential for Singapore International

Foundation  to  garner  the  many volunteers,  particularly  the

increasing   number  of  senior  citizens  to  do  international

volunteer  work.   I  welcome the setting  up  of  the  National

Volunteer  Centre  by MCD and hope that it would  help  mobilise

volunteers for both local and international volunteer work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another area where I see a great role is for employers

and schools to be involved in greater volunteer work.  The reach

of  the  schools  and  all employers practically  reaches  every

household.  If we can develop a volunteer programme whereby  all

schools and all employers are involved in doing community  work,

just



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1609</b></font><br><br>



by setting aside one hour a week to undertake community work,  I

think  we  would  have  reached a large number  of  Singaporeans

getting  involved  in volunteer work.  And by  imbibing  in  the

young,  particularly in the schools, a sense of doing  community

service, a sense of doing common volunteer work, I think this is

something that they carry on throughout their life and  it  will

show commitment to serving the community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I do hope to see is greater volunteerism among

the  public sector and private sector employees so that not  one

sector but all sectors of the society are involved in building a

better  Singapore.   I  also  hope that  the  proposed  National

Volunteer Centre can reach out to both employers and schools  in

a big way in future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another recurrent thing that has appeared in the

column  of  Active  Citizens  in the  S21  Report  is  that  the

recurrent theme among a number of Singaporeans is that they  are

not  being consulted and there is a climate of fear in  speaking

out  against Government policies which they feel are ineffective

or  wrong.   The  Government has made big, bold moves  from  not

having  enough  consultation with the public to where  there  is

substantial consultation.  But the public view is that there  is

still not enough consultation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I recollect an incident. About four years ago, when

I  participated  in a public dialogue session, a  young  person,

whom  I  believed was from the university, got up and criticised

that  there was not enough freedom in Singapore and she went  on

to  criticise  the Government.  Then I turned around  and  asked

her,  "The fact that you stand up and criticise, don't you  feel

that  you have the freedom?".  And she kept quiet.  What I would

like  to  highlight  is  that, while they  complain,  a  lot  of

measures  have  been  undertaken  by  the  Government  for  more

consultation.    However,  the  public  not  only   wants   more

consultation,  but they would also like to be consulted  at  the

pre-policy stage rather than at the post-policy stage.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1610</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a classic example, particularly during the Feedback

Unit  sessions,  is the feedback session held  over  the  Budget

session.  Many of these feedback panel participants usually feel

that  the feedback and discussion on the Budget should  be  done

before  the  Budget is presented and not after it is  presented.

So  there  was a call for the consultation and feedback sessions

to  be held before a policy is made rather than after the policy

is  made.  I hope this is something that the Government can look

into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what can the Government do? The Government, for a

start, could encourage the relevant non-sensitive information to

be  disseminated timely so that members of the public  can  give

considered  feedback  or  suggestions.   At  times,  the  public

suggestions may not be helpful, not because they are not thought

through  but  because they are premised on inadequate  or  wrong

information.  This leads to a win-win situation as we have a far

larger  pool  of  people  looking  at  the  problem  and  giving

suggestions.   It  may  be difficult for  some  civil  servants,

particularly  the Administrative Service officers  who  are  the

best  and brightest, to accept that the public can come out with

better  policy  options.  This may be due  to  the  mindset  and

expectations  of the Administrative Service to be the  best  and

have considered everything.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering policy options, the civil servant may

harbour  a  feeling that the suggestion from  a  member  of  the

public which is accepted and implemented may imply a failure  on

their  part  to  have  identified and implemented  it.   Such  a

thinking must be discarded and the mindset must be changed.  The

PS21  guidelines and programmes that have been implemented  have

gone  to  a  large extent to change the mindset  of  the  public

service, but more can definitely be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is also definitely more scope for pre-policy

consultation.  I applaud the call by the Deputy Prime  Minister,

BG  Lee  Hsien  Loong, in March this year at the  Administrative

Service  Dinner, that the Administrative Service  should  change

its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1611</b></font><br><br>



mindset  and to involve the people sector in its policy  making.

I  am  convinced that our Ministers recognise the sea change  in

public eagerness to participate.  But it has to sink deep in the

mentality  of  the civil servants.  Perhaps,  they  need  to  be

advised that not all the information is official secret  and  to

share information and gain policy input from the public is a win-win formula not only for the public service but for Singapore as

a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to encourage a culture of consultation and involvement

with  the  public,  the civil service must  also  recognise  and

reward  officers who take this process seriously and engage  the

public for better policy making.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is also a call to make more use of technology to

improve  the consultative process.  I would urge all  Government

departments to make greater use of technology like the  Internet

to  get speedy feedback and suggestions from as large a pool  of

Singaporeans as possible so that everybody will feel that he has

contributed  towards policy making in Singapore.  What  can  the

people  do  then?   It  takes  two to  tango.   Equally,  it  is

important  that  the public respond with vigour,  sincerity  and

responsibility.  The discussions must be on a platform of  doing

and  achieving the best for Singaporeans and Singapore.  We must

be tolerant to different views.  The participation by the public

should  not be merely armchair criticisms and offering of views.

They must also follow through, where possible, with action, what

the  report referred to as "walk the talk".  The Government must

also  facilitate this.  Groups of individuals who share  similar

interests  and want to advocate certain views should be  allowed

to  flourish  without unease.  Rules and regulations  should  be

changed  to  help  create and flourish the development  of  such

interest groups.  At the same time, we must also recognise  that

not  all  Singaporeans want to participate in such consultation.

They  are happy that there are avenues for them to give feedback

and discuss matters they feel strongly about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other complaint among Singaporeans is that, although

they hold differing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1612</b></font><br><br>



views,  they  are  afraid to speak up for fear  of  being  black

marked  or  picked up by the Internal Security  Department.   We

know  that there is no such black mark namelist and this  is  an

unjustified perception.  The Government must work harder to help

clear this perception.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, some of our laws, which were prepared in the

1950s or 1960s to deal with a different era, must be relooked at

so  that they would give comfort to Singaporeans.  Many of these

laws  are so widely defined that they can be picked up, arrested

or  charged for any of these widely defined offences.   Perhaps,

we  can relook at some of these laws to make sure that they  are

not  very  narrowly defined and people need not fear  when  they

speak  up their minds or when they want to go out and do  things

which are in the interest of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps, here, the OB markers could be made clear so

that people do not harbour any suspicion or fear of being picked

up.   When an OB marker is arbitrarily defined, it frightens the

public  and many may withdraw from public participation.  Public

discussion   should  be  encouraged  not  only   in   Government

organisations  like the Feedback Unit, People's  Association  or

think-tanks like IPS.  Ministers, MPs and civil servants  should

make  time to participate in as many relevant forums as possible

to  increase  the  consultative  process.   Just  like  justice,

consultation must not only be done but must also be seen  to  be

done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other thing that the Report calls for is for

active  citizens  to  take  action  and  assume  responsibility,

rolling up their sleeves to help implement what they envision or

suggest.   This  is something very laudable.   The  public  must

recognise  that not all their views and opinions  are  workable.

When a decision is finally reached, they must equally close rank

and  support  it  wholeheartedly  for  democracy  is  all  about

accepting the views and opinions of the majority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I see the S21 Report as a guidance to what a parent

will give to his young children who have just turned 21 years of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1613</b></font><br><br>



age.  It is up to the young person to decide what he wants to do

with  the guidance which his parents has given, just as the  S21

Committee  has  given  this  Report to  the  Singapore  society.

Singapore is coming of age as we enter the new millennium.   Let

us  work together to make the 21st century a place where we  can

dream  and  realise our vision of a home, a home we can  all  be

proud of.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir,

for  allowing me to join in this debate.  I rise in  support  of

the motion standing in the name of the Minister for Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the outset, I would like to congratulate the S21

Committee on an effort that has been quite sincere to canvass  a

wide  spectrum  of  views  in order  to  forge  this  vision  of

Singapore  in the next century.  The process has been bipartisan

and  exhaustive, if not exhausting, given the Committee's desire

to reach out to as many Singaporeans as possible.  The result is

certainly  a  compelling  vision that  embraces  our  collective

aspirations as a people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an important point made in the S21 Report is that the

five key ideas complement those that have already served us well

-  clean  government,  meritocracy,  and  racial  and  religious

harmony.   Yesterday, our Prime Minister made a passionate  case

why  these ideals, particularly our multi-racial harmony, should

not  be  taken for granted.  To me, it was a timely and sobering

reminder to keep our feet firmly planted on the ground  even  as

we  reach  for  the  stars.   I was not  puzzled  by  the  Prime

Minister's  speech or the import of his message.   In  fact,  it

struck  a chord.  So I do not think it is a generational  issue.

But I do think it is a matter of perspective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a concern among some Singaporeans that we may

be  becoming  more ethnocentric at the expense of  our  national

identity.  Some Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1614</b></font><br><br>



policies  like the advent of self-help groups, the establishment

of  SAP  schools  or the introduction of ethnic  quotas  in  HDB

estates  may  have accentuated these anxieties.  While  each  of

these policies has its own forceful rationale, each also has  an

inescapable  ethnic dimension.  And some have  argued  that  all

such  policies should be dismantled because of their ethnic hue.

Others  feel that some policies, especially those that segregate

like the self-help groups, should be reviewed.  Indeed, this was

the  thrust of the Straits Times commentary today on yesterday's

proceedings  in  Parliament.  Yet,  others  have  absolutely  no

problems with any of these policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to me, it is clear from this debate, be it on self-help groups, SAP schools, or any of the other ethnic based

issues,  that  we  Singaporeans, all  of  us,  attach  paramount

importance to multi-racial harmony.  It is also equally clear to

me  from  this  debate that we do not all agree  on  what  form,

direction  or,  indeed, the paradigm we should adopt  in  moving

forward as a society to maintain that harmony.  One view is that

the  four circles, which the Prime Minister described yesterday,

should progressively migrate closer together and, ultimately, be

perfectly  aligned,  creating one circle,  one  homogeneous  and

unified society.  An alternative perspective is that whilst  the

overlap   should   be  maximised,  a  certain   variegation   is

unavoidable, indeed, it may be necessary, creating a clover-like

mosaic  where there is common ground and yet there are  distinct

areas as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have listened to these alternative points of view

with  much attention, not just in the course of this debate  but

over the years.  I too have had my doubts, especially when I was

asked to take up the assignment as the first CEO, Sinda.  It was

with    considerable   trepidation   that   I    accepted    the

responsibility.   I  was concerned that I might  unwittingly  be

part of an endeavour that might undo a lot of good work that had

been  done over the last decades, that it would set us  back  in

our  efforts  to build a multi-racial society, and  that  is  an

ideal  I hold very close to my  heart.  But once I took  on  the

job, I was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1615</b></font><br><br>



surprised and, I must say, relieved to find that there  were  no

teeming  hordes of parochialists waiting to engage in a game  of

one-upmanship with other communities.  Instead, to my  pleasure,

what  I  did  find were individuals who were eager to contribute

within the context of the community.  They had recognised a need

within  the  community  and  had  been  seeking  resources   and

opportunity  to  do  so.   The  self-help  group  gave  them  an

opportunity to be active citizens, in the parlance of  Singapore

21.   And I am sure other colleagues who are in Parliament today

like  Mr  Chan  Soo  Sen and Mr Zainul Abidin  could  attest  to

similar experiences in CDAC and Mendaki.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to me, the self-help groups are very much like a paint

brush.  In the hands of an artist, it is a tool of creation.  In

the  hands of a tradesman, it is a tool of utility.  But in  the

hands of a vandal, it is a tool of destruction.  It is very much

the  intent  of  the user and how we manage its use.   Self-help

groups  are  a  response to a challenge within the  context  and

constraints of present day realities.  And I believe  a  similar

argument  can  be  made  for  other  ethnic  based  policies  in

Singapore.  It is for this reason that I believe such endeavours

deserve  continued support from the people and  the  Government.

But  it  is precisely because that in the wrong hands, they  can

also  go  tragically astray that we must also be  vigilant.   We

must  encourage  CDAC,  Mendaki, AMP,  Sinda  and  the  Eurasian

Association to find common ground to work together.  But we must

also  be  willing to blow the whistle if we feel they are  going

astray.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are self-help groups an ideal solution? Probably not. But

then  again, I do not think we live in utopia.  Are there risks?

I think so.  But I am not convinced that we will be closer to an

ideal   society   by   merely  dissolving   or   merging   these

organisations today.  Ultimately, the challenge for Singapore is

to  maintain racial and religious harmony within a society  that

is changing and is facing new constraints all the time.  We need

pragmatic and dynamic responses to these challenges.  But we  do

not  have  a consensus on what model or what modality we  should

use.  What it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1616</b></font><br><br>



calls  for  is a practical mind to respond as we see appropriate

at  that  time  to  these  challenges, without  undermining  our

fundamental beliefs, but making sure that it contributes to  the

overall growth of our society.  And it is in this context,  with

the  on-going  endeavour  as  the basis,  that  an  effort  like

Singapore 21 will also thrive.  That, to me, Sir, was the import

of the Prime Minister's message yesterday, and a message which I

feel all Singaporeans would do well to bear in mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of active citizenship is an attractive and

compelling  one.  To me, it is an invitation to each citizen  to

be  actively  engaged  at all levels in  this  endeavour  called

Singapore,  in order to make a difference to society.   I  would

like  to share some observations I have about active citizenship

based on my experience with NGOs, VWOs, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one, active citizenship will start from the bottom up.

Some  may think that being an active citizen means participating

in  policy discussions and formulation at the highest  level  of

Government.   While  this is an important  contribution,  active

citizenship  cannot  just be about sitting  at  a  round  table,

debating  the relative merits of various policy options.   There

are  other more earthly matters that are equally worthy  of  our

attention and energy.  These include municipal issues  and  also

social  concerns  within  our neighbourhood.   The  citizen  who

participates in a Neighbourhood Watch Group is as worthy of  our

recognition  as  another who is a member of the  National  Crime

Prevention Council.  No contribution can be too small, no matter

at what level it is made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also feel that active citizenship is about commitment. A

regular  lament in Singapore is the lack of time,  and  I  think

this  is  a  legitimate  grouse and one  that  cannot  be  taken

lightly, given the genuine time pressure that Singaporeans  face

in our daily grind.  Yet, what I find ironic is that some of the

most  active  citizens I have had the pleasure  of  meeting  are

those  who  are  also involved in numerous other activities  and

this   is  in  addition  to  juggling  their  family  and   work

commitments.  They are truly an inspiration to all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1617</b></font><br><br>



of  us  and  they teach us an important lesson that we  can  all

contribute  if we choose to make active citizenship an  integral

part of our lives.  To do so, we need to be creative and perhaps

find one area of interest in which to participate in tandem with

our  interests  at  the  different phases  of  our  lives.   For

example,  one  could  contemplate the life cycle  of  an  active

citizen  as  commencing at the student stage in social  service,

moving  on into young adulthood in youth groups, and then  going

on  as  a young parent into parenting organisations, as an older

parent  in  school  management,  and  ultimately,  as  an  older

Singaporean in senior citizen groups and counselling.  It  is  a

matter of will.  The opportunities will always be there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I do believe active citizenship requires a

positive mindset.  Last year, I was involved in a forum on civil

society.  What surprised me most in the course of the discussion

was  the  suspicion that some of the panelists had  about  being

associated  with  Government-related  entities,  be  they   town

councils,  CDCs or feedback groups.  They felt that their  civil

society  credentials  might somehow be  tarnished  if  they  got

involved  in such organisations.  I cannot understand  why  they

have  such  distrust.   If  an organisation  serves  worthwhile,

social and community objectives that we can identify with,  then

should  we  not feel moved to participate in its activities  and

support  it?   Or is the mere fact that it enjoys some  form  of

Government blessing a turn-off?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot has been said about how active citizenship can be

facilitated.  As an ex-civil servant, I think one area is surely

in  the civil service.  The civil service can undertake measures

to  create  more opportunities for Singaporeans  to  give  their

views  in the course of policy formulation.  One trick could  be

to  define  the problem and issue first, and wait  for  a  while

later  before  we  come  up  with the  solutions,  allowing  the

intervening time for individuals with the knowledge and interest

to contribute their point of view.  It would also be helpful, as

many others in this House have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1618</b></font><br><br>



said, when contributions are received, even if they have already

been  thought  of by the Government agencies, it will  still  be

worth our while to acknowledge the value of these contributions.

At the same time, occasionally, at least, it would be helpful to

explain why certain ideas cannot be accommodated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that all this would probably spell much hard work, a

very  circuitous  route  in  the way  policy  is  formulated  in

Government.   But  if we can strike a balance between  efficient

policy  formulation and a Singapore 21 compliant  approach  from

time to time, then I think we will be better off as a country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to people, a lot has been said about the

people  sector  and  its active citizenship and  involvement  in

contributing  ideas.  One observation I would like  to  make  is

that we should not be deterred if our ideas do not automatically

get  absorbed in the policy process.  Indeed, one should  expect

that  more often than not, the ideas may not find such  support.

But  we  must  have  the  maturity  and  the  tenacity  to  both

understand  the mechanics of the process and, at the same  time,

to persevere in order to get our point of view across.  That,  I

think, is the mark of a truly active citizen who has his eye  on

the ball.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a point on our leaders. We certainly want leaders who

will  listen and actively seek opinions.  In fact, we  certainly

want  leaders  who would even make themselves available  through

radio  chat  shows to us.  But we also want leaders who,  having

listened all those points of view, will make a decision that  is

in  the long-term interest of this country, not leaders who will

slavishly follow a majority point of view.  That is not why  the

people  of Singapore elected leaders.  We have been elected  and

the Ministers have been there in office because we have faith in

their  judgement,  and it is important that  that  judgement  be

exercised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, a point on the communication of this very

important report.  S21, in my view, is quite fundamental and  it

should not reach a point where it does not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1619</b></font><br><br>



get  absorbed by its total audience, all Singaporeans,  a  point

that  my  colleague,  Dr  Ong Chit Chung,  also  stressed.   One

perception of this report is that it is the work of an  English-educated  intelligentsia.  Weighty words  like  "knowledge-based

economy",  "active citizenship" and "Singapore  heartbeat"  have

been  used in this report.  But the Singapore heartbeat pulsates

not  just  in  Shenton  Way  and  Raffles  Place,  but  also  in

Chinatown, Geylang Serai, Serangoon Road and Ang Mo Kio.   I  do

not  know  this  report  will make  good  copy  in  the  various

languages,  but  whatever  the  case,  we  must  ensure  that  a

concerted effort is made to ensure that the message reaches  all

quarters,  so that S21 remains a living document in  the  hearts

and minds of all Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I rise in

support  of the motion standing in the name of the Minister  for

Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members have well appreciated, understood and

articulated the ideas contained in the report, especially in the

last section about active citizens, and especially the last  two

Members  who  have spoken.  I shall not repeat these  ideas.   I

should  like, instead, to focus my remarks on three areas:   (1)

how  do we think of the future and change? (2) how do we consult

and  take  decisions?   (3) what do we mean  when  we  call  for

Singaporeans to be "active people"?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a member of the Singapore 21 Committee and I hope that

I  shall answer some of those who doubt this report and who have

labelled  its  recommendations as  mere  platitudes.   I  cannot

satisfy  those  who  are cynics, who have made  up  their  minds

without reading this report or really listening.  But I do  hope

to   persuade  those  who  may  be  skeptical,  those  who  have

legitimate doubts but, nevertheless, keep an open mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first point is: how do we think of the future and

change?   Singapore, our country, is driven by its  future.   We

may not have five-year plans, like many other countries, but  we

are constantly setting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1620</b></font><br><br>



ourselves strategic visions and new aspirations such as those in

education  and  technopreneurship.  Often we  imagine  new  city

scapes,  right  down to the details of a new  city  skyline  and

living  areas.   We  constantly talk  and  drive  towards  these

futures.   In  so doing, this change becomes naturalised,  taken

for granted.  What seems incredible today, is possible tomorrow,

and then, "of course", the next day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you one example of our aims to be a global

city.   This was first, perhaps, articulated by the then Foreign

Minister,  Mr  S  Rajaratnam.  But the idea of globalisation  or

regionalisation took on greater significance in  the  Next  Lap.

In 1991, when the goal of Singapore going global or regional was

pushed, many had doubts, and few institutions (whether public or

private  sector) had this as part of their aims and  programmes.

Globalisation  and the desire to be a global city  required,  in

this   sense,  a  change  of  mindset,  a  revolution   in   our

expectations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet today, some eight years later, global or regional plans

figure   prominently  in  the  aspirations  of  most  companies,

Government agencies and citizens.  It is taken for granted  that

Singapore aims to be a global city and a regional hub.   We  are

not  there  yet, but we are firmly on that path.  The revolution

in  thinking has been naturalised, so much so that when we  look

back,  it  is too easy to think, "what was the fuss about"?   We

have   not  experienced  such  a  change  suddenly.    We   have

experienced a sea change that is deep and real, but  yet  subtly

realised.  Change has been like water on a stone.  So,  I  hope,

it will be with the recommendations of the Singapore 21 report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In calling for such a change, do we neglect present

realities?   Yesterday,  Prime  Minister  Goh  Chok  Tong,   who

commissioned  this  report on Singapore's  heartware,  cautioned

that  all  Singaporeans should have a realism of  where  we  are

today.   I  agree.  I do not take this as a dampener, nor  do  I

believe  that  it was intended to be.  The Prime  Minister  also

held out the prospect of a future in which we can be a nation, a

tribe  of Singaporeans and this is an important vision.  Realism

is important to how we think



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1621</b></font><br><br>



about  the  future.   It is the necessary difference  between  a

vision and a pipe dream.  But to have a vision, ideals are  also

necessary.   It is part of the difference between mere  survival

and a rich life here in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the Singapore 21 report is based on a

realistic  assessment of both immediate and longer term  trends.

We  all  should  be  aware of the present economic,  social  and

political  uncertainties in the region around us.  Amidst  these

great  imponderables,  we have very few  certainties  which  the

report  looks at: (1) that our youth and children are  different

from  us  or  the preceding generation and will be part  of  the

change  that Singapore will experience in the 21st century;  (2)

that the aged that this report talks about are not those who are

aged  today, but all of us here, who are in our 30s  or  40s  or

older;  and (3) that in a globalised world and the drive towards

a  knowledge-based economy, one of the few certainties about the

future is that it will be different from the present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, how do we think about the future and make

plans amidst such uncertainties and changing circumstances? Some

have  called  for  implementation, here and now,  of  particular

policies and details.  These are in the Singapore 21 Report  and

deliberations of the subject committees.  Many suggestions  have

been canvassed, separately published and released.  But this  is

not  the essence of S21 or how we have tried to think about  the

future.  Singapore 21 offers, in this sense, a compass, and  not

a  blueprint or road map, as the hon. Member, Dr Ong Chit Chung,

mentioned.   This compass is to better recognise and  deal  with

the uncertainties and rapid change which we will face ahead.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br>4.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you look at a road map of Singapore from last year,

there  is a very real prospect there will be new roads and whole

housing estates that you will not find in that map.  If  you use

a road map



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1622</b></font><br><br>



from five years ago, you are bound to get lost.  If you look  at

a  road map from the 1970s or the 1960s, you will think that you

are  in  a  different country.  Road maps go out  of  date  very

quickly in Singapore.  But the cardinal points of north,  south,

east  and  west remain the same.  They are what you can navigate

with,  even  as  the terrains change.  And it is these  cardinal

points  of  a  compass for the coming century that Singapore  21

offers as guidance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to my next point. How do we consult and take

decisions?  It has already been mentioned that some 6,000 people

were  consulted and contributed ideas to the S21  Report.   Some

have  questioned  if this is enough.  Others have  wondered  how

representative  these people were, whether the  ordinary  public

were  allowed  their say.  Opposition Members, MP Mr  Chiam  See

Tong  and NCMP Mr J B Jeyaretnam, have suggested that they  were

intentionally left out.  They forget that Singapore 21 Chairman,

Minister  Teo Chee Hean, wrote to all MPs in this House  to  ask

for  their  views.  This is how and why Member of Parliament  Mr

Low Thia Khiang became one of the 6,000 people consulted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But was 6,000 enough, and how representative and open was

the process?  This is the important question.  6,000 may seem to

be a small percentage of our population.  But it represents many

hours  and  much  work  in both listening and  discussing.   The

Committee could have consulted more people, of course, but if we

did  so,  we  may well have delayed the Report on  Singapore  21

until  it  was already the 21st century.  More to the point,  we

were open through the Internet and other fora to all.   Also,  I

would say that we reached a point at which most of the views  we

received   from  additional  people  were  things   others   had

previously said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I say we consulted 6,000 people, this does not mean,

of  course, that Singapore 21 Report is a compilation of all the

ideas  and  views  we heard, nor does it mean that  6,000  would

agree to all of the Report.  Consultation does not always



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1623</b></font><br><br>



mean  consensus.  Indeed, the more we heard, the more  difficult

it  was  to find concurrence and convergence.  This was part  of

one  of our stated dilemmas, and we lived, and still live,  with

the tensions in this process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Member of Parliament, Mr S Iswaran, said before me, we

can  listen, but we have to make decisions.  I can tell you  all

things  were debated, or debatable.  I can tell you  there  were

differences,  big and small.  There were differences  among  the

people  we  spoke  to, between the subject  committees  and  the

people they heard from, there were differences between one  such

committee and another, and there were differences even among the

main   committee  themselves.   But,  indeed,  differences   and

diversity  are healthy.  It is part of being an open and  plural

society, and it is part of the process of consultation.  I would

like  to  thank, as a member of S21, all those who participated.

I  learnt  much from them, even if I did not include  all  their

ideas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally, part of the process of consultation was to find

common  ground,  not  to  reduce things  to  the  lowest  common

denominator,  but to distil key principles.  In  this,  the  S21

Committee  exercised  judgment.   Under  the  guidance  of   its

Chairman,  Minister Teo, some suggestions have  been  left  out,

because  they  found  little  or no  wider  agreement.   Others,

especially  those  dealing  with specific  policies,  have  been

surfaced  in  the subject committee deliberations, but  are  not

part  of  the  main Report.  If you look at these deliberations,

you  will see consideration of such ideas as flexible work hours

and a 5-day week, dual citizenship, that GPCs should hold public

hearings  on  important  issues, and  that  we  need  to  better

distinguish  grassroots organisations from the  People's  Action

Party.   Such  policies  have  been debated,  because  they  are

important  and controversial ideas.  But they do  not  form  the

core  of  Singapore 21 principles, because they are not settled,

and do not yet find consensus, if they ever will.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with this approach. This is necessary if the

Report is not to become a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1624</b></font><br><br>



laundry list of miscellaneous and perhaps conflicting items.   I

agree  because the S21 Report was not set up to look at specific

policies, but at the heartware that undergirds all policies.   I

agree  because after all the consultations, someone must  decide

and  act.   Perhaps,  most  importantly,  I  agree  because  the

Singapore 21 Report is not an end point, not the final  word  on

this policy or that.  Rather, what I hope is that this Report is

a  beginning,  a  launch pad for future and  further  review  of

policies  that  concern or touch on the principles  of  the  S21

Report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what I tried myself to do when, in this House two

days  ago,  I spoke against the Land Titles (Strata) (Amendment)

Bill  at  its  Third Reading.  It is not that the  Singapore  21

Report  says that such a Bill is wrong.  It is that I fear  that

it  may  have consequences that run in tension with some of  the

principles.   Others  in  this House  or  in  the  Singapore  21

Committee, I think, do not agree, and they are free  to  do  so.

Similarly, I have listened, in these past two days, to other MPs

attach  many  different  concerns to  the  broad  framework  and

principles  of the S21 Report, from the call to give more  money

from  the  Government to the Consumers' Association of Singapore

(CASE), to the use of parks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of this is in the Report, but this is the point. I

believe  that  what  can  make the  Singapore  21  Report  truly

something, that is, from the people and for the people, is  that

we  talk about the principles and apply them to new policies  as

they  emerge.   Not  whether we talked to  6,000  or  60,000  or

600,000 or everyone in Singapore twice, but whether this  Report

will  go  on to be discussed, debated and accepted, in whole  or

part,  by  the people as part of the new and specific  different

issues  they  will face in the future.  I hope, in  this  sense,

that  the  S21 Report will be a continuing source of discussion,

something  of continuing relevance and acceptance, but  also  of

controversy.  Because principles are like that.  They  allow  us

to  constantly question a particular direction of where  we  are

going,  and not merely the details of how to get there.  Change,

as I see it, is a continuing process, especially change that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1625</b></font><br><br>



aims  at  mindsets and key principles.  And I hope that the  S21

Report  will  be part of a process of change, and  not  its  end

point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of this is already happening, I believe. For example,

I  hope  that some of the Singapore 21 discussions on attracting

foreign talent and looking after Singaporeans will be of use  to

the Committee on Manpower 21.  When I read DPM Lee Hsien Loong's

recent speech to the civil service and his call for them  to  be

more open to views from citizens, I thought it furthered part of

the call to enable greater consultation and an active citizenry.

I  have  followed, similarly, the establishment of  a  citizen's

network,  which  calls itself "The Working  Committee  on  Civil

Society",  and I see it as part of the response to the  S21  and

its  call  for  an  active people sector.   I  hope  other  such

initiatives  will  follow, not just from the Government  in  the

public sector, or because the Government calls for it, but  also

from the private sector and from the people sector.  I hope that

such  initiatives will be aligned to the concerns and principles

of the S21 Report, even if they do not explicitly refer to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn now to my third and final point. What do we

mean  when we call for Singaporeans to be "active people"?  This

deals  with  a  particular part of the S21 Report,  that  I  co-chaired with the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar, Mr Lim Swee Say,

on  "consultation and consensus against decisiveness  and  quick

action".   It also relates to the call to make sure that  "Every

Singaporean matters".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not agree that the call for an active people or for

every  Singaporean to matter are platitudes.   Rather,  I  think

these  principles  call  for  a  quiet  revolution  in  the  way

Singapore has traditionally done things, and the way governments

in  the past have viewed people.  It is a  quiet revolution that

is  required by changed circumstances in the global economy  and

the  political  landscape, and by a people  who  have  different

aspirations.   It  is  also an unfolding revolution  that  faces

considerable obstacles today.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1626</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have been used to saying, "People are our

only resource".  This is an accepted truth.  But part of the way

this  truth has been seen is that people become just a resource.

That  is to say, people become important only in so far as  they

give utility to the national good, the economic bottom line.  In

this  view,  people can be seen as having to fit  into  assigned

jobs  and created categories or else they do not fit in at  all.

In this, there is a tendency to see people solely in an economic

paradigm,  as  cogs  in  a grand machine,  and  not  as  people.

Accordingly, the machine, in this misinterpretation  of  "people

are  our only resource", was designed, driven and refined  by  a

small elite, and not the people themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe this is an over generalisation. But such a contrast

allows  us to see the quiet but real revolution in the  call  to

make  every Singaporean matter, and to have an active citizenry.

What  the  S21  Report  calls for goes beyond  the  politics  of

consultation  that Prime Minister Goh and his second  generation

team brought.  It calls not just for ideas but for actions.   It

calls not just for suggestions but for initiative.  It calls for

participation.  It calls for ownership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The S21 Report is not saying that we are already there.

The  Report points to obstacles.  This includes especially  what

we  have  referred  to  as  the "Black Book"  and  "Black  Hole"

problems, that people do not speak or act because they  fear  it

will  be  held against them, or because there is no feedback  or

discernible response to what they have put forward.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to changing this is to change mindsets, like water

on a stone.  We need, as a society and a polity, to be convinced

of the utility of an active people sector, and be less afraid of

its possible disutility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By "utility", I mean that an active people sector can

produce new ideas and initiatives, or refine existing ones; that

it  can  act  as a genuine partner to state agencies;  and  that

consultation   and  participation  strengthen   legitimacy   and

ownership of actions taken to address problems.  I also see that

a people sector can cut across



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1627</b></font><br><br>



race  and other differences to help widen our common ground  and

help make us more of the Singaporean tribe.  There is a utility,

in  this sense, in having a people sector in both the process as

well as the end product.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By "disutility", I mean that we need to lessen our fear of

change  and of including new people in the way we make decisions

and  of  getting things done; that we need to clarify and lessen

the  out of bound or "OB" markers of what people can say and do;

and that while real national security concerns can and should be

met, we need not fear every shadow or every word or act.  To  do

this, to increase utility and lessen our fear of disutility,  we

will  require that the Government has a greater trust and  that,

increasingly, people understand the fragilities of  our  society

and  will  act responsibly.  We will correspondingly  require  a

people who do, in fact, understand and act responsibly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our desired society is not one in which Government is

strong and people are weak.  Nor in calling for an active people

sector,  is  it a desire to see Government weak and  the  people

strong.   The  two are not always and necessarily  in  conflict.

Our  desired  society  lies in the growth of  an  active  people

sector,  participating in community and national issues,  as  an

independent entity.  When I say "independent", I do not mean one

that is determined to oppose, nor do I mean one that is beholden

to obey.  I mean, one that is free to agree and cooperate, or to

disagree and make counter arguments.  With such an independence,

we  have  to  see  that  the  two can come  together  and  truly

cooperate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can read the S21 Report for yourselves, although some,

not  all,  have.  Fewer of you will have the time or inclination

to  read the summary of deliberations of the subject committees.

Let me just quote one section about our desired society, and the

attempt   to  resolve  the  dilemma  between  consultation   and

consensus against decisiveness and quick action.  I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The [desired] society will be open to a diversity of

ideas.  The increased interaction between the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1628</b></font><br><br>



government  and the people sector will deepen the  mutual  trust

and facilitate the Government's decision-making.  With trust, it

will  be easier for the Government to act quickly and decisively

under imperative circumstances.  .  While consultation will  not

always lead to agreement or acceptance, it will lead to a better

understanding of the constraints and problems faced by both  the

Government  and the people sector.  . Underpinning  our  desired

society  are 2 key factors.  First, the Government must be  open

and  receptive  to ideas.  . Second, the people sector  must  be

constructive and responsible in its actions."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In calling for an active people sector, the S21 Report does

not  assume  that  for the next century we can always  guarantee

good  government  and able leaders from the  PAP  or  any  other

party.  It does not assume that we always have a Mr Lee Kuan Yew

or  Mr  Goh Chok Tong.  What the S21 Report does call for is  an

equal place for active citizens.  Some years ago, I believe  the

then Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew considered the danger if the

leadership of Singapore were all to perish on a single airplane,

for  that was the size of our leadership and establishment then.

Who  would  run  Singapore,  he  rightly  asked  then.   He  was

concerned  that without this planeload of leaders,  our  country

would fail.  In 1997, the year in which he commissioned the  S21

Committee,  our  present Prime Minister, Mr Goh Chok  Tong,  had

asked us not to depend wholly on a small elite for all ideas and

initiatives.   If  a  government of the future  should  fail  or

perish in that hypothetical airplane Senior Minister Lee alluded

to, it will always be a loss to our country.  But if there is an

active, able and responsible people sector, it need not  be  our

end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me close. We are used to imagining the global city of

Singapore  in the future.  There are even sketches of  what  our

future downtown in Marina Bay will look like.  The Singapore  21

Report   does  not  focus  on  skyscrapers  and  infrastructure,

however.  The S21 Report looks at the future in a different  but

complementary  way.  In putting people at the  centre,  the  S21

Report  seeks to describe the necessary qualities and principles

that  must  guide people who will live, work, and give  life  to

that city and our common future.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1629</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this, I believe there is a dose of realism, as Prime

Minister  Goh  has called for.  There is, I hope,  also  a  good

measure  of  faith, idealism and vision, that  is,  "heartware".

For  it is this marriage between realism and such heartware that

can and must carry Singapore into the next century.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,   Sir,   I  would  like  to  speak  on   two   of   the

recommendations  by  the Singapore 21 Committee.   First,  Every

Singaporean   Matters,  and,  secondly,  Strong  Families:   Our

Foundation and Our Future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on Every Singaporean Matters. It is recommended in

the  S21  report that on the personal side everyone should  make

full  use of his strong points and develop his potential to  the

fullest.  On the society side we should respect the professional

skills of the individuals, reward the successful ones, encourage

those  who are yet to succeed and give those who have  failed  a

second  chance.  The Government should take the lead in changing

the  mindset of our people so that everyone would recognise  the

fact  that  everybody has his or her own talent.  So long as  we

do our work well we can be outstanding talents in our respective

trades or industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, we must understand that success should

not  be  measured  only  in terms of economic  or  materialistic

success.   We  should also take into consideration  performances

in  the  fields  of  culture, arts and  sports.   The  Committee

recognises that our human resource is very precious.   It  urges

everyone to work hard and with the assistance of the society, we

will  be  able to give full play to our potential and to develop

our  talents  to  the fullest.  This is very important  for  our

development in the 21st century.  As it was pointed out  by  the

Committee,  the  criteria of success are not only  in  terms  of

economic  and materialistic success.  In Singapore, most  people

feel  that  there  are  two avenues  to  success.   One  is  for

individuals to go to the top schools, get



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1630</b></font><br><br>



good  results, get a scholarship and a first class honours,  and

then  become  senior  officials in the Government  or  political

leaders.   The  other  is  after  graduating,  either  from  the

secondary schools or from the university, they work hard in  the

business  world and then given the good opportunity they  strike

gold, become very wealthy, make a lot of money, just like Mr Peh

Chin Hua.  He is a typical example of such success stories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, we have some entrepreneurs who have made

their  fortune through technology and this is what we  call  the

technopreneurs.  There are also some very outstanding performers

in  the field of arts or culture, but it is just a flash in  the

pan.  They are not deemed to be "success" in the context of  our

society.  There may be some very successful teachers, some  very

successful tailors, but they are hardly recognised as successful

Singaporeans.  Although we give rewards to the best teachers  in

Singapore, how do we say which teacher is the most successful or

which  journalist  is the most successful journalist,  or  which

tailor is the best tailor?  Are we generally very respectful  of

them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 21st century we must expand the criteria of success

to cover a larger area.  Of course, Singapore is a small country

with  a small population.  The market is small and there  are  a

lot  of  restrictions.   If you write a  story  based  on  local

scenes,  how many readers can you get?  If you produce  a  local

film of strong local flavour, how many audience can you get?  If

you want to study nuclear physics, do we have enough facilities,

and even after you have completed your studies, will your talent

be  put to optimum use in Singapore?  The Government should help

these  people  so  that they can develop  their  talent  to  the

fullest and become a model of success.  So success should not be

confined  to only those who become senior officials or  big-time

businessmen.   We should let Singaporeans develop their  talents

in every field so that we can become a more vibrant country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have to make full use of our

talents and we must



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1631</b></font><br><br>



also  recognise  that  individual wisdom  and  capabilities  are

different from one another.  The Government should educate  them

according  to their abilities and make use of the various  types

of  materials  to  mould  them into  successful  products.   Our

primary school streaming, technical stream or academic stream in

the secondary schools or the vocational training are examples of

teaching according to the abilities of the students.  The wisdom

or  capabilities  may be inborn.  We should  not  over-emphasise

inborn  wisdom  so as not to discourage people from  wanting  to

upgrade themselves.  We should emphasise acquired knowledge  and

training and the positive effect of this acquired knowledge.  As

it  is  said,  diligence  can compensate  for  the  slowness  in

learning.   In  any society, the highly intelligent  people  are

always  in  the minority.  To reform our society,  we  need  the

efforts  of everyone.  Therefore, it is important that  we  must

encourage  and  motivate  the majority  to  participate  in  the

development of Singapore in the 21st century.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I like to talk about the family. The report has

emphasised  on  the  importance of  family  ties.   The  younger

generation should understand and look after the older people and

the Government and society should also help the older people  to

adjust  to  the new environment so that they can enjoy  life  in

their  autumn years.  The report has also mentioned that in  our

society, family is the foundation for our future.  But in recent

years, we have noticed that the divorce rates have gone up  from

year to year.  In 1987, there were only 2,708 divorce cases.  In

1997,  it  had increased to 4,888 cases, an increase  of  80.5%.

This  has  caused much misery and harm to the parties.   On  the

other  hand,  there  are many young people who  have  reached  a

marriageable age but they are unable to find suitable  partners,

particularly  the  ladies.  They are  unable  to  find  suitable

partners  and  once they have grown out of the marriageable  age

they  will  have  to remain single for the rest of  their  life.

This  high  divorce rate and the fact that many people  are  not

getting married are very important problems that we have to look

into.  The report should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1632</b></font><br><br>



discuss  how  the Government or society would educate  and  help

these  people  to resolve this matter.  Although  we  know  that

there is no easy solution to this issue, this problem has to  be

resolved  one  way  or another.  We want the family  to  be  the

foundation  for  our future.  We must look into how  to  resolve

this  problem.  Then with other favourable factors, we would  be

able to sustain our growth and prosperity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say (Tanjong Pagar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  yesterday the Prime Minister  mentioned  in  his

speech that Singapore was not a nation yet.  For a moment I  was

taken  by  surprise. Subsequently, after listening to  his  very

careful explanation, I realised that what the Prime Minister had

said  was that Singapore is not a "tribe" nation yet.  The Prime

Minister  wanted us to create a Singapore tribe.   He  described

our  society  as a society which was formed by four  overlapping

circles, with each circle representing one racial community, and

in  those areas where the circles do not overlap, the individual

community will develop on its own.  And where they overlap,  the

communities would converge and  form a unified society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a multi-racial society we are able to live in harmony because

we  have mutual trust and understanding of one another.  We want

to  build ourselves into a nation.  The Prime Minister's  speech

is very meaningful.  Every Singaporean should study it in depth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I would like to speak on the relationship between the

people,  the public sector and the private sector.  We can  also

describe  this  in  terms  of three circles.   These  are  three

interlinked circles and these circles represent the people,  the

public  sector  and the private sector.  The  question  is:  are

these  three  circles  of equal size and are  their  overlapping

areas  big enough?  Over the last 18 months, we have discussions

and  deliberations.  From the people's point of  view,  we  have

discovered that some Singaporeans are still skeptical. They  are

worried that there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1633</b></font><br><br>



would  be a black hole or a black list in the Singapore  system.

They  feel  that  if  they  make some  good  suggestions,  these

suggestions  may still not be endorsed by the Government.   When

these  suggestions  are objectionable to  the  Government,  they

would  get into trouble with the authorities. Of course,  we  do

not  agree with such a view.  But it is worth noting that  there

are in fact some Singaporeans who have such worries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Government's perspective, of course, to rule the

nation, we will have to look at the macro interest and the long-term needs of the nation.  From the people's point of view, some

suggestions  may  be  driven by narrow  interest  or  individual

interest,  and  hence  not fully aligned with  the  Government's

view.  As a result, when policies are announced, some people may

just know a little bit about the Government's policy and do  not

know the full rationale of the policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, there is no doubt that these three circles

are  of different sizes.  The circle representing the Government

is  the  biggest and the private sector is medium size,  whereas

the  circle representing the people is the smallest.  Of course,

we  want  to  create a Singapore tribe, we want to  enlarge  the

circle of the people and we want to enlarge the areas where they

are  overlapping.   At the same time, we must also  enhance  the

sense of belonging of the Singapore tribe.  On the one hand,  we

must let the two circles of the people and the private sector be

gradually  enlarged so as to be the same size  as  that  of  the

Government.   On  the  other  hand,  we  want  to  enlarge   the

overlapping areas of these three circles.  If we can succeed  in

forging  consensus while maintaining diversity, then our  future

would be very bright.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to achieve this objective of seeking more

identity,  more consensus and less diversity, there  are  a  few

things  that  we  have to look into.  Let me  illustrate  by  an

episode of a conversation  between two people whom I shall  call

the "Big Self" and the "Small Self".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1634</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Small Self would say, "Well, I am very encouraged by

this  Singapore 21 Vision because it implies that in the future,

my  family, my community, the Government and the nation would be

enhanced and they would attach more importance to me, to myself,

my  needs,  my achievements and my ideals.  Under the five  main

pillars  in  the  S21 vision, when I go to the  university,  the

Government will give me a scholarship and even send me  overseas

for  higher  education.  After studying,  if  I  have  a  better

opportunity overseas, the Government will allow me to break  the

bond and I can work overseas.  In order to enhance the Singapore

Heartbeat,  the  Government  would  allow  me  to  have  a  dual

citizenship.   Then  the  Singapore citizenship  will  become  a

guarantee, a security.  Next time, when I come back, my  family,

my  parents  will  look  after my children.   My  community,  my

grassroots  leaders  would  serve  me  and  improve  my   living

environment.   So  it is "Everybody for Me"  and  that  is  very

good."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Big Self does not agree. He said, "I am also very

enlightened and encouraged by this S21 vision.  But  my  feeling

is  different because the emphasis in these five main pillars is

not  only  just to enhance the Government's esteem of me.   But,

more  importantly, it is how I can devote more time and  efforts

to  strengthen the family ties, and to better serve the country.

One  day, I saw a Singaporean running towards a bus stop.   When

he  was  about 20 metres from the bus stop, he saw that the  bus

was  about to drive off the bus bay. He waved to the bus  driver

to  wait  for him.  The bus driver saw him running.  He  stopped

the  bus,  opened the door and let him board the bus.  But  this

Singaporean, after boarding the bus, did not even take a look at

the  bus  driver.  He just bought the ticket and  sat  down.  On

reaching  his destination, he alighted from the bus.  Just  like

that - not a word of thanks!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is indeed disheartening to see how these people behave.

For the Singaporean  scholarship holders, they are like this man

who  was running after the bus. When this scholarship- bus came,

he waved, stopped the bus, and got in.  Upon reaching his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1635</b></font><br><br>



destination, he graduated, just walked down and broke the  bond,

with  not  even  a word of thanks.  His reasoning  is  that  the

Government  should help him to realise his dream.  I am  worried

that  there are Singaporeans of such mentality.  I am even  more

worried  that there seems to be more and more such Singaporeans.

From  the personal point of view, looking at the S21 Vision,  we

should  realise that, yes, I have a vision, I have an ideal.   I

hope that the big environment of Singapore 21 would provide more

opportunities for me to realise my dream.  But at the same time,

I must also realise that every Singaporean has his or her ideal.

So  when I am striving towards realising my dream, I should also

consider  the  dreams  of  the other  Singaporeans.   We  should

respect others as well.  We cannot be too self-centred.  Looking

from  the  society's point of view, I hope that we would  change

the way we assess the individuals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Mr Peh Chin Hua said in Parliament that we

should  preserve the good traditional values.   His  speech  was

very  impressive.   But what worries me is that  the  next  day,

there was a photograph in the Straits Times showing Mr Peh  with

his  Porsche.  I am worried that our young people may just  look

at  the  picture and do not read the wordings.  They  will  say,

"Oh,  Singapore 21 means one day I will be able  to  live  in  a

bungalow  house,  and drive a Porsche, like Mr  Peh  Chin  Hua."

They  would  have neglected the main crux of Mr Peh  Chin  Hua's

speech. We have to take note that S21 does not want to assess  a

person's  success  by  his materialistic  success  because  this

success could well just be a nominal success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few years, I have been working with the trade

unions.   In  my heart, I feel that the trade union leaders  and

grassroots leaders are truly working very hard for the  ordinary

citizens.   They take pains to show care and concern  for  these

people.  They are ordinary people but have extraordinary spirit.

I  think  this  is  a real spirit.  This is an enriched  spirit.

These are the people whose success warrants our commendation  in

the  21st  century.   Of  course, everyone  has  his  own  will,

everyone has his own ambition.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1636</b></font><br><br>



Every  one  of  us will pursue our ideals in our  own  way.   In

whatever trade or whatever industry we are in, we must  see  how

we  could  contribute to our society, and to contribute  to  our

nation.  We should not always think of what people should do for

me,  but  rather we should say, "What  can I do for the people."

We  would  have derived that satisfaction.  The satisfaction  is

not just personal satisfaction, but a collective satisfaction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am using this episode between the Big Self and the Small

Self  to reflect my feelings.  To me, this S21 report may be one

same report, but because everyone of us has his own mindset, and

because  we  have  different ideals, we would derive   different

inspirations  from  this  S21.   If  we  are  to   reflect   our

inspiration from this S21, from the view of the Small Self,  S21

gives  better  lives to the individuals.  It is  like  everybody

sleeping  on  the  same bed but each having his  own  individual

dream.  Four million people having four million different ideas,

and  each  goes  his  own way.  Yes, when times  are  good,  the

country  can develop and prosper.  But, once there is a national

crisis, or we are hit by some calamities, we will not be able to

stay united in one heart as a nation, and we will be wiped out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nation building is a long and winding road. There are

bound  to be some bumpy patches here and there.  If we  want  to

tackle   each  problem  as  it  comes  along,  and  face  danger

fearlessly,  we must plan ahead even in peace time.  We have  to

anticipate the occurrence of any crisis.  Our destiny is in  our

hands.   To  me, it is a very important question of  whether  we

could  look  at  this  matter from  a  collective  view.    This

"heartware" engineering of Singapore 21 is a long-term  project.

We  are only at the beginning stage.  We need a long process  of

deliberation to come to a consensus like the Big Self.   I  hope

that  one  day,  everyone  of us in Singapore  would  have  this

passion  to  do his best to contribute all that he  can  and  to

shine   on   others,  and  to  respect  the  values  of   fellow

Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Singaporean should, first of all, respect the

parents, love the family and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1637</b></font><br><br>



contribute  towards society.  And I hope that every  Singaporean

would  have this fearless spirit to face the intense competition

ahead of us.  As we are evolving into a knowledge-based economy,

we  have  to courageously face the challenges ahead  of  us  and

strive  for  excellence.  We must use our talent as our  assets,

our local talents as well as the foreign talents, to create more

job  opportunities, more foreign investments so  that  Singapore

can become a society where everyone would have an opportunity to

pursue  his  dream.   I  hope that every Singaporean  will  have

loyalty  towards our nation, to be proud of our  nation  and  to

create the Singapore tribe as described by our Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, I hope that everyone would have this notion in

mind  that everyone has a responsibility in the destiny  of  the

society.   Everyone should lead by example.  We should take  the

lead  and  work  for the good of our nation.  The direction  has

been set in our Singapore 21 Vision. In this process of building

an  ideal  society, there may be times when we are going  uphill

and sometimes, we may be moving downhill.  Whatever it is, if we

are not careful and adopt the mindset of the Small Self,  we may

roll  down  the slope.  But if everyone of us can look  at  this

Singapore 21 in the spirit of the Big Self, I believe we can all

move  uphill  and scale greater heights.  With the  stage  being

enlarged by this Singapore 21 for our nation building, the three

sectors  - the public, private and the people sectors  -  should

each  play  its  own  role,  respect one  another,  support  one

another,  and be dependent on one another to turn the  dream  of

this Singapore 21 Vision into reality.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, hon. Members may wonder why my name is listed  as

No. 7 to speak on this motion today and I am now speaking as No.

16.   The reason is very simple.  Just now, Dr Michael Lim  told

me  that  he  had  some important matters to attend  to,  as   a

patient was waiting for him at the hospital.  I felt that saving

life is very important. Mutual help and mutual



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1638</b></font><br><br>



co-operation are equally important.  I believe this is  part  of

the Singapore 21 spirit.  That was why I agree to swap with him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, today is the 6th of May. There are

only another 238 days more to the Year 2000.  In a short span of

just  a  few  months' time, we will be stepping  into  the  21st

century.  But  when we look at our neighbours, they  are  having

social unrest, political conflicts, revolutions and disturbances

resulting in a very uncertain situation.  But in Singapore,  our

Government has used this regional financial crisis to  test  our

people.   By presenting this Singapore 21 vision, it  paves  the

way  for us to march into the 21st century in a higher  key.   I

feel  that this is something which all Singaporeans should  take

pride in.  I would like to commend the Committee led by RAdm Teo

for  successfully bringing us this creative concept of  the  S21

vision  and  to lead Singapore into a better and more prosperous

society in the 21st century.  As such,  I support this motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it has often been said, everyone has a role to play in

the  survival  of our country.  When the country is  prosperous,

all  its  citizens  are happy and proud.  But when  the  country

meets  with  difficulties, everyone should hold up  his  or  her

responsibility to defend the nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ours is an enlightened society. Our policy is transparent.

Our  Government is  concerned with the well-being of our people,

and  it  attaches great importance to the views of  the  people.

The  setting  up  of the Feedback Unit  is a good  example.   In

order  to implement policies which are beneficial to our people,

and  to  build up consensus through consultation, our  Ministers

have been visiting the constituencies regularly to have dialogue

sessions with the people and to find out first-hand the problems

of  our  people.  We have also the Feedback Unit to collect  and

collate  feedback and views from our people.  In the past,  when

the   Government  departments  wanted  to  implement  some   new

policies, they would just carry on with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1639</b></font><br><br>



implementation without consultation with the people.  This  kind

of  "do  first  talk  later" attitude  had  incurred  a  lot  of

displeasure and dissatisfaction among the people.  But  now,  it

is  different.  With this consultation with the people, a lot of

misunderstanding can be cleared and problems resolved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you a few examples. First, the "Sale of

Tenanted  Shops"  scheme.   In the early days,  all  the  leases

issued by HDB were for 99 years. Recent changes in policy   have

resulted  in  a recommendation to reduce them to 30-year  leases

instead.  But before this policy was implemented, the matter was

referred  to the Feedback Unit to find out the response  of  the

people.   I personally convened and chaired a number of dialogue

sessions  with  the shop owners to hear their  views.  The  shop

owners were happy that they had a chance to voice their views on

the  matter.   In the process of these dialogue sessions,  there

were  some heated but very meaningful discussions.  In  the end,

we  presented  the  recommendations of the  discussions  to  our

Minister  for  National Development, Mr Lim Hng  Kiang  and  the

Minister  has  accepted the recommendations  of  these  dialogue

sessions conducted by the Feedback Unit.  The concept of  a  30-year  lease  for  the sale of shophouses was announced  and  the

response  was  very good.  At the moment, many  shopholders  are

requesting that the Minister for National Development sell  more

shop  premises  to  them.  So we can see that  if  a  policy  is

implemented  after  consultation with the  people  concerned  it

would be strongly supported by the people and will receive  very

favourable response.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is the carpark for heavy vehicles. Many

drivers of heavy vehicles informed me that it was very difficult

for them to find parking lots for their heavy vehicles.  When we

presented  these views to the relevant authorities,  the  answer

was that the available parking lots were more than the number of

heavy vehicles.  So it was not a problem.  But from the feedback

given  by the drivers, we understood that they were still having

a  lot of problems parking their heavy vehicles.  I invited  all

the heavy-vehicle



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1640</b></font><br><br>



drivers  to  take part in our dialogue sessions.   I  discovered

that although there were enough parking lots, many of these lots

were  situated at some far away and remote places, such as   the

industrial park in Tuas or some isolated areas in Woodlands, and

these  drivers had difficulty going to the carparks in the early

morning  because there was no public transport to  go  there  to

pick up their vehicles.  We conveyed these views to the Minister

and  we  are indeed very grateful to Minister Lim Hng Kiang  who

graciously  directed that more car parks for heavy  vehicles  be

built  near  the  housing estates.  To a  certain  extent,  this

problem is resolved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From these two important examples, it clearly illustrates

that  consultations and discussions before implementation  of  a

policy  are  of utmost importance. I believe in the  process  of

implementing the cost-saving measures, the Government  has  also

conducted various dialogue sessions with the businessmen,  NTUC,

trade  unions,  and grassroots leaders. As a  result,  when  the

measures were implemented, they received strong support  of  the

people, and the implementation was smooth and successful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore 21 Vision Committee has reached out to some

6,000  people.  This has once again emphasised the  Government's

esteem of the views of our people.  Our airport is No. 1 in  the

world, our port is first-class, our workers' quality is also No.

1  in  the world.  Singapore is a small island nation.  We  have

this  achievement which every Singaporean can be proud  of.   We

have  so  many "No. 1" honours in our bag.  This is because  the

Government listens to the people, and the people are  given  the

benefit  of clear and transparent explanations  of the  policies

by  the Government  before they are implemented.  We are all  in

one heart.  We work together and the Government has placed great

esteem  on  the  views of the people.  Unfortunately,  there  is

still a small group of people, because of personal grudges,  who

have  raised  some arguments which could incite the  people  and

give rise to unnecessary misunderstanding.  That is regrettable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you a few examples. When we first implemented

this COE system, a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1641</b></font><br><br>



dialogue  session was conducted.  I was present at this dialogue

session.  The arguments for and against the concept was  debated

furiously  and rigorously at the session.  It was a very  heated

argument  indeed.  In fact, the argument was so heated  that  an

environment was created where  some unnecessary misunderstanding

was generated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second example was recently, in my constituency, when

we  announced this Selective En-Bloc Redevelopment  scheme,  the

main  purpose  was  to  resolve the  transport  problem  because

Hillview  Avenue is a place where we do not have  enough  public

transportation and many residents have approached me  and  asked

me  to  request  for this en-bloc redevelopment.   According  to

surveys,  more  than 90% of the residents supported  this  view.

But there was a small minority of people who objected to it, and

one of them asked me in the dialogue session, "What good is this

policy?   What good is this new development plan?"  I  told  him

one of the important advantages is that the new development site

is  very  near to the MRT.  He said, "I do not need an MRT."   I

asked  him  why.  He said, "I have a car.  I do not  need  MRT."

The other residents who were present shook their heads.  I said,

"Well, it is good that you have a car.  It is good for you.  But

80%  of  the  residents  do  not own  cars.   They  need  public

transportation.   MRT  is  a  very  effective  means  of  public

transportation."   We  can  see  from  this  example  that  this

resident was only concerned with his own personal interest.   He

looked at the matter purely from his own personal point of view.

One thing I was very happy was that when his wife heard what  he

said, she gave him a pinch and asked him not to pursue the line.

I can see that when the Government implements this policy, it is

for the advantage of the majority of the residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another example, as we all know about two years ago, Ang

Mo  Kio  had  a Main Upgrading Programme and there was  a  small

group of people, because of some personal problems, who objected

to the upgrading.  Even yesterday, I was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1642</b></font><br><br>



discussing  with DPM Lee on this matter.  Results of the  voting

for   MUP showed that in one of the blocks, less than 75% of the

residents supported the programme. As a result, when the MUP was

carried  out,  this  block  could not  be  upgraded.   When  the

affected residents came to know about it, they hurriedly went to

DPM  Lee  and  asked whether they could have  another  round  of

voting.  DPM told them, "No, you have only one chance to  vote."

When  you  look  at  this  whole thing,  you  should  take  into

consideration the benefits of the majority and not just your own

personal interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister said yesterday that ours is a multi-racial society, and we had to exercise mutual tolerance and

understanding among ourselves.  If anyone is to raise some  very

sensitive  issues, such as religious or racial  issues,  chances

are  that  they  will give rise to disputes and misunderstanding

which  will  result  in great harm being  done  to  our  nation.

Everyone of us should look at national interest first.  The  two

Chinese  characters for nation or country are:  "Guo  and  Jia".

Guo  is  nation, Jia is family.  Nation first,  then family.  We

must  first  have the nation before we can have the family.   We

must bear this basic principle in mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at the whole world, there are wars, famine and

poverty  everywhere.   When we look at  our  region,  there  are

unrests  and troubles.  But take a look at Singapore.   We  have

political  stability and a strong economy. Our people  live  and

work  in  peace and contentment. This proves that all  the  past

efforts of the Government are not in vain. The concerted efforts

of the people and the Government have reaped great rewards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the support from the people, we have become a

prosperous country. According to statistics kept by the People's

Association,  we  have presently 26,026 grassroots  leaders  who

have   created  and  contributed  much  to  our  nation.   These

grassroots  leaders  work  very  hard.   They  sacrifice   their

precious  time and money to work for the benefit of  the  nation

and  the  people.   We should also not forget the  10,000-20,000

voluntary  welfare officers who, out of love  for  their  fellow

citizens,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1643</b></font><br><br>



have  contributed much to society without asking for any reward.

I think we should give due respect to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the selfless spirit of these grassroots leaders

and  voluntary welfare officers should be given due commendation

and the value of their services should be recognised.   Although

we  have now more than 30,000 community leaders, this represents

only  1%  of  our population.  We hope that there will  be  more

Singaporeans coming forward to volunteer their services  to  the

nation.  I  suggest  that  the Government  issue  "Good  Citizen

Awards"   to  these  people, albeit  they are  just  1%  of  the

population.  But I feel that these good citizens could  be  role

models  for others to emulate.  We should encourage more  people

to come forward and do even more for our nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another 238 days, we will be going into the 21st

century.   I hope that the Government will take this opportunity

to   issue  2,000  "Good  Citizen  Awards"  to  those  who  have

contributed much to our society, and to encourage more people to

take  part.   Gradually, we can have more and more awards  being

issued.   Our  cohesion  will be enhanced,  and  then  an  ideal

Singapore  and an ideal home in the 21st century will be  within

sight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we hope that the people and the Government could

put  in  a  concerted effort to develop Singapore  into  a  more

prosperous and more progressive country.  Finally, I  wish  that

everyone  in  Singapore  would love his  country  and  love  his

family.   I hope that the Singapore 21 vision could be  realised

soon.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

rise  to support the Singapore 21 Report.  I think it is a  good

Report and we should all support it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went through the Report and I was quite impressed. I

came to page 54 and there was this short paragraph.  I will read

it out:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Fourthly, there should be an attempt to spell out the "out-of-bound markers" in more precise and transparent terms. When

these "OB" markers are clearer,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1644</b></font><br><br>



people  can  be encouraged to take a more active part  in  civic

life,  knowing that there is less danger of straying  into  them

unwittingly.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Committee has asked the Government to spell out these

out-of-bound  markers.  It is not specific.  The  Committee  did

not  specify any particular field where Singaporeans should  not

dwell  too  deeply into.  When I read this, I  was  thinking  of

areas like race and religion, but I am not so sure.  That is why

I want the Minister to clarify this point later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, the fact that this has been asked means that young

Singaporeans want guidance, clear boundaries, so that  they  can

think  and act within set rules, and they will not think  beyond

pre-set  boundaries.  Do young Singaporeans want this,  I  asked

myself,  to be told what they can say and what they cannot  say?

Can  this  be  the  basis  for creative  minds  to  flourish  in

Singapore?  Can we have meaningful discussion and thinking?  Why

do  people  need OB markers before participating in debates  and

discussion?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I read this, I was drawn back to the discussion I had

earlier on in this House when I asked for the toning down of the

call  on  foreign talent in this economic crisis.  I,  who  have

stood  in this House with a record of nearly 19 years of  public

service, was labelled by a Minister to be doing a disservice  to

my  country  for  bringing  up this  subject  in  this  Chamber.

Calling  for  toning  down a message is a  disservice,  I  asked

myself?  Then how can an ordinary Singaporean stand up to  raise

issues  when  such  treatment was meted out to  a  long-standing

fellow MP?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no wonder that the Committee has asked for OB

markers,  so  as  not  to "stray into them  unwittingly".   That

request for clear guidelines or OB markers could reflect a  lack

of  confidence  people  have  in their  judgment  and  in  their

thinking.  I just want the Minister to enlighten this  House  on

why this recommendation was put into Singapore 21, as I feel  it

is contrary to openness and creativity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened to the discussion on foreign talent very

carefully, because I started it in this House, and now I am less

clear about



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1645</b></font><br><br>



the  term  "foreign talent".  It would seem that we are throwing

the  net  very  wide,  to  include people  like  SIA  girls  and

hairdressers.   To  me, there is a difference between  need  and

talent.  I think it is corporate wisdom to employ Japanese girls

to be SIA stewardesses to serve the Japanese sector.  That is  a

need  and  we  should encourage that.  It is also good  that  we

should employ European girls to man the European sector and,  of

course, Indian girls to man the Indian sector.  But that is  not

talent.   To  me, it is a need.  Therefore, I want to  be  clear

now.   Later,  I hope the Minister or someone can tell  me  what

"foreign talent" really stands for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand if we get an international figure like Mr

Olds  to  look  after  DBS  Bank.  He  is  well  known.   He  is

knowledgeable.   We  all  accept it and  most  Singaporeans  too

accept  it.  It seems that if you talk to Singaporeans  and  say

that foreigners are now talented people, they would say that  we

surely must have local talents too.  We must give Singaporeans a

sense  of  pride  being Singaporeans.  If not, this  S21  Report

carries  no meaning.  We want Singaporeans to stand tall.   Yet,

we  give  too much praise on foreigners.  We have good  bankers,

good  business  leaders, administrators and they  must  be  very

good,  or else Singapore cannot be what we are today.  We rarely

single  out  such  people for recognition.   We  take  them  for

granted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure we must have many Singaporeans who will be good

role models for younger Singaporeans, and we should highlight

these people who have made good in their respective fields.

Professor Tommy Koh, for example, Fock Siew Wah and even Philip

Yeo.  I criticised him but I respect that man, because I think

he has good talent.  He has got vision.  He can go round the

world and scout for good and appropriate industries to come to

this country, so that they can set up factories here and give

jobs to our people.  That is talent.  So we should, in fact, pay

a little bit more emphasis to our local talent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give another example. We always cite Christopher

Tan as a foreign talent,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1646</b></font><br><br>



but  I  think  he is a local talent.  I know him.   We  went  to

school together.  We went to university together.  We stayed  in

the  same  college.   He  took  up biochemistry.   But  he  left

Singapore,  and  he went to Calgary and made  a  good  name  for

himself.   He stayed there and he established a good  name.   We

are  proud of him and we brought him over.  But now we call  him

foreign talent.  Maybe he has not changed his citizenship.   But

these are our own local talent, and we should be proud of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Singaporeans deserve a clearer definition of

"foreign  talent".  Who are these talented  people?   I  am  not

against foreign talent.  I want it to be very clear.  But I want

us in this House to let Singaporeans know who are these talented

people.   Have we, for example, any figures to show Singaporeans

that the number of such talented foreigners working here is  not

a threat to them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is all I want to say, Sir.



<br>5.41 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Senior Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

first, let me congratulate the members of the Committee and  its

Chairman for having spent so much time and effort to crystallise

6,000-odd views into a few pages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The discussions in this House, which I have read and

sometimes  listened to, give hope that what we  started  umpteen

years  ago  is being pushed forward.  No society is static.   No

society  remains,  either going up or going down.   We  did  the

easier   part,   getting  raw,  basic  clashes  to   be   muted,

distributing the population into mixed housing estates,  sending

them to the same schools, preventing them from segregating.   It

will take much more to get them to finally accept each other and

begin to trust each other.  And it takes just one mishap and you

will  find  segregation begins all over again.  Only  those  who

have  seen in raw life what happens to people when they clash  - and  your  uniform is your face, your shape, your  appearance  - will understand what primeval hate is.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1647</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now have a stable, quiet, relatively placid situation.

And  on  this, we build.  I have seen societies of a  very  high

standard go down in its civility.  The Britain I went to in  the

1940s,  after  seven years of war - 1939 to 1945 -  was  a  very

civil  society,  which  I  admired greatly.   Now,  bombs,  lone

bomber, IRA bombs, football hooligans.  What went wrong?   I  do

not  know.   Immigrants?  Travel? Foreign influence?   TV?   But

something has been lost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen the Japanese as conquerors and I saw them

rehabilitate  and re-establish themselves.  I  could  not  help,

reluctantly, but admire their sterling qualities as a nation, as

a  race,  the Yamato race.  And they have all the advantages  of

homogeneity, solidarity and total commitment to each other.  But

even  they  now,  under  the impact of  globalisation,  open  to

foreign  influences, are faced with heart-wrenching problems  of

both their economic restructuring which will alter the nature of

their  society  and life-time employment, and also  the  way  in

which  they  interact  with the world.  Japan  now  has  over  a

million  families  working abroad.  How do  they  re-absorb  the

children of these engineers, executives, managers who have  been

educated  in Japanese schools but exposed to foreign influences?

I  know  of Japanese diplomats who have travelled all  over  the

world  with their families, and their children have been  unable

to  fit  in,  and  have  settled in Los Angeles  or  London,  or

elsewhere.  They are faced with very serious problems of change,

and so are we.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past is valuable in telling us how we got here, and

having  us  understand what are our perils, what are  our  fault

lines, and do not mistake them.  They are not going to disappear

in  20,  30,  40 years.  But if we are aware of it, it  is  like

living  with an earthquake fault.  We can build buildings  which

may be able to stand the shocks.  That is my hope.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am disappointed with the Opposition, particularly Mr

Chiam.    It  is  Singapore's  culture  that  if  you  are   the

Opposition,  you  oppose.  And he is unable  to  see,  good  man

though he is in many ways, that this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1648</b></font><br><br>



is a basic issue of the future of our society.  He says it is  a

PR  effort.   Enormous amount of energy, work went into  it!   I

read  the  Committee's  deliberations or summaries  of  it,  and

congratulated and encouraged the Minister for Education.  It  is

in  the right direction.  But it is not easy, and it will not be

accomplished  in one generation.  Some of the things  that  some

Members  have  spoken of may not be achieved in 20  generations.

You  can have cultural change and acculturation.  But to have  a

DNA change, to have it into one melange, that is not easy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will we become one tribe? Not possible. If we try, we

will  bring  misfortune to ourselves.  Because there are  tribal

elements  in  our society that say: I want to  be  myself.   The

Sikhs  do  not  want to be absorbed.  The various  Muslim  sects

themselves do not want to be absorbed by other sects, let  alone

by  other religions.  And I say, leave well alone, let  us  find

common  ground, because those are the cards that we  were  dealt

with.  So much easier if we are all one race, one language,  one

religion.   And that was Jafaar Albar's cry when  he  wanted  to

beat  us  down:  Satu  bangsa, satu bahasa,  satu  ugama.   That

excludes me, of course, and excludes a lot of other people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, having gone through that stress, we came to the

conclusion  that  we have to be the opposite, tolerant  of  each

other,   accommodative,   multi-racial,  multi-lingual,   multi-religious,  multi-cultural.  In other words, I am  not  foisting

myself  on you.  But we face severe challenges.  What  has  gone

before cannot be extrapolated easily into the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last eight and a half years since I resigned as

Prime  Minister,  I  have  had the advantage  of  time  and  the

opportunity to attend meetings with top bankers, top  executives

in  different parts of the world, and I have concluded that  our

previous aspiration of becoming the centre for Southeast Asia is

inadequate, because this is a global stage, whether you like  it

or not.  Therefore, to play in this global market, you must have

talent of a global standard.  Perhaps more time should be  spent

to get this message across.  Maybe



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1649</b></font><br><br>



the Member for Ayer Rajah would better understand.  Yes, we have

good  bankers.   But  he  is  wrong, if  he  believes  that  the

Singapore banks are thriving because they are wonderful bankers.

Because  I  protected them with Koh Beng Seng.  I prevented  the

foreign banks from opening branches and having ATMs, and allowed

Singapore   banks  to  place  their  ATMs  and  their   branches

throughout  all the HDB estates, and they grew.   And  now  they

have  become important financial international institutions  for

us.   But  if they continue to play in that league, we  will  be

wiped  out.  Why do I say that?  Because of the speed with which

technology is going.  Because I have been exposed as a member of

an  international advisory board of a big American bank, I  have

seen  the speed at which they themselves are changing, and  they

are  spreading throughout the world.  And we cannot  stop  them.

We can continue with this protectionism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gave away productivity prize at Suntec City to some 30,

40  people.  One of them was a Citibank man, and Citibank is one

of  the  best retail banks in the world.  So I asked him,  after

the  ceremony,  "When we liberalise, what do  you  expect?"   He

said,  "I  will  treble my customer base."  I said,  "Why?"   He

said, "I have got international products."  Banking is no longer

just  taking  in  your  deposits and  then  lending  it  out  on

mortgages.  As a society matures, people earn enough to begin to

want  to  make  sure that their money is put to good  use,  will

multiply, and in their retirement, they have a comfortable  nest

egg.   So banks offer this.  A good bank has got a whole panoply

of  products.   What  is it you want?  Children's  education,  I

offer  you  this;  your  old age, offer  you  that.   Therefore,

Citibank   combined  with  Travellers.   Why?   Travellers   has

developed in America the most extensive network of customers  to

whom  they  offer  the widest panoply of products  -  insurance,

anything  you want, mutual funds, the lot.  But it has  not  got

the  international reach to customers world-wide.  Citibank  has

that.   They  came together.  And once they have  settled  their

internal problem of two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1650</b></font><br><br>



managements coming together, all those super-products which  our

banks  cannot think of, but which Travellers has already  worked

out,  and are all in computers, they will go worldwide, and  you

are wiped out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citibank does not want branches any more. With an educated

population, you only need an ATM.  And in time, you do not  even

need  any ATM.  You can do Internet banking.  You need  the  ATM

only for drawing out cash.  And once you have the cashcard,  you

do not need the ATM.  You put your cashcard, your smartcard into

your  computer, and you draw and you top up, or you pay in.   So

where is the ability of the Singapore Government to protect  our

four big banks?  It will be gone in 10 years or less.  So unless

we  move  forward,  and  fast, we are wiped  out.   We  will  be

marginalised,  and  marginal players in our own  domestic  base.

And  it is a very dangerous position to be in.  We will be  like

New Zealand.  They have been wiped out.  There is no New Zealand-owned bank that can back the New Zealand economy if it runs into

trouble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spoken to the bankers for the last six, seven years

to move, but they have run in the same old way, too comfortable,

please  give  us more time.  And they did nothing in  that  time

until we decided to move and we said, "Right, we will move.  DBS

and  POSBank  with  the  top  management  will  take  over  your

business."   That forced OCBC to start looking, to  upgrade  its

management.   It  wanted  a  Chinese because  it  thinks  it  is

important  that  the Chinese culture in the  bank  must  not  be

upset;  hunted and found Mr Alex Au, who made Hang Seng  Bank  a

success  in  Hong  Kong, and was taken by StanChart  in  London.

They brought him back here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is more than one man. Neither Alex Au nor Mr John

Olds  can  succeed unless they find a team to inject into  every

department the level of expertise that we will require  to  meet

the  competition.  Ten years ago, if you had asked me,  I  would

say  we were doing not badly in banking.  Now I am convinced  we

are  headed  down the hill.  And this is an enormous opportunity

for  us.   We  are one of the few countries, besides Hong  Kong,

where our banks are standing up.  We have got the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1651</b></font><br><br>



credibility;  we have the resources.  This is the  time  we  can

upgrade  ourselves  and  form partnerships  with  banks  in  the

region, upgrade them, inject capital, inject expertise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not just in banking. I could go on ad infinitum,

because I spend much time on it.  The same globalisation process

is  forcing  SIA and NOL to compete worldwide.   You  can  be  a

beautiful regional airline.  You will be marginalised.   Because

the  customer wants to go to odd places that SIA does not go to.

I  want  to go to Buenos Aires, Santiago.  The American airlines

are  going global.  The Europeans have seen the light  and  they

have  decided  they must have a few airlines  that  can  compete

globally.  So they have lifted their restrictions within  Europe

and  allowed  free competition, so that in the next  few  years,

two,  three or maybe more airlines will emerge who can then take

on the Americans and go global.  Then wherever you are stranded,

Seoul,  Nairobi,  Lagos, you just go to the  airline,  whichever

airline, and say, "Here is my ticket.  I want out."  We have not

got  the critical mass to go global.  So we have to team up  and

go  global  in a relay team.  So SIA, like it or not,  teams  up

with  Air  New Zealand, Ansett.  Coach-sharing alone with  Delta

Airlines  and  Swissair  does  not  work.   It  is  going   with

Lufthansa.   It  has got to go into some other network  so  that

when  you  book  into an SIA ticket, stranded  anywhere  in  the

world, there is this relay that will take you out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have to be a global player. That means your management

must  be  global,  of  that  standard.   Same  with  NOL.    NOL

unfortunately  bought into APL, just before  the  market  turned

down.   But if you want to be in that industry, you got to cover

all the Pacific Basin ports.  So it is in trouble and Temasek is

the  biggest shareholder.  Temasek decided to look for the  best

Chief Executive, shortlisted them and decided on a Dane who  ran

Maersk, one of the top shipping container lines.  It is the only

way we go.  Either we go that way or we are marginalised and our

horizon shrinks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we come to the total talent. Why do I bring up

unmarried graduate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1652</b></font><br><br>



mothers?   Because the talent pool cannot expand or even  retain

its present size if you take out of that pool your best mothers.

It is as simple as that.  And the impact is being felt.  We talk

of  creativity, entrepreneurs, initiative, drive, yes.   At  the

end, in any field, the top men have got top minds, good balance,

good  judgement.  You can take any member of any US Fortune 500.

And  that  is  drawing  out of a pool of  260-something  million

Americans.   We  have  3  million  Singaporeans  who   are   not

reproducing themselves in the optimal way.  If we do not draw in

these talents, we will be marginalised.  The other countries  in

South  East  Asia will offer markets.  The banks want  to  come.

Huge  customers  to  whom they can sell new products  which  the

local banks will not be able to offer.  All this will go on  but

so  long as Singapore has got its four banks competing, we  will

be all right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, every Singaporean counts. That is important. But

when the final decision is made, as with every committee and  as

with  every  Cabinet, some people's judgement counts  more  than

others.  And no Prime Minister will stay long in his job  if  he

does  not  understand that.  You listen to every Minister.   You

are not an expert in banking.  I was not.  You have to go by the

judgement,  having  read all the details,  whose  judgement  you

think  is sound.  And all this is possible only if there is  not

only leadership but a leadership that can interpret its will and

its plans into action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned a lot from the Catholic Church. They have lasted

nearly  2,000 years.  The churches that have no hierarchy,  they

have not lasted very long. We have the Quakers, Baptists, and so

on.   But this church has lasted 2,000 years.  They have a  core

of  Cardinals  who  then  elect  the  Pope.   And  they  have  a

priesthood  that keeps the faith and the flock.  We  need  them.

We  need  a core of people who are dedicated to the survival  of

Singapore  and  Singaporeans because every  Singaporean  counts.

But  for  their survival, we need this extra.  If your  computer

has  got  32  megabytes and you are putting in  a  program  that

requires  128, you'd  better go out and start buying  extra  and

put it in.  And if you find your Pentium II too slow, you go and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1653</b></font><br><br>



buy  your  Pentium III, or you are not in the game.  You  cannot

download, you cannot interact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it comes down to what kind of an administration do

we have that will be able to translate the ideas, the plans of a

Government.  And what kind of a political establishment  do  you

have  that  will  ensure that there is  a  flow  of  talent,  of

talented people, Singaporeans, and they have to be.  This is one

area where non-Singaporeans are out because I am entrusting  the

future of 3 million people into your hands.  And I want to  make

quite sure that your instincts are immediately for Singaporeans.

I  do not know whether other political parties will ever be able

to  duplicate  what we have done.  But the PAP has  built  up  a

cadre  of membership of several thousands of which some  80  are

Members of Parliament and a grassroots leadership which  Mr  Ang

Mong Seng has said is now 20,000-odd.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But most important is the core in the civil service of

expertise on how to run the various Ministries.  So at  the  end

of  the day, we need this framework.  Yes, we are safer now than

in  the  1960s which used to worry me because I could count  the

number  of  people on whom I had to depend to get  things  done.

But without that hard core, there is no Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have listened to Mr Simon Tay. I wish it were possible

that  just  by our being civic minded, by having more  NGOs,  we

will  throw  up another leadership.  It will not.  It  does  not

happen that way.  That is the problem many countries face.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, in Indonesia, they have to choose

between  an  elite which has been brought together by  32  years

under  President  Suharto.   It  may  or  may  not  be  able  to

completely  abandon  its  past, but it is  a  conglomeration  of

different  talents in Indonesia that has been able  to  run  the

country.  They may change at the top.  But the central  core  of

people who have been running the system, whoever gets to the top

will find that he has to draw from the same group.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1654</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the problem that the Malaysian opposition faces.

UMNO  has  been at the heart of Government since 1955.  Keadilan

has got to offer an alternative.  What is the alternative?  That

is their problem.  As a very shrewd political commentator, Samad

Ismail, said, "That's their problem.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the alternative? And that is Singapore's problem.

You  have  listened  to  Mr  Chiam.  You  have  listened  to  Mr

Jeyaretnam.   I ask you, "What is the alternative?"   I  am  not

interested in what political scientists say.  I am interested in

the  real  workings of Singapore.  Why have we brought Mr  Simon

Tay and the others in as Nominated MPs?  Because we want to hear

serious  men and women with serious ideas so that we can  engage

the  population in a dialogue.  But will you come out and  spend

the  next  30  years  of  your life running  around  building  a

grassroots  organisation?   And at the  end  of  the  day,  when

election  time comes, put up the posters, find the  people  whom

you can enthuse and vote for you?  That is a different problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that comes back to the nature of our society. You come

back  to  Singapore  21.   We  are not  Americans.   In  certain

respects,  I  wish we could have become more American  in  their

grassroots volunteerism.  Sometimes, late in the evening, when I

finish  with  my work, I will check with my wife  who  has  been

reading all the literature that I brought home.  All the various

associations send me their newsletters.  And she would  talk  to

me about the American newsletter.  This is 20, 30 years ago.  As

a result, they keep on sending it to me till today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early days, the first American expatriates came,

they  formed  a  committee to help other  expatriate  wives  and

families to familiarise themselves, where to shop, where to  get

doctors, dentists, what is reliable, what is not reliable.   And

they  formed committees to help newly-arrived wives  to  adjust.

The  American Embassy had nothing to do with it.  The  Singapore

International  Foundation  has  to  go  out,  send  people  from

Singapore to Sydney, Perth, Vancouver and London to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1655</b></font><br><br>



organise  them.  That is culture.  One has a civilisation  where

in  covered wagons they went across the prairies and fought  the

Red Indians and said, "I am going to form a town here.  And this

is  High  Street, this is Main Street.  I am the banker,  you're

the sheriff, he's the mayor.  Now, let's get going."  That is  a

different history, started with the Mayflower and a lot of other

shiploads of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a different past. And if you dismantle what we

have  done so far, you will never rebuild anything to  take  its

place in time.  We have got this far and I am greatly encouraged

that  we are pushing this big boulder up the hill.  And it needs

pushing  up the hill.  If you can achieve half of what this  S21

Report says, in the next 20 years, that is a tremendous triumph.

And it will require tremendous efforts to get there.  But I take

great  satisfaction that there is a team in place  that  can  do

this  and can listen to Tan Cheng Bock who has a different point

of view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On OB markers, let me put it very simply. If your

intention  is  to improve Singapore, you do not worry  about  OB

markers.  It is as simple as that.  It is when your intention is

to  twist your Minister's tail, to show that you are smart, that

is  risking  it.   I  think  Claire  Chiang  says,  "Should  not

criticise people when they make foolish suggestions."  But  this

is  part  of the open debate.  If you do not demolish  a  stupid

suggestion, it may take root and it would create problems for us

to  demolish it later.  It is a free country.  But you must  not

be  afraid.  No American is afraid to be demolished.   He  comes

out  with something stupid, he gets a clout, he shrugs  it  off,

maybe  comes up with another silly letter.  But in our  society,

face  is  important.  So we will try, when you twist my tail,  I

will only tweak your ear.  But this is a serious business and  I

think we should be able to make it. [Applause].



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Sir,

first,  I  would like to thank the Prime Minister for expressing

the  Government's strong support and acceptance of  the  report.

This  is a strong signal of the Government's commitment for  the

public sector to work hand-in-hand with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1656</b></font><br><br>



the  people sector and the private sector to achieve the  vision

of  Singapore 21. I would also like to thank Senior Minister Lee

for  joining  this  debate and providing his  unique  historical

perspective on the issues we face.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to thank all the Members who have spoken in support

of the motion and for their strong endorsement of the vision set

out in the report. I appreciate the time and effort that Members

have  taken,  not just to read the report, but to study  it  and

provide their own views and interpretations of what this  vision

means  to  them.  This vision provides a compass, the guideposts

as  we  move forward into the 21st century.  Our discussions  in

this House have given more substance, fleshed out the ideas, and

will contribute towards making this vision a reality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Prime Minister reminded us that we are a

state, but not yet a nation.  He put this debate on Singapore 21

in perspective.  Nation-building is an on-going task.  It is the

work  of  many  generations.  Our people are  made  up  of  many

strands,  with  different  languages,  cultures  and  religions.

These strands will not dissolve into one indistinguishable mass,

nor  would  we  want this to be so.  We are closer  today  as  a

people  than we started out as a country 33 years ago.   But  we

should  not  try to homogenise everyone.  In the House,  in  the

corridors,  I have already been asked, "We have got the  English

version.  Where is the Chinese, Tamil and Malay versions?"   The

same  ideas,  the  same vision, but we want  to  read  it  in  a

language that is most comfortable to us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Prime Minister said, we should maximise the area of

overlap, while leaving enough space for each group to grow.  The

self-help  groups  are  one such example.   Where  we  can  work

together,  we should.  But the strength of the self-help  groups

is that they can address issues specific to each community in  a

way  that  is most comfortable for the community.  These  issues

may  precisely be the ones that are the most fundamental and the

ones which need to be solved in order for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1657</b></font><br><br>



the issues to be overcome, and the problems to be tackled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each community needs its own space. Each community wants to

retain  a connection with its roots. But we also need a unifying

vision  to  draw these strands together - to give  us  a  common

goal,  a  common purpose, so that we can strive forward together

as a nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multi-racialism, meritocracy and incorruptibility have been

the cornerstones on which our country is built. On top of these,

we  can add another layer, the five key ideas of Singapore 21 to

guide  us  into  the future - Every Singaporean Matters,  Strong

Families,  Opportunities  for All, The Singapore  Heartbeat  and

Active  Citizenship.  I agree with Dr Ong Chit Chung  about  the

dangers of unbridled individualism and self-interest.  The  five

ideas  have  to  be  taken in context  and  all  together.   The

individual has to be placed in the context of community,  family

and nation, and Mr Lim Swee Say has expressed this well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of coming up with the Singapore 21 report is,

in  itself,  an example of the possibilities and the limitations

of  consultation. It was quite an exercise for  the  77  subject

committee  members to consult and solicit feedback as widely  as

we   did.  The  subject  committee  members  spent  many   hours

discussing with various groups of people. We had over 80  forums

and discussion sessions.  In the time we had, a little more than

a  year,  we  managed to have reasonably substantive discussions

with  some  6,000 Singaporeans. Each of them, I have  no  doubt,

represents and reflects the views of many more Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But can we speak to every one of our 3 million Singaporeans

in  every consultation exercise, not just in Singapore,  but  in

every corner of the globe?  Sir, it is obviously not possible on

every  issue  to  consult every Singaporean directly.   On  some

issues,  like  the budget which Mr Ravindran referred  to,  pre-announcement consultation is not possible because of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1658</b></font><br><br>



market  sensitivity.   And good Finance  Ministers  and  central

bankers  all  over the world have developed the  art  of  either

maintaining a stoic silence or of making Delphic predictions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Singaporean can provide his feedback and express his

views.  There are no limitations and limits on this.  They  need

not  be  weighty national issues.  As any Member  of  Parliament

will   know,   constituents  regularly  provide   feedback   and

suggestions  on  what  might  be  considered  mundane  municipal

issues.   But  this  makes  a difference  to  people  living  in

neighbourhoods  and on the ground - should  a  bush  be  removed

because  it  obstructs the view of drivers and pedestrians,  can

the timing of the traffic lights at a junction be adjusted, what

is   the  best  way  to  deal  with  litter  or  crime  in   the

neighbourhood.  There are many examples which Mr Ang  Mong  Seng

has raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it has been in the discussion on Singapore 21. We

consulted as many as we could directly and every Member of  this

House,  every Singaporean, was invited to send his views.   That

is consultation and feedback.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about building consensus? During the consultation

process, among all the ideas and views expressed, a few surfaced

again  and  again, and gained prominence, not because they  were

expressed again and again, but because they have the most merit.

These  ideas  became  the five key ideas  of  the  Singapore  21

vision.   Not  every one might have agreed with them  initially,

and  even  at  the  end,  not every one might  agree  with  them

completely. But, we have to exercise our judgement,  decide  and

move  on.   That  is  also part of the process.  These  are  the

possibilities and the limitations of consultation and  consensus

building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a vision to guide us and a willingness to build a

consensus,  we  can  pull together as one people.  We  can  work

towards becoming a symphony - playing in harmony; rather than  a

cacophony  producing  a  discordant and meaningless  mixture  of

sounds,  with each stubbornly insisting on playing  to  his  own

tune, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1659</b></font><br><br>



not  listening to what other people are playing.   That  is  the

difference  between  a society based on a  vision  of  consensus

rather than a lack of vision based on contention.  The energetic

and enthusiastic contributions of NMP Mdm Claire Chiang stand in

stark contrast, a refreshing contrast, to the approach taken  by

Mr Jeyaretnam, or the approach taken by Mr Chiam.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have achieved economic success through tripartism.

Workers,  employers  and Government work together  to  create  a

conducive  business  environment,  and  create  good  jobs   for

workers,  allowing the whole country to enjoy  economic  growth.

This is a model that is unique to us in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Magad spoke about the Singapore 21 vision calling

for  a new tripartism - a new tripartism this time in the social

sphere:   the  people sector, public sector and  private  sector

working  together.   Again, this can be our  unique  model,  our

unique solution to building Singapore's heartware.  Mr Lim  Boon

Heng,  Mr  Loh  Meng See, Mr Iswaran, Mdm Claire Chiang  and  Mr

Simon  Tay shared this call for a new tripartism.  Mr  Loh  Meng

See  asked whether Singaporeans possess the skills to be  active

citizens, while Mr Zulkifli Baharudin and Dr Michael Lim  called

for  a mindset change in the public service so that we can build

a cooperative relationship.  Well, I think we all have to take a

step forward.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This vision of social tripartism is a compelling vision,

with  people  sector organisations, public sector  organisations

and private sector organisations, coming together, all taking  a

step  forward together, reaching out to each other  and  looking

for  ways  in which they can work with each other to  strengthen

our social capital, the heartware, of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran and other Members have asked, "So, what's

next?"   Some Members, Mr Chew Heng Ching and Dr Lily  Neo  have

asked  the Government to take the lead in implementing Singapore

21.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of the Government, the public sector has

already been asked to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1660</b></font><br><br>



review  its  policies and programmes, to ensure  that  they  are

aligned  to the Singapore 21 vision - not Y2K compliant but  S21

compliant.   But what more should the Government do?    Left  to

itself, the momentum of the Singapore 21 vision created  by  the

debate  in this House may slacken and dissipate, because of  the

wide  range  of issues and interests. I would therefore  propose

that  the  Government  also play the  role  of  facilitator  for

Singapore  21  to  guide  the process  along,  and  provide  the

necessary support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have consulted the Prime Minister on this, and the Prime

Minister  has agreed.  Once the House endorses the Singapore  21

vision,  the Prime Minister will ask the Minister of  State  for

Defence,  Mr David Lim, to consult with various stakeholders  of

Singapore  21  - the people sector, the private sector  and  the

public  sector - to see how their initiatives can be facilitated

to  make Singapore 21 a reality.  This could take the form of  a

Singapore  21  Facilitation  Committee.   Its  task  is  not  to

implement  the  Singapore 21 vision.  Rather, it would  help  to

strengthen and sustain the process of active citizenship, and to

provide  encouragement and visibility for  the  efforts  by  the

people,  private  and  public  sectors  as  they  work  to  make

Singapore 21 a reality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore 21 involves individuals, families, the

community and the nation. Singapore 21 is not the responsibility

of  any one person or body or agency.   There is no Ministry for

Singapore  21.   It  is the responsibility of  everybody,  every

agency,  every  Singaporean, to interpret these  key  ideas  and

translate  them into plans and actions. Only then  can  we  move

forward to make Singapore 21 become a reality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge Members of this House to take this message to their

constituencies,  and  to  stress  these  key  ideas   in   their

constituency activities and functions.  I ask those contributing

their time in the people sector, those serving in the public and

private  sectors,  to consider how they can  work  more  closely

together.   All  these  will help make  Singapore  21  become  a

reality.   Deputy Prime Minister Lee, in his address  to  senior

civil servants on 29th March this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1661</b></font><br><br>



year,  has already asked the public service to consider  how  to

build  the  ideas  of  Singapore 21 into their  programmes.   On

Tuesday,  you  heard  the  Minister for   Community  Development

announce  a  number  of initiatives, for example,  the  National

Volunteer Programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge every Singaporean to re-examine himself, his goals,

his attitudes to success, his attitudes to his family and fellow

Singaporeans;  and  to come forward to play a  greater  role  in

community  life.   Mr  Chan Soo Sen put it nicely  in  Confucian

terms.  We also heard stories from the Ramayana.  Other Members,

Dr  Teo  Ho  Pin, Dr Toh See Kiat, Mr Tay Beng Chuan and  others

came  up with their views on what the ideal Singaporean  or  the

ideal  society  should be. Prof Chin Tet  Yung  put  it  nicely.

Every Singaporean, any Singaporean, can lead a happy, successful

and fulfilling life.  He can be a good parent, a good neighbour,

and  an active citizen.  And he can say that in all this, he did

his best.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it leaves me now to once again thank Members of the

House for supporting the S21 vision so enthusiastically, and for

providing such thoughtful insights. I also wish to thank all the

members of the Singapore 21 Committee who have worked for over a

year  to bring clarity and focus to the varied views which  they

have  heard from Singaporeans from all walks of life.   I  thank

everyone who has contributed to forging the Singapore 21 vision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After today, we will move on to the next phase - a far more

challenging  phase  -  of turning this vision into reality.   In

the  past  few  days  we  have heard heartwarming  stories.   Mr

Bernard Chen spoke of how his father came to regard Singapore as

home.  We are glad that

he did, and fortunate that he did, as Singapore is the better by

two  Members of this House.  Members have shared with  us  their

innermost thoughts and personal feelings as they struggled  with

their own dilemmas in life.  Let these stories from the past  be

held  up as good examples for all of us  -  of committed, active

citizens.   And let the icon of the kiasu Singaporean fade  into

20th  century, and, in its place, emerge the active  Singaporean

-   the  Singaporean of the 21st century, the icon  of  the  new

Singaporean.    Beyond   looking  out   for   ourselves,   every

Singaporean must look out for the larger Singaporean family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my hope that every Singaporean, each in his own way,

will  stand  up  and  be  counted, and find  a  way  to  make  a

difference to his family, his neighbourhood, his community,  and

to  Singapore.   There  can  be  no  effort  too  small  or  too

insignificant.  And in the process, we would have built a better

future  for  ourselves  and  our children.    Let  us  all  work

together  to  translate the Singapore 21  vision  into  reality.

[Applause].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House endorses the Vision for Singapore in the

21st  century  as  set  out in the report of  the  Singapore  21

Committee  "Singapore  21: Together, We  Make  The  Difference",

contained   in  Paper  Misc.  2  of  1999,  as  the  basis   for

strengthening  the  heartware  of  Singapore  and  meeting   the

aspirations of Singaporeans.

<div align="center"><b>PORK VENDORS</b></div>





<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for the

Environment  (a) whether his Ministry is planning any  financial

assistance  schemes  either on its own or in collaboration  with

banks  to  assist pork vendors in setting up chiller facilities;

and  (b)  whether his Ministry will accord some  flexibility  to

facilitate pork vendors who decide to change their trade due  to

financial difficulties.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Environment Ministry has arranged with three financial

institutions  to  provide loans to assist meat  stallholders  in

buying  chillers. Four chiller suppliers have also come up  with

easy payment schemes to assist stallholders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stallholders who do not want to continue selling meat can

switch to selling other produce.
