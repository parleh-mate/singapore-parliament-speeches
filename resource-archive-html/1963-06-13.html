<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 24 -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for Head 24 be

reduced by $100."



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, last night, I mentioned that the  Public

Works   Department  is  closely  connected  with  every

citizen  of Singapore. The efficiency and work of  this

department  have a very great effect on the future  and

livelihood  of the people. We see that the  expenditure

of  this  department for this year is the same as  that

for  last  year. Its duties and tasks in the past  have

been of great concern to us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night, I also said that in the rural areas,

there are many bridges, roads and drains which are in a

very  bad  condition. Weeds are also  found  along  the

roadside. The P.W.D. should not neglect its maintenance

and  repair work. We have not seen it carrying out  its

duties  in  the past year. In order that the roads  and

drains   in  the  rural  areas  can  be  repaired   and

maintained, the people in these areas must  first  wait

for  the Prime Minister to visit them. I have facts  to

back  up  what  I  say. Now all this  has  aroused  the

grievance  of  the people. They have to  wait  for  the

Prime Minister to visit them before work can be carried

out  by  the P.W.D. The impression is created that  the

maintenance  of  roads  and  the  building  of   social

amenities  in the rural areas is at the convenience  of

the   Prime   Minister.  This  shows  the  bureaucratic

practice of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the bridges and roads in the rural areas are very necessary for the people and they should be properly looked after by the P.W.D. If they are damaged or they are in a bad condition, this will have a great effect on the livelihood of the rural folks. If the roads are bad and the bridges are not kept in a

state  of repair, the eggs and agricultural produce  of

these people will not find their way to the market  and

this will result in a great loss for them. In the past,

the drains and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>



rivers  in  the rural areas were looked  after  by  the

P.W.D. every two or three months, but now this work  is

handed  over to the Work Brigade which is not  carrying

out  the work of regular maintenance done in the  past.

Therefore, we can see lallang and weeds everywhere  and

some areas are flooded after rain, and, as a result  of

this,  the  people  in the rural areas  suffer  a  loss

because  their vegetables are destroyed. Obviously  the

duties  of  the  P.W.D. are very  important,  but  the

Minister   for  National  Development  has   not   paid

attention to the work of this department. He has handed

over  this  sort of work to the Work Brigade  and  they

have  not  carried out the work which should have  been

done,  thus  causing unnecessary losses  to  the  rural

people.  I am of the opinion that since the expenditure

for  this department for this year is the same as  that

for  last  year, the Government should  carry  out  its

responsibilities  to  the rural  people,  such  as  the

maintenance of roads, drains and bridges as it has done

in  the  past.  In this way, the rural people  will  be

greatly helped.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Tan Kia Gan):</b> Sir, as usual the Member for Choa Chu Kang is

talking a lot of rubbish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Head is Public Works, Recurrent. It concerns the

maintenance  and  repair of Government offices,  public

street light, roads, backlanes, drainage, sewerage  and

other services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member then brings up the Prime Minister's visits

to  constituencies.  He says that the  Government  does

work  only  after the Prime Minister has visited  these

constituencies. [Interruption]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the work of construction and development,

whether  in  the city or rural areas, goes on  all  the

time.  The  Member  knows it.  But  he  comes  to  this

Assembly  haranguing, hoping that  the  people  outside

will  believe what he says. But I think in general  the

people  out-side  already  have  the  Barisan  Sosialis

properly  assessed.  They know that  these  people  yap

rubbish.  They  do nothing in their own  constituencies

and they harp on "only when the Prime Minister goes  to

the urban constituencies that things are done."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the work of development in the rural areas goes

on  all the time. For the information of the Member for

Choa  Chu  Kang, in the rural areas from  1962  to  May

1963,  we  spent $784,460 on laying 173 standpipes  and

also making water supply available to Pulau Tekong.  We

also  spent  $2,492,000 supplying rural electrification

schemes  for  33 kampongs. We also lit up  100  kampong

roads,  spending $240,186. We lit up 68 public  streets

at a cost of $455,195.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also made up 194 kampongs and access roads to the

tune of $1,125,318 for the making up of these roads.  I

would  not have brought this up if the Member for  Choa

Chu  Kang had not brought up the idea that we  are  not

doing  anything  for the people of Singapore.  Although

this  is a Head which concerns only maintenance, he  is

talking about development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also mentioned something about the Work Brigade

doing  the  work  of the P.W.D. It  is  true  the  Work

Brigade has taken over certain functions of the P.W.D.,

like  grass  cutting, desilting drains  and  all  these

things.  But what these people from the Barisan benches

ever  since we had this Budget sitting have been trying

to  say is that we do not do anything for the people of

Singapore, and that it is only when the Prime  Minister

visits  the place that we are doing something  for  the

people  of  Singapore.  If they  were  in  their  right

senses, they would not have been saying such things.  I

suggest that the Member for Choa Chit Kang get his head

examined.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  this Head 24 concerns  the  maintenance

fees  of  public  works. This Public Works,  Recurrent,

expenditure  should  be  spent  on  the  repairing  and

maintaining of roads and drains. However, the  Minister

for  National Development has said that we the  Barisan

Sosialis Members have not been working on our own. This

problem  will cause no surprise. As far as  the  Public

Works Department work is concerned, the P.A.P.'s policy

is  to  classify  the  works into  several  categories.

Firstly, it is whether the area concerned belongs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>



to  the Ministers' constituencies. If it is so, then if

there is any complaint, undoubtedly the Government will

have the work done in that constituency. Next comes the

constituencies of the Parliamentary Secretaries.  If  a

Parliamentary  Secretary and a Minister apply  for  the

same  work to be done, of course, the priority will  be

given  to  the  application of the Minister.  Thus  the

Parliamentary Secretary comes next. The third  category

are  the  Back-benchers, and there are also first-class

and  second-class  Backbenchers.  Those  who  are  more

obedient  are  classified  as first-class  Assemblymen.

Those  who  are querulous or quarrelsome are classified

as  second-class  lack-benchers. So in  the  Government

departments there are four categories of services. Even

in the Government departments there are four classes of

work.  So if the people want any drains or roads to  be

repaired  or  maintained or any  street  lights  to  he

installed, they have to go to the Minister. If they  go

to the Minister, then the work can be done. They should

go  to  the  Minister first. If they  cannot  find  the

Minister,   then  they  must  find  the   Parliamentary

Secretary.   If  they  cannot  find  the  Parliamentary

Secretary,  they  must  go  to  the  first-class  Back-benchers;  and then comes the last. If they go  to  the

Barisan  Sosialis Assemblymen, they will not  have  any

hope  of  having the work done, because the application

will be thrown into the waste-paper basket. This is the

policy  of  the  P.A.P. That is why the  constituencies

belonging to our Assemblymen do not have any work done,

because in the Government itself there are four classes

of work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember before I left the P.A.P. I made an

application  that the areas in Market  Street  and  Tew

Chew   Street  should  have  their  roads  and  streets

repaired. I made the application in May 1961. At  first

it  was  intended  to carry out the work.  But  when  I

became  an Opposition Member this work was not  carried

out.  No wonder the Minister was saying that we Barisan

Assemblymen have no work to do, because, as far as  the

people are concerned, they have found out that even  in

the   Government  Party  there  are  four  classes   of

Assemblymen.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the people in Singapore wish to have some

improvement   in  their  life  and  in   their   social

amenities,  they must, first and foremost,  topple  the

reactionary  and colonial stooge Government.  Otherwise

they  will not be able to have anything done for  them,

because  in  the whole parliamentary democratic  system

the  Opposition should he a component part of  it.  But

the  P.A.P. has discarded the Opposition Members as far

as   public  works  are  concerned.  They  play   party

politics. Ordinarily if any application is put  forward

to  be  done,  it should be considered. But  today  the

situation  is  different. If it happens to  be  second-class  Assemblymen  of  the  Government  Party  or  the

Opposition  Members, we have to wait. Today the  P.A.P.

policy  is  such  and  it is not  surprising  that  the

Minister  for  National Development has said  that  the

Opposition Members have no work to do. This is  because

in  the  Government Party itself there are four classes

of Assemblymen. That is why our applications were never

considered.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It appears to he an invitation to the

Government Backbenchers to reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of National Development (Mr Chor Yeok Eng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, just now after listening to the Member for

Havelock,  I  am  surprised that  the  Barisan  Members

should  have  introduced themselves  because  they  are

blowing their own trumpet. He feels that the people  of

Singapore  are not intelligent. I think all this  is  a

waste  of time for this House. The allegation  made  by

him just now is that when applications were made for  a

certain job to he done, they were not approved and  the

work  was  not done. This is all rubbish. I  can  quote

examples  to  prove  that even work in  the  Opposition

Members' constituencies has been carried out. It is not

true  to  say  that only applications coming  from  the

Government  constituencies are  approved  and  work  is

carried  out  there. While he made such allegations  he

should also substantiate them. According to him,  there

are  certain  roads which need to he repaired  but  the

repair  has  not been done. He is the Member  for  that

constituency. But at present he is interested  only  in

his own party politics



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>



and the work that should have been done by him has been

pushed on to us. If he has made any application for any

work  to  be done, and if nothing comes out of it,  why

does  he not make an inquiry about it? I can tell  this

House  that  what they are interested  in  is  not  the

livelihood and welfare of the people. As far as I know,

what  they are interested in and what worries them most

is how to go about extorting from the people. If people

do  not  subscribe to them, then they  will  intimidate

them. I can get many people to substantiate what I say.

When  debating  on  the Main Estimates,  they  are  now

talking   of   the  so-called  people's   welfare   and

livelihood.  Now  on  Sundays or weekends  they  go  to

people's houses to force them to donate money  to  them

and  to  their front organisations, such as  the  Rural

People's Organisation. They are trying to extort  money

from the people.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> These points are irrelevant. Are there

any other points the Parliamentary Secretary wishes  to

make?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): No.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under

this   Head  there  is  an  item  for  maintenance   of

Government quarters, barracks and grounds. I would like

the  Minister  to tell us how many Government  quarters

are now still vacant, particularly of the Class I type.



<br><br>3. 00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> I do not have the information with

me,  but  if  the Member likes, I can let him  have  it

tomorrow.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Could the Minister say whether

there are any -  even without the numbers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> No, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

do  not  know what the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Minister for National Development was speaking about. I

made an application in May 1961, i.e. before I left the

P.A.P. if he wants evidence, well that is easy. We  can

go  to the Director of Public Works and ask for it. But

now, if we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>



want  to  make an application, we have to go  here  and

there  and  the result will be nil. It is usually  like

this:  the  Director  will tell us  that  we  have  our

difficulties and he has his, and the result will  again

be  "No". The Parliamentary Secretary does not know all

about this. Frankly, he is very inexperienced. What  he

is  interested  in is pig-rearing and  the  keeping  of

goats and sheep.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that the Parliamentary Secretary

said  that they did some work in the constituencies  of

Opposition  Members. Actually it is this: because  they

are  the Government, they know that if such work is  to

be done on a certain day of a certain week, they see to

it  that before the work commences they go to that area

and take a look. After the work has actually been done,

the  people will say. "Well, this work was done by  the

P.A.P."  But  this  cunning  tactic  cannot  cheat  the

people.  This  actually  is the responsibility  of  the

Government  and they should do it. They  cannot  escape

from it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked why we did not do these things. It was

because they prevented us from doing them. Some of  our

people  used  their own labour to open  up  drains  and

build bridges, and sometimes they were interfered  with

by the Government saying that they had first to satisfy

certain laws and regulations. This is the policy of the

Government nowadays.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker, actually I did not wish to join in the  debate

on  this  subject  of the Public Works Department.  But

since  several Members of the Barisan Sosialis opposite

have  repeatedly  mentioned the  visits  of  the  Prime

Minister, I feel that, as a responsible Member  of  the

Government in the Ministry of the Prime Minister, it is

proper for me to participate in this debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the debate on this Head, this question of

visits   of   the   Prime   Minister   to   the   rural

constituencies has been repeatedly mentioned. To  them,

the  question is like an atom bomb, because it  exposes

the dirt of the Barisan Sosialis to the rural folks.  I

feel that only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>



those who deliberately close their eyes can fail to see

the achievements and projects that have been carried

out in the rural constituencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the term of office of the P.A.P., we have

established  the Urban and Rural Services  Consultative

Committee  which was previously headed  by  the  former

Parliamentary  Secretary to the Prime Minister,  now  a

Member  of  the Barisan Sosialis. Its members comprised

the Members for Choa Chu Kang, Toa Payoh. Changi. Jalan

Kayu - if I am not mistaken - and also I think the  Member

for  Pasir Panjang. However, Mr Speaker, if  you  will

peruse the minutes of the previous Committee, you  will

find  that,  at  the  time when  the  Barisan  Members

defected from the P.A.P. not a single minute was handed

to  the succeeding Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime

Minister.  When I took over from the Member  for  Upper

Serangoon  who went to Israel, I found that  standpipes

were  meant for Choa Chu Kang only. The Member for Choa

Chu  Kang,  at  one time, was acting as a Parliamentary

Secretary.  As he then was, lie was trying to  cut  his

coat  to fall in with Members of the Government. I  can

prove   that,  Mr  Speaker.  There  is  not  a  single

constituency  left out of the Government's  development

projects.  Perhaps when the Prime Minister  visits  the

rural  constituencies,  he  will  be  informed  by  the

constituents  of  the  projects  or  achievements  made

today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffice it to say, I think the people know who are

fond  of  twisting facts. Mr Speaker, forgive  me  for

quoting  an  analogy.  If the  intent  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  is  had, the smell will be  detected  by  the

people,  because works and projects such  as  drainage,

standpipes,  have,  in fact, been carried  out.  It  is

possible that some Members of the Barisan Sosialis have

approached  the Director of Public Works with  requests

to  get  work  done. It was wrong, because  we  have  a

Committee  for  this purpose, and they know  that  this

Committee is responsible for such work. So they  should

channel their applications to this Committee. As  Vice-Chairman  of  the Committee, I have never  received  an

application from Members of the Barisan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>



Sosialis for requests to carry out rural work in  their

constituencies.   But  the  Member  for   Tanglin   has

submitted an application for work to be carried out  in

his constituency. The Member for Kampong Kembangan, the

Member  for Southern Islands and the Member for Geylang

Serai too have submitted applications. But not a single

request  has been received from Members of the  Barisan

Sosialis.  This clearly shows that they have  neglected

the  interests  of  the  people  whom  they  claim   to

represent, because to date not a single application has

been  received  by  the  Committee  from  them  to   do

improvement work in those constituencies.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. May I remind the Parliamentary

Secretary  that  he is addressing the  Speaker?  He  is

pointing  in the wrong direction. I do not mind  if  he

points at the Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Yaacob (In Malay): Mr Speaker, I want to speak

on  this  point which has been debated since yesterday.

The  Barisan  claims that after the Prime Minister  has

paid  visits  to the constituencies that work  is  then

carried out. The purpose of the visits is to buy  votes - so  the Barisan claims. If I were to read in detail the

projects  that  have  been  implemented  in  the  rural

constituencies  for  the  information  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis, it will take a long time. If I am to  address

my  speech to people who are deaf, it will he the  same

as  tuning  on  my  radio in full volume  for  them  to

listen, and it will still not have any effect on them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, to prove that the people welcome the visits of the Prime Minister, they themse1ves submit memoranda with recommendations for consideration by the Government. If the Prime Minister visits the rural constituencies, the people who welcome him do not comprise only members of the Work Brigade. If Members opposite are prepared to accompany the Prime Minister

on  his visits, I am prepared to invite them to see for

themselves  the livelihood of the people. The  fact  is

that  they  are  not prepared to face the  constituents

themselves  because they have not done their  job.  For

that reason, the Prime Minister himself



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>



takes the trouble to visit the rural constituencies  to

face  the people so as to know their grievances. I wish

to remind the Barisan Sosialis Members of the speech of

President  Soekarno, "As the father of the Republic  of

Indonesia, all State machinery will be at my  disposal.

With  the  strength  of  the  State  machinery,  I  can

influence thousands, nay, millions of people.  But  one

thing  is  beyond my control, and that is, to get  each

and  every  person  who welcomes me  to  smile  at  me,

because  the  smile  comes from the heart  of  hearts."

Thousands  have welcomed the Prime Minister,  and  that

clearly   shows  that  the  influence  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis is coming to an end.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what we

are  asked to believe is that Members of the Government

are  all  hard-working people, that they are  generous,

that  they go around meeting the people in the kampongs

and in their houses and doing a favour to the people by

building roads, drains, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first of all, I will he generous and concede one

point,  and  that is that they are not idle.  We  agree

they are very active people. They do a lot of work,  it

is  because they are active and do a lot of  work  that

today  they still survive. Amongst the things they  do,

they  sit down and plot, and think of how they can  fix

political opponents ---



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> We are

fixed by you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> First year in office. Most of the time the

Prime  Minister spent was in plotting how best he could

fix  the Member for Hong Lim. The second year, he spent

a  lot  of time plotting how to fix Mr Lim Ching Siong

and  the rest of us. This is one of the things they do.

They  are very active. They use police and other agents

to  try  and  disrupt organisations  that  do  not  owe

allegiance  to  the P.A.P. They spend  a  lot  of  time

trying  to  find ways and means of how  best  they  can

disrupt, for example, trade union organisations.  Aside

from  activities like this, Sir, they build  roads.  We

are not saying that they are not building roads. We are

not saying they do not build drains, improve



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>



roads and undertake other development projects. What we

say,  in  the  first  place,  is  that  all  these  are

inadequate.  That is our first point. I am  quite  sure

the people agree with us that these are inadequate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly is this immediate and recent concern the

Prime  Minister has shown in the welfare of  the  rural

dwellers. The Prime Minister became the Prime  Minister

in June 1959. He did not go round the constituencies in

June  1959.  In June 1959 he did a victory  parade.  But

after, the whole of 1959, 1960) - no. When did he  start

these  so-called Prime Minister's visits to  the  rural

areas? Only recently. The reason is obvious. The  Prime

Minister's visits are a political stunt to catch votes,

and  I say the Government are dishonest if they do  not

admit this ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think we have had a very

lengthy debate on the Prime Minister's rural visits.  I

do   not  want  to  reopen  the  debate.  I  think  the

allegation  now is that the rural complaints  have  all

been  attended to, just because the Prime Minister  has

visited rural areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I do not want to reopen the debate. I just

want  to make this point because so much play has  been

made  of  this so-called desire of the Prime  Minister,

the  anxiety and concern of the Prime Minister over the

welfare  of the rural dwellers - a concern that  did  not

arise  during the three years in office, but  has  only

arisen in recent months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we realise that right at the moment, the

Government  is paying extra concentration on  improving

roads,   building  new  roads  and  other  construction

projects. We agree they pay greater concentration  now.

The  reason for this is very simple. The elections  are

around  the  corner.  It  will be  remembered  that  in

1957/1958, just before the last general elections,  the

previous government also concentrated on building roads

and  more  roads,  more post offices,  schools,  S.I.T.

flats ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> That is not what we said in the

election campaign.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> The Prime Minister, when he was on this

side  of  the House just before the elections in  1959,

had  said  these  things. His pupils  must  look  these

things  up.  The Prime Minister told the  former  Chief

Minister,  "You are now building more flats.  Yes,  but

still you are not going to win the elections." That was

proved correct, not because the Prime Minister said it,

but because the people cannot he deceived that easily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today if this talk of the welfare of the people,

the  needs  of  the  people  is  raised,  and  if  some

attention is paid to these things by the Government, it

is because they want to try and recover their political

stature. They know they are discredited. It is  like  a

desperate  dying  man clinging on to anything  that  he

considers  medicine that will cure him. We  tell  them,

"Do  it.  Take what you want. But one important  lesson

that  we  should learn from history is that you  cannot

deceive the people all the time" ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> That is true.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Then they have always said the time will

soon  come. Sooner or later, Sir, the people will  pass

judgment.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

That is his moment of truth, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> They are obviously overjoyed, Mr Speaker.

I  am sure you will agree that we have made a number of

calls for general elections in Singapore ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Keep

on calling.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> We made this call as early as 1961 ---



<br><br><!-- Madam Sahorah Binte Ahmat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Sahorah Binte Ahmat (Siglap):</b> Chakap besar!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. All this, of course, is

completely irrelevant. But I think the hon. Member  has

made   his  point.  We  are  still  on  Public   Works,

Recurrent,  that is, maintenance of drains and  bridges

and roads.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I just want to make this point, Sir. Who is

scared of meeting the people? This has been raised ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I quite agree it has been raised

on  the left side of the House and on the right side of

the  House. It has been raised time and again. It  will

not hear repetition. We have heard enough.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Very well, Mr Speaker, let it go at that.

I  just want to make this one final point, if they  are

today  building roads, flats, drains, these are because

by  obligation  they are expected to do  these  things.

Sir, the funds for this come from the people. The basic

obligation   of  the  Government  is  what   they   are

fulfilling now. There is nothing to take pride in this.

It  is no use telling the people, "You must he grateful

to  me  because I am building a road for you."  We  say

yes, you have got your budget. We approve the money and

you do the work because you are expected to do it ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> What have you done?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> --- and if you want to get credit.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I had not intended

to  participate  in  this debate, but  every  time  the

Member  for Thomson gets up to speak, he stimulates  my

interest  in  subjects in which I am not normally  well

versed.  But, however, Sir, some of the things that  he

has  been  saying, I think, call for some  reply.  For

example,  the  point he has been making  is  this.  The

Government has done a lot of good things. But it should

do  more. I agree with him. But what I want to know is:

What  have  the Barisan Sosialis been doing? They  were

all  elected  on  our  platform to  help  complete  our

promises ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> That is true.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Today, they are on the other side

criticising, destroying, obstructing. For example, Sir,

it  is true that the Prime Minister and lots of us  are

trying  to  catch  up with sonic other  work,  backlog,

mainly because after the second year, we spent a  great

deal of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>



our time, nearly two years, fighting the Communists who

were  trying  to  sabotage  a  major  platform  in  our

election  programme-merger and  Malaysia.  The  greater

part  of  two years which was vital to us was spent  in

combating   them,  stifling  them,  conscribing   them.

Therefore,  Sir,  if there are not enough  stand-pipes,

not  enough  roads, then I say the Communists  and  the

Barisan   Sosialis   bear   a   great   deal   of   the

responsibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the interesting things is that since the

Barisan  Sosialis left this side of the House everybody

is  well  aware that things are coming up.  Houses  are

coming up, schools are coming up, and a friend of  mine

has  told me that that proves that if you have a  water

pipe,  you will always get some dirt clogging the pipe.

If you remove the dirt, the water flows freely. That is

what  has been happening. After the Communists suffered

a   defeat   at  the  referendum,  people   have   more

confidence,  no more obstruction. All that the  Barisan

can  do  is to make occasional speeches here and there.

We  have been able to more than fulfil a great deal  of

our  programme.  And for that, I would  like  to  place

here,  Sir, I think, for the instruction of the Barisan

Sosialis,  a  pamphlet* produced by our Ministry  which gives  the  achievements of

the Government  during  the last 47 months, one month short

of four years. For  the convenience of those Members who

cannot read, there are lots  of  pictures too. I place

it here in the  Chamber for the information of Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Copy placed in the Assembly Library.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the proper place for that

is the Library.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian (Punggol)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  had not thought of speaking. But after hearing

the   Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister   for

National Development referring to Punggol constituency,

mentioning  that I did not know what was  happening  in

that constituency, I am now rising to speak a few words ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng:</b> Yes. (In Mandarin): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  did not mention Punggol constituency.  Perhaps

the Member was sleeping. I never mentioned him at all.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Parliamentary Secretary

himself  is out of order because it is not a  point  of

order. It is a point of elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I have not been

sleeping. He himself was sleeping. What he has said, he

is  now denying. He has said it just a little while ago

and now he has already forgotten about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember there have been a few incidents in the

Punggol  constituency. Since I am a  representative  of

that constituency, the people there came to see me  and

to  ask  me  to  try and solve their  problems,  and  I

conveyed  these  matters to the  Ministry  of  National

Development.   Later  on,  these  two   matters   after

investigation by the Minister for National  Development

were  finally  resolved  to the  satisfaction  of  both

sides.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I feel that this sort of work is the

responsibility  of the Government. As a  representative

of  that  constituency, I have a  duty  to  convey  the

opinions  of the people to the relevant departments  of

the  Government  in  order to help them.  So  when  the

Government  has solved anything for the  people  in  my

constituency, the Prime Minister should not take  pride

on account of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this incident happened only a few weeks

before the Prime Minister went to Punggol constituency.

I  remember  that  a few weeks before  he  went  to  my

constituency, there were a few P.A.P. members who  went

round  to  get  the  people  to  organise  a  welcoming

committee. But they could not find the chairman of  the

committee,  and  the Minister for National  Development

had to go there himself to look for him.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have completed the debate on rural

visits.  I do not want to reopen that debate. Is  there

anything on maintenance of drains, bridges and roads?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): What I want to say is

something  which  is related to the  chairman  of  this

committee.  On  the  day when the Prime  Minister  went

there,  this  chairman of the welcoming  committee  put

forward  a  suggestion to deepen  the  river  in  Upper

Serangoon.  He asked the Prime Minister  to  solve  the

problem  about this river. Later on, the P.W.D. people

went  there  to  investigate it. I had also  written  a

letter to the P.W.D., but the reply I received was just

a  printed  card  which states that  "the  problem  now

raised by you is now under consideration." Later on,  I

heard  nothing  about  it.  But  the  Chairman  of  the

welcoming  committee,  after sending  his  application,

managed to get the work done immediately. It seems that

his power and influence is greater than an Assemblyman.

This is very unusual.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua (Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chew Chua):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Member  for  Havelock has just now  said  that  when  a

Minister  sends in an application for work to be  done,

the  Government always attends to his work first.  This

is absurd. This is not correct. This is just to condemn

the  Government. At the last meeting of the  Urban  and

Rural Services Consultative Committee, the Minister for

National Development sent in a request to have  a  road

made  up. But I, as the Chairman, and committee members

turned it down. It is not a matter of our attending  to

the    Ministers    first,   then   the   Parliamentary

Secretaries,  and then the Assemblymen.  Our  committee

attend   to   all   Assemblymen  who  send   in   their

applications.  When a Member sends in  an  application,

for  example,  for  a standpipe at a certain  spot,  if

there  is  a standpipe not more than 50 feet away,  how

can  we  install  one more standpipe there?  Naturally-when  an  application is made, the Water Inspector  and

the Work Engineer visit the site and report back to the

committee. If we are not satisfied, we in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>



Committee visit the site to see for ourselves whether a

standpipe  is  necessary or whether the existing  roads

should  be urgently repaired. We always attend  to  all

these things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Members of the Opposition say that we only attend

to  Assemblymen of the P.A.P. constituencies.  This  is

utter  nonsense.  We  have been in the  Government  for

nearly four years now. Does it mean to say that all  of

us are stupid and that we do these things in the public

eye?  We  are not so stupid as the Opposition Members,

especially the Barisan Sosialis people. They are always

trying   to  mislead  the  people.  They  condemn   the

Government and they want it to collapse, so  that  they

can  come  to power. I would remind Opposition  Members

that  they  should  be very careful about  doing  these

things.  During the referendum, they went out  to  tell

the people, "Look here ---"



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I cannot allow a debate on the

referendum  now.  I  take  it  that  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  deals with the maintenance of drains,  roads

and bridges. Can we come back to that subject, please?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Thank you very much for your

advice,  Sir. They say that we did not attend to  their

constituencies.  The  Member for Changi  is  not  here.

Pulau Tekong is not a P.A.P. constituency. We installed

a  water  service there. We made roads for  the  people

there  too.  In  Changi, we also made many  roads.  The

Minister  for Health and Law met the people  of  Changi

and  he  has  put up a request to the Urban  and  Rural

Services  Consultative Committee for  more  standpipes,

the  maintenance  of roads, etc. In fact,  the  Barisan

Members do not go to their own constituencies, and they

do not know what the people need. That is the cause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu said that we have done

nothing.  I think he is just like a kayu. His brain  is

kayu. He comes here and speaks all sorts of rubbish and

incorrect things just to mislead the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Member for Queenstown said that the

P.A.P.  Government  has  done  nothing.  Just  now  the

Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>



for  National  Development mentioned that  millions  of

dollars  have been spent on street lights, stand-pipes,

and so on.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. May I remind the Parliamentary

Secretary  that the debate is that roads,  drains,  and

bridges   have   not  been  maintained  completely   or

sufficiently. That is the issue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Thank you, Sir,In fact, I went

down  to the Member for Upper Serangoon's constituency.

I found out that some of the roads were had, and I just

ordered the Work Brigade to repair them and also to put

up  street lights and kampong lights for these  people.

And  the  Member comes here and says, "We sent  in  our

application and the Government did not attend to it." I

just   want   to  tell  the  Member  this.   They   are

Assemblymen. They are not children. Be gentlemen.  Come

here  and  tell the correct things. We do not  mind  if

they  condemn us when we are in the wrong. But  do  not

condemn everything. The public know. When they read the

papers  tomorrow, they will know what  the  Members  of

this  House have been talking about and that the things

said are not correct.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the Member for Jalan Kayu

deserves a hearing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  it  is  unfortunate that my  constituency  is

Jalan  Kayu and that the Parliamentary Secretary should

compare me to a piece of kayu. We are criticising  that

they  have not maintained the roads and drains. On  the

contrary,  they  [Indicating]  are  boasting  of  their

construction and their works - (pointing to an officer

in the official gallery)



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It is completely out of order to

indicate  directly a stranger from  the  Floor  of  the

Chamber.  If  the Member has done so, he is  completely

out of order. The hon. Member must not do that. Has  he

done so?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I must have an answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I accept your

ruling, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is not enough to accept my ruling.

This  ruling has been given long ago - quite a number  of

months  ago.  I  think the Member  owes  the  House  an

apology for doing that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

accept your opinion, and apologise to you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, when I was a member of the Urban and Rural Services Consultative Committee, I know that many Assemblymen submitted their applications for work to be done in certain places. When the Prime Minister paid visits to the rural areas, he announced several projects which would be carried out. All these works are only part of what I had applied to be done in the

past.  If  the Government want to mention these  works,

they should also mention that I had applied for them to

be  done  in  the past. I know that it is difficult  to

carry out the work to the satisfaction of all. This  is

my  reply  to  some  of  the allegations  made  by  the

Parliamentary Secretary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the Government is either

corrupt  or  incompetent or is trying to  do  something

which  is  not realistic. Certain kampong roads,  after

having been completed a year ago, have now fallen  into

disrepair. Certain roads should be at least six  inches

thick. But perhaps some of the works on the roads  were

carried  out  by  contractors  and  the  work  was  not

properly done. That is why the roads are easily damaged

by water or the rain.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain drains were not properly built. They are not

according to the proper plan and this causes the  water

to  flood the road in the kampong area. That is why the

surface earth of the road has been washed away  by  the

flood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing is the improper manner in which they

maintain  the  roads. There are so many  holes  in  the

roads.  It is difficult for cars and vehicles  to  pass

over



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>



them. I have written to or rung up a Mr Mahideen.  But

my  application has not been considered. Certain  roads

are  so  bad  that they are impassable. These  are  all

facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had made some applications for stand-pipes. It was

only  just before the Prime Minister went to that  area

that  these stand-pipes were built. But the sites where

I had intended the stand-pipes to he built were changed

at the convenience of the Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the hon. Member wishes for a reply

to  his speech, he should at least give the Minister  a

chance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): There is one point

I  would  like  to  stress. It is that  they  are  very

unrealistic. They are either corrupt or incompetent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Yesterday I refrained from saying

something  which I will say now. This is  very  amusing

because  this  concerns the Barisan  Sosialis  and  the

United  People's Party, represented by the  Member  for Punggol. Very recently the Member for Punggol  rang  me up,  and he also wrote me a letter alleging that  there is  an  illegal prawn pond in Punggol. I bring this  up because  the  Member for Jalan Kayu said  that  he  was doing  work  for his constituents; that he applied  for

things to be done and that they were not done. Back  in

1960  he  did  not  apply for  a  permit  and  he  also

constructed  one of these prawn ponds  in  the  Punggol

area. It was demolished ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not see how that is

relevant to the maintenance of roads and drains, unless

it is maintaining a road to the prawn ponds.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> He wanted me to build a road to his

prawn  pond.  The Member for Punggol said that  it  was

only after the Prime Minister's visit to that area that

something was done. But he knows full well that we have

been  in  his constituency and working for quite  sonic

time  now and we also know what his constituency thinks

of him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Thomson mentioned something, that

you  cannot deceive the people all the time. I am  very

glad



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>



the  Barisan  Sosialis realise now that  they  can  not

deceive  the people all the time. He said that  it  was

our duty to do all these things. True, it was our duty.

We  planned  and we came to this Assembly  to  get  the

money to do all this work.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Time has expired.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $17,402,050 for Head 24 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 25 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 25 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (I)  of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Health and Law does not act like one as regards the strike of the nurses. He should show some responsibility in solving the problem, but he does not tackle it and leaves it to the Prime Minister. The other point is the cholera scare in Singapore. It should have been the responsibility of the Minister to

organise a meeting of experts in his Ministry to tackle

this  problem. But the work went actually to the  Prime

Minister's Office. So we see that the Prime Minister is

at present actually looking after that Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I wish to ask the Minister if he could

inform the House of the date when the last revision was

made  of the salaries and conditions of hospital staff,

including grades like nurses, student nurses, assistant

nurses, laboratory assistants, etc.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Pasir

Panjang  has  said  that the Minister  for  Health  has

declined  to  accept responsibility in  regard  to  the

nurses'  strike  and  also in  regard  to  the  cholera

epidemic which occurred recently. Mr Speaker, Sir,  as

far  as the nurses' strike is concerned. I was all  the

time  in communication with the two contending unions.

There is a long history behind this dispute, and I  do

not propos e to bore the House with the details. But



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>



eventually  sometime in 1960 these two unions  came  to

some  sort  of  a hotchpotch agreement.  The  Singapore

Medical   Services  Union  claimed  to  represent   the

assistant  nurses, and the rival union,  the  A.U.P.E.,

claimed  to  represent the male nurses.  The  assistant

nurses   number   about  719   in   a   total   nursing

establishment  of  2,241, and the male  nurses  number

about  219.  There the matter stood, Mr Speaker,  Sir.

After  both these unions served demands on the Ministry

claiming  revisions of salaries for the  whole  of  the

nursing  service  and  for  improved  conditions,   the

Secretary-General  of the A.U.P.E.,  i.e.,  the  former

Parliamentary  Secretary to the Minister  for  Culture,

called  on  me at my office in February this  year.  He

made  a  proposal  for a solution of  this  matter.  He

suggested to me that the Ministry should propose to the

other  union that he should keep in his membership  all

the  student  nurses and staff nurses and that  he  was

quite  prepared  to  let  the  other  union  have   the

assistant  nurses and the sisters and charge nurses - the

charge  nurses are the male equivalents of the sisters.

That  proposal  was  put to the other  union  and  they

flatly turned it down They said it was unfair and  they

were  quite  prepared to submit the whole matter  to  a

general  ballot  of  the  nursing  service.  They  went

further to say that if they lost in the ballot, they were  quite  prepared to dissolve themselves  and  return

their  certificate of registration. When they  received

that  offer,  we  made  every attempt  to  contact  the

Secretary-General  of  the  A.U.P.E.   Three   official

letters  were written to him at various dates. Various

telephone  calls were made on him. But every  time  our

officials  were  told that he was elsewhere  on  other

important business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to our surprise, on 23rd May, we received a strike notice. The strike notice said that if the demands that his union had made were not settled by midnight, the 6th of June, then the union would call out all the student nurses, assistant nurses, sisters, and the charge nurses on strike. This union included in

its  strike  notice these grades of sisters and  charge

nurses which it earlier said in February it was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>



prepared  to  concede  to the  rival  union..  When  we

received  that  notice,  we had  to  refer  it  to  the

Commissioner for Labour and ask him to conciliate.  The

Commissioner  for Labour held two meetings  with  these

two unions, and they took firm stands on this issue  of

union  representation. The Singapore  Medical  Services

Union  claimed that they represented all grades of  the

nursing staff and that they wanted a general ballot  to

be  held  for all grades. The other union said that  it

wanted  a  restricted  ballot to  be  held -  a  ballot

restricted  only  to the grades for  which  the  strike

notice was served. These meetings took place very  near

to  the date when the A.U.P.E. decided to call out  its

members.    A   strike   then   took   place    without

justification. Before that, Mr Speaker, Sir,  we  told

both  unions that we had decided that a general  ballot

should  be  taken  to  find out  which  union  had  the

majority of membership of the nursing staff.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the A.U.P.E. disagreed with us, we

nevertheless  proceeded to take that ballot,  and  that

ballot   is   still  proceeding.  The  Prime   Minister

intervened  in  the  matter. He felt  that  if  certain

proposals  that we had in mind were put to  both  these

unions, there was a likelihood of their accepting them,

in  fact, he did hold meetings with them and put  these

proposals  which  have been accepted.  The  unions  are

agreed  now that the Arbitration Court should be  asked

to  find out whether the nursing staff were all members

of  a  single service or whether the staff employed  in

the  hospitals  should be categorised,  and  the  Court

should be asked to determine whether there should he  a

decision   on   representation  which   would   involve

representation  by two unions in respect  of  different

categories in the service or representation by a single

union  in respect of the whole service. That matter  is

now  before the Court. Mr Speaker, Sir, for the Member

for  Pasir  Panjang to say that I left it  all  to  the

Prime Minister is quite untrue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the cholera epidemic, it happened that

at the time this epidemic occurred, the Director of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>



Medical  Services was on leave, At the same  time,  the

Deputy  Director  of Medical Services  (Hospitals)  was

away  on  a  conference,  and the  Deputy  Director  of

Medical Services (Health) - these are the three  most

important  officials  in  the  Ministry - was  ill   in

hospital.  So  I  was left with a comparatively  junior

officer. He is the Chest Physician in the Tan Tock Seng

Hospital. We got together and organised a campaign;  so

that  it is also quite untrue for the Member for  Pasir

Panjang to say that in the cholera epidemic I left  all

matters  to  the Prime Minister. It was true  that  the

Prime  Minister  did  hold a  conference  to  which  he

invited representatives of the Public Utilities  Board.

The  Ministry of Health was also represented, and I was

present at that conference. That conference was  called

so  that he could co-ordinate the activities of the two

Departments to meet this epidemic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson

asked me  to  tell  the House when the revision of salaries affecting

the  nurses and medical auxiliary staff was last  made. The answer is that there was a committee that went

into all  this, and it was necessary to relate the  salaries

of  all these different grades to key salary scales  in

the  Government service. This committee took two  years

to  do  this  work,  and finally the  new  scales  were

implemented as from 1st February, 1959.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is shocking to

hear  the  Minister  say that his  Ministry  had  great

difficulty  in  trying to contact the Secretary-General

of  the  A.U.P.E., that despite three official  letters

sent  to him and attempts made to contact him, all were

to  no  avail.  At that particular time the  Secretary-General

of the A.U.P.E. was the Parliamentary Secretary

to  the Minister for Culture. He was paid out of public

funds,  and he should be sitting in that office.  Where

then  was  the difficulty in contacting him?  If  there

really  was  that difficulty, it would  mean  that  the

P.A.P. had allowed a Parliamentary Secretary, paid  out

of public funds, to be up to his tricks doing something

else. Only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>



such things could happen in a P.A.P. Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I disagree with the Member for Pasir Panjang

when  he said that the Prime Minister has no confidence

in  the  Minister  for  Health  and  that  was  why  he

intervened  in  the nurses' strike. The Prime  Minister

had  to intervene because it was a quarrel between  the

Prime  Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary  before

he resigned. It was a completely P.A.P. matter, And who

else   but   the  Prime  Minister  could   admonish   a

Parliamentary Secretary? The Parliamentary Secretary to

the  Minister for Culture could just twiddle his  thumb

at  the  Minister for Health if the Minister for Health

tried  to settle it, But when he had to meet the  Prime

Minister, it was a different kettle of fish. Therefore,

the  Prime  Minister took over. The Prime Minister,  in

fact,  has great confidence in the Minister for Health.

His   confidence  is  so  great  that  even  the  Prime

Minister's   wife  went  to  a  private  hospital   for

treatment - the  Mount Alvernia Hospital - instead  of  the

General Hospital or any other hospital in the Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Is that at all relevant? Has the

Member completed his speech?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, it is obvious from the recent strike

of the nurses and the threatened strike of the midwives

and  so  on  at the Kandang Kerbau Hospital, which  was

averted   by   the  dispute  being  referred   to   the

Arbitration  Court,  that there  is  strong  discontent

among the nursing profession in the hospitals with  the

salaries  and terms and conditions of service.  Sir,  I

realise this is a very special matter that concerns the

former  Parliamentary Secretary  to  the  Minister  for

Culture,  who  is not here now, and the nursing  staff,

who are a special preserve of the Secretary-General  of

the A.U.P.E. I do not want to pry into his affairs, but

because  this  has  come  to he  of  public  importance

leading to a stage where a strike, in fact, took place,

I  think  it is fair to assume that there is legitimate

discontent.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, luckily this strike was not called by a union

that  is affiliated to the S.A.T.U. group, as otherwise

the  charge  would  have been that the  Communists  are

calling  the  strike,  that they are  making  the  poor

patients  suffer.  I think I will not  be  wrong  if  I

assume   that  the  strike  was  not  called   by   the

Communists. It was not a political strike, it was not a

Communist strike, but it was a genuine strike. Sir,  on

that  basis  at  least  we must assume  that  there  is

genuine  discontent. As far as I can understand,  there

are  numerous grades of nurses and salary scales in the

service.  I  hear there is strong dissatisfaction  over

even   the   nature  of  duties  performed,  and   that

dissatisfaction  extends to the general  conditions  of

service of the whole nursing staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of all this, what I would like to ask

the  Minister  for  Health and Law is  this:  will  the

Government   consider  setting  up  a   Commission   to

investigate  into the conditions of employment  of  the

nursing  staff and their salaries, etc, with a view  to

bringing  about  a general revision and unification  in

employment terms and salaries?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am aware that there is

a   genuine  grievance  among  nurses  that  they   are

underpaid for the work they do, in the sense that their

salary  scales  are  related to the  salary  scales  of

clerical officers though they have to do shift work and

overtime   work   and  night  work   without   adequate

compensation.  Mr Speaker, Sir, I think  it  would  be

wise to let the Arbitration Court decide this issue  of

representation first. Once that is got over, we can see

how  best we can deal with the need for proper  inquiry

to  be  made into the conditions of work of the members

of the nursing staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as to salary scales, the Member for Thomson is in the trade union field and he knows that the unions take exception to boards of inquiry, say, fixing or making recommendations for wage scales. The unions always feel that they can get a better deal if they can collectively bargain for better scales of pay

and  for improvements. So I would suggest that we  wait

until we get the decisions of the Arbitration Court and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>



then we will either have to deal with one union or  two

unions  and  see how best we can reach a solution  that

will be satisfactory to all concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we

on  this side of the House have always maintained  from

the  moment  when the Member for Kampong  Kapor  became

Deputy  Speaker, that he should not take part  actively

in trade union matters which might bring him to a head-on collision with the Government ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it Deputy Speaker or Parliamentary

Secretary?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It was Deputy Speaker at that time, We

attacked  that position consistently and all the  time.

Subsequent to those attacks - whether it was due to those

attacks  or to other considerations, we are  unable  to

say - he  became  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the

Minister for Culture. That made the position even worse

than  the  first  position, from  our  point  of  view,

because,  instead of being part of the Legislature,  he

became part of the Government. It has now happened,  he

has  now  resigned his seat, as we knew  eventually  he

would  have  to resign because one day  if  he  were  a

genuine  trade  unionist he would  have  to  choose,  I

wonder,  Sir,  whether the Government has now  realised

the almost impossible position into which it had placed

itself.  Could  the Government give an  assurance  that

things like this will not happen again?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I just want to clarify one little bit from

what  the Minister has said, I was not suggesting  that

some  Commission  be  appointed  to  inquire  into  the

conditions  of salaries or, by any chance, taking  away

the collective bargaining right of the trade unions.  I

suggested that a Commission be appointed to investigate

and  make  recommendations and, of course,  the  unions

will have the opportunity of sending their cases. In so

far  as  the present arbitration case is concerned,  it

will only deal with the representation question, and  I

am  sure  the  Minister  will agree  that  solving  the

representation  question  is just  solving  one  minute

problem.  The  basic one is the question  of  salaries,

etc.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Minister wish to say anything

further?



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a point has been made by

the  Member for Farrer Park that when a member  of  the

Government places himself in a position where there can

be  a  conflict  of  duty and loyalty,  the  inevitable

always happens. Mr Speaker, Sir, this is agreed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to what the Member for Thomson has suggested, I

think  it would be wise to leave this matter over  till

we  know what the decision of the Arbitration Court is.

Meanwhile,  we  will  give  thought  to  what  he   has

suggested.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Member for Pasir Panjang wish

for a vote?

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 25 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (3)  of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this item deals with the post of Political

Secretary.  Political Secretaries have been under  fire

at  every Budget meeting since 1960. In this particular

case,  the Ministry of Health, the particular Political

Secretary  is  now under lock and key, put  in  by  the

Government.  I am wondering whether the Minister  still

considers that this post should remain on the Budget so

that  the Government can go around trying to find  some

Communist  or Communist sympathiser whom the Government

hopes  to  win  over  to their non-Communist  socialist

policy  and then give him this job out of public funds,

and  later  on, when the Government finds to  its  cost

that  such a person cannot be trusted, put him in gaol.

I  remember  the Minister did say that if  he  did  not

consider  that such a post was desirable he  would  see

that  it  was  abolished.  In fact,  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister gave that assurance and he had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>



carried  out  that assurance. I am not so sure  whether

the  Minister  for Health has given such an  assurance,

but  I  have  a feeling that almost all Ministers  gave

that  assurance.  Does the Minister  for  Health  still

consider that he wants that post on the Budget?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will concede that last

year, eighteen months ago. I did  - say that I would give

consideration  to  the need for  such  a  post  in  the

Ministry  of  Health.  I also concede  that  there  are

Ministries  where  the  need  for  the  services  of  a

Personal Secretary (Political) is more urgent.  I  must

point out that there are some sensitive departments  in

the  Ministry  of  Health which regularly  receive  the

attention of trouble makers. For instance, there  is  a

Hawkers'  Department and our new policy of helping  the

hawkers - we  always  give  them  alternative  sites  and

provide  these alternative sites with standpipes,  they

may have to be moved to enable cleansing to be properly

done  or to clear a traffic obstruction which might  be

caused   by   them.  The  trouble  makers  deliberately

misrepresent our objects to the hawkers and it  may  be

necessary  in  future  to  engage  the  services  of  a

suitable  person to serve in this post to  counter  the

machinations  of these trouble makers. So  that  it  is

necessary. Mr Speaker, Sir, on reconsideration, in the

public interest, that financial provision be sought for

this post of Personal Secretary (Political).



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, since the Minister wants that

post  retained  to trap another Communist,  I  have  no

objection. I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 25 be

reduced by S100.*





<hr size="2" noshade>

*  The same amendment also stood in the names of Mr S. T. Bani, Dr Thio Chan Bee and Mr Ng Teng Kian.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we know that the population in Singapore has been increasing very rapidly and the health services in the Government should be improved also. In the Four-Year Development Plan of the Government, there is something about the health services.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>



There  are  at present 2,113 beds in the Hospital,  and

shortage of beds in a hospital implies that our  health

services are not adequate enough. Although we have  now

set  up  24  outpatient clinics, in one day only  5,000

people  can  be  treated. In order  to  cope  with  our

increasing population, we have to set up another  seven

modem  clinics,  each one catering for 500  people,  in

1964.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, four years have passed and the

patients in the hospitals are always asked to leave the

hospitals before they get better. We know that the poor

people  in Singapore live in very insanitary conditions

and  the air is very impure. When a patient returns  to

his  home before he gets better, this is very  bad  for

him and it will not help him to recover.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the patients in the General

Hospital  are  crowded  together  especially   in   the

Outpatients Department. The Government claims  that  it

wants  to build 17 clinics in the Four-Year Development

Plan. But it seems that it has not reached this target.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that in Upper Serangoon and Yio

Chu  Kang  there  is  one  old outpatient  clinic.  The

patients who attend that clinic have to queue up in the

hot  sun and the queue is very long. Will this help the

patient  who  is  queueing up to get better  if  he  is

exposed  to  the heat? Therefore, I hope the Government

will pay more attention to this problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir,

just  now  the  Member for Pasir Panjang mentioned  the

Outpatients Department in the General Hospital. I  have

the  same  impression as he has, especially  at  night,

because I have received so many complaints saying that ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Member will notice that

time  is passing. I think the hon. Member will be  able

to say what he wishes to say under the next Head, which

is  Hospitals  Division. Will the Minister  answer  the

points made?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> The Member for Pasir Panjang thought that

it  was desirable that patients should remain longer in

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>



General  Hospital. He complained that  there  were  too

frequent  discharges. Mr Speaker, Sir, the  turn-round

in  the  use  of beds is about 50,000 a  year  in  this

hospital, and the General Hospital has only a  capacity

of  1,351 beds. Unlike the Chronic Sick Hospital at Tan

Tock  Seng Hospital you have about 1,300 beds  and  the

same  patient  remains in a bed  for  a  longer  period

because tuberculosis is a disease which requires longer

treatment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are doing our best to turn the Chronic Sick Hospital at Thomson Road into a subsidiary general hospital. In fact, there are 11 wards in that hospital; in five wards, 180 beds are being used at the

present time, and six wards with a capacity of 216 beds

are   vacant.  We  have  introduced  a  crash  training

programme to train nurses. As soon as we are able to do

so with the modest increase in doctors that we have, we

will  -bring this hospital into service as a subsidiary

general  hospital, and that will help  to  relieve  the

present pressure on the General Hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as far as his complaint that there is a lot of

congestion  at the main clinic at the General  Hospital

is  concerned, we admit that. That is so. We are trying

to detach the emergency cases from the outpatient cases

and  remove  the  outpatient  cases  from  the  General

Hospital to the old hospital building at Maxwell  Road.

We  have  asked  for financial provision  to  make  the

necessary alterations so that that old hospital can  be

converted into the main outpatient clinic for the  city

area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the complaint that the Upper Serangoon

Road clinic is unserviceable, I will agree that that is

a  very old building. I visited it myself recently.  It

is  just  at the corner of Yio Chu Kang Road and  Upper

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this involves Staff Midwives. The next amendment

*  Amendment (3) reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 26 be reduced by $10 in respect

of item (229) of subhead 1.

<hr size="2" noshade>





<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If it is convenient, yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, there is a very curious and outmoded

practice  in  training midwives in the  Kandang  Kerbau

Hospital.  Those  who are employed are,  in  the  first

instance,  made  pupil  midwives  and  are  subject  to

training  for  a  period of about two  years  and  four

months.  I  may  be wrong - the Minister may  correct  me

here - but  to the best of my knowledge, it is two  years

and  four months, after which they are expected to  sit

for  an  examination. If the candidates succeed in  the

examination, they are given three months' duties in the

clinics in the rural areas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.32 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three months, I hear, are for further practical

training.  Of  course, in the course  of  the  training

during  the  two years and four months, they  are  also

expected to do practical work, and most of them in fact

perform  duties which are normally performed  by  staff

midwives.  They are, of course, supervised by qualified

staff midwives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the curious thing is this, Mr Deputy Speaker.

After   the   period   of  training,   they   are   not

automatically  employed as staff  midwives.  After  the

period  of training, their services are dispensed  with

and, if they desire to become staff midwives, they have

to  wait  for  the Ministry of Health to announce  that

there  are  vacancies and that they intend  to  recruit

staff midwives. Those pupil midwives who are successful

in their training are then allowed to apply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this appears peculiar and outmoded, because what

is  the  purpose of giving them their training  if  the

Government  does  not  want to  employ  them  as  staff

midwives? I can only think of one reason, and  that  is

to have cheap labour. I know some private employers are

in the habit of doing this sort of thing. I do not like

to  believe seriously that the Government wants to have

cheap  labour,  because in the course of training,  the

pupil  midwives  do work which is normally  done  by  a

trained staff midwife, but they are paid the rate for a

pupil  midwife, But after training, instead of  getting

automatic appointment like the assistant nurses,  their

services are dispensed with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I like to ask the Minister if the Government

will  lock  into  this with a view to  abolishing  this

system, so as to provide an arrangement similar to  the

one that is in existence for other nursing grades.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, if I am not

mistaken,  the  Member  for  Thomson  says   that   the

grievance that the pupil midwives have is that they  do

go out during the time that they are pupil midwives and

do  the work of staff midwives for a certain period but

that  they do not receive the salary of staff  midwives

when they are so employed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Deputy Speaker, you cannot have it both

ways. If they are pupil midwives, they must be paid  as

pupil midwives, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of explanation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Can I explain this? The basic grievance is

not  what the Minister says it to be. My point  relates

to period after training. I agree that you give them  a

rate  of  pay on the training scheme and that is  that,

but  after training, they are not automatically  placed

as  staff  midwives,  like the  nurses,  the  assistant

nurses - in fact like all other grades of nursing.  Their

services are terminated, They have to wait for  months,

Only  when  the Ministry of Health says that they  want

midwives, can they apply. That is the basic grievance,



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Sir, if the Member for Thomson had not

interrupted  me,  I would have gone on  to  the  second

point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I think the first point to be answered is this:

if you are a pupil midwife, you must be paid as a pupil

midwife, though you go and help out as a staff midwife.

The  second objection now, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,In

the  case of nurses and assistant nurses, we accept the

responsibility   for  training  them.  The   Government

accepts  that responsibility and the Government ensures

that  it  will train sufficient numbers of  nurses  and

assistant  nurses  to  fill  all  available  Government

vacancies.  It  is  true  that  there  is  a   lot   of

wastage - many  of them leave us, and so on - and  we  have

got  to have crash training programmes to catch up with

increases  of staff which are necessary. That  goes  on

throughout  the  nursing  service.  It  is  unlike  the

midwifery  service, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. We  cannot

accept  any  responsibility for assuring every  midwife

that we train that there will be a vacancy for her.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, unlike the nursing service, there are a lot of midwives who go into private practice. They work on their own or they work with doctors. The Member for Thomson knows that very well, Now, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, their training and so on is not unlike that of the radiographers. We have got a

medical  auxiliary  staff  of  radiographers  which  we

train.  We  have  got a radiography  school.  We  train

people who want to be radiographers, but we train  them

so  that they can go into private employment as well as

come  into Government service when there are vacancies.

It  would  be impossible for the Member for Thomson  to

expect that the Government can create the vacancies  in

the Government service to accommodate every midwife who

has been trained at the expense of Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I honestly cannot understand the argument

of  the  Minister.  Sir. The Minister  says  that  they

cannot  guarantee employment: in other words, they  are

saying that there may not be the vacancies. Sir, surely

when  the  Government employs, say, one  hundred  pupil

midwives,  they are employing them not for the  purpose

of  giving  training, but for the purpose of doing  one

hundred persons' work and also ultimately with the view

to  placing  one  hundred as midwives  in  the  various

Government  institutions.  Take  the  question  of  the

nurses.  The same principle operates. You do  not  take

assistant  nurses, give them training and  in  the  end

dispense with their services on grounds that you cannot

guarantee posts for trained nurses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second point that I want to make here is the

question of a midwife who leaves the service to go into

private  employment. It is quite true  that  there  are

private clinics which have midwives  - maybe K.K. - trained

midwives.  But,  on  the other hand,  if  I  think  the

Minister  investigates this matter, he will  find  that

the  vast majority of the pupil midwives who leave  the

Kandang  Kerbau Maternity Hospital after training  look

forward  to Government employment for obvious  reasons,

because most of these pupil midwives are young;  it  is

not  possible for them to go out and practise on  their

own,  and  there are lesser opportunities  to  work  in

private clinics.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think you will

agree,  regarding these pupil midwives, that  there  is

quite a large number of them and we can employ only  as

many  as we can. We cannot give an assurance that every

midwife who is trained will be absorbed into Government

service. That will all have to depend on the vacancies.

You will realise that there is a much larger number  of

midwives practising on their own than there are  nurses

who   practise   as  nurses  outside   the   Government

employment. Now, I do appreciate that there  are  large

numbers of them who are outside Government service  who

apply for Government jobs. They are keen on joining the

service,  but  we can only employ up to the  number  of

vacancies that we have.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Can I

also  make  the  point that if the Government  were  to

restrict  the  training of midwives just  to  fit  into

vacancies on the establishment of Government hospitals,

that  would mean that the number of trainees  would  be

less than there would be? Therefore, there will not  be

the  additional  supply  which  will  go  into  private

practice.  As  the Minister for Health  has  said,  the

number    of   midwives   in   private   practice    is

proportionately  more  than the  number  of  nurses  in

private practice. Therefore, you have to train a larger

number  of  midwives  than  can  be  employed  in   the

Government institutions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, my understanding

of  the  situation is such that the demand for midwives

in  Kandang Kerbau Hospital and in the district clinics

is  much  greater than the present strength of midwives

the  Government  has. That is my understanding  of  the

situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> There may he scope for employing more of

them in the schemes to be introduced in connection with

the work of the Public Health Clinics. We must wait and

see,  Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,I mean it is just common

sense that we would like to employ all if we can if  we

have  got  the  vacancies; but we  can  never  give  an

assurance that everyone who is trained will be given  a

job after training.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr S.

T. Bani ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That the sum to be allocated for Head 26 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item (229)  of subhead 1.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Mammen):</b> Amendment (3) , Mr Bani.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I am not moving.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 26 he reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 112.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the Government to explain to us, so

that  we can understand the manner in which the  Budget

is being prepared, what is meant by a revote?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> A revote is a sum of money which

was  voted in previous years in the Estimates  but  not

spent, and revoted in the current year.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I thank him for that

explanation, but could the Minister for Finance explain

how  a  revote can be more than the original vote?  How

could  a  revote  be  more  than  the  sum  which   was

originally  voted? In this particular case, the  revote

asked  for  is $14,840, whereas the original  vote  for

1962  was $11,500. I cannot understand. So if it  is  a

revote, it could only be for $1 1,500, unless it  means

something  else. Perhaps this is a new  meaning - P.A.P.

meaning - of a revote.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The money is intended to buy a

particular  service  or  buy  a  particular  piece   of

equipment. Now if the price of that product has gone up

in  the  meantime, or if it is found that the  original

amount  is  not enough, then you have to  increase  it.

Approval  is asked for to buy the particular  equipment

or service.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> This is a further explanation. A

revote is a vote asked for again for something that was

not spent last year. So the correct way would be a vote

of  $11,500  plus $3,340 being extra cost,  instead  of

which  the Minister, after having taken more  than  one

year  to prepare the Budget, gave us a Budget that does

not give the correct



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1051</b></font><br><br>



information. In his own words, when I asked him what is

the  meaning  of a revote, he said that a revote  is  a

revote of a vote that has not been spent.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what has not been spent was $11,500, but what he

is  asking  for is a revote of more than what  has  not

been spent. All I want to point out is that the note is

wrong,  is  misleading. If the Minister had  put  in  a

revote  of $11,500 plus an additional vote to  meet  an

additional cost, because the calculation was all  wrong

in 1962, then we would have accepted it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> The original estimate was $11,500. Then it

went  out  to  tender and the lowest tender  price  was

$14,838. The work was completed in May this year - it  is

the  installation of a fire alarm system in the General

Hospital - and  that is why you get the sum  of  $14,840,

because of the lowest tender price of $14,838.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I am not quarrelling with the

amount spent, but what I am trying to point out is that

it  is  misleading  on the part of a Minister  of  this

House  to say that. It is not, in actual fact, a revote

in the real meaning of that word. I do not know whether

to proceed to a vote on this.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Is the Member for Cairnhill

suggesting that there has been some new departure  from

financial procedures? If he will only study the printed

Estimates,  say, of the last ten years,  he  will  find

numerous examples of this sort of thing.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I will not want to waste the

time of the Assembly by asking the Finance Minister  to

produce - and he has to go through ten years of Budgets

to produce  - something which is not there. I withdraw.

Mr A.P Rajah, Mrs Seow Peck Leng, Tun Lim Yew Hock and Dr Thio Chan Bee.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to touch on two or three points, Sir.

First,  the  Japanese  doctors. I understand  there  is

great dissatisfaction with the Japanese doctors who are

still  being employed in the Singapore hospitals.  They

were  originally brought into Singapore,  according  to

the  advice  that I have got, as a spite more  or  less

against  local doctors as a result of a number of  them

having  resigned  consequent on the pay-cuts.  But  the

whole trouble about these Japanese doctors is that they

have  been made Senior Registrars with a pay of  $1,100

as  a  starting salary and yet they are only doing jobs

of  ordinary M.O.s and supervised by ordinary M.O.s  of

Singapore. Why should that be so? I remember I  brought

this question up in 1961, and the Minister then gave an

undertaking  to  look into the matter and  I  gave  him

concrete  examples. I wish the Minister would enlighten

us on what he has done about the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second matter which I wish to bring forward is

this:  the Outpatients Department in Singapore  at  the

present   moment  is  very  congested.  They  have,   I

understand,  15  doctors  working  in  the  Outpatients

Department in the daytime, but only one at night.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Why do you not volunteer?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Why should there be only one

doctor  at  night? Consequent on there being  only  one

doctor  after the usual office hours, many  people  who

are  very ill have to wait for a very long time  before

they  are attended to in the Outpatients Department  of

the General Hospital. Are we short of doctors, or what?

Could  the  Minister explain to us why there should  be

only one doctor when we are supposed to have many, many

doctors with no shortage?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I wish to raise is: if the Minister

will  refer to page 174 under subhead 11 (3),  he  will

see  "Drugs  and Chemicals", Estimates 1962,  $780,000.

But   for  1963,  it  has  been  reduced  to  $723,000.

Similarly,  "Dressings and Sundries"  above  this,  the

figure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>



is  the same for 1962 and 1963. Similarly, on page 175,

under   subhead   21 (2),  he  will  find   "Drugs   and

Chemicals", and the amount is again the same  for  1962

and  1963.  And  further  down under  subhead  26  (2),

"Dressings and Sundries", it was $100,000 in 1962,  but

it has gone down to $71,000 in 1963. Similarly, on page

176 under subhead 31 - Medical and Surgical Equipment and

Stores -  you will find all the figures in the column for

1963 much lower than those in the column for 1962.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assume that with a population increase in Singapore

there  are  more  and more people  making  use  of  the

services  in the General Hospital. How is it then  that

less money is voted for all these services in 1963?  Is

it because fewer people are making use of the hospital?

I would like to be enlightened on this, especially when

we know that there is a lot of surplus in 1962.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 26 be

reduced by $100 ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Mammen):</b> The amendment has been

moved.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I have a few

questions. One concerns the General Hospital.  I  would

like  to  ask  the Minister for Health if  he  can  say

whether   there  can  be  established  in  the  General

Hospital   an   Emergency  Unit  which   will   provide

facilities  for  patients to be  admitted  without  any

special  procedure,  so that they  can  be  immediately

admitted  when there are emergency cases, in  order  to

reduce the pains suffered by the patients and to lessen

any  worry of the members of their family and to reduce

the  number  of  fatalities.  Because  without  such  a

facility,  the  people concerned will  find  it  rather

inconvenient; there will be cause for concern for them.

This is one thing I would ask the Minister to consider.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the services provided in the

General  Hospital are usually rather lax,  because  the

patient  will sometimes have to wait for two  hours  or

several hours at a stretch. I hope the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>



Minister will pay attention to this and find some means

to improve this situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is in regard to the Kandang Kerbau

Hospital. This hospital is in charge of maternity cases

who  go  there for confinement. I have been  there  too

because  my elder sister and younger sister  have  both

been  there  and have other friends there too.  I  have

found   that   the   situation  there   is   also   not

satisfactory,  because after two days' stay  an  inmate

will have to move out. Perhaps the Minister's wife  has

not   been   delivering  any  baby  in  that  hospital,

otherwise  the  Minister would have taken  measures  to

improve  the  situation. I hope the  Minister  can  pay

attention to this matter so as to improve the situation

there  and help poorer people, because well-off  people

perhaps  would not go there for delivery. It is  mostly

the  poor people who go there. I hope the Minister will

do  something  to help them and make things  convenient

for  them.  It is the poorer people who are making  the

most use of the Kandang Kerbau Hospital. When they  are

hospitalised,  members  of  their  family  are   rather

concerned. At home they do not have telephones and they

naturally  find  it  rather difficult  to  contact  the

hospital  staff.  This is another  reason  for  further

worry.  Whereas for the richer people or the Ministers,

they  have  telephones at home and can  easily  get  in

touch  with  the  hospital staff to enquire  about  the

condition of their wives in the K.K. Hospital. This  is

another  point  I hope the Minister will pay  attention

to, to help the poorer people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing is this. In the hospitals each hospital

bed is normally charged at $12 per day.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Mammen):</b> Order. It is time to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Deputy Speaker left the Chair of the

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would like to ask a third question relating to Tan Tock

Seng  Hospital.  I have heard that the maintenance  for

each  bed in Ward C is $6, whereas the maintenance  for

other  beds is $12 each. Is it proper to carry  out  in

this way?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is about service conditions for nurses.

Recently  the  nurses  were  on  strike,  thus  causing

inconvenience  to  the  public. Has  the  Minister  any

method  to resolve this question and to look after  the

working conditions of nurses in order to prevent future

strikes  which  will inconvenience the public  and  the

patients?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Time is getting short. I will call on

Mr Rajah. Not speaking? Dr Thio.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of

the most dreaded diseases taking an increasing toll  of

human lives here is cancer. I understand that equipment

for  our hospitals here for the treatment of cancer  is

not  as  good  as they have in Hong Kong.  So  patients

requiring  treatment for cancer who can afford  it,  of

course, go to the United Kingdom or to Hong Kong. Since

we  are  not  lacking  in funds, I wonder  whether  the

Minister for Health and Law will look into this. Cobalt

bombing is one of the methods of treatment. It is  used

in Hong Kong but not in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Bani is not speaking? Mrs Seow is

not speaking? Tun Lim.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what I am

concerned  to see under this Head is that the Maternity

Home



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>



at  Maxwell  Road  is  to be scrapped.  The  Government

planned  as  far back as 1961, when they  tabled  their

Development  Estimates,  for  a  $400,000  vote  for  a

maternity   home  at  Maxwell  Road.   Then   for   the

Development  Estimates for 1963, it is seen  that  they

felt  that out of this vote of $400,000, only  $350,000

would  have been spent by the end of 1962 and therefore

a  revote of $50,000 was asked for for 1963. But now in

this  Estimate of Personal Emoluments, it is seen  that

the Government is going to scrap this Maternity Home. I

would  urge  upon  the Government to  reconsider  their

decision  and to do all they can to set up a  maternity

home in that area which is very thickly populated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as to the Japanese

doctors - we  have five doctors - the contract of  one  has

expired and he has gone home. There is still a shortage

of  doctors  in the medical service, although,  on  the

latest  figures  that  I have, we have  fortunately  in

service  a total of 329 doctors as today. Nevertheless,

we  are  still  short. We are happy to  accept  in  our

service more doctors if we can get them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently two doctors from Formosa applied to join our

service  and  I  snapped  them  up  immediately.  These

foreign  doctors  are  not  in  any  way  blocking  the

promotions  of  local doctors. They  are  paid  from  a

separate  vote in the Estimate. If we can get  them,  I

think we should be grateful for their services, so that

they  can  help out in our hospitals and  our  clinics.

This  expansion will not be possible unless we can  get

more  nurses  and  doctors. That must  be  realised  by

Members in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the complaint was that they get into senior positions in the hospital and, therefore, block the promotions of our local officers. In point of fact, all our young local medical officers of ability get every opportunity of coming under the notice of specialist doctors, so that they can get opportunities

of  going overseas to get higher qualifications. I have

spoken to the specialist officers who are in charge  of

these various units employing the Japanese doctors, and

they have assured



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>



me  that  these  Japanese  medical  officers  are  good

officers, experienced officers, and they would be  glad

to retain them in the service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the complaint that there is only one doctor on

duty at night, whereas there are 15 doctors on duty  in

the  daytime  at the Outpatients Clinic at the  General

Hospital, these postings are dependent on the number of

patients  that  are dealt with in the  daytime  and  at

night. I will be making enquiries to find out why  only

one  doctor is employed at night. I would have  thought

that   before   the   officers  in  charge   of   these

arrangements  make  these  postings,  they  would  have

regard  to  the numbers attending at night and  in  the

daytime at the clinics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown referred to reductions in

the  Estimates on Chemicals and drugs. I have discussed

that  with  the Minister for Finance just now,  and  he

told me that the amounts for the purchase of drugs have

been overestimated in previous years. I have also on my

own  checked  on  this question and the  Superintending

Pharmaceutical  Chemist  has  given  me  a  note  here,

stating that the total number of all patients, both out-patients  and in-patients, at all Government  hospitals

increased from 3,000,000 in 1958 to 4,920,000 in  1962.

Also  the  amounts spent on the purchase of drugs  have

also  increased from $2,389,000 to $3,155,000.  I  have

noticed  in checking these estimates that it  has  been

the  practice  in  the  past to overestimate,  But  the

Superintending Pharmaceutical Chemist has given  me  an

assurance that they have sufficient drugs in store  and

on purchase to meet all requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu has asked that we make

arrangements  to  provide  for  easier  facilities  for

admission  to  the  General  Hospital.  That   is   not

possible.  Even  if  the patient  is  referred  to  the

General Hospital by a general practitioner, it does not

follow that he gets admitted. He has to be seen by  the

Senior  Medical Officer in charge, and  if  the  Senior

Medical Officer in charge



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>



agrees  that  his case merits admission, then  he  gets

admission.  I have told the House just now  that  there

are  only  1,351 beds in that hospital and if everybody

can  be  freely admitted into that hospital,  it  would

lead to complete chaos and breakdown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member for Jalan Kayu also complained that

the patients at the K.K. Hospital were detained for two

days  and released after two days' detention.  That  is

all  that we can do in the present circumstances. There

are 50,000 babies delivered in that hospital in a year,

and  there  are  a little more than 400  beds  in  that

hospital,  and unless babies are delivered  quickly,  I

cannot see how that hospital can carry on. Then he said

there were not sufficient telephones by which the  poor

can  contact their relations outside. There is a public

telephone in that hospital and I see no reason for that

complaint.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the complaint of a charge of $12 and $6

a  day.  Those charges have been enforced for  quite  a

long  time.  Then  he  wants  the  salaries  of  nurses

revised. All that is being attended to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin asked that we give

consideration  to  improving  the  facilities  for  the

treatment  of  cancer.  In  fact,  Mr  Speaker,  Prof.

Patterson of Liverpool University visited Singapore  in

the  last  three months and he has drawn up a programme

for  the  construction of the new cancer unit  for  our

hospital.  The cost involved is around $2� million.  He

says  if the programme is supported by the World Health

Organisation, then it would be possible for us  to  get

funds from overseas to buy the equipment that is needed

for  such a centre. It is also important that you  have

physicists for this centre before you embark on putting

up  the  buildings and buying the equipment. There  are

doctors     already    available    with     specialist

qualifications for the treatment of cancer. If  we  can

get  the  funds, then we can proceed with this project;

but  in  point of priority there are other  commitments

which  deserve  earlier attention. I am  just  bringing

that to the attention of the House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Cairnhill has asked why we did

stop  the  vote for the provision of $400,000  for  the

setting  up of a Maternity Home at the old Hospital  in

Maxwell Road. That was the project. But our plans  were

considered   by   Professor   Baird - he   is   a   noted

gynaecologists   and   obstetrician - when   he   visited

Singapore, and both he and Professor McKelvie,  who  is

now  on secondment and in service in the Kandang Kerbau

Hospital, have advised that we should not proceed  with

this  project. It is necessary that in the building  of

this maternity hospital for there to be incorporated in

the hospital itself the other facilities that go with a

modern  hospital and there is little room for expansion

in  this  hospital.  So they have  advised  me - both  of

them - and they have said it is their considered  opinion

that if we proceed with this project, it would be money

going down the drain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, that building can serve another useful purpose.

It  can, as I have explained earlier on this afternoon,

be  converted into a main clinic to serve the Chinatown

area. Now, that will relieve the congestion at the main

clinic of the General Hospital, and it will enable  the

clinic  at  the  General  Hospital  to  concentrate  on

casualties and emergency cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have answered all the points that have been

raised by Members of the Opposition.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,

I  was  shocked to hear the answer that, because  there

are  no  beds in the Hospital, women who go  there  for

confinement  are kept for only two days.  Is  that  the

proper answer from a good Government which sees to  the

welfare  of the people? Is expansion, more space,  more

beds  and more facilities, not the answer, rather  than

keep  them for two days? What happens if more women  go

to  deliver in one day? Then afterwards, what  happens?

It is a very strange answer.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, the Minister explained that

the   number  of  doctors  on  duty  at  night  in  the

Outpatients Department is dependent on the number of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>



patients  dealt with. I do not know what  he  means  by

that. Surely he should know by now that there are many,

many patients going there after office hours. If, after

having  been  in office for so long he still  does  not

know  that there are many people waiting in long queues

in  the  O.P.D. and admission room at night,  then  he

should resign, and let somebody take his office.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> You take over.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If he finds that one doctor is not

enough, then it is his job to have two doctors here  or

even three.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Or four.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You have plenty of money - $97

million, $300 million -  how much is it? - all unused.  Why

do you not make use of the money for the service of the

people?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown is

very easily upset, and when he is upset, he forgets the

direct. Is there anything else?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Minister also possibly does

not  know  that  in the Tan Tock Seng Hospital  and  in

other  places,  there  is a great  shortage  of  drugs.

Streptomycin,  for example, one of the  most  important

drugs is short. Why should that be? And yet he tells us

that there are plenty of drugs. Outpatients go there to

ask for drugs, and they are told that there is none.  I

wish the Minister would investigate into all this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the Member for

Mountbatten  expressed surprise that it  was  necessary

for  women  to be discharged with a minimum  amount  of

stay at the Kandang Kerbau Hospital. That is a hospital

in  which about 50,000 babies are delivered in a  year.

It  is  one of the biggest maternity hospitals  in  the

world today. Now we have expanded the facilities there,

and  when there are normal deliveries, there is a quick

turn-round;  they come in, and they  go  out.  Now,  of

course,  the cases that require treatment,  well,  they

get the treatment that they require.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in the case of the clinic at the General

Hospital, the Member for Queenstown was protesting that

it  was  very  unfair and unjust that one  doctor  only

should he posted on duty at night, whereas fifteen  are

on  duty  in  the daytime. The question is to  get  the

doctors. As I told you just now, we have 329 doctors in

the   service.  They  protest  against  our   employing

Japanese doctors. They do not want us to employ doctors

from  abroad. Is it not reasonable that we  should  get

more  doctors in the service? I put it to the Singapore

Medical  Association. They said, "Oh, yes, we will  co-operate; all of us will co-operate; give our service to

help out part-time in clinics and hospitals." So far  I

have only got eight doctors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What about the Member for Queenstown?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Yes, what about you, the Member for

Queenstown?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> They all want to put money away in their

pockets if they can! I tell you, Mr Speaker, Sir, that

we  are  now  making a declaration that  we  will  give

facilities  to  any  doctor  who  holds  a  registrable

qualification  an  entry  permit  with  a  promise   of

permanency  in this State - any doctor who  has  got  the

registrable  qualification, if  he  cares  to  come  to

Singapore  for private practice or to join the  medical

service. But we will not be held to ransom by  a  group

of unscrupulous people.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I wonder

whether  the Minister could assure us that in countries

which are medically advanced the women are kept in  the

hospital only for two days during confinement?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I can only tell the

Member   for   Mountbatten  that   we   have   men   of

international  standing serving in the hospital.  There

is Professor McKelvie there, He is seconded for service

here in Singapore by the Canadian Government and he has

not  complained  to  me that we were  ill-treating  the

women of Singapore by limiting their stay in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>



Kandang Kerbau Hospital to two days. Naturally, if  the

deliveries are abnormal, their stay must be longer. But

if  you are going to produce 50,000 babies a year,  you

have got to be reasonable - get it over quickly.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, my point is this. If the

experts  think that two days is the right period,  well

and  good, but if these people are forced to  stay  for

only two days because of lack of space or lack of beds,

as  the  Minister puts it, then it is the  Government's

duty to do something about it - to increase the number of

beds.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Chairman, I do not want to labour the

point. As I have said, if they are required to stay for

more  than two days, they are welcome to stay for  more

than two days.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, we are not concerned about

the  Minister's  quarrel  with  the  Singapore  Medical

Association. What we want from him is an assurance as a

Government  to see that the service is the  Outpatients

Department is adequate. Will he give an assurance  here

that at least two doctors will be provided at night?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I do not want to embark

on  all  this. I cannot give such an assurance. I  have

got  to  ascertain  the facts.  I  have  to  know;  for

instance, we have to take a log and find out. I want to

find out; I am not going to leave it alone.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Good.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I am following it up. I want to see how

many patients are attended to in that clinic every  day

as  against  every  night. We have to  so  arrange  the

postings  that we do not denude other branches  of  the

medical service in order to give a better reinforcement

to  this  clinic.  There are priorities  in  all  these

matters,  and they have to be looked into carefully.  I

just  cannot stand up here and say, "Yes, I  will  give

the  Member for Queenstown an assurance." It cannot  be

done. In running these institutions, we cannot just act

on the spur of the moment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, regarding the

outpatient  doctors.  I  can  give  the  Minister   one

example.  I myself brought a patient to the Outpatients

Department  at 3.30 a.m. one morning. The  patient  was

suffering from cirrhosis of the liver and he  had  been

vomiting  blood. I had to wait for 45 minutes  for  the

doctor  to examine the patient. Now, if there was  such

an  example,  is the Minister going to  look  into  the

matter?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> There is a doctor on duty al night and if

this  patient was not attended to earlier, it must have

been  that  this  doctor possibly was looking  at  some

other  case. But there are doctors posted for  duty  at

night.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Member for Queenstown wish for

a vote?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, Mr Loh Pui Kay held

this  post until 12th September, 1962, when as a result

of  criticism  by  the Chief Justice  arising  from  an

appeal  on  a corruption case, a Disciplinary  Tribunal

was  convened  which subsequently recommended  that  he

should  be transferred from his present post  with  the

loss  of  one  increment. From that  date  the  present

Acting  Superintendent was allowed to act  pending  the

substantive   filling  of  the  post.  The   post   was

advertised on 25th March, 1963, but the grading of  the

post  has been objected to by the Amalgamated Union  of

Public Employees which raised this objection

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, according to the 1959 P.A.P.'s Election Manifesto in regard to the problem of hawkers, the P.A.P. method of dealing with it is based on the principle of educating the hawkers not to obstruct the traffic and, at the same time, to help them to get a living. They also know the problems faced by the

hawkers,  that  they  had been under  the  unreasonable

control  of  so  many  departments  before  1959,   for

example,  under  police control, and interference  from

the  Police Department. But normally the reason for the

arrest  of hawkers is the same as the reason  given  by

the  Superintendent of Hawkers, and that is  that  they

obstruct   traffic.   In  its  election   pledges   the

Government   was  determined  to  get   rid   of   this

malpractice and that all problems relating  to  hawkers

would  come under the control of one authority and  not

under so many departments. But four years have elapsed.

Are   the  hawkers  today  under  the  control  of  One

authority? Actually, it is not so. They are still under

the  control of so many departments. They are the  same

as  they  were  before; their plight  is  the  same  as

before. Moreover,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>



the  hawker policy of the P.A.P. is not consistent, and

the Hawkers Department cannot deal with the problem  of

hawkers  effectively and reasonably. There are so  many

approaches  towards  the solution  of  the  problem  of

hawkers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to quote an example. Some of the hawkers in

Queen Street have licences, some have not, but whenever

a licence is transferred to another person, the Hawkers

Department  always carries out investigations  to  find

out whether the licensed hawker is actually engaged  in

the  business. But those unlicensed hawkers are allowed

to  carry  on their business. The licensed hawkers  are

very  much  worried because they are  harassed  by  the

authority. They cannot leave their business because the

Hawker  Inspector may turn up at any  time  to  inspect

their  licences, and if it happens that  they  are  not

there,  then their licences will be rescinded and  they

are sometimes summoned to the Hawkers Department to  be

questioned. This is a great harassment to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the problem of hawkers has become more

acute.  Before there were only 40,000 hawkers, but  now

the  number  has  increased to more  than  50,000.  The

P.A.P.,    while    trying   to    boast    of    their

industrialisation scheme which is only a paper  scheme,

has given wide publicity in newspapers. On T.V. we have

also listened to the industrialisation scheme, but  the

number  of  unemployed has increased and the number  of

hawkers has also increased. The Government has not made

any  effort to alleviate the problem of hawkers at all.

It  is  adopting the same methods and measures  towards

it,  that is, to impose fines and harass them and expel

them. We know that in many areas many hawkers have been

evicted,  for example, in Changi. East Coast Road,  Joo

Chiat,  near  Hollywood Theatre,  Lavender  Street  and

Tanjong  Rhu. Especially in East Coast Road the hawkers

there were engaged in the business for a long time, but

now  they  have been asked to remove to the back  lanes

and, as a result, their business has gone down. At  the

same  time,  if  they  are arrested,  a  fine  is  very

severely imposed. If a hawker



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>



is  warned consecutively three times, he will be  fined

very heavily - up to $50.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the hawker stalls along Tanjong

Rhu  Market  have not been properly looked  after.  The

right   of   allotment  was  handed  to  the   Hawkers'

Association,  and the hawkers who were there  were  not

given their places, but instead these places were given

to  others,  especially  to  members  of  the  Hawkers'

Association which supported the P.A.P.'s phoney  merger

proposals.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to

draw  the attention of the Minister - and I have done  it

several times - to the complaints in the papers and by me

here  about  the condition of drains, especially  along

East  Coast Road, Geylang Serai, Mountbatten  Road  and

the  Katong area. I do not know about other areas,  but

the  drains there are in a terrible state. It is really

in  a  disgraceful state. Apart from that in town, down

High  Street or North Bridge Road and Change Alley,  if

you  go there during week-ends, which I happened to  do

one week-end when I took some tourists down there (they

are  friends  of mine), I have never known that  Change

Alley  could  be such a disgraceful place to  take  any

tourist  around. I do not know who has been  scattering

all  the rubbish along the roads. If you go down  on  a

week-end  evening - Saturday evening, probably on  Sunday

evening - down  High Street, you will not recognize  that

place,  I  can assure you, Sir. Would the  Minister  do

something  about it because a lot has been  said  about

earning money through tourism and this certainly is not

a way to attract tourists?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

what  I  would like to tell the Minister is  this.  The

behaviour  of  the  sanitary inspectors  in  the  Upper

Serangoon  area, when they carry out their  duties,  is

not very good. At the end of this sitting, I will write

to  the  Minister  concerned and  remind  him  of  this

matter,  and I hope he will give consideration to  this

point.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I wish to take this

opportunity



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>



to welcome the steps taken by the Government to try and

solve  the  pressing problems of the  hawkers  who  are

plying their trade in back lanes and crowded streets. I

have  had occasion before to raise this matter  in  the

Chamber. Such steps might inconvenience certain people,

but  I  think,  in  the  interests  of  the  people  of

Singapore,  we  should not take this  problem  lightly.

There  must  be  proper regulation of control  to  look

after  the  hawkers' problem. If the  Government  takes

positive steps, I believe, like the recent outbreak  of

cholera epidemic, however much the Government puts  out

its efforts, this is a matter which we should view with

grave concern.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Mr Speaker, concerns health. We

should  feel ashamed of ourselves, as has been  pointed

out  by  the  Member for Mountbatten, that no  measures

have  been  taken to rectify the situation  as  certain

shops are dumping their rubbish indiscriminately.  This

not  only concerns health, but also we must take  pride

in the fact that Singapore can attract many tourists.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these tourists see hawkers plying all over the

city,  I think it will bring the good name of Singapore

into disrepute. I hope the recent measures taken by the

Government will be continued persistently.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Pasir

Panjang  has said that we have failed to carry out  our

promise  to  set  up one authority for the  control  of

hawkers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before we became the Government, hawker control was exercised by two authorities, the City Council and the Rural Board. Now with the integration of the local authorities and the Central Government, it is the Ministry of Health that exercise unified authority over hawkers. So that he really does

not understand what is happening in Singapore, although

he is a Member of this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have an intelligent and reasonable programme and an outlook on the hawkers' problem. It is not possible to eliminate the problem.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>



That  depends on the economics of our present position.

All  that  we  can  do is to bring  the  problem  under

reasonable  control. There are people who  are  not  as

fortunately placed as ourselves. These people  have  to

find  a  livelihood, and because they find it difficult

to find other employment, they have to take to hawking.

We  understand  all  that. We have tried  to  help  the

hawkers as much as we can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitherto the licensing laws were unreasonable in the

sense  that if a hawker decided to give up hawking,  he

was  not  permitted to transfer his business to another

person.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, we have  made  the  hawking

licence  freely transferable - that would stop graft.  In

the  past,  Sir, if a man gave up hawking, his  licence

would  be cancelled and his pitch would be put  up  for

auction as it were. And that, Mr Speaker, Sir, was  an

opportunity  for  corruption. Now  when  it  is  freely

transferable, he gets money for his pitch  whenever  he

wants to leave it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been necessary to remove hawkers from

areas  where  they  definitely cause  obstruction.  But

before  we take any action, we give them notice and  we

find   them  sites  close  to  where  they  have   been

operating. This is common knowledge in the town.  Upper

East  Coast  Road  has been mentioned. Everybody  knows

that  this spot, where the hawkers were hawking, was  a

spot  where you have, say, three big cinemas. The  road

there was very narrow and we had to widen it. For  that

reason, to relieve the traffic congestion there, we had

to   move   the  hawkers  into  backlanes,  give   them

alternative sites and provide standpipes for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Mr Speaker, Sir, outside the Hollywood

Theatre.  That was a complete mess. We have now  tidied

all that up. We have moved them into the grounds of the

Hollywood Theatre and everybody is satisfied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a scandalous traffic obstruction at the

corner  of Joo Chiat and Changi Roads. Everybody  knows

that  that juction is a main junction and it  caused  a

real obstruction. It was scandalous that it was allowed

to continue for so long. We had to serve notices on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>



hawkers  and  move them from outside Changi  Market  to

Lorong 101, which is just by the side of the market. We

provided pitches for the hawkers who were plying  their

trade in Joo Chiat Road outside the market. We took the

trouble to mark out about 150 pitches there. We did all

that.  We allocated sites to them. Everything was  done

through  a ballot system. Everybody who hawked  in  Joo

Chiat  Road  qualified for the ballot.  They  balloted.

They got their allotments. And we fixed a date by which

they  had  to move into their allotted areas.  When  we

went  in  there, we found the whole place  vacant.  Our

hawker inspectors had to check up why that happened. We

allotted  spaces  and  they disappeared.  We  went  in,

checked up and found most of those hawkers were hawkers

who had stalls in the market. We checked up their names

and  addresses when we marked them for ballot,  and  we

checked  on  their names and addresses  in  the  market

itself, and we found that they were related to the same

persons. It clearly shows you what happens if  the  law

is  not  enforced. There must be an enforcement of  the

law, otherwise no person who is in the market stall  is

going  to remain there if hawkers outside compete  with

them.  That is the clearest example which you  can  get

that that is so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody knows that there was a mess outside the

Lido Cinema in Orchard Road. All those hawkers have not

been  put  out of business. They have been accommodated

in  the  lane by the side of the East Asistic building.

That  is  a favourite haunt of all the people  who  are

employed  in the Orchard Road area. They go  there  and

eat  in the daytime. There has been no harm done to the

hawkers.  They  have  their  same  employment   at   an

alternative  site. Similarly with the  hawkers  at  the

East Coast Road area. They are in backlanes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there is the Tay Buan Guan organisation which has

a grocery shop in East Coast Road. They have offered to

put  up  a  building behind their shop  to  accommodate

these  hawkers.  They find there are opportunities  for

them to make money and for the hawkers to make



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>



money  with  them  just behind their business  in  East

Coast Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the Housing Board has also taken a very

enlightened  view of the hawker problem in the  Kallang

Board  Estate.  They  put up as  many  as  436  hawkers

pitches. Now they propose to rent those pitches `to all

hawkers  who  are now trading in shacks in  that  area.

When the hawkers move into these new pitches, they  can

demolish  those  shacks. They give them  a  proprietary

right to those pitches. Those hawkers who go into those

pitches will have to pay $10 a month and, at the end of

three years, the stall will be theirs - the site will  be

theirs to do as they will. And they pay a small fee  to

the  Hawkers Department to exercise proper control over

the  whole  problem.  That sort of operation  has  been

going  on, not only at Kallang but in Tanjong  Rhu,  in

the  Queenstown  area  and  in  many  other  areas   in

Singapore,  so  that it is not true  to  say  that  the

Government is dishonest in regard to the pledges it has

made  to the hawkers. Of course, we keep a close  watch

on  what  the  inspectors are doing.  We  have  in  the

Ministry  a  Hawkers Advisory Committee  on  which  the

Health Department doctors, the Road Traffic people  and

the Police are represented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have tried as much as we can to help them and see that there is an authority knowing what our inspectors are doing. They have to take out summonses against hawkers if they continue to obstruct the public roads, if they refuse to move into the sites that we make available for them. We have got to do

something about it. Recently somebody rang me up in the

office  saying that just by the Clifford  Pier  on  the

main  road there was a man setting up a hawker's stall.

If  we  had  allowed that, there would have  been  more

going  in  there, We had to take action immediately  to

clear him out of there. That must be done in order that

we can keep our streets clear for traffic to move in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Pasir Panjang said also that we were

unfair  in  the way we allotted pitches and  stalls  to

hawkers, that the allotments were handed over to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>



the  Hawkers'  Association. That is a  deliberate  lie.

There is not the slightest truth in that.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The word "lie" has been ruled

out time and again. The word "untruth" could be used.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I apologise, Mr Speaker, Sir,I withdraw

that and say this is a deliberate untruth. We make sure

that somebody responsible is present when the balloting

is  done,  and it is always the Parliamentary Secretary

himself who goes down and supervises the balloting.  So

that  it is completely untrue to say that this work  is

handed over to the Hawkers' Association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten says that the drains in

the Kallang area are always dirty. She fails to realise

that  these are tidal drains. When you have high tides,

the dirt does not go through the drains. The drains get

dirty.  We  have contractors to clean the  drains,  and

they are being adequately supervised. Making complaints

here  that the drains are dirty is a general complaint.

Members  should be specific about their complaints  and

not  just  say that all the drains in the Kallang  area

are dirty. Anybody can say that, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol complained that there was an

inspector  in  his  constituency  who  was  misbehaving

himself.  If the Member will give me his name later,  I

will look into this complaint in due course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must thank the Member for the Southern Islands who

has seen the problem and who realises what we are faced

with.  I  am glad that at least we do get support  from

Members of this House for the work we are doing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  would like to  speak  for  just  two

minutes. On the question of public health, I would  not

like  to say something unnecessarily. I only hope  that

the  Minister  for  Health will pay  attention  to  the

condition of the drains in Queen Street. The drains are

very  dirty.  If we were to compare Tanglin  and  Queen

Street,  there is a great difference. Dust bins  occupy

the backlanes in Rochore Road and Albert



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>



Street,  causing  obstruction to traffic.  I  hope  the

Public  Health Department will remove these  dust  bins

and improve the situation there.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

said  that I was not specific. I have been so  specific

in  this House that I described the drain and I  took

the trouble to go to the Minister's office sometime ago

to  even  tell him what was the cause of the congestion

in  the drain. If it is a tidal drain, then the tide is

a  strange  title  that never ebbs, because  the  water

level  is  always high. If the Minister wants  to  know

which  drain I am referring to specifically - all  drains

are dirty - it is especially the drain beside the Garrick

Theatre  and  it goes through the Haig Road  Government

quarters  into  East Coast Road and  into  the  Kampong

Amber  area down to the sea. That is the drain that  is

the worst hit.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> We will look into the complaint of the

Member for Bras Basah.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Moulmein.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Moulmein. He was once the Member for Bras

Basah, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Really?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> That is why he knows this area so very

well.  Anyway,  we will see that all  these  roads  are

cleaned up -  Queen Street, Rochore Road and Ophir Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as for the Member for Mountbatten, in a tidal

drain when there is high tide, the refuse does not flow

out.  It  is only when the tide is low that it can  get

cleansed.  There  is a difference between  an  ordinary

drain  and  a tidal drain. I did not know that  before,

but  I  had  to  learn it. I will tell the  Member  for

Mountbatten that I go round there myself.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Time is up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $23,720,230 for Head 27 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 29 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 29 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (1)  of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this concerns the President of the Industrial

Arbitration Court. All that I want to do is to ask  the

Minister a question under this amendment: what has  the

Government done in respect of a memorandum submitted by

the  Singapore Bank Employees' Union, whose adviser  is

Mr  C.  V. Devan Nair, which requested the removal  of

the President of the Arbitration Court?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it will be recalled that there was a

Press report on this and a photograph where we saw some

young  feminine  members of the Bank  Employees'  Union

going to the residence of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara to

present  the  memorandum. I am  told  that  the  P.A.P.

Government and Mr Devan Nair were not very happy about

the  contents  of the memorandum, but  because  of  the

pressure  of the members of the union and the executive

committee, this memorandum was submitted. I would  like

to  ask  the Minister if he can explain what steps  the

Government   has   taken  on  the  contents   of   this

memorandum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> When parties in a dispute appear before

the courts they either succeed or lose, and it will  be

quite  impossible  to  agree  that  when  a  party   is

dissatisfied just because the decision did  not  go  in

his  favour, then the judge is to he removed. We cannot

accept that that should be the position at all. In that

case, the dispute was whether a bonus was negotiable or

not.  The court held that it was and the Ordinance gave

it  the power to decide such questions. The court  went

on  to apply the quantum of bonus awarded in an earlier

banking  caste  to  the  dispute  in  question  without

hearing from, the union on the question of quantum, and

the  court had the power to so award. In that case,  it

is clearly a case where we should amend the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>



law to provide that where earlier awards are applied in

subsequent cases, the court should not apply the  terms

of  the  earlier  award to the case in question  before

giving  the  union  concerned an opportunity  of  being

heard.  That  is  clearly a case for amending  the  law

rather than removing the President from discharging his

functions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Could I ask the Minister a question, Sir?

The 1962 Estimates give the emoluments of the President

as  $26,100.  The 1963 Estimates - that is,  the  present

Estimates - give  it  as $23,400. There  seems  to  be  a

reduction of $2,700 in his annual emoluments. Is  there

a cut in his salary?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I do not think that his salary has been in

any  way revised downwards, Anyway, I will check up  on

that to find out what has happened.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Member for Thomson wish for a

vote?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I beg to move, Mr Speaker, Sir,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 29 he reduced by

$10 in respect of item (14)  of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will notice that I have another amendment,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 29 be reduced by $10 in respect of item (25) of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are similar items in respect of the two Judges.

Shall I deal with both of them?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Certainly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the first time

that  an entertainment allowance is being given to  the

First  President and to the Second President. Before  I

say  anything  on this, could I ask the  Minister  what

motivated  the Government to provide this entertainment

allowance of $150 a month for each of these Presidents?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head 29 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (14)  of subhead 1."



<br><br>The debate may range over item (25)  of subhead 1.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> It is laid down in the Industrial

Relations  Ordinance that the President  has  the  same

tenure of office and terms of office as a Supreme Court

Judge.   It  is  specifically  so  laid  down  in   the

Ordinance. And he receives the same salary as a Supreme

Court   Judge.   All  Supreme  Court  Judges   get   an

entertainment   allowance  of  $150   a   month,   and,

therefore,  we  thought it right and  proper  that  the

President  of  the  Court should  also  have  the  same

allowance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park will remember that we

created  the post of the Deputy President, and  it  was

provided  in  the  amending Ordinance that  the  Deputy

President should exercise the same powers and have  the

same   protection  and  immunities  as  the  President.

Therefore,  Mr Speaker, Sir, we thought  that  it  was

right  that  the Deputy President also should  have  an

entertainment allowance. Now, the Deputy President is a

career  officer  in the legal service of  Superscale  G

standing, and he has been seconded for service in  this

post   as   Deputy   President,   These   entertainment

allowances  are  attached  to  offices.  They  are  not

personal  allowances.  They  are  allowances  that  are

attached  to  particular offices. We have  also  powers

under the Ordinance to appoint an acting President  and

an  Acting  Deputy  President,  so  that  whenever  the

President  or the Deputy President is away, the  Acting

President or the Acting Deputy President can draw  upon

these  allowances. Not being personal  allowances,  the

allowances  must be specially claimed and supported  by

vouchers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, I concede to the Minister

that if an allowance is properly payable in the case of

the  President, it should also be paid in the  case  of

the  President  of  the  Second Industrial  Arbitration

Court.  I  certainly  concede that proposition.  But  I

think  the  Minister takes the view that,  because  the

Industrial Relations Ordinance sets out the status  and

position of a Judge



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>



appointed under that Ordinance shall be similar to that

of our Judges in the Supreme Court, therefore, anything

that  is  given to a Judge should also be  given  to  a

Judge under the Industrial Arbitration Ordinance.  That

I  do  not  accept, Mr Speaker, Sir. I think what  the

Industrial Arbitration Ordinance intended to do was  to

preserve  the status and power and position  of  Judges

and  give  them a similar status. I doubt whether  that

proposition  could  reasonably include  the  contention

that,  because  a  Supreme  Court  Judge  is  given  an

entertainment allowance, therefore, it follows that the

Industrial Court President should also get it; now, not

all   our  Judges  get  entertainment  allowances.  Our

District  Judges  do not get entertainment  allowances.

The  Supreme Court Puisne Judges certainly do, and  the

Chief  Justice  gets  a very much bigger  entertainment

allowance than the Puisne Judges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think the main reason for giving our High Court

Judges allowances - and I do not deny that they should be

given  those  allowances - is  that  by  virtue  of  the

position   that  they  hold,  they  have  to   maintain

themselves  in  a  certain  manner  and  when  visiting

dignitaries come, it is incumbent upon them to see that

they are properly entertained. I accept the proposition

that   our   Supreme  Court  Judges  should  be   given

entertainment  allowances  for  which  they   are   not

accountable in a voucher form. Do they?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne</b> indicated assent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> In any case, I do not think that a Judge

of an Industrial Arbitration Court should be put in the

position of a Supreme Court Judge. None of our District

Court  Judges  are  placed in that  position,  although

their  status, to my mind, is not any inferior to  that

of the President of an Industrial Arbitration Court.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is laid down in the

Industrial Relations Ordinance that the President shall

have  the  same  rights,  privileges,  protection   and

immunity  as  a  Judge of the Supreme  Court,  and  the

section  goes  on  to say that the  provisions  of  the

Singapore (Constitution) Order in Council, 1958,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>



relating to the tenure of office and the term of office

of Judges of the Supreme Court shall apply to him as if

he  were  a Judge of the Supreme Court. If the  Supreme

Court  Judges  are given an entertainment allowance  of

$150  a  month, or $1,800 a year, it follows from  that

that  the  President should also qualify for  the  same

allowance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is by way of an inquiry with a view to obtaining

information - "Rent of premises ... $14,400".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The premises in respect of which this rent is being

charged  is  in  the Supreme Court building.  Am  I  to

S10 in respect of subhead 3.



<br><br>"Allowance  for Panel Members and Referees."  Sir,  the

Industrial  Arbitration Court  is  constituted  of  the

President  and two panel members, one representing  the

employers' panel member and the other representing  the

employees'   panel  member.  Sir,   under   section   6

subsection  (3)  of the Industrial Relations  Ordinance,

the Minister may from time to time invite a trade union

of employers and a trade union of employees to nominate

members for inclusion in the panels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to draw the attention of the House to the

fact that today the members in the employees' panel are

members  who have been appointed by the P.A.P. unions.

This  is a very major grievance because the implication

of  this,  in practice, is that a large group of  trade

unions which do not owe loyalty to the P.A.P. and which

reject  attempts  by the P.A.P. Government  to  control

them  are  denied  the right of nominating  members  of

their choice to the panel. So when a dispute concerning

this  group of unions goes before the court, they  will

not  have the opportunity of nominating a man of  their

choice to sit in the court. I believe the Minister will

agree that the principle underlying the appointment  of

panel  members is to allow the unions and the employers

alike  the  right to nominate members of the court  who

would,  in  their view, help to bring about  industrial

justice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be recalled that during the time when the

amendment to this section was debated in this  House - I

believe   sometime  last  year - it  was  a  very   small

amendment  which merely sought to substitute the  words

"Trades Union Congress" in section 6 subsection  3  (b)

to  read "a trade union of employees". During the  time

when  this  amendment was debated, I raised this  point

and the Minister gave an assurance that he would invite

unions  to  nominate  members to the  employees'  panel

irrespective of the union's political allegiance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to repeat my request last year and

ask  the  Minister, once again, to give  a  pledge - only

this time I ask him to try and keep his word -  and write

to  the  unions and invite them to nominate members  to

the employees' panel.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the employees' panel, as

constituted today, consists of six persons. It has been

very  hard  to  find unionists with the competence  and

ability  that  we  require to serve on  the  employees'

panel of this court. After a lot of difficulty, we have

been able to get only six persons so far.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Nonsense.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Yes. Now, the Member for Thomson very well

knows  that  when  the Ordinance was first  passed,  it

provided  that  the T.U.C. could automatically  appoint

all the members of the employees' panel. That provision

of  the Ordinance was in force for two years after  the

First Court was constituted, and I remember, when I was

in  the  Labour  Ministry, I wrote to  the  T.U.C. and

requested them personally, on many occasions,  to  make

the full appointments to the employees' panel. All that

I could get were only four names from them, and amongst

the   four   was  Mr  James  Puthucheary.  Mr   James

Puthucheary, as the Member for Thomson very well knows,

served  on  that  panel  up to the  time  when  he  was

detained in February this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there has been a split in the trade union

movement. The Government did not take him out or  force

him  to  come  out of that panel, just because  he  had

joined the S.A.T.U. group. He was, in fact, a member of

that Court up to the date of his detention in February.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is easy for the Member for Thomson to impute bias against us. He very well knows that we found great difficulty. Every time there is a case to be heard by the Arbitration Court, the unions of the S.A.T.U. group refused to make an appointment with anybody in this panel.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> You never wrote to us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> They refused to make an appointment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Nonsense.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> So I invariably got letters from either

the  President  or the Deputy President  asking  me  to

exercise  my powers, since they do not want to nominate

one  from  the  panel  on  to  the  Court,  to  make  a

nomination myself. The Member for Thomson is well aware

of the position.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it will be embarrassing

for the Minister if I suggest that he is lying.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Does the Member not know that

that word is prohibited? He must withdraw the word  and

apologise.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I withdraw the word.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> And apologise.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I apologise to the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, the Minister is talking nonsense. In the

first  place,  he talks about the T.U.C. days.  It  is

behind  times. The T.U.C. was dissolved in 1961 because

Mr  Kandasamy,  a  P.A.P. Member  and  the  Secretary-General  of  the T.U.C., went to see the  Minister  for

Labour, another P.A.P. Member, and asked for the T.U.C.

to  be dissolved and the T.U.C. was dissolved. That was

in 1961. This is now 1963, Mr Speaker, I agree that in

1961, when the T.U.C. was asked to nominate, there were

difficulties in getting the names. That was because  of

the    political   considerations   that   the   P.A.P.

representatives  gave  in the T.U.C. secretariat  when

their  names were being considered. But, however,  that

is a story relating back to 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, right at the moment, no union which is a non-P.A.P. union as such - I can name at least 40 trade

unions representing more than 100,000 members has  ever

been  invited  to  nominate members to  the  employees'

panel. The Minister says that he has six now and I tell

him that he can appoint up to ten. Let him write to  us

tomorrow  and we will nominate four names. Let  him  do

that.  Then there should be no difficulty.  If  he  had

written  to  these unions and if they  had  refused  to

nominate members to this panel, then he would have been

justified in what he says. But this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>



is  not  the case. He has not invited at least  40 trade  unions,

which constitute the  majority  of trade  unions  in Singapore,

which  represent  the majority  of  the  working  population  and

which represent  the  majority of disputes  arising,  to nominate

their representatives to the  employees' panel.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, the unions of  this group  have  consistently shown by their  attitude

that  they  do  not  wish to  participate  in  the workings  of  this Court.

That is the  front  that they put up all the time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Nonsense.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Everytime when there is a case to he heard,

they will not make a nomination  from  the panel,  and they leave it

to the Minister to  make the nomination.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> That is because

we  do  not  have  a member.  Mr  Byrne:  That is always the thing  that

they have  done.  It  is not true for  the  Member  for Thomson  to

just gloss over all these things  and say,  "Oh,  yes, that was in 1961." For two  solid years  from  20th October, 1960,  when  the  First

Industrial Arbitration Court began to function, we have written repeatedly

to them and asked them  to make  their nominations to this panel.  Under

the powers  of  the Ordinance, before it was  amended, they  had  the  right

to appoint all  ten  to  the employees' panel. They refused to do so and

until today  they have not shown that they have  changed their attitude at

all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I wish to point this out. Perhaps the Minister is under a misapprehension. He is talking of two things at the same time, One is the appointment of a member from the employees' panel to sit in the Court to hear a dispute, and the other is what I referred to just now under section 6 subsection 3 (b) where the Minister may invite a

trade  union to nominate for the inclusion in  the

employees' panel such number of persons as he  may

specify.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the first point. Today, because these 40

unions  do  not have on the employees'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>



panel  such persons  as they themselves have appointed  to  be

included in the employees' panel, when a case goes

before  the Court, these unions do not know  which

member of the employees' panel to choose. If there

is  a  dispute concerning a bank employees'  union

and an employer, the bank employees' union chooses

a  member  from  the employees' panel  because  it

knows,  perhaps, that so and so in the  employees'

panel  can represent the union's interest well  in

the court.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to these 40-odd unions, this is not possible

because  they do not have, at the moment,  anybody

in  the employees' panel whom they have nominated.

This is  what the Minister means  when  he  says

sometimes we do not nominate members to the court.

That  is  quite so, Sir. But my grievance  is  not

about  that.  I say, to remedy this position,  the

Minister,  under  section 6  subsection  (3)   (b) ,

should  write to, if not the 40 unions,  at  least

some  of  the  big  unions,  and  invite  them  to

nominate  names  for inclusion in  the  employees'

panel. There is no question of our not wanting  to

go  to court. Surely if the Minister looks up  the

records,  he knows the number of cases  these  so-called  Communist unions have taken  to  court.  I

give a pledge to the Minister that if he writes to

us  tomorrow, within a matter of a week,  we  will

nominate. There are four places. The Minister says

there  are  only six at the moment. The  Ordinance

allows  up  to ten. We will nominate four,  if  we

can,  and  if not, at least two, Let the  Minister

write to us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I take it the

Member  for  Thomson  has given  an  assurance  in

public  that  he  supports  this  court  as  such.

Otherwise, their attitude was this. "This was  the

court   that   the   Government   had   set   up." [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> "We did not participate in this

court.  We  do  not want to have  a  hand  in  the

operation.   Let   the  Minister   so   make   the

appointments."   Mr  Speaker,  that   was   their

consistent attitude.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>



When  they  had  the  power  to  make  all   the

appointments  to  the panel - I spoke  to  the  big  boss

himself,  Lim  Ching Siong, he said no. He  said,  "Mr

Byrne,  we  make four. You make the rest. This  is  the

court that the Government set up." I like to hear  what

the  Member  for Thomson said. He said so  publicly  in

this  Assembly today that he fully supports this court,

and  that  if  the Minister writes to him he  is  quite

prepared  to suggest at least two names. I pointed  out

to  this  Assembly  that Mr James  Puthucheary  was  a

member  of  this court. There was a split. He  was  not

removed  because  he  joined  the  S.A.T.U. group.  He

continued  to  serve on the panel. I pointed  out  that

there  are  these four vacancies. We could have  tilled

all  the  vacancies. But we have left four appointments

still  vacant on this panel. In view of what the Member

for   Thomson  has  said,  we  are  prepared  to   give

consideration ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Write to us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> --- to his request in this Assembly, in view

of what he has said here today.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, I originally wanted to speak

also  under amendment (7)*, but since the Minister  has raised this, I might as well

make the speech now.







<hr size="2" noshade>

*  Amendment (7) reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 29 be reduced by $100.

<hr size="2" noshade>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no question of our supporting the court

or  not  supporting  the court. The  Arbitration  Court

exists and it will continue to function so long as  the

Industrial Relations Ordinance is in force. Sir, I  can

say that we have never boycotted the court as such.  We

have had our reservations. If today the Bank Employees'

Union  can  say, "Petition the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara,

throw  the President out" - and it is because this was  a

legitimate complaint; there was discontent. We had  our

reservations. We do not want to run to the  court  like

the Bank Employees' Union. Devan Nair faces the workers

and  makes  a  very fiery speech. Tempers  go  up.  The

workers  say  they  want to go on  strike.  But  it  is

against the P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>



policy  to call strikes because more strikes will  mean

more  Communists  coming out. But, on the  other  hand,

they  cannot possibly tell the workers, "Do not  go  on

strike," because the workers would turn around and  say

to  Devan Nair. "You are not brave enough to lead us on

strike."  So  they call a strike for a few  days.  Then

they  go  to  the Minister and say, "Please,  Minister,

refer it to the Arbitration Court," And so they had one

strike   after   another - the  Bank  of   America,   the

Mercantile Bank, the Chartered Bank, the Straits Times,

one  after  another all these went to  the  Arbitration

Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not operate on this basis. And we say, Mr

Speaker,   unreservedly,  that  we  believe  that   the

Arbitration  Court  can fulfil  a  useful  function  in

solving   industrial   disputes  and   in   maintaining

industrial  peace.  But as to whether  this  court  can

succeed  or  not  will  depend on the  individuals  who

operate  this court, including the Government. But  the

Minister  wants a pledge as to whether we are going  to

support the court. I do not see his question. We do not

boycott  the court. We go to the court. There  was  the

Plywood  case. I cannot remember offhand,  but  if  the

Minister wants, I can list the number of cases that  we

have  referred to arbitration, Fraser and Co, went  on

strike.  We  asked the Ministry of Labour  Conciliation

Officer  to  get  the employer to agree  to  refer  the

dispute  to  arbitration.  The  employer  refused.  The

Government did nothing about it. Watts & Baker went  on

strike.  Ford went on strike. In the Straits Times,  43

workers  made a demonstration today because  they  were

sacked  for  getting cholera inoculations. We  ask  the

Minister, "Refer this case to arbitration."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are facts. He tried to put on a show that

we  boycotted the court. We were against the  operation

of the court and, therefore, we should not be given the

right to appoint members to the employees' panel. I say

this is merely, in the usual P.A.P. fashion, a cover to

protect  the wrong that they have done to the  majority

of  unions. I hope, Mr Speaker, that the Minister will

give a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>



pledge that he will write to these unions, ask them  to

nominate members to the employees' panel and we  pledge

to nominate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we will give

consideration  to this request. As far as  the  strikes

that were referred to just now are concerned, I do  not

know what the facts are. But I know it was the habit of

the  unions  in this particular group to strike  first,

and  then when they get the worst of it, they  try  the

Arbitration  Court.  That is not playing  fair  by  the

court.  If  they cannot get their way, it is only  when

they  fail in the strike that they say. "We go  to  the

Arbitration Court."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr S.

T. Bani ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) That the sum to be allocated for Head 29 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 5.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Bani, amendment (6) .



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I am not moving.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (7), Mr Bani.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 29 be

reduced by $100.*





<hr size="2" noshade>

*  The same amendment also stood in the names of Tun Lim Yew Hock and Dr Thio Chan Bee.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I merely wish to make this point under this

amendment.  We definitely have certain reservations  as

to  whether  these Arbitration Courts can fulfil  their

functions  in  establishing industrial  justice.  These

reservations  are justified by events that  have  taken

place in the past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the proper functioning of these courts, one

of  the necessary things the Government ought to do  is

to ensure that there is no governmental intervention in

the  proceedings  of  the Arbitration  Court.  As,  for

example,  in the case of a journalist who was dismissed

by  Kerala  Bandhu Press in 1961, the proceedings  were

interrupted under a cloak of secrecy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>



and  an  award  was made without the case  being  fully

heard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Speaker, it is necessary to give all

trade  unions  the facilities of participation  in  the

proceedings  of  the  court - the  facilities  to  appear

before the court. Sir, the proceedings of the court are

conducted  in English. There are very few  trade  union

officers  who are English-educated and who arc  capable

of  presenting  cases in English.  We  have  made  this

request in the past and we renew this request again -  we

think  that  the courts must allow for multi-lingualism

in the proceedings.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have just one

observation. Under the Industrial Courts Ordinance, the

Minister  responsible  for this  is  the  Minister  for

Labour. I am therefore, wondering whether it would  not

be   proper   that   such   estimates   should   appear

appropriately under the Ministry of Lahour instead  of

the Ministry of Law.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Thio?



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I am not speaking.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there really was not any

governmental  intervention as such. The only  thing  is

that  the court was made aware of reasons why the paper

in  question  was  not  allowed  to  circulate  in  the

Federation.  That cannot be held to be intervention  of

any   sort   of   governmental  intervention   in   the

proceedings of the Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the question of facilities for participation. We have the ordinary courts of criminal and civil jurisdiction here, where the proceedings are in English. There would be chaos, Mr Speaker, Sir, if the proceedings were to be conducted in Tamil or in Malay or in Chinese in this Court. That is not possible

and  the Member for Thomson knows that to be so.  There

are legal problems connected with this court, and as  I

hold  the  portfolio for legal affairs, it  is  thought

desirable  that this court should be placed  under  the

responsibility of my Ministry. But in point of fact, in

the normal operation of the court, it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>



the  Minister for Labour who is in charge, in the sense

that  he is vested with the power to refer disputes  to

arbitration   under  the  powers  of   the   Industrial

Relations Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $348,010 for Head 29 ordered to stand part

of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 32 -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head 32, State Advocate-General's

Chambers. Tun Lim.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 32 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (6)  of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item (6) of subhead 1 is in respect of Legal

Officers, and the salary given is $2,500 a month.  Sir,

if  that is the correct salary, it would mean that  the

annual   emoluments  of  Legal  Officers  is   $30,000.

Therefore,  there  must  be something  wrong  with  the

arithmetic,  $30,000  for one Legal  Officer.  For  two

Legal Officers it will be $60,000 and not $40,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Sir, in fact, when this vote was entered

in  the  Estimates, it was envisaged that we  would  be

able to get three specialists for legal drafting, crime

prosecutions and civil and income tax prosecutions, but

we have not been able to get any of them, and it is for

this  reason that this vote has been reduced. In  fact,

we  are  paying  for  the services  of  an  Income  Tax

specialist  from out of this vote and he receives  much

less than $2,500 a month.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I think the explanation for this is

simple,  Sir. For last year it was $60,000  for  three;

therefore, for two, in proportion, it must be $40,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Yes, that is the answer. Yes.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> But that would mean that ever since

1962  they have not been able to get the Legal Officers

of the qualifications they want.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> That is so, yes. In fact, that is the

point. We have reduced the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>



number  to  two,  and the money is even  more  than  is

required to pay the present incumbents who are  helping

out.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> May I withdraw?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 32 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (21)  of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before I move my amendment. I wish to

bring to your notice that I had given notice of  an amendment

under  item  (20) ,  but  because  under  the "Notes"  column,

within brackets the words "se" appear, it would appear that my

notice was treated as being out of  order. My contention is this: that my notice was in

order,  because  under  section  30  of  the  Singapore

(Constitution) Order in Council, subsection (7) , if you

will permit me to read it, Mr Speaker, says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The State Advocate-General shall be paid such

remuneration and allowances as may from time to time be

determined  by the Assembly, and such remuneration  and

allowances  shall be charged on and  paid  out  of  the

Consolidated Fund'



<br><br>So  unless  and  until the remuneration and  allowances

have  been determined by this Assembly, they shall  not

be  chargeable on the Consolidated Fund, and it is only

charges  on  the Consolidated Fund that  are  items  of

statutory  expenditure.  So  until  the  Assembly   has

approved  the allowances of the State Advocate-General,

it is not a charge on the Consolidated Fund. Therefore,

it is not statutory expenditure. Therefore. I am within

my rights in moving the amendment. Mr Speaker, Sir,  I

would like your ruling on whether I can deal with  that

item now.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member did give me prior

notice of this point, and it would appear to me that it

is  so:  that if the Assembly has not as yet determined

by  resolution  the  allowance of the  State  Advocate-General,  then the Member is entitled to his  query  on

the allowance, The salary of the State Advocate-General

has,  in  fact, been resolved by the Assembly, but  not

the allowance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1089</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in dealing with this

particular allowance, which the Government is  bringing

to  this  House,  the first thing I wish  to  raise  is

whether it is ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I take it that the Member for

Farrer Park did give due notice to the Minister that he

would raise this point, because if he has not done  so.

then  I  am  afraid  he  cannot raise  the  matter -  the

mistake was in the office and no notice has been  given

to the Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I do not mind.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister is prepared to answer. Mr

Rajah.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I think the point is a constitutional one.

There  is  nothing intricate about it.  There  are  two

points,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir. One  is  a  constitutional

point.  You  see, Sir, the remuneration  of  the  State

Advocate-General  was.  I  think,   determined   by   a

resolution of this Assembly on 16th July, 1959.  It  is

subsequent  to that resolution that it became  possible

for the Government to put it down in the Budget. Unless

and until a resolution has been framed and approved  by

this  Assembly in respect of the $6,000, my  submission

to  the  Assembly  would he that  this  $6,000  is  not

properly entered in the Budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second item I wish to bring to the notice of the

Assembly  is  this.  The point  that  would  have  been

raised, certainly by me if a resolution to this  effect

had  been brought to the House, would be this: that the

remuneration of the State Advocate-General is  $24,900.

The remuneration of the Chief Justice, which is on page

45  of  the Estimates, is $28,500. So remuneration  for

remuneration, there is a difference which reflects  the

importance  of  the  position and  the  status  of  the

position in our constitutional setup. This allowance of

$6,000  which, really, in effect is a remuneration,  if

added to the State Advocate-General's salary, makes  it

$30,900, which makes him $2,400 above that of the Chief

Justice. Now, Mr Speaker, that is a position I  cannot

accept. That is the second point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is: I object on principle, and I

think the Minister for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>



Law  will  agree  with me on this,  that  no  allowance

should  be paid to the holder of any office special  to

himself.  He  is the holder of the post.  The  post  is

evaluated at a certain sum of money. He gets  that  and

nothing more. It is an invidious business that when the

present  holder  vacates  his office,  either  in  five

years' time or two years' time as the case may be,  the

subsequent  incumbent of that post is not going  to  be

given $2,400 on the basis that "You are not as good  as

the previous chap."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on these three points, Mr Speaker, Sir, I

certainly object to this special allowance personal  to

the  present  holder  of the post  of  State  Advocate-General. The only reason for my giving notice  of  item

(21)   was  to join the two together and speak  on  them

together. Now that I have made my point on item (20), I

do  not wish to say anything more on item (21), because

the  State  Advocate-General gets  his  usual  variable

allowance  which  any other officer in  the  Government

gets.  That  is  why  I wanted to  raise  this  in  the

Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand this

allowance   was  paid  to  the  State  Advocate-General

because he is not only the State Advocate-General,  but

the  Permanent  Secretary of  the  legal  side  of  the

Ministry  of Health and Law. He has a lot of duties  to

discharge.  Not only has he to exercise  his  functions

under  the  Constitution  in  the  matter  of  criminal

prosecutions   and   advise   all   Government    legal

departments,  but he is also the Head of  his  Chambers

and  the  Head, as Permanent Secretary, of a number  of

very  important Government legal departments, like  the

Official  Assignee  and  Public Trustee's  Office,  the

Registry of Companies, the Registry of Trade Marks, the

Business  Names  and Patents Office,  the  Registry  of

Marriages,  the  Registry  of  Muslim  Marriages,   the

Shariah  Court, the Legal Aid Bureau, and the  Juvenile

Court.  He exercises administrative control over  these

important  legal departments. Now that is quite  unlike

what  the Judges do. We found it impossible to pay  the

State Advocate-General a sum equal to or more than that

of  the Chief Justice. It would be quite improper if we

did that. On the other hand, we must recognise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1091</b></font><br><br>



that the State Advocate-General carries more duties. He

has  to discharge more duties, and he is vested with  a

lot  of  responsibilities for which  he  would  not  he

adequately compensated if he were to receive  a  salary

lower  than that of the Chief Justice without  adequate

compensation. For that reason, it has been agreed  that

he should get his allowance.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Can I say a few words about this

matter, Mr Speaker, Sir? Since no notice was given  of

this item. I have not come here prepared with the brief

on   the  constitutional  position  of  this  item   of

expenditure. But may I tell the Member for Farrer  Park

about the practical considerations which have led us to

give  him this allowance personal to himself?  I  agree

with  the Member for Farrer Park that it is not a  good

practice,  but  nevertheless there  are  precedents  of

allowances  personal  to  the  holder,  and  these  are

carried out only in exceptional circumstances. There is

every  reason  to  consider  his  appointment  and  his

allowances  as  exceptional. He is a man of  tremendous

breadth and depth of intellect, a man whose ability  at

legal  draftsmanship is unsurpassed  in  this  country.

Further. I should like to inform the House that he  has

been  invited by the United Nations to serve in a  very

high  office in that institution, the salary for  which

would  be considerably more than what we are now paying

him.  And  in fairness to him and in acknowledgment  of

his great abilities, Government has agreed to grant him

this  allowance.  If  judgment  is  made  on  practical

considerations as against the constitutional legalistic

aspect, I do not think anyone will grudge the incumbent

this additional allowance.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not grudging the

incumbent his allowance. In fact, I feel very sorry for

having to raise this, but I feel it my duty to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you will remember that on previous occasions when it was suggested that the State Advocate-General should be the Permanent

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>



Secretary  to a Minister, I objected to it. I  objected

in the most categorical terms, I told the House that it

was  not right for the State Advocate-General to be the

head  of  a department in respect of which he might  be

called   upon  to  give  advice  against   some   other

department,  and  that  would  place  him,  the   State

Advocate-General, in an invidious position if  he  were

made the Permanent Secretary to a Minister. Because  as

Permanent Secretary to the Minister, he is a servant to

the  Minister,  but  as  State Advocate-General  he  is

outside  the control of the Minister and in a  position

to  say  yes  or  no  to him. And because  of  the  two

capacities  in  which  he  has  to  function,  I   have

advocated  that  those  two  functions  should  not  he

conferred  on the State Advocate-General and he  should

remain  State  Advocate-General, pure and  simple,  and

nothing else,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I sympathise entirely with the plight of the Government. If I were the Government, it could be that I might try to do something about it. But the way in which it is being done is absolutely wrong. To put it under the heading "Special Allowance personal to present holder of post of State Advocate-General - $6,000" straightaway, puts it in opposition to

the post of Chief Justice and invidious comparisons are

made between the two. Under our Constitution, the Chief

Justice enjoys a very much higher status than the State

Advocate-General, as it must inevitably be so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if the services of the State Advocate-General in

the  special circumstances in which the Government  now

finds  itself are absolutely invaluable to them at  the

moment,  then  I  would suggest to the Government  that

this  is not the way to do it. There are several  other

ways of doing it, and it is not for me to suggest them.

My business this evening is to tell the Government that

this  is  absolutely the wrong way to do it - to  give  a

special allowance personal to the present holder of the

post  of State Advocate-General is wrong. Could  I  ask

the Minister whether this is a pensionable allowance?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It is not.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It is not. So if it were a pensionable

allowance,  it  would he even worse. Mr Speaker,  Sir.

But the position is: there it is. It makes him the most

highly paid legal officer in the State, and that is why

I object to it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On the legalistic point, if the matter

is to he referred for legal opinion, may I also suggest

that  the  matter of salaries of Judges he investigated

because  there  is a similar section in  the  Order  in

Council which says - I will read the section 92 (2):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Judges of the Supreme Court shall be paid such

remuneration and allowances as may from time to time be

prescribed  by or under any law for the time  being  in

force   in   Singapore,  or,  if  not  so   prescribed,

determined by the Assembly...'.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> At the present moment, this matter

is under review.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister for Law has got two more

minutes if he wishes to speak.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> We will take those constitutional points

and see how best we can regularise the whole thing.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Member wish for a vote?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> No. I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, here again, this is a vote for Political

Secretary.   I  remember  on  previous  occasions   the

Political Secretary in the Ministry of Finance had been

under  fire, and every time we raised objection to  his

appointment  and even doubts as to the advisability  of

retaining  the  services of a man who is  known  to  be

associated with the Communists and in a position  where

he  could he described as a sort of Political Commissar

over-looking the work of the Minister for Finance,  the

Minister for Finance was very prompt in jumping  up  to

his feet and defending his Political Secretary. He even

went  to the extent of paying tribute to him for having

done  good  work for him in his Ministry. He said  that

the person concerned knew his job and had been of value

to him and that he was also a man of many capabilities.

The  Minister for Finance liked his Political Secretary

so  much that the Government had decided that it  would

be  better to put him in gaol to practise or  to  learn

some  more about the art of presenting the Government's

case  to the public and bringing the public closer  and

closer to the People's Government.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the exact words which I used

to  describe my former Political Secretary are that  he

was  a  very  bright young man, and indeed  he  was,  I

cannot say how sorry I am now that he has met ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Why did you lock him up?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, I just want to express sorrow

that such a bright young chap should have come to grief

in  so ignominous a manner, All this goes to prove that

I  must be most careful in selecting the next candidate

for this post.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, does the Minister for Finance

still consider that he should have this post ready as a

bait for another Communist?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I have already conceded to

the  Opposition  that I must make my  choice  with  far

greater circumspection than was the case previously.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> May I withdraw, Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 33 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (67)  of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item (67) is in respect of personal emoluments for

eight General Clerical Officers. Eight General Clerical

Officers  last year drew a total emolument of  $22,410,

whereas for 1963 it is going to be $30,650. It means an

increase  of more than $8,000. Does it mean  that  each

clerical officer gets an annual increment of $1,000?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the increase is only partly

due  to  the abnormal annual increments of salaries  of

the clerical staff. The main reason is the transfer  of

more  senior  clerks drawing higher  salaries  to  this

particular section.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> May I withdraw, Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 33 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (79)  of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item (79) deals with Variable Allowance in respect of

officers who are working in the Budget section  of  the

Ministry of Finance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> That is right.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Minister says, "That is right."

Going   through  the  personal  emoluments  side  under Budget,

there  is  no change in the  number  of  posts

between   1962   and  1963.  But  for  total   personal

emoluments for the officers in this Budget section,  an

increase  of  $5,330 is shown. So  there  is  a  normal

increase  in the personal emoluments of these officers.

Yet  for  variable allowances there is  a  decrease  of

$2,550.  How  does  that  come  about - an  increase   in

personal   emoluments  means  a  decrease  in  variable

allowances,  particularly when you deal with  Divisions

II and III officers?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the Member's arithmetic correct?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Yes. Under item (79) there is a

reduction of $2,550.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The increase mentioned by the Member

for Cairnhill is an increase in the total emoluments ---



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Of all officers.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In the Budget section?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> But, as I have said, is the Member

satisfied with his arithmetic as to whether it is

correct?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Yes. If I could help the Minister,

Sir: the whole total for 1963 is $317,950 and for 1962

is $312,620 - a difference of $5,330.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Under the Budget section?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I am sure the arithmetic of

the  Member  for Cairnhill is quite wrong.  Let  us  go

through  item by item. Item (70) , there is  no  change.

Item  (71) , there is no change. Item (72) , there is  no

change. Item (73) , there is no change. Item (74) , there

is no change. Item (75) , there is a change -  there is  a

reduction  of  nearly $5,000. There is a  reduction  in

item  (76).  There is a reduction in item (77),  and  a

small  increase in item (78). Therefore, I think  there

is a decrease and not an increase.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>



So  the  Member's arithmetic is slightly off the  mark.

Actually there were changes in the holders of the posts

in  respect of three Executive Officers, one  temporary

stenographer and one general clerical officer. That  is

the  reason  why - [Interruption].  The  stenographer  is

probably an unmarried young lady and therefore draws  a

smaller variable allowance.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I found where my mistake occurs. It

is  because  I  took all the items under "Establishment

and   Financial,   Administration  Division".   May   I

withdraw, Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 33 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (116)  of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item (116) of subhead 1 is in respect of personal

emoluments    for   34   General   Clerical    Officers

(Supernumerary). Thirty-four for last year and  34  for

this year. For last year, the total emoluments came  to

$81,600, but for this year, it is down by half. Does it

mean that there is a total change of all the 34, or  is

it  due  to  pay  cuts?  Or were all  the  34  Clerical

Officers  (Supernumerary) removed and new Supernumerary

Clerical Officers engaged on a lower timescale?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, this vote is intended to pay

newly  recruited General Clerical Officers who have  to

undergo  a  period  of  training  of  about  six  weeks

immediately after recruitment before posting to various

Ministries.  This training includes attending  lectures

at  the  Staff Training School, followed by attachments

in various departments for practical training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, this vote is only used to pay the salaries

and   allowances  of  newly  engaged  General  Clerical

Officers  and this provision really works out to  about

eight  months' salary. We found that the provision  for

1962 was rather too high; we accordingly reduced it for

this year.

<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 33 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (127)  of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the post of Director of Training (and Head of

Political Study Centre) seems to be very like  that  of

the  Political  Secretary. I just wonder whether  after

four  years this post is now necessary, because if  the

Political  Secretaries who may  be  regarded  as  super

graduates  have most of them been found to be  disloyal

and so dangerous that they must be sent somewhere else,

maybe  there  is no necessity for having this  training

school,  In  any case, after four years, whatever  work

that  the school was intended to do must have been done

already.  Unless, Sir, the Finance Minister feels  that

there are still many more in the Government service who

must  undergo training through this school. I  do  hope

that  they will be more successful than in the case  of

those  who  have had political training to be Political

Secretaries under them.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Member for Tanglin is

labouring  under  a  grave misapprehension  as  to  the

duties  of  the  holder  of this  post.  He  is  not  a

Political Secretary. The fact that the word "Political"

occurs  in both posts does not mean that there  is  any

similarity in the duties of these two posts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year, I have had to explain what work the

Political Study Centre does and what the objectives the

Government hopes to achieve by the work done  there.  I

do not think I want to repeat the arguments advanced in

1961 when this subject was debated at some length.  But

obviously the Member for Tanglin is in some doubt as to

the  value of this training. There are two ways whereby

I  can  convince  him that this is valuable  work.  The

first is by arguments and I would like to impress  upon

him  that in the last 18 months, the reputation of this

Political Study Centre has spread beyond the shores  of

Singapore  and  that the Governments of Sarawak,  North

Borneo and the Federation of Malaya have called upon



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1099</b></font><br><br>



the  staff of this centre to run courses for their  own

officers  in  their  respective territories.  You  will

recollect, Mr Speaker, Sir, that when we started  this

innovation. Members opposite, particularly those in the

S.P.A., were highly suspicious of it. They thought that

this  was an attempt to indoctrinate the civil  service

with  P.A.P. ideology. Now, I am sure they  will  agree

that  if  that, in fact, had been the purpose and  that

had been what is being done in the centre, it is highly

unlikely that the Governments of Sarawak, North Borneo,

and the Federation would have asked for the services of

the officers of this training centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second way in which I can convince the Member for

Tanglin  that  the duties of this post  are  completely

unrelated   and  dissimilar  to  those   of   Political

Secretary, is perhaps to invite him to attend a course.

I  am  sure  the  Director will agree to  make  special

provision  and extend an invitation to the  Member  for

Tanglin.  I am also equally convinced that it  will  do

the Member for Tanglin a lot of good. I am sure he will

emerge   from  the  Centre  a  much  wiser  man,   more

politically sophisticated and convinced that  the  work

done  there  is impartial, non-party and of  tremendous

value  to sustaining the democratic system against  the

onslaught of its enemies.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, judging by the

fact  that  what  we have foretold  has  proved  to  be

correct,  as  in  the  case of the resignation  of  the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture,  I

do not think that I require any more brain-washing from

their  side.  Sir, what we would like is this:  if  the

Minister  could make available to us the subjects  that

are  being  taught and the lectures given, some  of  us

will  be  only too glad to have a look at them  because

there  have been criticisms made by those who  attended

them,  and  I  do  not want to voice them  here,  which

indicate  that  now and again in between the  lines - now

this   is   where  the  danger  lies - there  have   been

deplorable references to personalities in other Parties

and  in  one  case  my  own name  has  been  mentioned.

[Laughter] I am sorry, I have to say it now.  Well,  of

course, the printed matter will not say anything. But I

do not think it is fair for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1100</b></font><br><br>



a   thing   like   this,  with  mention  of   political

personalities   of   other   Parties - the   Member   for

Cairnhill's name has been mentioned disparagingly,  and

I think we on this side of the House strongly object to

that unfair indoctrination.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, why does the Member

for  Tanglin  still maintain that this  is  ideological

indoctrination? Surely the Government of the Federation

of  Malaya  will be the last government to  expose  its

officers  to indoctrination by our Government.  He  has

made  a request for the supply of materials. I will  be

only  too  delighted to let him have all the  material,

both printed and in tape recordings. [Interruption] No,

no.  A  lot of the material is tape recorded and  I  am

sure   the  Member  for  Tanglin  will  derive  immense

benefits from listening to it. He says that disparaging

remarks were made in the course of instruction  at  the

Political  Study  Centre  about  personalities  on  the

Singapore  political stage. But, Sir, he  did  not  say

whether  these  disparaging remarks were  made  by  the

instructors  and tutors of the Centre, or whether  they

were made by the participants ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> By the instructors.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> He never said so, Mr Speaker,

Sir.  A  lot  of instruction work carried  out  in  the

Centre is not so much by way of lectures from staff  to

the  audience, but by participation in debates  of  the

audience  itself. It is possible that  members  of  the

audience  might  have strong views,  perhaps  not  very

complimentary - but  I  can hardly help  it - of  political

personalities. If, on the other hand, he says that  the

staff  have  been  taking a biased or unfair  political

line  in  personalities, well, if he will let  me  have

details  of these allegations, I will certainly inquire

into  them.  As  I  have said, the Centre  is  to  give

students   who   go  there  a  broad  background,   the

historical development of the revolution in Asia ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> What revolution?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Historical revolution. Nationalist

Revolution ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Just like the P.A.P.?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> --- and to distinguish ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Chiang Kai-shek?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, we not only discuss Chiang

Kai-shek;  we  discuss  Mao Tse-tung:  we  discuss  the

intelligent Communists who march on to victory and  the

unintelligent Communists who march on to disaster.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> For elucidation, Dr Thio?



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Yes. Sir, I have been asked

whether  those  disparaging remarks were  made  by  the

students  or by the instructors. I say here. Sir,  they

were made by the instructors, who were answering or who

were  discussing some points raised with the  students.

But I believe that I am sure the Minister himself would

not want that sort of thing to go on, because if we are

to  be in power, we will not allow unfairness like that

to be done to Opposition Members.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am relieved to receive that

assurance,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir.  As  I  have  said,   I

completely agree with the Member for Tanglin that it is

improper  for  the  civil  service  to  make  political

judgment  before other members of the civil service  on

personalities  on the political stage.  If  the  Member

will give me details, as I have said, I shall certainly

look into the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, I am just seeking

information. Will the Minister for Finance inform  this

House who is the man in this post?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It is none other than the good old

friend of the Member for Havelock, Mr G. G. Thomson.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I remember how in 1961, we said that

it  was  disastrous  to have Mr G.G.  Thomson  as  the

Director  of the Political Study Centre. I do not  want

to repeat what I said. I can only say that it is all in

the  Hansard, and Members of the House can always refer

to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know the questionable character of Mr G. G.

Thomson  and if there is to be any person appointed  to

give political education as such to our civil



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>



service, then I say that G. G. Thomson should

definitely not be the person.



<br><br>7.59 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to touch

on one or two other points relevant to this. First of

all, I would like to say this. There is a background to

the setting up of this Political Study Centre. Soon

after the 1959 elections, when the P.A.P. came into

officer' many Ministers, who did not really understand

how and why they were put into office, exhibited the

pride of being elected by the people, and they went on,

to despise the English-educated, especially the English-educated civil servants who, the P.A.P. knew, largely

voted against them.



<br><br>8.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that one of the main reasons why the

Political Study Centre was set up was to try  and  make

the  civil servants understand the aspirations  of  the

masses, so that, in their day-to-day duties, they would

understand  the problems of our people  in  the  proper

perspective  and  be  able  to  deaf  with  them   more

effectively.  Sir, to the extent that a course  in  the

Political  Study  Centre will not  alienate  our  civil

servants  from  the masses and the aspirations  of  the

masses,  we  welcome the setting up  of  the  Political

Study  Centre. It is because of this that  people  like

Woodhull  and  James  Puthucheary  undertook  to   give

lectures. But in practice, as the P.A.P. has done  with

various  other State institutions, the Political  Study

Centre,  far from fulfilling the purpose for  which  it

was originally set up, became an institution for making

P.A.P. propaganda,  for  trying  to  make  the   civil

servants owe allegiance to the P.A.P. as such. And  the

Member  for  Tanglin is quite correct in  what  he  has

said. In the course of lectures, personalities of other

political  Parties, political opponents of the  P.A.P.,

have  been  degraded,  and there have  been  deliberate

attempts  to  try and orientate the civil  servants  to

think  like  the  P.A.P.  Ministers.  Sir,  the  P.A.P.

Ministers, who, I said, soon after the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>



elections,  did  not  understand the  feelings  of  the

English-educated,  are today no better  off  than  they

were before. It will be remembered how they stood up to

spite  the English-educated. Today they think  that  by

continuing  the Political Study Centre  they  stand  to

gain,  because  they  believe that  they  can  get  the

English-educated - I  am  referring   to   the   English-educated,  because the majority of the  people  in  the

civil service are English-educated - to be the supporters

of  the  P.A.P. for the P.A.P. cause, as  against  what

they  call  the Communist cause. I like  to  tell  them

this. I really have great sympathy for people like  the

Minister for Finance, the Minister for Culture ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I feel sorry for you now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I am grateful, you know. Feel sorry by all

means.  When  they used to flex their  muscles  to  the

English-educated and told them that  they  must  go  on

their  bended  knees and beg and be happy and  grateful

that  they  were  alive, they did  not  understand  the

English-educated. We were much more realistic. We  knew

that  it was a matter of fact that the majority of  the

English-educated, the majority of the  civil  servants,

were  alienated from the mass of the people, and  that,

therefore,  they  were  not  able  to  understand   the

feelings,  the thinking and aspirations of the  masses.

Far   from   trying   to  understand   their   problems

objectively  and  providing a proper  orientation,  the

Political  Study Centre was turned into an  institution

for  instilling  civil servants with  so-called  P.A.P.

ideology,  though  I do not think the  P.A.P. has  any

ideology  anyway. And it is sad, in spite  of  all  the

money  spent  out of public funds, the Political  Study

Centre today is no better than it was before. And  this

is because it is being put to misuse.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> First of all, Sir, I would like to

ask the Member for Thomson whether he has been anywhere

near  the  precincts  of  the Political  Study  Centre.

[Interruption] When?



<br><br><!-- Mr Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Mammen):</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I have never seen him, Sir. I am a

regular goer to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>



Political  Study  Centre, and I  have  never  seen  him

anywhere around there. [Interruption] The only time  he

might have come was when Mr James Puthucheary and  Mr

Woodhull occasionally left their trade union affairs to

come and help us out in the construction of the courses

for  the  Political  Study Centre. In  fact,  Sir,  the

course  itself is more or less what was agreed upon  by

Mr  George Thomson, Mr Woodhull, Mr Devan Nair,  Mr

James Puthucheary, the Minister for Finance, myself and

a few others. The course is still the same; the outline

is  the  same. One of the things about the  Member  for

Thomson  is  that  when  he talks  about  the  English-educated being alienated from the masses, what he means

is  that  the  people  are  being  alienated  from  the

Communists.  And  when he talks of people,  masses,  he

equates them to the Communists, the M.C.P., we begin to

understand  the  drift  of his  conversations  and  his

speeches.  If  he  wants any proof that  the  Political

Study  Centre is a success, the first is the fact  that

there   are  Right-wing  Governments  who  are  equally

suspicious of the Political Study Centre. The  colonial

governments  in  the  Borneo  territories  are  equally

suspicious   of  the  Political  Study  Centre.   Civil

servants  were  initially suspicious of  the  Political

Study  Centre.  What happened was  a  number  of  civil

servants  came anxiously, nervously - they  sent  one  or

two - to  the Political Study Centre. Having gone  there,

they  told us quite openly, "We were quite afraid. When

we  came  here, we thought that there was going  to  be

P.A.P. propaganda, socialist propaganda and  Communist

propaganda." They said that the two weeks'  course  was

so  revealing  that  they  were  going  back  to  their

respective  governments to recommend that  other  civil

servants be sent here. This group of officers came here

at about the time when our friends decided they did not

want merger, when they felt that Singapore should merge

with  Indonesia.  At about that time,  when  there  was

trouble brewing in the Borneo territories, the officers

who  were  sent  said,  "It  is  necessary,  since  our

officers  sooner or later are going to be  troubled  by

the  same  elements that have been troubling Singapore.

It is a good



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>



thing  to send more officers, especially civil servants

in  the  Borneo territories who are more or  less  like

District  Officers a single officer  has  control  over

large  tracts of territory; he is more or  less  a  law

unto  himself - and it is necessary that  these  officers

should  get  a political grasp of what is going  on - not

P.A.P. propaganda, as the Member for Thomson  said - the

essentials of democracy, the enemies of democracy,  how

the  Communists  function, how they subvert,  how  they

operate." Even the Federation Government also sent down

officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this the Political Study Centre is serving

a   useful   function,  and  to  the   civil   servants

themselves. Initially, they were reluctant to come. Not

only   are  the  civil  servants  now  requesting   for

refresher  courses,  but  for the  information  of  the

Member  for  Thomson,  who  runs  the  Business  Houses

Employees' Union, he will be interested to know that  a

number  of business firms have already started  sending

officers  and  staff  to  attend  the  Political  Study

Centre. The heat with which the Member for Thomson  has

been  slanging  away at the Political Study  Centre  is

therefore  understandable, because just as he  has  not

been  able  to  capture a number of  unions  which  are

trying  to get into the civil service and to manipulate

people, I can tell him that very soon he will find it a

little  more  difficult  to  mislead  the  workers   in

commercial firms, especially the English-educated.  But

what  he  is  up  to  and what his friends  are  up  to -

[Interruption]. I can see a great deal of anxiety being

generated, but in course of time all firms ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> What firms?



<br><br><!-- Mr Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Mammen):</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> --- will be included in this course

and  maybe  some private practitioners will  also  find

members of their staff coming to these courses. Anyway,

Sir,  it has proved itself. This Political Study Centre

is   something  independent  of  P.A.P. ideology   or

indoctrination and it has become



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>



a  crucial and an effective weapon against the  enemies

of democracy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> You do not believe all this, do you?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> A lot of revealing things have

come  out.  We never knew that it is a Britisher  still

heading the Centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Recommended by James Puthucheary and

Woodhull.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> These are the people who are

supposed to have been ousted. But the P.A.P. has  found

it  very  convenient to retain them. Why? To  help  the

P.A.P. to subvert? No, they cannot. But they  hope  to

buy  the  civil service over. Now, they are telling  us

that  even  business  firms  are  making  use  of  this

Political Study Centre. I ask what business firms?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You are not going to intimidate them,

are you?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> These are the business firms that

represent  vested  interests, not  the  local  people's

interests. That is why I ask the question and they dare

not  answer.  So  this Political Study Centre  actually

represents only the vested interests. The whole idea of

the P.A.P. is to perpetuate colonialism in this part of

the  world,  as  can so very easily be  seen  in  their

support of the present Malaysia Plan.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, in the Japanese town of Nara,

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member for Queenstown is

incapable   of  seeing  truths.  To  that  extent,   he

represents the first monkey.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Minister is very much out of

order. I will not allow such remarks to be made in this

Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Mammen, Sir, I am not saying ---



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No. I have made my ruling and the

Minister cannot pursue that line.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Now to reply to the very foolish

and  extravagant remarks of the Member for  Queenstown.

He  alleges  that  the whole purpose of  the  Political

Study Centre is to perpetuate colonialism and that  the

whole  basic  policy of the P.A.P. is to  continue  the

perpetuation of colonialism. Sir, for a man of his age,

training  and  profession,  to  come  to  this  utterly

foolish and idiotic conclusion ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of order, Sir,Is he

referring to me as idiotic? I would say he is a foolish

fellow.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is not a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the conclusion he came to is

manifestly idiotic and if that reflects on his personal

character, well, I am not pursuing it.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Minister is reflecting on his

personal character, he should withdraw that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Oh, I am not, I am not at all.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right. Let us proceed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am saying his conclusion is

completely idiotic. In fact, most of his statements are

completely idiotic. [Interruption] All we have got from

the  Member  for  Queenstown is an unending  stream  of

drivel.  Why  he ever sees fit to inflict  this  drivel

upon  this  House and bring democracy into contempt,  I

cannot understand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Thomson alleges that the whole

purpose of the Political Study Centre is to convert the

civil  servants to a pro-P.A.P. attitude - in his  words,

to  get  them to owe allegiance to the Party.  Sir,  if

this  were  the case, can he please explain how  is  it

that  the  governments of other territories,  including

the  Right-wing  Government  in  the  Federation,  have

requested the services of the ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> They are all colonial Governments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Mammen):</b> Order. May I remind the

Member  for Queenstown that we are in the Committee  of

Supply?  If  the Member wants to elucidate or  get  any

information from the Government side, he is at  liberty

to speak. Dr Goh.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> May I explain that for the best

part  of  three  months this year,  the  staff  of  the

Political   Study  Centre  were  sent  to  the   Borneo

territories and the Federation to carry out on-the-spot

courses so that the maximum number of officers in these

two   territories  could  get  the  benefit  from  this

training.  Now,  is  the Member for  Thomson  seriously

suggesting that the Federation Government-which is  led

by  the  Alliance Party, part of which is not  on  very

good  terms with the P.A.P. in Singapore-wants  to  see

its  civil  service  subverted by the  Political  Study

Centre  to  owe allegiance to the P.A.P.? This  is  the

irresistible conclusion and it is so foolish that I  am

surprised  a man of his age could make such a statement

in this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Political

Training  Centre  up to this present  moment  has  been

established  for  a  period of four years.  The  P.A.P.

Government, especially our Minister for Finance,  hopes

that in the course of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1109</b></font><br><br>



four  years'  training, it will be able to  change  the

attitude  of the civil servants towards the P.A.P.  The

Party hopes that the civil servants will understand the

situation of the P.A.P., and particularly the  position

of  the P.A.P. in the general election to come and  the

change  of  policies  of the P.A.P. during  these  two

years.  I  must  give this advice to the  Minister  for

Finance, that no matter how the P.A.P. Government tries

to make use of the so-called political training to make

the  civil  servants change their attitude towards  the

P.A.P., it is impossible for them to achieve this  aim.

It  is merely a waste of time and a waste of effort.  I

will  explain  to  you further on this  point.  I  came

across some civil servants and casually we talked about

these  things.  Generally speaking, the civil  servants

will never, never forget and forgive the P.A.P. for the

unilateral  and  arbitrary  action  in  reducing  their

allowances.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I wish to remind the hon. Member

that  the time allotted for the Ministry of Finance  is

ending at 9.40 p.m. If the Member is going too long  on

the  pay  cut  of  the civil servants,  the  Opposition

Members will be losing their chances to speak on  other

items.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In the meantime, the

civil  servants will never, never forget; neither  will

they  ever  forgive  the  P.A.P.  Ministers  for  their

arrogance  and  for their sneer at them  in  1959.  So,

although the P.A.P. Government, especially our Minister

for  Finance,  who is quite clever and intelligent  and

who  is  quite  good  in  buying  over  talented  civil

servants and get them into his own Ministry, no  matter

how hard they try, the civil servants will never, never

forget  and  forgive the P.A.P. for their pay  cut  and

their arrogance. The other point ---



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. If the Member wants to discuss

this subject in detail, I think the most opportune time

is when we come to amendment (l6)*. We can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>



dispose of this and have a whole debate on the Ministry

of Finance, including the Finance Minister. This is the

Political Study Centre. Mr Low Por Tuck.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* Amendment (16), standing in the names of Mr Low Por Tuck, Mr S. T. Bani, Mr

Ong Eng Guan and Dr Thio Chan Bee, reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 33 be reduced by $100.

<hr size="2" noshade>





<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I have another point

to make before I conclude. The Minister for Finance has

said  just now that the Federation Government  and  the

Governments of the Borneo territories quite  appreciate

the  work done by the Political Training Centre, but  I

doubt  it  very much since the P.A.P. is providing  all

the  staff  for the training of civil servants  in  the

various  other  territories. I am quite  suspicious  of

their  motives. Because on the advent of Malaysia,  the

civil  servants of the other territories will have  got

the  influence  of the P.A.P. No matter how  hard  they

try,  I  will  tell  this  House,  although  the  civil

servants of the other territories have not been given a

dose   of  the  arrogance  of  the  P.A.P.,  they  will

nevertheless have some influence from the  local  civil

servants.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have noticed in

the  last few days that a new strategy is being pursued

by   the  Barisan  Sosialis;  for  example,  they  have

suddenly  come to criticising the pay cut. I  have  had

occasion a few days ago to look at the speeches made by

some  of  the Members opposite and, I think,  including

that of the Member for Havelock on the pay cut. We have

never  regretted at that time having made the  pay  cut

and  still  regretting it. There is justification,  but

today the Barisan Sosialis, with complete cynicism, are

using  this purely as part of their strategy  to  bring

down  everything  with them; upset the civil  servants,

the  bourgeoisie. Yesterday they were in defence of bus

owners employers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Mammen):</b> Order. So far the Minister

has  made his point in reply to the Member for Havelock

on the pay cut and the civil servants.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, the other point is that we are

not  interested  in  running  this  Political  Training

Centre to get civil



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>



servants' votes for the P.A.P. If we want to  do  that,

there  are  other  ways of doing  it.  I  have  already

indicated  that this is a course whereby we have  tried

to  ensure  that the civil service performs  its  basic

function  of  translating  effectively  the  cause   of

democracy to the people. One of the main things of  the

Communists is always to destroy the State structure, to

bring  the  police and its bureaucracy into  disrepute.

Therefore,   this   Political   Training   Centre   was

instituted not to give P.A.P. propaganda but to  ensure

that  the bureaucracy, the civil service, can use their

machinery effectively, as they are entitled to do,  not

as  politicians but as civil servants to safeguard  the

democratic   system   against  the  encroachment,   the

inundation of the anti-democratic forces. That  is  the

main reason why the Federation Government, knowing full

well  that  though it is a Political Study Centre  from

Singapore of the P.A.P. Government, knowing that it  is

neutral  as  far  as party politics are concerned,  has

as  sending  their  officers  to  the  Political  Study

<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> No, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the names of Mr Ong

Chang Sam, Tun Lim Yew Hock and Dr Thio Chan Bee ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 33 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (128)  of subhead 1.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ong Chang Sam and Tun Lim Yew Hock

<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I am not moving.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (8) - Mr Rajah.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 33 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 4.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, subsidy to Housing and Development Board $6,028,000,

and the note against it  reads  "For period 1.1.62-31.12.63."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, that I take it is the exact amount of the subsidy which the Government is giving to the Board in

respect of reduced rates of interest on which loans are

made  to  the  Housing Board. If I am correct  in  that

assumption,  could the Minister please tell  the  House

the  exact amount of money which has been lent  to  the

Housing   Board   on  which  this  subsidy   has   been

calculated?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, in my Budget speech, I said

that  the  details and calculations for this item  have

yet  to  be agreed between my Ministry and the  Housing

Board. This figure in fact represents what the Ministry

of Finance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>



believes  should be a fair quantum of  subsidy  to  the

Housing Board. When final agreement is reached,  it  is

possible  that  there  may be some  variation  to  this

figure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subsidy covers not only the difference between

the  rate of interest of the market terms and  that  of

the   subsidised  terms,  but  also  other  items.  One

important  item is the property tax which in  1962  the

Government levied on vacant properties of the Board. We

felt  that  since  the  Board was performing  a  social

service  to the public - the Board is in fact an  agency

of    the    Government    in   respect    of    public

housing - therefore  it appears to deserve  some  special

treatment by way of tax on vacant properties. There  is

also  an  item  representing the loss incurred  by  the

Board in respect of certain houses that were let out in

previous  years  at  sub-economic  rents,  even   after

allowing  for lower rates of interest then  charged  to

the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park asked for the amount of

loans that this subsidy would cover. I have not got the

full  details with me, but if he will be satisfied with

a  fairly  close  approximation, I will  say  that  the

volume  of  loans that will be covered by this  subsidy

will be somewhere around $115 million plus or minus $10

million - I would say of that order of magnitude.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 33 be reduced by

the whole sum in respect of subhead 40.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have taken an unusual course of asking for the total elimination of that vote, because it seems to me that the contribution under section 23 of the Singapore Improvement Ordinance would not be possible, as that Ordinance has already been repealed and there is no such thing as section 23 existing at

the moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in the first instance, I do not know who is

going  to be the beneficiary of this contribution,  but

if  there is going to be a beneficiary, I would suggest

that  if the Government intends the beneficiary  to  be

the  Housing Board, then I think the trust is in favour

of  the  wrong  beneficiary, because  the  contribution

under section 23 of the Singapore Improvement Ordinance

was  a sum equal to the Improvement Rate which the City

Council  used  to  levy on behalf  of  the  Improvement

Trust,  and to the extent of the money realised on  the

Improvement Rate the Government contributed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there was a statutory provision as to how this

Improvement Rate could be used. It could only  be  used

for   town   improvement,  like  backlanes   and   slum

clearance.  So  that it would appear  that  the  proper

beneficiary - if  the Government intends to  be  generous

about  this  thing - is not the Housing Board  but  the

Planning Authority. But the Planning



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>



Authority,  at  the moment, do not  seem  to  have  any

statutory  functions  in  the way  of  putting  through

backlanes or the clearing of slums. So I would  suggest

that, as the vote is worded, it seems to be ultra vires

and a matter on which the Government cannot act.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Member for Farrer Park, I

think,  would  be  quite correct  if,  in  fact,  these

payments  were  to be made in respect of  the  position

after  the  establishment of the  Housing  Board.  What

actually  happened  was  that  the  Housing  Board  was

established on 1st February, 1960. Before that  it  was

the  Singapore Improvement Trust which was the  housing

authority. Now, it so happened that the Government  did

not   pay   the   Improvement  Trust  in   respect   of

contributions for the second half of 1959. Moneys  were

owed  but  we did not pay to the Trust in 1960  because

there was no Trust. The Trust has ceased to exist.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The next item is in the name of

the  Member for Fairer Park. If he will forego some  of

his   time,  perhaps  the  Minister  can  complete  his

explanation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Yes, certainly, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Goh then.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Accordingly after some time the

Housing  Board  made  a  claim for  this  fund  on  the

grounds,  if  I  recollect correctly,  that  they  were

successors to the improvement Trust and certain  moneys

were  owed  to  the  Trust  in  respect  of  claims  or

liabilities  that existed in the second half  of  1959.

The matter was debated at some time and it was referred

to the Director of Audit as well as the State Advocate-General and it was agreed that a payment should be made

to  the  Housing Board for this amount. After that,  of

course,  there will be no further payment  due  to  the

Housing Board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subhead 31, Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore Allowances.

Mr Speaker, Sir, I should know this but i do not quite

understand  what  "Singapore Allowances"  mean.  It  is

merely  a question of wanting to find some information.

What are "Singapore Allowances"?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, Singapore Allowances are

allowances payable to pensioners. The amount of pension

is, of course, determined by the formula worked out  in

the  Pensions Ordinance and carries no cost  of  living

element  in it. It was decided in 1950 that the  amount

as calculated was unduly low and, accordingly, the cost

of  living allowances paid to pensioners were approved.

Roughly, the rates are: on the first $50 of pension  10

per  cent, second $50 four per cent, and so on  and  so

forth.  These allowances are payable only to pensioners

whose  total  pension and Singapore  Allowance  do  not

exceed  $257  in case of pensioners without  dependants

and $331 in case of pensioners with dependants.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> During the debate on the Budget

speech  I asked the Minister whether he would  be  good

enough  to  look  into the complaint  that  payment  of

pensions  through  post offices has meant  a  delay  in

payment  to  the  pensioners concerned and  whether  he

would  take steps to see that payment of such  pensions

is  made on the same day as that when they were paid at

the Accountant-General's Office.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> This is on Singapore Allowances. Does

that arise on Singapore Allowances?

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> This is also allowance.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does it arise on Singapore Allowances?

I do not know.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It could be related.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I will certainly look into the

matter,  Mr Speaker, Sir,I have not had time  in  the

last  few days to go into it. But I am not sure whether

it  is possible to speed up the payment because when it

is   paid   through  post  offices  there  are  certain

procedures to he followed. But if it is at all possible

to speed it up, I will make every attempt to do so.

Head 36 -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 36 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 7.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a vote for a contribution to the Red

Cross  Home  for  Handicapped  Children.  It  shows   a

reduction  of nearly $8,000 as against the contribution

for  last year. Sir, the Red Cross Home for Handicapped

Children  is  doing  a  very  worthy  service  to   the

handicapped  children of Singapore.  Could  I  ask  the

Minister to reconsider this cut and give



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1118</b></font><br><br>



the same amount of contribution as that for last year?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the rate of contribution

is  half  of  the actual expenditure incurred  for  the

running  of  the Home. In fact, the actual  expenditure

for 1959 was $50,199. In 1960, it was $47,285. So there

was  not  a  very  significant drop. But  in  1961  the

expenditure dropped to $35,000. Now the grants have  to

be   estimated  on  the  actual  expenditure   of   the

institution  in the year preceding that  in  which  the

estimates  are  prepared. That is why in approving  the

grant   for   1960  the  actual  expenditure   of   the

institution  for  1959 must be looked  at.  And  it  is

because of' this reason, Mr Speaker, Sir, that in 1961

and  1962  we gave them the same grant of $25,260.  But

when  there  was  a significant drop in expenditure  in

1961 we gave them half of it, $17,530, which is half of

the actual expenditure of $35,000 in 1961.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> May I withdraw, Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 36 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 8.



<br><br>Subhead 8, Singapore Academy of Medicine, is a new item

which appears under this head. Could the Minister  tell

us  what the Singapore Academy of Medicine is and  what

its objectives are?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, the Academy of Medicine,

Singapore,  was  formed  in  1957.  Membership  is   by

invitation  and  its members are specialists  from  all

branches  of medicine. The membership is now about  80.

Its  objects  are  to  foster  medical  and  scientific

interests  and  to  uphold the  high  professional  and

ethical  standards  in  all  fields  of  medicine.  Its

activities  include scientific meetings,  post-graduate

education  by  arranging  a  series  of  lectures   and

demonstrations,    public    lectures    on     medical

philosophical   topics.  In  fact,   this   association

proposed  holding  a conference sometime  in  April   - I

think  it  was  - in 1962. Note, Mr Speaker,  the  date.

This  association  was sponsored  by  an  international

conference scheduled to take place sometime in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>



1962,  but  in  point of fact, they  did  not  get  the

participation  of  the  invited  countries.   So   this

conference  never,  in fact, took place.  They  thought

that  the expenditure on the conference would be $8,000

and  they  asked the Government to meet  half  of  that

expenditure.  That  was agreed to.  Later,  failing  to

convene this international conference, they had a local

conference.  They  sponsored  a  local  conference   in

Singapore,  and  they asked that this  contribution  be

used  for the purposes of that local meeting. That  was

not  allowed because it would have created a precedent.

If  we  had allowed that money to be used for  a  local

meeting of doctors sponsored by that association, other

organisations would have made similar requests  to  the

Government.  So  that, in fact, that  conference  never

took place and this sum can be deleted.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It will not be used. It cannot be

deleted  now. Perhaps the Minister can say it will  not

be used.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> It will not be used.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 36 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 16.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister did make some reference to the Labour Research Unit in his Budget statement to the House. I was wondering whether the Minister would elaborate on the purpose of instituting the Labour Research Unit, what it is intended to do and whether it will help in private industry and what its objectives are?

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Labour Research Unit is intended

to   assist   trade  unions  in  the  formulation   and

preparation of claims. It is also to assist them, where

necessary, in the preparation of research material  for

them   to   carry  out  their  negotiations,   and   if

negotiations culminate in arbitration, to  prepare  the

cases  for the union in the Arbitration Court. The  sum

entered  here  is largely to pay for the staff  of  the

Labour  Research Unit. Apart from clerical  and  typing

staff,  this  consists mainly of  trade  union  leaders

seconded from private



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1120</b></font><br><br>



employment into the service of this Labour Unit.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I believe this unit is now housed either

in  the  National Museum or somewhere near the National

Museum. Is it the intention of the Minister that,  when

Trade  Union  House has been built and  equipped,  this

Research  Unit  will move into Trade  Union  House  and

become part and parcel of that establishment?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, that will be so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Labour Research Unit

is  nothing but a P.A.P. outfit. Sir, if Members across

the  Floor will have some honesty, then the least  they

can do is to admit it, because there are facts to prove

what I say:

$299,810 of public money spent on a few civil servants,

administrative staff, and more on what the Minister for

Finance calls trade union leaders seconded from private

employment.  Sir,  the Minister can list  these  names.

They  are all officials of P.A.P. trade unions - Mahmud

Awang,  etc. I ask the Minister to publish their  names

and  to  publish the amount of allowances and  salaries

given  to  them. As usual, the P.A.P. always provide  a

cover. They must have a cover. They could not put  here

as  $299,000  to  be spent on P.A.P. Research  Unit  or

P.A.P.  Labour Research Unit. Well, it is public money,

so they have to put a cover. The cover is, they say, to

assist the trade unions in preparing cases, assist them

in  negotiations and to set up research facilities also

to assist the unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to make it very clear that I do not

oppose  such lofty aims of the Government - if they  want

to  genuinely assist the trade unions in setting  up  a

research bureau to assist the trade unions in preparing

cases,  etc., we have no objection. We would say,  "All

right, why $299,000? Perhaps more." But that is not the

aim.  The  aim is to assist one group of trade  unions,

and  all for the purpose of furthering P.A.P. interests

in the trade union field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after the February arrests in which many union

leaders  who were opposed to P.A.P. control  of  unions

were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1121</b></font><br><br>



involved, there was a lack of negotiators for these non-P.A.P. trade  unions. One of the  functions  of  these

people - the  so-called trade union leaders  who  were

seconded  from private employment  - was to go round  and

offer  their services. They went round telling workers,

"Look, you do not have leaders; you do not have anybody

to  negotiate: we will negotiate for you." That was the

first  step.  The second step would have  been  if  the

workers  had accepted it - of course, the workers  saw

through it - make these unions P.A.P. unions - I will  name

him  one  person who did this. I do not know  what  his

designation  is -  United Workers of Petroleum  Industry,

Aziz.  He offered his services and so did many  others.

If the workers had fallen for this, the next step would

have  been  to get them into their unions  or,  as  the

Minister for Culture says, "to capture the union." Sir.

I  am  not objecting to legitimate competition  in  the

trade  union field. I am not saying that we are  afraid

of  P.A.P. cadres who are paid out of public funds  who

may  compete with us. What we strongly object,  and  we

take very serious exception to this, is the use of  the

State funds. We have said it over and over again. It is

necessary  for  us to say it over and  over  again,  we

oppose the use of public funds for P.A.P. purposes.

the  Member  for  Thomson  is  aggrieved.  I  can  well

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The P.A.P. does not own unions and

does  not control unions. These are independent unions.

They  have their own Executive Committees and they have

their own policies. Take a simple example, Mr Speaker.

Sir.  The  A.U.P.E. is supposed to be a  union  of  the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I admit at once that the purpose of' this unit

is  to  strengthen  the democratic,  nationalist  trade

union  movement,  and the Member for Thomson  is  quite

rightly alarmed and resentful over this unit because it

has  succeeded. Sir, may I just read out  the  list  of

defections  of  branches from the  pro-Communist  trade

unions,   such   as   the  Singapore  Business   Houses

Employees'  Union and the Singapore General  Employees'

Union?   First,  from  the  Singapore  Business  Houses

Employees' Union - 16 branches of theirs have  gone  over

to  the  democratic  nationalist unions.  The  American

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>



even  more  intense  annoyance.  That  is  exactly  the

purpose of this Unit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 36 be reduced by

* The same amendment also stood in the name of Tun Lim Yew Hock.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have also given notice of an amendment to subhead 25+,

could I deal with it  at  the same time because the principle involved is the same?



<hr size="2" noshade>

+  The amendment, in the name of Mr A. P. Rajah, reads as follows:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) That the sum to be allocated for Head 36 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 25.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, certainly.









<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, on the face of the Estimates, there

has  been  a  reduction  against  the  Singapore

Anti-Tuberculosis  Association, from $500,000 last  year  to

$400,000 this year. There is also a reduction of  about

$32,000  on the Voluntary Institutions for Children.  I

would  like  an assurance from the Minister that  these

apparent  reductions are not due  to  any  cut  in  the

allowances  but  through some system of computation  of

the allowances.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That the sum to be allocated for Head 36 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 19."



<br><br>The debate may range over subhead 25.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, the vote for subhead  19  has  been

reduced  from  $500,000 in 1962  to  $400,000  in  1963

because  experience over the last four years has  shown

that  the  average expenditure is below the  figure  of

$400,000.  For example, in 1962 the actual  expenditure

was  only $354,375. The average annual expenditure over

the last four years is also in this region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment to S.A.T.A. is on the basis of the number of

destitute cases treated by them. The scale of rates  is

as  follows: for those receiving public assistance  for

T.B. treatment  allowance  from  the  Social  Welfare

Department, a sum of $30 per patient per month is  paid

to S.A.T.A. In addition, for a small number of such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>



cases, who are selected for rehabilitation training  at

S.A.T.A. workshops, S.A.T.A. is paid an additional  $25

per patient per month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly in the case of subhead 25 "grant to

Voluntary  Institutions  for  Children",  the   reduced

figure is based on the actual average expenditure  over

the  last  four years. The actual expenditure in  1962,

for  instance,  was only $229,534.50, and  the  average

over the last four years is in this region. Grants  are

made  to  11 institutions for children on a per  capita

basis. The rates are $1.50 per day for statutory cases

and 50 cents per day for non-statutory cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to emphasise that the reduction does not mean

any  reduction  at the receiving end of the  grant.  In

fact,   if   the   amount  estimated  is  insufficient,

transfers can always be effected from savings in  other

votes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> May I withdraw my amendment, Sir?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (5) in respect of subhead 25

is not being moved. Amendment (6) .



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 36 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 44.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subhead 44 - Amenities Fund for Students in United

Kingdom. This appears for the first time as a  vote  in

our  Estimates. May I ask the Minister what  does  this

amenities fund intend to do for students in the  United

Kingdom?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, there is a little history behind this. In

the  past  when the Federation of Malaya and  Singapore

were  not independent - in the case of the Federation,

it  was not independent then - local students in London

were looked after by the Director of Colonial Scholars.

The  two Governments used to contribute the sum of  the

equivalent  of  �2 l0s, per head - be  they  Government

scholars or private



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>



students  in  the U.K.  - as disbursements for  various

amenities.  But with changing times and the institution

of   the   Office   of  Director  of  Malayan   Student

Department,  it  was then decided that  each  territory

would  look after its own students. Therefore, as  from

1961  the  Malayan  Students  Department  of  the  High

Commissioner's Office for the Federation of  Malaya  in

the  United  Kingdom  would he looking  after  our  own

students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This particular item is in respect of the general

welfare   contributions   from   the   various   former

Commonwealth   territories  to   the   United   Kingdom

Secretary  of Technical Co-operation by  way  of  a  10

shilling  contribution per student from each  territory

which  could  then  go to a centralised  fund  for  all

welfare organisations in the U.K. for students ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Time has expired.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,721,750 for Head 36 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 37 -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 37 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 4.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subhead 4 is a vote for Hotel Allowances. While it is

pleasing to see that there is now a reduction of $5,000

being asked for 1963, it is my view that it would  have

been  more economical to the Government to house  these

officers in Government quarters. I would also like  the

Minister to tell us for how many officers is this  vote

of $25,000 meant?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, this vote is to meet the

needs  of overseas officers on their return from  leave

or  on  their  first arrival in Singapore  to  stay  in

hotels  pending  the  time  when  they  can  move  into

quarters.  Normally  they are not given  permission  to

stay  in  hotels for periods exceeding three days,  but

sometimes it does happen that the type of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1126</b></font><br><br>



quarters which the officer wants or is entitled  to  is

not immediately available,, and therefore permission is

given for them to stay for longer periods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About two years ago, Members will recollect that

there  were  large  numbers  of  vacant  quarters.  The

position  was  such that we had to  rent  out  quite  a

number  of  these  vacant quarters to  members  of  the

public.  But  now  the position is getting  more  tight

partly   because  of  the  expansion  in  our  infantry

Regiment.  Many  of the officers for the  Regiment  are

seconded  from the British military forces,  and  under

the  terms of secondment they are eligible to  stay  in

hotels  for  a period of up to 21 days, and  of  course

they  do  make  inroads  into the  number  of  quarters

available.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> May I withdraw?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 37 be reduced by

<br><br>10.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subhead 6, Mr Speaker, Sir, is Recoverable

Expenditure  under the Overseas Service  Aid  Scheme -

$920,000. Sir, I have put down two notices of amendments

under  Ministry of Finance, subhead 12 and subhead  13,

which I did not move because of lack of time. They seem

to   be  connected  items.  Perhaps  the  Minister,  in

replying to me, could range over the other two items.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister tell us what this Overseas Service

Aid Scheme is intended to do, and how Singapore intends

to benefits by such a scheme?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> This is an agreement we entered

into  with  the  British Government with  retrospective

effect  from  the 1st April. 1961. The U.K.  Government

has  a scheme whereby it makes certain payments to what

are  termed  "entitled  officers",  that  is,  officers

formerly recruited by the Secretary of State in London.

That  is the main category; there are other categories.

In order to encourage the retention of such officers in

overseas   territories  that  are  emerging  to   self-governing status, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>



to  prevent  the rapid exodus of experienced  officers,

the  British  Government has a scheme to  give  certain

benefits  both  in  cash  and in  kind.  The  benefits,

perhaps  I could mention some of them, are: the British

Government would pay an inducement allowance  which  is

equal  to  10 per cent of the officer's basic  pay  and

expatriation pay. He is also entitled to somewhat  more

generous passage terms - the U.K. Government pays half of

that.  There are also certain improvements to  pensions

and gratuities. The additional cost of this is borne by

the  British  Government. In addition, the children  of

these  officers,  if  they  are  educated  in  England,

entitle  the  officer to certain allowances  which  are

fairly generous. Payment for the local items of cash is

made in the first instance by the State Government  and

recovered  from  the British Government.  In  the  1963

Estimates  the  revenue would appear at page  30  under

Class  II  B.1, (12)  (i)  and (12)  (ii) . This  agreement

will have a validity of 10 years from 1st April, 1961.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Could the Minister tell us whether there

are  any  such  officers  in Singapore  at  the  moment

serving under that scheme?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Oh, yes, indeed. They are called

"Designated Officers". They number something like 56. I

think  this would include those in the military forces,

I should imagine.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> May I beg leave to withdraw?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 38 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 38 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to speak tonight on the detection and preventive side of the Customs and Excise Department. To enable the Customs and Excise Department to exercise their functions of detection and prevention, it is important for them to be sufficiently well



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>



equipped  in order to beat the people who use the  most

modem speed-boats and the most high-powered vehicles in

order to smuggle into and otherwise distribute opium or

other  contraband goods in Singapore. It  seems  to  me

that  in  order  to  do  this, the  Customs  should  be

equipped  with really high-powered boats  and,  on  the

land,  high-powered vehicles. I think it  is  important

that  they  should  be equipped with really  first-rate

speed  boats in order to tackle the smugglers who  move

cigarettes and opium into Singapore. From time to  time

we  have  read  cases in the papers  where  the  report

sometimes says that the smugglers were able to beat the

Customs and to make a complete get-away. I take it that

the get-away is only possible if the smugglers' boat is

faster than the Customs boat, if the Customs boats were

faster  and the smugglers got away, then it is a matter

for  discipline.  But I take it that  the  Minister  is

satisfied that the get-away was entirely due to lack of

speed.  I  think it is up to the Government to  provide

them  with  the  speed to enable them to capture  these

individuals.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I agree with the views of the

Member  for  Farrer Park. In the past  there  had  been

competition  between the smugglers and the  Customs  in

respect  of horse-power of outboard motors attached  to

smuggling  craft  on  the  one  hand  and  the  Customs

launches  on  the other. I think the race started  with

something  like  a  25 horse-power engine  and  rapidly

accelerated to 75 horse-power. If the Member for Farrer

Park  will  turn to page 253, subhead 20, he will  find

that  there  is  provision  for  the  purchase  of  two

launches  costing  $150,000 and  eight  75  horse-power

outboard engines.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is 1962.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I have been assured by the

Comptroller of Customs that this would be adequate  for

the  time  being. But, of course, if their  duties  are

increased  with the advent of the common  market,  then

they  would  probably need more staff as well  as  more

equipment. I am very glad to note that at least from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1129</b></font><br><br>



the Opposition side I shall have one staunch supporter

if and when Supplementary Estimates have to be passed

by this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to assure

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That the sum to be allocated for Head 41 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item (46)  of subhead 1.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 41 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (77)  of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Head deals with variable allowance again.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are back to arithmetic!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> This time I hope my arithmetic will

be right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> After dinner, it should be!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1130</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> After dinner, it should be, Sir,

especially as I have had no dinner. The mind  would  be

sharper now!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the variable allowance in this case shows a

reduction  of  $9,180,  whereas,  if  we  look  at  the

emolument  side under the "Registry of Business  Names"

the  reduction in personal emoluments is  just  $5,430.

The  reduction  of  total personal  emolument  is  only

$5,430, whereas the reduction in variable allowance  is

very  much  more. Can the Minister please explain  this

arithmetic?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I think the Member for Cairnhill has

this  time  hit on something. His arithmetic  is  quite

correct.  Obviously  this rather  severe  drop  in  the

amount of variable allowances calls for an explanation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is that a substantial number of the posts

in the Registry of Business Names are at present vacant

and will probably remain vacant for some time until the

Ordinance under which this section operates is amended,

so  that  in fact a lot of the sums voted for  in  this

section  of the Estimates will not be spent.  But  that

does  not really explain the fall, because it  was  not

spent  either in 1962. The reason is that in  1962  the

method of calculation was not correct. It was incorrect

because they estimated variable allowances at the  mean

of the salary scale, whereas if there are new posts the

calculation should be at the minimum or bottom  of  the

salary  scale. That method of calculation was made  in

1963  and that explains the rather severe fall  in  the

amount of variable allowances.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> May I withdraw the amendment, Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 41 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (78)  of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item (78) shows "Increases due to Revision of

Salaries  of Division IV employees and integrated  City

Council State." Would the Minister please say



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1131</b></font><br><br>



what  kind of Division IV employees and integrated City

Council Staff work in the Registry of Business Names?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Actually there is not one member

of  the  staff  of Division IV Integrated City  Council

Staff  working  in  the  Registry  of  Business  Names.

Actually  this item refers to the whole of  The  Inland

Revenue  Department and not merely to the  Registry  of

Business  Names.  I think the Member for  Cairnhill  is

quite  familiar with the reasons for this increase.  It

is  because on integration we had to smooth out various

anomalies,  and  in smoothing out these  anomalies,  of

course,  it  always works out to the advantage  of  the

employees.  I  think that is all  I  need  say  on  the

subject.



<br><br>10.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The reason why I have brought this

up  is  just  to show that, despite the fact  that  the

Government  has taken more than one year to hatch  this Budget,

there  is  a lot of careless  budgeting  being

done.  About the previous one, the Minister said  there

was an over-provision and now he tells us that this  is

something which should not have been there. Why  should

it have been there if it should not have been there?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not think the Minister said that.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I never said there was a mistake.

This  is  an  item  that refers to  the  whole  of  the

department  and  not  merely to that  section.  If  the

Member will refer to the other Heads, he will find that

the  last item on personal emoluments almost invariably

shows increases due to the revision of salaries. And it

so  happens  that  he thought that  it  refers  to  the

Registry of Business Names whereas in fact it refers to

the whole department.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I beg leave to withdraw, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 41 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (1)  of subhead 15.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item (1) of subhead 15 is "Contribution to Central

Provident  Fund".  This shows  an  increase  of  a  few

hundred  dollars. What I want to know is what  kind  of

provident  fund contribution is there for employees  in

the  Registry  of Business Names who  are  all  on  the

pensionable establishment?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> There are, in fact, 20 clerical

officers,  8  typists and one office boy who  would  be

required to contribute to the C.P.F. if we enlarge  the

Business  Names  Registry when  the  new  Ordinance  is

passed.  So  this is really a provision  for  expansion

and,  if  expansion  is not proceeded  with,  then,  of

course, this vote will be frozen.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> This is another example of not

preparing  the Budget. It provides for contribution  to

prepared wrongly and hastily in spite of the long delay

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the names of Mr Low

Por Tuck, Mrs Seow Peek Leng, and Dr Thio Chan Bee ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) That the total sum to be allocated for Head 41 be

reduced by $100.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 41 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the Government has a plan to

encourage  the  middle and lower income groups  to  own

houses, and they give special rates - I believe it is  23

per  cent,  if  I  am not mistaken - to people  occupying

their own houses in rural areas. If, on principle, they

want to encourage people in the middle and lower income

groups  to own houses, there are people in these income

groups  who own houses in the city area and not in  the

rural areas. It does not mean that just because they do

not  have  much money they have to live  in  the  rural

areas: many of them do buy houses in the city area  but

they  do  not  enjoy  that benefit.  For  the  sake  of

encouraging  people to save in order to buy  their  own

houses, especially those in the middle and lower income

groups, I am just wondering whether that concession  of

rates of assessment could be extended to people who own

houses in the city area as well.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I am not speaking.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I do not follow the hon.

Member. What concession was she referring to?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Property Tax, and not assessment. I

think it is called Property Tax now.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Property tax, yes. People who

live  in their own houses and do not rent them out  are

allowed on application to pay 23 per cent instead of 36

or  34  per  cent. But this only applies in  the  rural

areas.  If  it so happens that such houses are  in  the

city  area  and on the boundary line just opposite  the

rural area, such house owners do not get the benefit.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> My impression is that this benefit

for  owner-occupied houses in the rural areas  was  the

result  of  our  increasing the  rates.  There  was  an

exercise   in  1961 - rates  in  the  rural  areas   were

increased  but we thought that we should  exempt  owner

occupiers  from this increase. Now, rates in  the  city

area  were not increased, and I do not think  there  is

any  reason to extend the concession to owner occupiers

in the city area.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

for  Finance has a very good memory. Yes, that  is  the

case.  It was because of the rise in the rates  in  the

rural  areas. But my argument is this: the  motive  for

giving  owner-occupied  houses  special  rates  is   to

encourage  wage earners to own houses.  So  if  special

rates are given to owner-occupied houses on one side of

the  boundary line between city and rural, why does his

brother or colleague who lives on the other side of the

boundary line not enjoy the same benefits?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> That really is the luck of the

draw. The chap who is on the rural side of the boundary

line  should  thank his lucky stars that he  gets  away

with   it.  Anyway,  I  think  we  have  already  given

substantial  concessions to owner occupiers  everywhere

by  way  of  exemption from income tax. Of course,  the

real thing to do is to make capital loans available  on

easier terms to people who want to buy houses. Everyone

seems to think that the present terms are all right: no

lack  of demand for loans on present terms. So I  think

for the present we had best leave them alone. I do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1135</b></font><br><br>



know whether the Member will be satisfied with that.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I get very

funny reasons given today, such as if you have no  beds

people cannot stay in hospital for as long as they need

to  stay.  The  Minister for Finance says  that  it  is

matter  of luck whether a person gets it or not.  I  do

not think a government should be run like that - a matter

of  luck.  If  the Minister says that the  idea  is  to

encourage people to go into the rural areas and develop

them, so that these people could go there for the  sake

of  this concession, then I am quite prepared to accept

such  a reason. I expected an explanation like that.  I

did not expect the Minister for Finance to say that  it

is  just a matter of luck on which side of the boundary

line you happen to fall into.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> True.

*  The same amendment also stood in the name of Tun Lim Yew Hock.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My ex-friend, the Minister for Home Affairs-cum-the

Minister      for     Labour-cum-P.A.P.      Organising

Secretary - Sir,  it  is  strange  and  to  some   extent

intimidating  to  have a Minister for Home  Affairs  as

also  the Minister for Labour. I am sure we all vividly

recall  how  the  Tunku,  the  Prime  Minister  of  the

Federation  of Malaya, once said that his Minister  for

Interior  knows  how  to solve industrial  problems  in

Singapore, and the Tunku added that he himself does not

know  how.  Long before merger and Malaysia we  already

know  how,  because they already have got quite  a  few

prominent trade union and working class leaders  locked

up.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is all the more sinister when we notice that in

Singapore  we  have a position where the  Minister  for

Home  Affairs  is also the Minister for Labour.  I  can

only  conclude  that  this  shows  the  importance  the

Government attaches to Labour. I hear that one  of  the

reasons why the present Minister for Health and Law was

transferred  was  that they thought  he  was  unfit  to

handle  labour problems, and so they needed a  man  who

had  the support of the police force and who could move

the police force and also a man who was very trusted by

the P.A.P. hierarchy. However, Sir, my main concern now

is not the police and the Intelligence sources that the

Minister possesses and which are, in fact, used against

trade  unions  that he does not like,  but  the  labour

policy of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everyone knows that the P.A.P. was elected on a

labour ticket.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Which has been carried out.



<br><br>10.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I wish it were true. Sir,If it had been

carried  out,  there would not have  been  the  Barisan

Sosialis  sitting on this side of the House.  We  would

have  been  there  and the P.A.P. would  have  been  as

strong as, if not stronger than, it was in 1959. It  is

because they have not carried out their policy,  it  is

because  they have deviated from the policies on  which

they  were  elected  that today  they  are  in  such  a

degenerated        state - thoroughly        discredited,

disintegrating all the time. The latest  is  the  drama

put   up   by   the   Minister  for  Culture's   former

Parliamentary Secretary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> What has happened to him?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I think what will happen to him is more

important, Sir. Probably he will cross the Floor of his

own  free will, or he will be made to cross the  Floor.

However,  that is for the P.A.P. to answer. It  is  not

for  us to speculate. We can only indulge perhaps in  a

little wishful thinking.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as I was saying, we are concerned about the

Government's  labour  policy: a  Government  which  was

elected  by  the workers on a labour ticket  and  which

today.  Sir, does not have a consistent labour  policy.

Sir,  I just wish to make one or two references to this

claim that they have fulfilled their labour policy, and

merely  to  touch on one or two other points which  are

fundamental.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To start with, the Industrial Relations Ordinance. In

their election manifesto they said that the setting  up

of a court would give the trade unions the right to opt

in.  That was not kept. It will be remembered that even

in the days when we were in the P.A.P., I supported the

Bill  from  across the Floor and I did point this  out.

The whole basis of P.A.P. labour policy was unification

of  the  trade  union movement. That is all  forgotten.

There is no unification. The P.A.P. has only helped  to

further  divide the trade union movement. In 1961,  the

moment  there was a political split in the P.A.P.,  the

Singapore Trades Union Congress was dissolved,  thereby

reverting back to the position as prevailed in  in  the

early  days - a  division  in the  labour  movement.  The

reason why they dissolved the T.U.C. is very clear.  As

has been explained a number of times, they had four and

we  had  six  and so they could not control the  T.U.C.

There  is  the second fundamental point: the  basis  on

which   the  P.A.P.'s  labour  policy  was  formulated.

`Unification of the trade union movement - not done. Sir,

they  claim today that they have fulfilled their labour

policy. There are many other instances and examples and

perhaps it is not possible for me to quote them here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the Labour Ministry is pursuing a policy

whereby they act on the whims and fancies of the P.A.P.

Minister.  I  wish  to  say  something  on  the  Labour

Conciliation Officers, but I will say that when we come

to  Head  46. However, I would just like to  make  this

remark  as  a  prelude to that, so that I will  not  be

misunderstood. We concede that the majority  of  Labour

Conciliation Officers who are civil servants are  doing

a good job. The vast majority of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>



them,  almost all of them, except a few, are  genuinely

trying to seek solutions to industrial disputes. Sir, I

hope  when  the Minister replies he does  not  say,  as

other  P.A.P.  Ministers  have  always  said,  that  we

condemn the civil servants, we cast aspersions and what-not.  We  are  aware  that the reason  why  the  Labour

Ministry  is  not functioning as it should function  is

that  the Labour Minister is playing politics with  the

trade unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard the accusation that the S.A.T.U. group

of  unions do not want to use the Labour Ministry. This

is not true. I believe we are able to recall the recent

exchanges   between  the  Singapore   Business   Houses

Employees'  Union  and the Ministry of  Labour  on  the

Fraser  strike. The Fraser Company wanted to break  the

strike  and employ black-legs. The Ministry  of  Labour

said  yes.  If it were a P.A.P. union, it  would  be  a

different matter. It is not a P.A.P. union. They  said,

"Yes, we will give you police protection. You break the

strike."  Then when the union disclosed this  publicly,

the  Minister  turned  around and said,  "The  Business

Houses   Employees'  Union  did  not  use  the   Labour

Conciliation  machinery." Sir, this was  proved  to  be

untrue.   The   records  maintained   by   the   Labour

Conciliation  Officer who handled the  case  will  show

that the Ministry was 1consuited and talks were held in

the Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various other examples to show that it is

not  these  unions  which are  staying  away  from  the

Ministry  of Labour, but it is the Ministry  which,  as

directed  by The Minister, seeks to play politics  with

the  trade unions and disputes of the workers. So  long

as  this happens, Mr Speaker, the Ministry, the  whole

conciliation  machinery,  arbitration  processes,  will

stand  thoroughly  discredited  in  the  eyes  of   the

workers.  Nobody  is going to have  confidence  that  a

trade dispute can be solved peacefully. So long as  the

Government  seeks  to  use the Ministry  for  political

purposes,  for making political capital  out  of  trade

disputes,  confidence cannot develop in the ability  of

the Ministry of Labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have said earlier that the Government's labour

policy  is  inconsistent and based  on  the  whims  and

fancies of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>



the  Minister. I would like to quote just  one  further

example to prove this. There is the question of  secret

ballot. I quote this example because it is not possible

for  the  Minister to say that this is  Communist  talk

because  the ex-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister

for  Culture  has put forward the same argument.  Under

section   18,  subsection  (3) ,  I  believe,   of   the

Industrial  Relations Ordinance,  a  secret  ballot  is

ordered if the employer on whom a claim has been  made,

refuses  to  negotiate with the trade union  which  has

made  the claim because he is of the opinion that  that

union  does  not represent a majority. It then  follows

with  a  secret  ballot which can  be  ordered  by  the

Commissioner  for  Labour. Sir, there  are  two  points

here.  One, as to when a secret ballot should be  held,

and  secondly,  - I will deal with the first point first,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The records of the disputes relating to this handled

by  the  Ministry of Labour show that  the  P.A.P. has

completely disregarded this particular section  of  the

Ordinance. There have been instances where unions  have

asked for a secret ballot and the Minister has refused.

On  the other hand, there have been instances where the

Minister  has imposed secret ballots. I would  like  to

quote one example - C. K. Tang. The workers of C. K. Tang

were  members  of  the  Manual and  Mercantile  Workers

Union,  a  P.A.P. union. On the 5th of December.  1961,

the  workers  left  the Manual and  Mercantile  Workers

Union.  A  majority of them - 85 to be  precise,  out  of

120 - joined  the  Singapore Business  Houses  Employees'

Union.  On  the 5th of December, 1961, and ever  since,

the  Business  Houses  Employees' Union  requested  the

Ministry  to  hold  a secret ballot  to  determine  the

representation, because the employer refused to concede

that  we  had  a majority. He was doubtful  as  to  our

majority  and  he asked the Ministry  also  to  hold  a

secret ballot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we know, the secret ballot was only held a

few  weeks  back. This was held a few  weeks  back  not

because  they  liked it, but because we  threatened  to

take civil action ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> That is not true.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Whether it is true or not, I believe the

Parliamentary Secretary will be in a position to say if

he consults his Commissioner for Labour.



<br><br>11.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other aspect of this question. Just now the

Minister  for Finance quoted the names of companies  of

workers  who have gone over to their side, and  two  of

the  names  he quoted were Tiger Breweries  and  Anchor

Breweries.  Sir, here, the Singapore General Employees'

Union  had  served claims on the management. The  rival

union,  the  Singapore  Manual and  Mercantile  Workers

Union,  sought recognition. Acting under the provisions

of  the  Industrial Relations Ordinance,  the  employer

said  he  was  not  sure whether the Singapore  General

Employees Union represented the majority, and they went

to  the  Labour Ministry. We asked for a secret ballot.

At  first,  they refused to hold a secret ballot.  Sir,

that  relevant section, as it is now, allows a  certain

amount of discretion to the Commissioner. But while the

law  allows this discretion to the Commissioner, it  is

not  for  the Commissioner to abuse the law. On reading

the  provision, it is clear that if the employer  says.

"I  do  not want to negotiate with you because I am  of

the opinion that you do not represent the majority," or

if  "I  am  doubtful that you represent the  majority,"

then  it is for the Commissioner to consult and hold  a

secret  ballot. No, they did not want to hold a  secret

ballot.  They marked time. They allowed the Manual  and

Mercantile Workers Union to make excessive claims, just

on paper, promising quarters for the workers, one house

for  each worker, $100 increases, just to try  and  get

the  support of the workers. And finally, Sir, when the

secret   ballot   was  held,  they   included   certain

categories  of  workers  who  should  not   have   been

included,  in the same way as they sought to include  a

certain  category of nurses in the secret  ballot  that

they  wanted to impose on the nurses to determine union

representation. In this case, Sir, it was a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P. member, the Parliamentary Secretary, who opposed

the  decision of the Government to hold such  a  secret

ballot to include categories on whose behalf the claims

were  not made. Of course, in the case of the A.U.P.E.,

they  dare  not press the point for fear  that  he  may

cross  the  Floor  quicker. But in the  case  of  Tiger

Breweries,  no, they pressed on, and held a ballot.  It

is true we lost. But anyway, that is one other example.

I  do not want to go on quoting more and more examples.

I  can only say that there are many and perhaps in  the

course of the debate, there will be some more quoted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One favourite thing that is said by the P.A.P.

Ministers,  which  was repeated earlier  today  by  the

Minister for Health, is that we call a strike, get into

trouble, then we go to the Labour Ministry. This is not

true.  And  to prove this is not true, I just  want  to

elaborate  on what I have said earlier on  today.  Sir,

there has been a very recent case. This will be a  good

test  of the Government's sincerely in wanting to  help

the  workers. The Prime Minister that day  defended  Ho

See  Beng in getting a gold medal -  some award, I do not

know  what:  whether  it is gold,  silver  or  bronze - a

public service award or whatever it was. Ho See Beng is

involved.  Ho  See  Beng's name was  read  out  by  the

Minister  for Finance just now. All the names  that  he

read  out merely confirmed what I said, that the Labour

Research Unit is a P.A.P. outfit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, 43 workers of the Straits Times were sacked by

the   management  for  having  gone  to  have   cholera

inoculations. They were called casual workers, but they

have  been working in the Straits Times for years. They

are  not members of the P.A.P. union. The P.A.P. union

there  is  led by Ho See Beng, the man who is now  paid

out  of  Government  funds as a seconded  officer  from

private  employment.  They were  not  members  of  this

union.  When  they  asked  the  management  to  provide

inoculation  facilities, the management  refused.  They

told  the  management they were going to  a  Government

clinic  to get inoculations. They went in the  morning.

When they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>



returned, an official of this union, the right-hand man

of  Mr  Ho See Beng, told them they were sacked.  Sir,

they   are  still  out.  This  afternoon  they  did   a

demonstration, and the union which now represents these

workers  is  called the Singapore Bookshop  Publication

and  Printing Press Workers Union. The dispute is being

referred to the Labour Ministry. [Interruption]  No,  we

tell the Minister. There is no strike, nothing. If  the

workers were sacked, they were sacked for answering the

Government's  call to get inoculated. Let  us  see  how

sincere  they are if they want to settle this.  Let  us

see  if  they want to help this union. This is  a  non-P.A.P. union;

it rejects the P.A.P.'s control. Let  us

see if they want to help. If they cannot settle it, let

them  at  least  refer this dispute to arbitration.  We

will  fight  it  out. That will prove a further  point,

that we are not anti-Arbitration Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I just want to conclude by saying that we

realise  that the P.A.P. has a vested interest  in  the

trade  union movement. They are not as naive as Members

of  the S.P.A. They know, Sir, though they have to play

the   Right-wing  game  to  please  maybe  the  British

masters,  the Tunku basically, they have to  count  on

the support of the workers to come back here. They know

that.  They know that by numbers the workers are  more.

There  are over 600,000 electors, the majority of  whom

are  workers  and their dependants. They  have  to  get

their  support.  They know they have vested  interests,

and  they know that if they are to survive politically,

they must try to get the workers' support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> They are all coming to us all the

time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Well, that is fine, if all the workers want

to go over to their side, if the workers want to choose

to  do so of their own free will, we say jolly good. It

does  not  matter to us, because we are not  as  short-sighted as the Minister for Finance. We believe in  the

struggle  of  the  workers.  Whether  the  workers  are

members  of the Manual and Mercantile Workers Union  or

the  Singapore General Employees' Union does  not  make

very much difference, because the struggle against  the

employers goes on.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>



If  the  Minister is a good socialist, as he claims  to

be,  he  must accept this to be correct. Therefore,  we

are  not  bothered. We are not like the P.A.P. running

around  trying to grab the workers. We do not do  these

things. On the other hand, we do not sit back and  say,

"All right, you come and poach on our members." No,  we

fight.  But  if we think we do not have a majority,  we

concede  defeat.  We will say, "Jolly good,  go  over."

T.V.  Gomez - one of their star performers in  the  trade

union field  - was not given a Public Service Star,  Sir.

I  do  not know for what reason. Perhaps it was because

his  questionable character is very well known to  many

workers and employers. Anyway, Mr Speaker, T.V.  Gomez

went  to  the  Arbitration Court and in  front  of  the

Arbitration Court, in front of the Deputy President, he

said,  "I have a majority. I have 119 members." He  was

caught  out  lying in the case of Plywood.  The  Deputy

President was sympathetic: he knew the problem; he  did

not  want  to embarrass him more and he held  a  secret

ballot.  On the other hand, if the Court had agreed  to

our suggestion and put Mr Gomez in the witness box, he

would have been proved a liar and a perjurer. They  had

the  cheek  to go to court. We do not do this  sort  of

thing.  To  drive home this point, we  say,  today  the

nurses  who go on strike, the bank workers  who  go  on

strike, and the insurance workers who go on strike  are

not  members  of what they call Communist unions.  This

is,  from  our  point  of view, an  indication  of  the

increase  of  class consciousness. We say, jolly  good,

whether  they  are under P.A.P. unions, S.P.A. unions. [Interruption]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not short-sighted as they are. Therefore, we

are not worried if the Minister says that thousands and

thousands of workers have gone over. The first proof is

`that  since  May Day last year, they have been  saying

thousands  have gone over. They have a very unique  way

of  making propaganda. First, they say that 50  workers

from  one  company went over. Then two weeks later,  20

workers went over, and so on - individual items. Then  at

the  end of two months, they put all the total together

and say that so many hundreds have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1144</b></font><br><br>



gone  over.  And they start all over again.  After  six

months,  they put the grand total together and  say  so

many  thousands have gone over. We are not denying that

workers have gone over. Yes, some of our branches. This

is an open secret. We do not deny it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Tiger Breweries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> They say Tiger Breweries. Yes, you took

over. These are facts. But from May Day last year, they

have  been  saying  that  thousands  and  thousands  of

workers  have  gone  over.  This  year  their  May  Day

celebration was such that they did not have even 50 per

cent of what they had last year.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Rubbish!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> It is not rubbish. You can ask anybody who

was  there. Everybody knows. We had a lesser crowd  too

compared to last year. It is true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Half.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> If you say half, then it was 40,000.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have not said a word. The

Member  should  remember  that  he  is  addressing  the

Speaker. May I also remind him that the debate on  this

Ministry will give over at 11.50 p.m.?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I am just ending, Mr Speaker, Sir. Half

means 40,000. Foreign correspondents and local Pressmen

were  there as witnesses. But the Ministry of Culture's

official  estimation of the Jalan Besar rally at  which

the  Prime  Minister was given a star by the Secretary-General  of  the  N.T.U.C., Mr  Devan  Nair - the  Prime

Minister  who  reciprocated by giving on  National  Day

another  star to Mr Devan Nair - was first, 3,000;  then

they increased it to 7,000. But let us be generous  and

say 7,000. Last year, the Ministry of Culture estimated

their  last  year's  crowd to  be  15,000.  Surely  the

Ministry  of  Culture  is  not  going  to  put  forward

Communist propaganda, and they could not have  computed

this  figure  because  they are  pro-Communists.  Well,

there it is, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to stress this point: so long as the Ministry

of Labour does not conduct



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1145</b></font><br><br>



itself as a Ministry of Labour should and  it  is

not genuinely and sincerely non-political in wanting to

solve  problems  arising  from  industrial  grievances,

there  can be no industrial peace; it can only help  to

increase industrial strife.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I withdraw.



<br><br>11.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am sure the

Member for Thomson cannot be serious when he says  that

he   has  been  intimidated  by  me  or  that  I   have

intimidated him, for the simple reason that I happen to

be also the Minister for Home Affairs. In any case, Mr

Chairman, Sir, I will only hold this office for another

2�  months,  and I only hope that when I relinquish  my

powers  as  Minister for Home Affairs, he will  have  a

kinder man to contend with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson has accused the Government of having deviated from its pro-labour policy. Far from the Government having deviated from its pro-labour policy, I think the Member for Thomson has deviated from his political stand. He was elected on the P.A.P. Five-Year Plan, but since 1961 he has

gone  over to the other side, and if at all any  person

has  deviated from his stand I think it is  the  Member

for Thomson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the best way to answer the criticism of the

Member   for   Thomson  is  to  narrate  the   concrete

achievements  of the Government during  the  past  four

years. Sir, the P.AP. Government's policy on labour and

trade  unions  was clearly laid down in  the  Five-Year

Plan  entitled The Tasks Ahead. In all our approach  to

labour  problems our guiding principle has always  been

industrial  peace with justice. During  the  last  four

years,  because of our enlightened policy and our  open

stand  on  the  side  of the workers,  the  workers  of

Singapore have benefited considerably



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1146</b></font><br><br>



in the form of monetary wages and fringe benefits. Many

of  the  laws which worked to the disadvantage  of  the

workers  were  removed  and new  laws  to  protect  the

interests  of the workers were introduced, so  much  so

that today our labour legislation has been acclaimed to

be  the  most progressive in South-East Asia by  labour

experts and trade unionists who visited Singapore. When

the present Government assumed office in June 1959,  we

took  strong  action to stop evasion of  the  statutory

provisions   by   employers,  with  the   result   that

widespread  evasion of statutory obligations,  such  as

payment  of overtime wages, holidays with pay and  rest

day  pay, etc., was eliminated. The Government, through

the Labour Department, has up to date recovered through

its Labour Inspectorate alone the sum of almost half  a

million  dollars and paid it to the workers  concerned.

Encouraged   by   the  pro-labour   attitude   of   the

Government,  many of the workmen took their  claims  to

the Labour Courts set up by the Government to deal with

these  problems  and, as a result, from  June  1959  to

date,  the Labour Courts have recovered a total sum  of

almost  half  a  million dollars and  paid  it  to  the

workers.  In the same period, through the good  offices

of  the  Labour  Courts,  a sum  of  $50,000  was  also

recovered on behalf of domestic servants. What is  more

important, Mr Speaker, Sir, apart from these  monetary

gains,  is  the fact that the employers  have  come  to

realise their statutory obligations and are willing  to

meet  them, and the workmen are aware of the  statutory

benefits they are entitled to and are no longer  afraid

to bring their grievances to the Labour Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the means of achieving industrial peace with

justice  is  the enactment of the Industrial  Relations

Ordinance   and   the  setting-up  of  the   Industrial

Arbitration Courts. The achievement and the  confidence

with  which  the  workmen and  employers  have  in  the

Industrial  Arbitration Courts is  well  known  to  the

people and need no further elaboration. Suffice  it  to

say  that the Industrial Arbitration Court has now come

to  be generally accepted by both employers and workers

as an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>



invaluable machinery in resolving industrial  disputes.

Last  year  the  two  Courts arbitrated  31  cases  and

certified 264 agreements, compared with 9 cases and 121

agreements for the 1960/1961 period. This goes to prove

that  the workers and their employers have come to have

confidence in the industrial machinery of the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some mention was made by the Member for Thomson

regarding  the Conciliation Service. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

the  Conciliation Service of the Labour Department  has

done extremely well in settling labour disputes in  the

interest of both the employers and the workers. For the

period  from  1960  to  1962, the Conciliation  Service

settled a total of about 3,000 disputes and disposed of

600  disputes in other ways. This Conciliation  Service

is  available  to  both the employers and  the  workers

without  any distinction. For that matter,  the  Labour

Department  has served all trade unions, employers  and

individual  workmen without distinction. In  1962,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  out of a total of 1,064 disputes  dealt

with  by the Labour Ministry, 603 disputes were brought

by  unions,  12  by  employers and  449  by  individual

workers,  and out of the 603 disputes brought by  trade

unions  in  1962. 382 were brought by unions affiliated

to  or  associated with the group of trade unions which

the  Member  for  Thomson belongs to;  while  221  were

brought  by  other  unions. Now,  if  the  Conciliation

Service  had not been fair and partial. I am  sure  the

S.A.T.U. group of unions would not have brought  their

cases  to the Labour Ministry. Mr Speaker, Sir,  there

were   only   two  occasions  on  which  requests   for

assistance  from  the  Labour  Department  had  to   be

refused.  The  first was a request from  the  Singapore

General Employees' Union in November 1962 to pursue its

demand  for  the  dismissal of a  workman  employed  by

Tithes  Dental and Photo Supply Limited. In that  case,

it  was explained that the Labour Department could  not

be a party to any negotiation, the sole object of which

was  to  obtain the dismissal of a worker. Briefly,  in

November 1962 two workers employed by the Company had a

fight in the Company's premises during their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>



working  hours.  One  of the workers  concerned  was  a

member  of  the Singapore General Employees' Union  and

the  other  was  not a member of any union.  After  the

fight  the Company warned both the workers, in writing,

that if they fought again they would be dismissed.  The

action taken by the Company was reasonable, but it  did

not satisfy the Union. The Union demanded the dismissal

of  the  worker  who was a non-union member.  When  the

Company rejected the Union's demand, the Union called a

strike of its 32 members employed in the establishment.

Up to the time of the strike, the Union had not availed

itself  of  the  conciliation machinery in  the  Labour

Department.  It was only on 19th November,  1962,  that

is,  two weeks after the strike had occurred, that  the

Union  first  asked  for  assistance  from  the  Labour

Department.  By then the Company's board  of  directors

had  already  passed a resolution  to  close  down  the

company.  However, on the persuasion of  the  Ministry,

the   company  eventually  did  not  proceed  with  its

intention to close down. The strike eventually came  to

an end on 4th of December, 1962, when the Union dropped

the  demand for the dismissal of a non-union member and

agreed  to  a return of work by the strikers.  Now,  in

this particular case, the Union concerned had sought to

use Government machinery, the State machinery which the

Member for Thomson has accused of being partial, to put

pressure  on  the employer to get one of the  non-union

members  of  the  company out of employment.  Now,  the

strike  which lasted from 5th November to 4th December,

1962,  achieved nothing, but did a lot of harm. Besides

depriving 32 union members and 18 non-union members  of

earning  their livelihood for about a month, it  nearly

led  to the closing down of the establishment. And what

is  the term of agreement eventually? Each union member

has to send a letter of apology to the management. They

receive no strike pay and no bonus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other case that was mentioned just now was the

case in connection with secret ballots conducted in  C.

K.  Tang Ltd. Mr Speaker, Sir, in this particular case

there was already at that time in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1149</b></font><br><br>



force  a certified collective agreement between  C.  K.

Tang  Ltd, and  the  Singapore Manual  and  Mercantile

Workers' Union. The Commissioner for Labour did  advise

at  that  time that a secret ballot could not  be  held

because  there was this certified collective  agreement

in  force  and, according to the legal advice  at  that

time,  so long as a certified collective agreement  was

in force, no secret ballot could be conducted. However,

in  April this year, the matter was reviewed again  and

legal advice was given that the Commissioner for Labour

could,   even  during  the  currency  of  a   certified

collective  agreement, call for a secret ballot  to  be

held,  and  immediately upon the receipt of  the  legal

advice a secret ballot was conducted.



<br><br>11.30 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson has criticised just now that the Labour Research Unit is a P.A.P. outfit. The setting up of a Labour Research Unit was one of the election pledges that we made during the election, and it was upon this pledge that the Member for Thomson was elected. Perhaps he has now forgotten.

Mr  Deputy  Speaker, trade unionists  have  complained

that while employers have excellent research facilities

and  qualified personnel at their disposal to help them

with the presentation of their cases in the Arbitration

Court, trade unions have been at a disadvantage.  Trade

unionists    with   the   necessary   experience    and

qualifications to help trade unions are few in  number,

and  trade unions possess no great research facilities.

On the representations of the trade unions made through

the  National  Trades  Union Congress,  the  Government

decided to set up this Labour Research Unit staffed  by

qualified economists, accountants and legal men.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the Unit is primarily concerned with advising any union seeking its assistance on matters concerning the

formulation  of  claims   for collective agreements, adjustments

affecting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1150</b></font><br><br>



existing or expiring collective agreements, and the

preparation  of  cases  for  presentation  before   the

Industrial  Arbitration Court. Since its  inception  in

January  1963,  the  Unit has  been  inundated  with  a

variety  of  requests touching on labour  problems.  To

date  it  has  been consulted by various unions  in  89

major cases, the benefits of which will accrue for some

10,000 workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, this Labour Research Unit is independent of official control and exists primarily to serve trade unions. All trade unions in Singapore, irrespective of their political or other affiliations, are eligible to call on the services of the Unit. Some of the unions affiliated to S.A.T.U. and others belonging to neither S.A.T.U. nor the N.T.U.C. group

that  have  made  use  of the services  of  the  Labour

Research   Unit  are  the  Singapore  General  Printing

Workers'  Union in connection with their  dispute  with

Qalam  Press and the Malayan Airways and Qantas  Empire

Airways  Local Employees' Union versus Air India  case.

Now,  these  two unions belong neither to the  N.T.U.C.

nor S.A.T.U. Then there is the Industrial Workers Union

of  Singapore (N.A.A.F.I. Branch) which belongs to  the

S.A.T.U. group and the Member for Thomson is an adviser

of  this union. This union too consulted and sought the

advice  of the Labour Research Unit. Then the Mansfield

Local  Employees' Union, whose adviser is Mr S.  Wood-hull,  too  consulted  the  Labour  Research  Unit  for

advice. Finally, the Singapore National Seamen's Union,

another  union  belonging to the S.A.T.U. group,  also

sought  assistance from the Labour Research  Unit.  And

assistance and advice were duly given to them.  Now  it

would appear that the S.A.T.U. group of unions have not

been  forthcoming  in calling on the services  of  this

Unit.  However, I need not labour the reasons for this.

The  pro-Communist leaders of the S.A.T.U. group cannot

be  expected to conduct research for the benefit of the

workers. And the Labour Research Unit, from their point

of  view,  is  bad  because it only  does  research  to

justify  the claims of labour and maintains no  contact

with foreign Communist Parties.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1151</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, one of the stock accusations of the Member for Thomson is that the Government has failed to support the unification of the trade union movement. Now, when the pro-Communists talk about the unification of the trade union movement, they mean the control of the movement by the front agents of the

Communist  Party of Malaya. It is surely impossible  to

expect  the Government to help the Communists  to  gain

control  of the trade union movement under the  pretext

of  unification  and  to  surrender  the  non-Communist

majority  of  the workers of Singapore  to  the  tender

mercies of foreign inspired anti-national elements.  In

the circumstances, it is better that there should be  a

clear  demarcation  between  pro-Communists  and   non-Communists  in  the  trade  union  movement.  And   the

Government  will  continue  to  encourage  the  genuine

unification  of  the trade union movement  but  on  the

basis of democratic and independent trade unionism.  We

have  no  doubt  that in the final  result  the  labour

movement of Singapore will be so unified.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Mammen, Sir, after hearing a

long  recital  by the Acting Minister for  Labour,  one

would  feel  that the P.A.P. is really pro-labour.  The

Government  has been trying to make out to the  workers

of  Singapore that it is a good Government for them. It

claims  that  it has a labour policy that is  in  their

interests. This means that the Government knows that it

has  a  lot of things to do in order to implement  that

policy.  And  yet, after the death of  the  Member  for

Sembawang,  Inche Ahmad bin Ibrahim, last  August,  the

post  of Minister for Labour has been left vacant  with

only  a  Minister acting in his place. That shows  that

the  Government has not given labour its due  place  in

the Cabinet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has mentioned that it is

significant that the Acting Minister for Labour is  the

Minister  for  Home  Affairs. This is  because  a  good

number  of  trade unionists belonging to  the  S.A.T.U.

group  are now in gaol as a result of the orders signed

by  the  Minister for Home Affairs, concurrently Acting

Minister for Labour. But what is more important to  the

issue is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1152</b></font><br><br>



this.  Both  the  P.A.P. and the Barisan  Sosialis  are

playing  party politics in the trade union field.  Both

are  trying  to  capture trade union organisations  for

their own selfish political ends. And to listen in this

Assembly  to  the  exchange  of  mud-slinging  by   the

contestants, who are both guilty, would make one  think

that  the  whole trade union movement hangs around  the

activities of the P.A.P. and the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have maintained that a strong trade union movement

can only emerge if it is free of political control.  If

the  P.A.P. and the Barisan Sosialis really believe  in

this,  then  they  should put an end to  the  political

warfare  that they have been waging in the trade  union

world. If Barisan Sosialis speakers bring attention  to

the  strikes  that have been organised  by  the  P.A.P.

unions,  then  the  Acting Minister for  Labour  brings

attention  to  the strikes that have been organised  by

the  Barisan-controlled trade unions. All this  is  not

helpful  nor conducive to the industrialisation  policy

of the Government. Many industrialists would have liked

to  come  to Singapore and open up factories, but  they

have been deterred by the fact that there has been this

industrial  unrest  engendered  by  opposing  political

Parties  for political ends. I say, put an end to  this

strife  in the trade union movement. If this  is  done,

the  industrialisation policy of the Government can  be

easier implemented.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Mammen):</b> Mr Bani. There are only

seven minutes left.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I just want to say

how  disappointed I am that the Minister for Labour has

not  replied to the points I raised. All that  we  have

witnessed  is  the  reading of  the  Labour  Ministry's

Annual  Report. Surely you know at least  the  Minister

must give us sufficient intelligence to be able to look

up these documents. We get them free of charge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I just want to make two points. One is this

question  of secret ballots. The Minister explains  how

at  one time the legal advice was that you cannot hold

a  secret ballot if there is a collective agreement  in

force.  And  then how at another time the legal  advice

was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1153</b></font><br><br>



such  that you can hold a secret ballot. But this  only

proves  what  I  have said, that the  so-called  labour

policy  of the Government is inconsistent. They do  not

want  to  hold  a  secret ballot when it  is  to  their

disadvantage. They hold a secret ballot when it  is  to

their   advantage.  There  is  no  coherent  consistent

policy. This is a policy based on the whims and fancies

of the P.A.P. interest and of the P.A.P. Ministers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Labour Research Unit, he quoted some cases.

Our  basic  grievance against this unit is that  nearly

$300,000  is spent on sustaining 10 or 12 people  whose

names were read out by the Minister for Finance who are

P.A.P. personnel - Ho See Beng, Gopal, Aziz, etc.  I  am

grateful  to  the Minister for Finance for having  read

out  this.  Sir, we say the Labour Research Unit  is  a

P.A.P. outfit because it is loaded with P.A.P. men. And

what  is  more, public funds are used to sustain  these

people. And it is in the interest of the P.A.P. to  try

and  tell the workers, "Yes, we want to help you."  and

therefore they offer their services to all unions.



<br><br>11.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they are genuine about wanting to set up a

Research Unit for the unions, then why not consult  the

40 odd unions which are not P.A.P. unions? They want to

fight  these  unions because they say  that  these  are

Communist unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can only say that these 40 unions are

registered according to the laws of the country and are

registered   organisations.  So  long   as   they   are

registered  bodies, their rights must be respected.  If

the   Government  think  that  all  these  unions   are

Communist and therefore should not exist, they have the

power  to take action. I am sure they must have thought

of the possibility of banning some of the unions. Well,

that is a different proposition altogether. So long  as

the   unions   exist,  it  is  hypocritical   for   the

Government,  on the one hand, to say, "All  right,  you

operate as a registered union," and, on the other hand,

to  say, "You cannot appoint a member to the employees'

panel in the Arbitration Court because you are a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1154</b></font><br><br>



Communist union; you cannot have your representative in

the Research Bureau because you are a Communist union."

This, I believe, is hypocrisy. This proves further that

the  P.A.P. is  trying  to use Government  organs  and

Government funds for the purposes of P.A.P. interests.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I quite

appreciate  and understand how the Member  for  Thomson

has  to  put up so hard a defence for the misdeeds  and

evils that they have done to the workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> What are they?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Just now, he mentioned that the

Minister  for Home Affairs was asked to take  over  the

Ministry  of  Labour  because  he  will  be  there   to

intimidate  the  workers. This is far  from  being  the

case. You will remember that during the Roneo case, the

Member  for Thomson's closest colleague, Mr  Foo  Yong

Fong ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Borneo?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> --- Roneo. Borneo? Yes, we will come

to  Borneo also. He put a cigarette end on the neck  of

an   executive  officer  and  he  was  punished.   Now,

similarly members of his union who were on strike there

lodged   a   complaint   with   the   police   alleging

intimidation  from the manager. Similarly,  the  police

also  took  up  the investigation and the  manager  was

produced before the court and prosecuted, but  in  that

case there was no case and the manager was acquitted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that their own S.A.T.U. unions came

personally  to me with a request for police protection.

They  said  that when they were on strike the employers

used thugs to intimidate them. Yes, we asked the police

to give them the necessary protection. So where is this

intimidation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member wants to know about ballots. I

think  probably he was not being informed of the facts.

In the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1155</b></font><br><br>



instance of the Plywood case, when the Singapore Manual

and   Mercantile  Workers  Union  also  challenged  for

recognition,  the  case was brought before  the  Labour

Ministry by the management. The Labour Ministry offered

a secret ballot in that instance. But the hon. Member's

union,  the Singapore General Employees' Union, refused

a  secret  ballot.  There is a letter  written  by  the

secretary  of  that union. It is in the  file.  If  the

Member  wants,  I can produce it tomorrow  before  this

House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 46 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 46 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (1)  of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, about the Commissioner for Labour - Mr Pang Tee

Pow.   Earlier  I  said  that  the  majority   of   the

Conciliation  Officers in the Ministry  of  Labour  are

doing  a good job. In fact, the Minister - I do not blame

him, because he was reading from the Annual Report  - was

trying  to  answer a point that I never  made.  He  was

trying  to  explain how the conciliation officers  work

hard and settle the disputes. I agree with him. I never

deny  this. The majority of them do so. But  there  are

one  or two - and this man, Mr Pang Tee Pow, who is  now

in Geneva making political speeches, is one of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is strange that the P.A.P. has made so many

appointments, since it came into office, to the post of

Commissioner  for  Labour. Mr Kok Ah Loy transferred,

Mr  Goh Koh Pui transferred, now Mr Pang Tee  Pow  is

the  Commissioner for Labour. Sir, I was  referring  to

Mr Francis Seow yesterday as a gold medallist. This is

obviously  a degree lesser; Mr Pang Tee Pow is  silver

medallist.  The  Government has  shown  recognition  by

giving   him   a   medal,   but,   unfortunately,   his

contribution  to the P.A.P. interest has  not  been  as

much  as  that given by Mr Francis Seow and therefore,

instead of a gold medal, he received a silver medal.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do not want to go around threatening civil

servants.  We do not do this sort of thing which  is  a

habit  of  the  P.A.P.  But we say  this  to  them:  we

understand  the problems that the civil servants  face.

We have a Government which is devoid of all decency and

does not respect the independence of the civil service.

It  uses threats, intimidation and bribery in the  form

of  medals, etc., to get the civil servants to do  what

they want them to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we realise the predicament of the civil

servants,  and  we say that we do not blame  them.  But

there are certain individuals like Mr Pang Tee Pow who

bend backwards to please the Ministers. And we say that

today the side-drum to the Minister for Labour and  the

Parliamentary  Secretary, who constitute the  political

wing  in  the  Ministry of Labour,  is  Mr  Pang,  the

Commissioner  for  Labour. He is the third  person  who

acts as if he is a P.A.P. cadre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You take the case of C. K. Tang, for example. Just

now  the Minister was trying to explain how and why the

C.  K, rang  secret  ballot was  not  held.  Sir,  the

Commissioner for Labour, since December 1961,  did  not

offer  any  explanation at all to the  Business  Houses

Employees' Union for refusing to hold a secret  ballot.

Arrogance, trying to please the Minister - therefore,  he

just   did  not  care  less  for  the  Business  Houses

Employees' Union. A public servant whose duty to us was

to  consider  the  holding of  a  secret  ballot,  when

repeated  requests  were made,  did  not  even  give  a

reason - let alone a reason, Sir, there have been letters

which he has not even replied to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we say that the P.A.P. Government is not going

to  be  in force for ever and ever. The time will  come

sooner or later, when the P.A.P. is going to disappear,

and  the  Ministers, the Parliamentary Secretaries  and

their  cadres  are going to disappear. When  that  time

comes,  the people who played politics when  they  were

not supposed to play politics, will have to pay for all

their actions. And we hope that wisdom



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1158</b></font><br><br>



will prevail, and that there will not be these attempts

by   individuals  to  bend  backwards  to  please   the

Ministers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Mammen):</b> Would the Minister or the

Parliamentary Secretary like to speak?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, just now

I was stopped because of the time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Member for Thomson wishes to pursue the

case of C. K. Tang, then may I take this opportunity to

continue  with  the legal opinion given  by  the  State

Advocate-General? All this is on record in  the  files.

If  the  Member for Thomson wishes to pursue the matter

further,  by  all  means. There are  other  sources  of

avenue  open  to him to enquire into it.  The  S.A.G.'s

opinion was as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The collective agreement, a memorandum of which has

already been certified, is binding between the parties,

etc, and  is deemed to be an award which is final  and

conclusive  save  as  varied  in  accordance  with  the

provisions  of  Part  IV  of the  Industrial  Relations

Ordinance. In the circumstances, I [that is, the S.A.G.

Chambers' legal officer] do not see how the question of

the   recognition  of  the  Singapore  Business  Houses

Employees' Union arises. Section 18 (3)  cannot apply at

this  stage  and you cannot be required  to  conduct  a

secret   ballot  now.  ["You  cannot"  refers  to   the

Commissioner for Labour]'.



<br><br>This  is  the  legal  opinion  tendered  by  the  State

Advocate-General.  Just  now  the  Member  for  Thomson

alleged -  rather I would say that he intimated - that the

present Commissioner for Labour is not carrying out his

work ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Point of elucidation. Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I would like to ask the Parliamentary

Secretary whether the quotation he gave just now of the

legal  opinion  is from the first or the  second  legal

opinion,  because  the Minister earlier  on  said  that

there were two opinions given. I am also anxious to ask

the Parliamentary Secretary ---
