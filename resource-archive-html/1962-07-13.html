<div align="center"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Motion)</b></div>



<br><br>2.32 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, "That the items of business set

down  on  the  Order Paper of  this  day  be

exempted  from  the provisions  of  Standing

Order  No. 1 until 12 midnight."-[The Deputy

Prime Minister - Dr Toh Chin Chye].

<div align="center"><b>NATIONAL MONUMENT FUND</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Motion)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves, in accordance

with  the  provisions of subsection  (2)  of

section  106  of  the Income  Tax  Ordinance

(Chapter  166),  that  notwithstanding   the

provisions  of  section  37  of   the   said

Ordinance  the assessable income of persons

contributing  to the National Monument  Fund

established  for the purpose of constructing

the National Monument in Kuala Lumpur, shall

be   reduced  by  the  amount  of  any  such

contribution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think Members are aware that

contributions  to useful and notable  causes

can be exempted from income



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>



tax,  and  every  so often motions  to  this

effect  are  put to the Assembly  for  their

approval.  This motion asking that exemption

in  respect of income tax may be granted  to

contributions to the National Monument  Fund

comes  at  a  very apt moment when  we  have

completed our deliberations on such  weighty

matters   as   merger,  Malaysia   and   the

referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a perfectly straightforward

and  simple  matter.  Where  exemptions  are

asked  from the Assembly, it is the  general

practice for both the Federal Parliament and

the  Singapore Assembly to agree to the same

resolutions. For instance, last year on  7th

August, the Federal Parliament by resolution

exempted  contributions in  respect  of  our

National Theatre Fund -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> - and in agreeing to exemptions for contributions to the National Monument in Kuala Lumpur, we are merely reciprocating the sentiments held in the Federation on matters of national

importance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (2) of section 106 of the Income Tax Ordinance (Chapter 166), that notwithstanding the provisions of section 37 of the said Ordinance the assessable income of persons contributing to the National Monument Fund established for the purpose if constructing the National Monument in Kuala Lumpur, shall be reduced by the amount of any such contribution.

<div align="center"><b>MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*That this House expresses no confidence in the Government.

<hr size="2" noshade>

*The same motion also stood in the name of Mr David Marshall.

<hr size="2" noshade>





<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, I move this motion of  no

confidence  in  the Government  because  the

political  situation in  Singapore  has  now

come to a most critical stage.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> For the Barisan

Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> For

you.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The future of all

Singapore is at stake and we cannot allow  a

discredited  Government that cater  only  to

the   selfish  interests  of  a  few  P.A.P.

leaders to mar and destroy the lives of  1.7

million people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last three years of P.A.P.

misrule in Singapore -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Sama sama lah!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b>- will be recorded in

history as the tragedy -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Of the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - of the P.A.P. and Lee

Kuan Yew's regime, but unlike the regimes of

old,  when the last artificial glow  of  the

P.A.P. is gone and forgotten, there may  not

even be ruins and ashes left behind.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You are going to burn

it all up, are you?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Today because of the

P.A.P.'s  broken promises, because of  their

dictatorial  rule, because of their  Fascist

abuse  of  power, because of their  play  on

communal politics, because of their constant

invoking  of the Communist bogey to threaten

and  intimidate the peace-loving  people  of

Singapore -



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> He loves peace!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - because of the self-centred

arrogance of the Ministers, because of  their  blatant

dishonesty,  because  of their placing party considerations

above the national  interests, because of their  sell-out

of  the  interests  of  the  people  of

Singapore -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> By not arresting the

Communists!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - and because of their unreasonably

and  desperately  wanting   to railroad  the  so-called

merger arrangements that will bring only national



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>



disunity and unhappiness to the people of

Singapore,  the  P.A.P. are   no   more   a

respected  Government, no more a  Government

supported by the majority of the people, and

no  more a Government of the people.  It  is

now   a   minority   Government   completely

discredited  in the eyes of the people,  and

everyone  in Singapore is counting the  days

when the P.A.P. will finally be no more  and

gone for ever, never to return.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Fat hope!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> For the P.A.P. it is

such   a  short  span  of  life - only   three

years - and  indeed  none  of  us  would  have

foreseen  that the life of the P.A.P. would

be  so short. The future of the people of  a

country  cannot be decided by  a  Government

that  does  not have the confidence  of  the

people.  We  cannot allow a Government  that

works  only  for  the interests  of  a  tiny

minority to impose its will on the  will  of

the  vast  minority. It  is  a  travesty  of

democracy and of justice and it is our  duty

to stop it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us briefly cast our minds back

over   the  last  three  years.  The  P.A.P.

started  on its journey of power  and  glory

most   impressively.  In  the  1959  general

elections, the P.A.P. contested all  the  51

seats in the Legislative Assembly; 43 of the

P.A.P. candidates were returned, some  with

large  winning margins. It was a  triumphant

victory,  and more than half the votes  cast

were   polled  for  the  P.A.P.   When   the

reactionary Lim Yew Hock Government -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Thank you!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - was replaced by the new

Lee  Kuan  Yew Government, there followed  a

period of rejoicing amongst the people.  The

people  were happy and they thought that  at

last  they  had  elected a  Government  that

would look after their interests and not the

interests of some colonial master. But alas,

such  is  not the case. No one at that  time

thought  that  it  would  be  such  a  short

passing  phase in the history  of  Singapore

politics.  Never in the history of Singapore

has there been a political Party in power



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>



that commanded so much .respect and had such

great   support  of  the  people  in   1959.

Everybody  had the feeling that  the  P.A.P.

was  destined to have a brilliant future and

that   the   new   political  set-up   would

definitely  come  to  stay  and   for   some

considerable time. But see, Sir, how quickly

it has changed -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr G. Kandasamy):</b>

Been betrayed!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b>- see how quickly and

how  completely  the P.A.P. have  destroyed

themselves.   Never  in   the   history   of

Singapore has any government given  so  much

hope to our people and let them down so very

badly, within so short a time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister himself had said the P.A.P.

could only be destroyed by the P.A.P. deviating

from its stand and if the  P.A.P. were  dishonest.

He said that in 1959.  Now, those  words  of  his

have  come  true.  The

P.A.P.,  by  being dishonest and  by  having

deviated  from  the original  stand  of  the

P.A.P. have destroyed the P.A.P. Amen!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us briefly catalogue the milestones,

so  to speak, of the P.A.P.'s downfall. From

the original impressive number of 43 out  of

a  total of 51 seats in this House in  1959,

the initial P.A.P. majority of 35-43 against

8 - was first reduced to 29 in 1960. Then came

the  split  in  the Party in the  middle  of

1961,  and the majority was soon reduced  to the uneasy figure of 1. Now, this uneasy one-man   majority  has  been  changed  into   a

precarious and untenable one-woman minority.

Sir, can we still have confidence in such  a

Government?  In  July  1961,  with  still  a

majority  in  the House, the Prime  Minister

introduced  a motion to seek the  confidence

of the House. Yet today -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> To draw a line

separating the traitors!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b>- with only an

untenable  minority  the  P.A.P. want  to

carry on, and to carry on, they have to rely

very  heavily on the support of the  S.P.A.-U.M.N.O. Alliance, an organisation which the

P.A.P. leaders used to despise and to  poke

fun at with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>



disparaging   remarks.  But   fearing   this

support  may be taken away from  them  soon,

the  Government will adjourn the House  sine

die   in  the  fond  hope  that  the  P.A.P.

Government  might  yet  survive  a  wee  bit

longer,  a  hope  which the  P.A.P. leaders

themselves  know  will  not  and  cannot  be

fulfilled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister said that the P.A.P. would never ally themselves with the so-called anti-Communist forces which, according to the words of the Prime Minister himself, are often cloaked to hide the

reactionary  elements ranging from  colonial

vested  interests to enemies  of  democracy.

But  see what has happened today. He has  to

rely   more  and  more  heavily   on   these

reactionary  elements that  are  enemies  of

democracy,  and  he  says  he  is   a   non-Communist. Sir, even a blind man,  I  think,

can  see that the P.A.P. Government are  now

on   their   last  legs  and, under   such

circumstances, we should probably have  seen

the  formation  of  some form  of  coalition

government -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> S.P.A. and Barisan?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But there is no

coalition  government. Neither the  U.M.N.O.

nor  the  somersaulting S.P.A. have received

their due share of the spoils of government -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You try to entice

them?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Perhaps there is no

point   in   trying  to  have  a   coalition

government.  There  may  be   more  from  the

Government Benches who will take courage  in

time  and stand up for the interests of  the

people, instead of just sticking around  and

following the tails of their leaders of  the

bankrupt  and discredited P.A.P. Government.

Let  us  hope they have the courage and  the

guts  to  do so, because this is their  last

chance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today the P.A.P. have become the

object  of hatred and contempt of the people

of Singapore. If only the Prime Minister and

the  Minister for Finance, especially  these

two,   should  go  into  the  coffee  shops,

markets  and  other places of gathering - that

is, really going amongst the people -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> You go to bars and

coffee shops?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - instead of just

hiding  behind air-conditioned Radio P.A.P.,

they  would  better  be able  to  sense  the

intensity  of the people's feelings  against

the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You are a real scream!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Everywhere we go we

hear that the P.A.P. is dirty -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Ch'ow!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> They say the P.A.P. is

more dirty than the S.P.A. In fact, they say

now   that  the  P.A.P. absolutely  stinks.

Surely,  the Special Branch and other  MI  5

scouts  of  theirs should be able to  inform

the  Prime  Minister and  the  Minister  for

Finance  of  this  feeling  of  hatred   and

contempt for them and the Government -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Barisan.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> In fact, Sir, not only

in Singapore and in the Federation, but also

in  the  Borneo territories and other  Afro-Asian countries, the common talk is that the

Lee  Kuan  Yew Government has sold Singapore

down the river -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Singapore River stinks

though!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And what is worse, the

P.A.P. Ministers have sold out Singapore  on

a time schedule -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Oh, I am worried about

that.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> What phase is it now?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, our debate has

been  guillotined and every act of  the  Lee

Kuan  Yew, Government has been timed to  the

pleasure  of the colonialists and  the  neo-colonialists. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, on a point of

information -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Unless the Member will give

way.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir,



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Prime Minister

cannot talk unless the Member gives way  and

sits down. Is the Member giving way?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> No, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Scared!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Prime Minister will

have ample opportunity to reply -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, I want only a few

minutes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But let him hear my

piece.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You weary my heart. [Laughter]



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Our Prime Minister and

the  Ministers  of the P.A.P. think  it  is

great  fun.  They think they can hide  their

great  anxiety and fear of the  contempt  of

the  people and the anger of the  people  by

laughing it away.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> You laugh.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Let them realise that

if  they were to go out into the streets  of

Singapore without their array of bodyguards,

we might not see them again -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Are you threatening me

now?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I might remind Members

of  the Government Benches that this is  not

really a mass meeting. I have not attended a

mass  meeting, but I understand there  is  a

lot of heckling at a mass meeting. I suggest

that  this  is not a mass meeting  and  hon.

Members should try not to heckle as much  as

they can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order.

The  last words of the Member for Queenstown

were  really a threat. He said  that  if  we

were  to  go  into  the  streets,  we  would

disappear.  Is  he  going  to  contrive  our

disappearance, Mr Speaker, by himself?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Do I take it then that the

Minister for Finance has been intimidated?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I ask the Member for

Queenstown not to intimidate.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will never be able to

intimidate,   Sir, If   there    is    any

intimidation, it is not from me. I  have  no

arms  on  me. It is the people outside,  who

will  go for them hammer and tongs and  they

will  never be able to see themselves  alive

again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was saying, Sir, that now every action

of the P.A.P. has been timed to the pleasure

of the colonialists, pro-colonialists and

neo-colonialists -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Who are they?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b>- so that our Prime

Minister  can  hand Singapore  over  to  the

Federation bound hand and foot on time.  Let

us ask: is the date 31st August, 1962?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You are getting

worried?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b>- that shows, Sir,

from  what they have been saying, that  they

are  trying to sell Singapore down the river

on time -



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> For how much?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b>- in order to

please forces outside Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Such as?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, the P.A.P. today

do  not work for the interests of the people

in  Singapore. No, Sir, they  work  for  the

interests of people outside Singapore -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Where? Peking?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - and for that reason,

Sir,   they   have  deservedly  earned   the

contempt   and  hatred  of  the  people   of

Singapore  the  contempt  of  some  and  the

hatred of more of the people of Singapore -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You do not like us, do

you?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Member for Bras

Basah  knew  of this widespread  hatred  and

contempt for the P.A.P., but the others  all

those  who  are  still associated  with  the

Ministers -  tailing them  around,  condoning

and  conniving at whatever they  do,  should

awaken early from their stuporous slumber -



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> He is using hard words.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b>- before it is too

late.  They  are words not easily understood

by the Minister for Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, immediately following the Party

split, and even before, when the few leaders

of  the P.A.P. were left with an empty shell

of  an organisation that has leaders but  no

followers,  the triumvirate of  the  P.A.P.,

namely, the Prime Minister, -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The Minister for Finance.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Minister for Finance -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The Deputy Prime Minister?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b>- and the Minister for

Culture.  Anyway,  Sir,  the  Minister   for

Finance  is  also the Minister  for  Culture

now. So it makes no difference.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> He thinks that they

are all the same.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> These three started the

smear campaign of the Communist bogey.  They

had  hoped by so doing that the public might

be deceived as to what was going on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. was disintegrating, but the

P.A.P. leaders attempted to paint a picture

that  it  was all the work of a  handful  of

Communists and subversives, and if only  the

P.A.P. could cleanse themselves of these so-called subversives, then all would be  well.

But what has happened? Only recently another

Central   Executive  Committee  Member   has

crossed the Floor. Is this again the work of

Communists,   so-called   Communists,    and

subversives?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Some of the Members on

the  Government Benches seem to know  a  lot

more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> We know more about you!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And they dare not face

the   people  and  tell  them  on  a  public

platform. They must hide behind Radio P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in their desperation today, the

P.A.P. have labelled everything - any person,

any  organisation,  any movement - that  is

against  the  dishonest P.A.P. dictators  as

Communist,   pro-Communist,  or   Communist-inspired.  The  unions,  because  they   are

against the Prime Minister, the Minister for

Finance  and  the Minister for Culture,  are

called Communist-led unions, irrespective of

whether  they are unions of factory  workers

or  of English-speaking office workers.  The

civic  organisations and the Chinese Schools

Old  Boys'  Associations have been similarly

labelled,  simply because they  are  against

the  dictatorial rule of the Fascists in the

persons  of  the  Prime  Minister  and   the

Minister  for  Finance.  Now  the  Singapore

University  Socialist Club and  the  Nanyang

University  Political Science Society  which

have  organised a Gallup poll on the  P.A.P.

White  Paper  merger  proposals  in  Tanjong

Pagar  constituency, are similarly  labelled

pro-Communist. The political Parties outside

the  Legislative Assembly - the Lib-Socs,  the

United Democratic Party, the Party Rakyat

all   those   that   protest   against   the

dishonesty, the   cheating,    and    the

dictatorship of the P.A.P. are now all  pro-Communist or supposed to be made use  of  by

Communist organisations.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sure, that is right.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> All the people who

oppose  the  sell-out merger are Communists.

All those who oppose the humbug of this sham

referendum are Communists. And today. Sir, I

see   in  the  newspapers  that  the  United

Nations may be taking up the matter,  and  I

suppose they also are Communists. [Laughter]

In  fact, everyone who is against the  Prime

Minister, the Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>



for  Finance and the Minister for Culture,

is  a  Communist  or  a  pro-Communist.  How

ridiculous can one be? Surely they must have

a  sense  of proportion. Is everything  just

because it is anti-P.A.P., anti-Lee Kuan Yew

and  Goh, the work of the omnipotent and the

omnipresent Communists? No. Sir, it  is  not

the  Communists  and subversives  that  have

been  at  work,  it is the bad  things,  the

unforgivable   things   that   the    P.A.P.

Ministers  themselves  have  done,  and  are

doing,  that have given rise to such  hatred

and  contempt, it is a demonstration of  the

people's   discontent  against  the   P.A.P.

Government.  It  is  the  P.A.P. that  have

destroyed the P.A.P. And I dare say if  more

Government   Backbenchers  could   pick   up

courage  and defend the rights and interests

of  the  people, more would be  crossing  the

Floor of the House. And we would be able  to -





<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Don't dream of it!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b>- see the spectacle

and  comedy of the S.P.A.-UMNO Alliance also

crossing the Floor - but from the Opposition.

of  course,  to  join the  P.A.P.  Ministers

opposite. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Better not. If you go

there, you are finished! [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There seems to be a

combined   orchestra  again!  We  have   not

reached  midnight yet. Let us not  have  any

further interjections. Let us carry on  with

this debate as fast as we can.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You see, they are

already anticipating, Sir, the tragic comedy

of the big double cross.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Member for

Queenstown talks in that vein, then I cannot

really  blame  the  Government  Benches  for

interjecting. If he addresses his remarks to

the  Chair  and proceeds with his speech.  I

think it will be all right.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir.

My  last remark was a repartee to what  they

had earlier on said.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the evidence of this loss of confidence in

the  P.A.P. Government can easily be seen  all  over

Singapore and even in the Federation and the  Borneo

territories where the name of the P.A.P. is  always

mentioned together with epithets that are only  used

in abusive language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you will remember the National Day celebrations

of  the past three years, Sir. Contrast the 1960 and

196!  National  Day celebrations with the  National

Day  celebrations this year. The P.A.P., this  year,

fearing  that  the loss of support and depletion  in

their   rank   and  file  would  allow  the   P.A.P.

contingent  to  be totally eclipsed by  the  Barisan

Sosialis  contingent if the political  Parties  were

allowed to participate as in previous years, imposed

all sorts of restrictions on us. Banners and slogans

were not allowed, and contingents from the political

Parties were restricted to 60 men per Member of  the

Legislative Assembly. Calculated on this basis, Sir,

the  Workers' Party would be allowed to have a  team

of  only  60 in the march past: the United  People's

Party would be  allowed to have 60 times 3 = 180: and

the Barisan Sosialis would be allowed 60 times 13 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> How many is that?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> 780, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He has written it down there!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Of course, it would give the

P.A.P. a chance to put up a larger crowd of 26 times

60, which would be 1,560, exactly double ours.  But

in  spite of all this, unfortunately for the  P.A.P.

they could not put up a show of strength. The P.A.P.

tried  their  utmost,  Sir, to  put  up  a  show  of

strength. Work Brigade boys were given double pay to

attend. Certain workers were induced to attend by  a

special  allowance of $1.50 per head. All  sorts  of

inducements were also offered. Sir, all these things

are known to everybody. Why should they try to hide?

In  spite of all this, Sir, in spite of their trying

to buy people to attend, the P.A.P. could not muster

more  than a handful, a mere handful of 300. It  was

no show of strength. It was a pathetic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>



spectacle  of the loss of confidence in  the  P.A.P.

and  a  clear  demonstration of  general  discontent

against the P.A.P. The workers who were scheduled to

hold  their  own National Day celebrations  had  all

sorts  of restrictions placed in their way and  they

were  compelled  to  cancel a meeting  to  celebrate

National  Day.  It was indeed, Sir, a city  divided.

And  it  was this "City Divided" - which was headlined

in the Sunday Mail - that had caused the P.A.P. to get

into such fits that they had to threaten to stop the

circulation  of this Sunday paper in Singapore.  And

now  we understand that the editor of that paper has

been  transferred to another department in order  to

placate the wrath of the P.A.P. Ministers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider again, Sir, the May Day rally of the

P.A.P.-sponsored unions in the Happy  World  Stadium

and the rally of the independent unions in the Jalan

Besar Stadium. It was described in our Plebeian as a

battle  of  rallies. We had a series of pictures  to

show the people who attended the two rallies. On the

one hand, there were 70,000 to 80.000 who braved the

heavy  rains  in  order  to  show  their  solidarity

against  the P.A.P. On the other hand, you had  this

humbug  of a rally in the Happy World Stadium  which

started with about 6,000, but when the time came for

the   P.A.P.  "adviser"  to  speak, the  crowd  had

dwindled down to only a few hundred.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You had a Gallup poll taken

there?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, all these are undeniable

facts  and  I see that the Ministers dare  not  even

deny  what  I say. Because these facts  can  all  be

proved,  Sir, with pictures which tell stories  that

nobody can deny.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is right. We already did

so yesterday.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Of course, the P.A.P. leaders,

knowing  full  well how unpopular they have  become,

dare  not  hold  rallies of their own  to  meet  the

people. The people used to flock by the thousands to

listen to them -



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> They will flock again.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - not so very long ago. The

P.A.P. were invited to a rally in Anson, Sir.  They

dared not turn up. They were afraid of the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Come off it!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> They just dare not. None of them

turned up, Sir. They were afraid that they would  be

booed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You mean you were scared of

their booing us?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Nowadays, Sir, if the P.A.P.

Ministers  ever think of holding a rally, they  will

first  make  sure  that  they  have  some  sort   of

entertainment or show on before they step on to  the

stage, at least hoping that the people might turn up

to  see the show and incidentally listen to them  at

the  same  tune. That was what happened in  Malaysia

Week.  They  had  to put on a huge  show  hoping  to

attract a crowd to listen to the Prime Minister. But

in  spite  of  all that, it was a poor  effort.  The

thousands never turned up. They cannot deny it.  All

this  is due. I believe, to a lack of confidence  in

the Government. Even in the recent University forum,

Sir,  I  understand that lorry loads of Work Brigade

boys  were transported there as cheer boys  for  our

Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Come off it!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I do not know. He can deny it

later  on  and we will see what he has to  say.  The

Government   are  very  clever  at  distorting   and

inventing  stories  to cover up all  their  defects.

Sir, the Prime Minister himself had said before that

if  a government were to function properly they must

have  the masses on their side. I think if he  wants

me  to  quote the proper context, I can  quote,  but

those are the operative words. I think he would  not

deny  it.  Even the Deputy Prime Minister,  I  think [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have already told the Member

for Queenstown that he should address the Chair.  If

he  does  not  want  to  be interrupted,  he  should

address the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Even the Deputy Prime Minister

said that if the P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>



want  to succeed, they must have the support of  the

masses. But what has happened today? The P.A.P. do not

have  the  support  of  the masses,  and  they  have

accordingly failed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. made a series of promises in the

general  elections,  promises which  they  have  now

clean  forgotten.  They  promised  to  release   the

detainees, for example. But the detainees are  still

detained. They are six years under detention, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Just think of that!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And even without the courtesy of

a  trial! And to think that our Prime Minister spoke

so strongly, Sir,-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Your Secretary-General was

released.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - on this particular point. I am

just  wondering whether the Prime Minister  and  the

Ministers  that  go along with him really  have  any

feelings. Are they completely devoid of humanitarian

principles?  Has the Prime Minister forgotten  those

brave and inspiring words - words which inspired  me,

Sir - uttered in this House not so very long  ago?  He

said  that  if any government wanted to put  up  the

slightest  pretence of democracy, then all detainees

must  be  released, or if not released, at least  be

taken  to  a court for trial. He said that he  would

never  abandon  his colleagues even if  they  should

work against him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is right. That is why we

let out Lim Ching Siong.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But what has happened? The

detainees are still in St. John's Island.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Those are not our colleagues.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Prime Minister is

entitled  to  elucidate if he is addressed  in  that

manner.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Surely, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I do not believe that the

Member  for  Queenstown - it is not really his  fault - is  capable of this subtle blurring of  the  lines.

Never were the detainees an issue. In fact, we  made

it  quite clear by stating that only those who  were

closely  connected with the P.A.P. would be released

and  nothing  more.  We owed no  obligation  to  the

others  who  were against us and who  fought  us  in

1957.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I have no wish to prolong this

argument  on  a small episode. But I  can  tell  you

this.   The   Prime  Minister  gave  a   categorical

assurance  to  Woodhull that he  would  release  the

prisoners within six months.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of elucidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I missed Mr Woodhull

recently at the University of Singapore. I  met  him

only  the other evening and invited him to  a  drink

but he was so very busy that he was unable to accept

my  invitation. This is one of those malicious  lies

that  are  being spread. By the very  fact  that  we

demanded the release of Messrs. Woodhull, Lim Ching

Siong,   Devan   Nair,   Fong   Swee   Suan,   James

Puthucheary,  Chan  Chiaw  Thor  and  the  rest,  we

indicated  that we were not in a position to  ensure

the release of every one on the assumption of power,

for the power was not in our hands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Woodhull has publicly stated that I promised him ten times. I indicated to him that the Prison records show that I visited the Prison only twice before he was released. I have since had no reply from him.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Prime Minister indicated to

us  in  this House that he would never put his hands

into   the   dirty  gloves  of  the  Lim  Yew   Hock

Government. What is he doing -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, that is another

inaccuracy. I never indicated it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>



in  this  House. I indicated it at the Hokkien  Huay

Kuan at a Press conference.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Then why is he denying? Does it

make  a difference whether he said it in this  House

or  outside  this House? But did he  not  say  those

things? That is all we want -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think, for the sake of the

Official Report, there must be  some sort of accuracy

in  this  House, even though it might be trivial  in

the eyes of the Member.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, all these are promises

which  the  Prime Minister has clean forgotten.  For

example,  he  also promised the unification  of  the

trade union movement. But there is no unification of

the  trade union movement today. In fact, so far  as

we  know,  every  attempt is being made  to  further

divide the trade union movement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You broke it up.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Then, of course, again, Sir,

there  were those promises which the Prime  Minister

made  to the workers in the Singapore Harbour Board.

He  told  them  that he would see to it  that  their

living standard, their wages and everything would be

raised  the  moment  he  came  to  power.  What  has

happened today?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I do not remember at any time

the  Member  for  Queenstown being present  at  any

meeting  of the Singapore Harbour Board workers.  My

only association with the Member for Queenstown  was

in  the  Chinese Printing Workers' Union. I was  the

legal, adviser and he was the medical adviser.  And

from time to time we used to meet. He has got it all

confused.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, the Prime Minister tries -

to



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Twist and turn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes, twist and turn. But he has

not denied what I have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>



said.  Sir,  we  learn a lot of things  not  through

direct  experience.  We have to  learn  through  the

experience  of others. I am sure, Sir,  that  nobody

will  say  that  he knows everything through  direct

experience. He has got to learn it from books. Books

tell you the experience of other people. Surely  you

must learn that, Mr Prime Minister -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown is

forgetting  that  he  is  in  the  Assembly.  He  is

completely  wrong in addressing the  Prime  Minister

directly. He must address the Chair. It seems to  me

that we are now debating the Prime Minister and  not

the  motion of no confidence in the Government which

is before us.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will endeavour to prove, Sir,

that  it is the triumvirate that is actually running

the   government,  and  the  whole  of  the   P.A.P.

Government actually rests on those three people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The Three Musketeers!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I do not know whether they call

them  the  Three  Musketeers or the triumvirate.  It

makes  no  difference, Sir. But if any one of  those

three should fall, the whole P.A.P. will fall.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is what you think.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The other- [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There is a Backbencher of the

Government  who seems to be very persistent  in  his

interjections. I do not propose to mention him  yet.

But I think he knows that I have watched him, and  I

ask him to stop interjecting.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Talking of promises, Sir, I

must  mention one more thing. There is the  shocking

remark  by  the  Prime  Minister  in  the  Singapore

University Forum about Singapore citizens  not  born

in  Singapore. He now thinks that the loyalty of the

Singapore citizens who were not born in Singapore is

worth only one dollar - just two packets of cigarettes-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of elucidation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Point of elucidation, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> refused to give way.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If an hon. Member makes a

direct  reference  to another hon.  Member  of  this

House - which  the  other  hon.  Member  thinks  is  a

misrepresentation or an untruth - and  if  the  Member

who  is  attacked  wishes to  rise  on  a  point  of

elucidation, I think the Member who speaks ought  to

sit  down.  That is courtesy not only to the  Member

attacked, but also to the Chamber itself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I have given up smoking for

some  five years, Sir, I do not even know  what  the

price  of a packet of cigarettes is, to begin  with.

In  my  remarks to the University of Singapore - which

is  all on the tape, Mr Speaker, Sir, and it can be

checked - what I pointed out was the curious  position

in  Singapore where, as a result of the  legislation

of  the previous Government, a whole host of persons

have  been  granted citizenship on the  basis  of  a

quantitative  and  not qualitative  test,  with  the

result  that  those born and bred here -  280,000  of

them - have  been  outnumbered  by  those   not   born

here - 340,000 of them. And I said this in answer to a

question  why  it was necessary to pose alternatives

to  the people. I indicated then that the process of

just  registering  a  man for one  dollar  does  not

ensure that he is as loyal as his oath. It is a fair

remark  which  I will make and repeat anywhere - which

any  honest man knows to be true. I did not make any

disparaging  remarks about the price of two  packets

of  cigarettes being the price of a citizen  because

obviously  there  must  be quite  a  number  of  the

340,000 who will satisfy any qualitative test. Quite

a  number of them are sitting with me in this  House

on my side.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Prime Minister has

made his point.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That merely proves my point,

Sir, that he did say



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>



that loyalty to Singapore was worth only one dollar.

And yet the Prime Minister -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member for

Queenstown must not misinterpret what has been said.

I  think  the Prime Minister indicated quite clearly

that  a  dollar  is  the cost of  a  certificate  of

citizenship, which is quite a different thing.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> No, Sir. He did say those

things  about  the Singapore citizens who  were  not

born in Singapore, and yet he came to power with the

support of these very same non-local born citizens.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of elucidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The vote was secret, and

nobody  knew  who voted how. There was no  disparity

between  the  Singapore born and  the  non-Singapore

born  citizens  at the last election.  I  think  the

suggestion by the Member for Queenstown that the non-local born citizens supported us and the local  born

citizens did not support us is completely untenable,

and in any case -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Prime Minister has made

his point. He cannot make a speech.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Just one last sentence. Sir,

about this incident. Let him remember the verdict of

the people. The Prime Minister himself has said that

the  verdict of the people is a terrible  thing  and

that  it will be very terrible to those who  do  not

keep faith -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Like the Barisan.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> -with the people. The P.A.P.

Ministers themselves know that they are no more what

they  were,  or  what they used to be.  Hence  their

desperate attempt to woo the civil service with  the

restoration of pay cuts and their belated attempt to

introduce equal pay for women. Now, Sir, we see this

comedy of trying to placate the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>



teachers  on  their grouse about the  six-day  week,

hoping thereby to gain or to regain possibly-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I wonder whether the report of

the  Commission of Inquiry on that particular  point

has  been  published. If it has not been  published,

the Member should not refer to that subject.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will leave it out, Sir.

Anyway,  the  P.A.P. today have travelled  very  far

away  from the people, so much so that they have  to

place open reliance on troops in order that they may

have an opportunity to repress the people. The Prime

Minister  has  boasted, for  example,  that  he  has

obtained  money from the United Kingdom in order  to

have more battalions stationed in Singapore-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am rising on a point of

elucidation, Mr Speaker, Sir, It is very important.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of elucidation. Will the Member

give way?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> indicated dissent.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member will not give way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I think the Prime Minister has

ample time to reply, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It is not a question of the

Prime   Minister  having  ample  time.  As  I   have

indicated,  if a direct attack is being  made  on  a

Member  and that Member thinks that that  attack  is

untrue,  then  he  should  be  given  a  chance   of

elucidating. But I am watching it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, the Prime Minister claims

that  he  is a great anti-colonialist. But he  is  a

curious   type   of  anti-colonialist   who   fights

colonialism with money and troops from the  colonial

power.  In  addition,  Sir,  I  saw  in  the  papers

recently  the  Prime  Minister was  giving  indirect

encouragement  to  the troops in the  Federation  to

take  over should the Socialist Front come to  power

in   the   Federation.   Sir,   this   Fascist   and

intimidatory talk of the Prime Minister  of  meeting

force  with force in Singapore, leaves no  room  for

doubt as to his true



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>



nature. There is now, Sir, no more faith in the  Lee

Kuan   Yew  Government.  The  Prime  Minister  talks

contemptuously  of the one man one  vote  system,  a

system  which  brought him to power. Let  me  quote,

Sir,  from his speech to civil servants as  reported

in the Straits Times of the 9th of July, 1962. It is

on page 8, column 6:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Prime Minister said: "The tragedy about the

one-man  one-vote system is that it is often  easier

to raise the bid not knowing or, even worse, knowing

full well that you will never be able to fulfil your

promises, and the higher bidder usually wins.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all new countries, the electorate is

inexperienced, unsophisticated - It  will  vote  for

the  person who says, `I promise you the  moon,  the

sun and the stars'."'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he still believe in the wisdom of the people?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if there is any tragedy in the one-man one-vote system in Singapore, it is that the people have

unwittingly voted in a man who has so little respect

for  the  opinions  of  the common  man.  The  Prime

Minister is already killing parliamentary democracy,

and  on  the day this sham, dishonest referendum  is

held-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That day your lies may-



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b>- democracy in Singapore will

officially be pronounced dead-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Officially?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Because on that day, freedom

will  have  been  taken  away  from  the  people  of

Singapore. There is no free expression of  views  in

Singapore today, Sir. There is even this clamp  down

of  news  from the Opposition Parties and  on  other

political   Parties  outside  who  try  to   express

opposition  to  the  Government's Fascist  measures.

Unionists, journalists and University students  have

all   come   out  openly  to  protest  against   the

undemocratic measures of the Government that further

and  further limit individual freedom.  I  will  not

enlarge  on that, Sir. Suffice it to say  that  this

alone  goes  to  prove that it is not the  so-called

Communists  that  are killing democracy,  but  these

Fascists masquerading as democrats who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>



are killing parliamentary democracy in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us now try and find out the reason why

the  selfish  P.A.P. Ministers have  got  themselves

into such a sorry plight. They would like to ascribe

all  this  to the Communist bogey, but that  is  not

true.  Why  then  are the people  against  the  P.A.P.

Government  today?  I have already  indicated,  Sir,

that it is the P.A.P. that have destroyed the P.A.P.

How,  you  may  ask?  Sir, the fact  is  the  P.A.P.

leaders  are  the  greatest political  bluffers  and

opportunists in Singapore history and, as such, they

are  opportunists  of  the first  order,  completely

without  scruples and without principles of  decency

and  fair play. I do not wish to open up old scores,

Sir,  but there are strong rumours current  in  town

that the P.A.P. leaders are not completely free from

political  guilt  in  the dirty political  purge  of

1956, although such political dirty work was carried

out   entirely  by  the  reactionary  Lim  Yew  Hock

Government. You see, Sir, our Ministers  have  posed

as Leftists for a long time and have managed to pose

as  Leftists  because the genuine Left-wing  leaders

have been prevented from performing their legitimate

role  as  a  result of political repression.  It  is

because  they had posed so successfully and well  as

the  Left that they were voted into office and power

in  1959. However, it is much easier to pose as  the

Left  than  to  be  Left, and then  when  they  were

exposed  as humbugs and shams, they began  to  fight

their  own comrades and colleagues in order to  keep

up  the  pretence and humbug and in  order  to  keep

themselves  in  office. I say, Sir,  these  are  the

ruthless opportunists who tenaciously hold on to the

reins  of government in spite of the fact that  they

have been completely discredited and in spite of the

fact  that they are no more supported by the people.

We  realise they always have their plausible set  of

rationalisations   and  justifications   for   their

opportunistic  act  of  perfidy  to  the  people  of

Singapore.  Sir,  these  are  the  so-called  social

democrats  who, because if their numerous somersault

distortions and disreputable public utterances, have

become a discredit to true democrats. They say, Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>



that they love the beautiful system of parliamentary

democracy. But the Prime Minister has just come  out

openly to say that the one man one vote system is  a

tragedy  in the context of Singapore. They say  they

are  democrats,  but they claim that  democracy  can

only   be  saved  by  dishonest,  undemocratic   and

dictatorial  methods.  They  say  they  cherish  the

freedom of the Press, but the Press is subjected  to

such  tight  control  that  there  is  already   one

newspaper, the Min Pao, that has been compelled  to

suspend publication indefinitely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, Sir, newspaper space for Opposition

Members on whatever they say in this House has  been

cut  down  to  less than one-third;  two-thirds  of

newspaper  space  must  be reserved  for  Government

Benches. For example, Sir, yesterday when the Member

for  Thomson moved his motion and later on when  the

Minister for Home Affairs replied, one full page was

given  to  the  speech  by  the  Minister  for  Home

Affairs,  and  only a scraggy couple of columns - less

than  a  couple of columns - I do not think  it  could

even  be  a  column, in some corner,  Sir,  for  the

Member for Thomson. This is a disgraceful method  of

pressure  on  the  Press.  They  say  they  are  not

Fascists  and  that  they  allow  people  to  freely

express  their views and opinions. Yet when a  group

of trade unions got together to hold a convention in

connexion  with  the referendum, the unionists  were

prohibited  from  holding  the  meeting   and   from

expressing  their  views. More recently,  they  also

barred  the  Council of Joint Action from conducting

its  lawful  and constitutional campaign or  protest

against  the  dishonesty  and  dictatorship  of  the

P.A.P. by holding rallies and conventions in  order

that  its  views  on the merger  issue  and  on  the

referendum might be communicated to the people. They

say they allow the people of Singapore the final say

on  the  future of Singapore and on the question  of

merger.  But  in  the  forthcoming  referendum,  the

people  will  not  be allowed  to  say  'no'  to  the

alternatives offered to them. They are  only  P.A.P.

alternatives foisted on the people-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must remind the hon. Member

that  those alternatives have been approved by  this

Assembly. Therefore, there is a vote of the Assembly

approving the alternatives and there cannot  be  any

reflection on any vote of the Assembly no matter how

much the Member might dislike it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is one of the defects,

Sir, -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That you cannot vote it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Just because they have been

approved by the majority -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> So what?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We are not even allowed to

criticise-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I thought the Member for

Queenstown   was   a   champion   of   parliamentary

democracy.   The  Speaker  is  here  to   see   that

parliamentary  democracy, at least in this  Chamber,

is  upheld and one of the rules is that no  vote  of

the Assembly can be reflected upon by any Member.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will observe your guidance,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Rule.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Anyway, the P.A.P. Ministers

call  themselves  socialists at one time.  Nowadays,

they  dare  not use the word "socialist"  any  more.

They call themselves nationalists. But by their very

actions,  they have shown themselves neither  to  be

socialists nor nationalists-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Communists.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But they have shown themselves

to be national socialists-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We heard that yesterday, you

know.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - national socialists of the

Hitler  type.  They do not like to hear  it  because

they are the exact replica today in Singapore of the

Nazis in Germany.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to emphasise, and I take it that it is

no  exaggeration  so to say, that all  along  public

confidence in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>



present  P.A.P. Government has hinged on the  public

standing  of  three  individuals.  I  have   already

indicated to you. They are the Prime Minister  as  a

lawyer, the Minister for Finance as an economist and

administrator,  and the Minister for  Culture  as  a

Goebbels  propagandist, and all three of  them  have

been  thoroughly discredited. These three, Sir,  the

triumvirate of the P.A.P., have now decided to  wear

a cross-



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Cross? They are not Christians.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> They have now turned themselves

into anti-Communist crusaders

a la McCarthy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Oh, alamak!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> a la McCarthy. Their historical

mission, so they keep repeating, is exactly this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> You need baggy trousers and a top hat!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Not with a marble skull! They

want to fight the supposed Communist enemies and the

supposed  Communist sympathisers to the finish.  And

towards  this end they have plotted and  slept  with

Machiavelli,  strained every  sinew,  mobilised  all

available  forces whatever they may  be,  both  from

their  side  as well as this side of the House,  and

used all the most dictatorial and Fascist means  and

methods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore have seen the proponents

of  this negative philosophy of anti-Communism,  and

have  seen  how  the P.A.P. have racked  their  evil

genius for excuses and distortions in order to cling

on  to power. As I have indicated earlier, Sir, they

have, and they know this full well, lost the support

of  the people. The rank and file of the P.A.P. have

been  so  depleted that the P.A.P. today is no  more

than  an  empty shell. And they have no organisation

and  hardly any cadres to speak of. They  know  full

well that they have no more moral authority to carry

on as a Government. Yet these self-same men who hold

power  have taken upon themselves to tell the people

of Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>



what  their constitutional future  should  be.

Simply  because the P.A.P. leaders say,  with  their

usual arrogance, that they know what is best for the

people  of Singapore. As long as the P.A.P. leaders

say  that,  then  the  P.A.P. maintain  that  it  is

correct  and  that  the  future  of  the  people  of

Singapore must be good. They imagine only the P.A.P.

know  what is best for the people of Singapore!  And

it  is  because of that, I suppose, that they thrust

this  sham referendum on the people. And it  may  be

because  of  that  that they  have  decided  on  the

questions for the people. Without any reflection  on

this  House, Sir, those were the questions that were

acceptable only to the P.A.P., not to the people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask how crooked our Singapore

politicians can become.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> That is you.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I am surprised at the Deputy

Prime  Minister interjecting, Sir, I would  like  to

ask  him  whether he was elected by  the  people  of

Singapore  in Rochore or whether he was  elected  in

Kuala Kangsar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> In Rochore or Rochore Canal?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Taiping.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I am not sure whether it was

Rochore or Rochore Canal, Sir. Possibly it might-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Let us try and stop being

abusive.  A repartee is quite all right if  it  does

not go over the border.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I would urge our Ministers

opposite to remember that they were elected  by  the

people of Singapore and I would urge them always  to

place the interests of the people of Singapore above

everything else. They say now that they do not  want

to  vacate their cushy jobs and their seats of power

because  they  believe they are the  chosen  people,

destined   to  fulfil  their  so-called   historical

mission  of  merger and Malaysia. And if their  ways

happen  to  be  undemocratic - so  the  Minister   for

Finance said - these undemocratic and drastic ways are

necessary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>



because of the Communists! They can become Fascists.

They  can  be  most undemocratic and most  dishonest

because of the Communists! Can we trust such  people

to  look  after  the  interests  of  the  people  of

Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we sincerely believe that Singapore can no

longer  allow  this  dangerous  political  trend  to

continue.  Otherwise from a sophisticated  Singapore

version  of Syngman Rhee, Ngo Dinh Diem, and  Chiang

Kai-shek,  we might get a more noxious variation  of

these  abhorrent dictators. We do not want  that  to

happen.  We have a duty to stop that from happening.

And  I urge all representatives in this House to see

that this does not happen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we in the Barisan Sosialis say that it is

suicidal  to  leave the future and  destiny  of  our

people  in the hands of the leaders of this minority

Government.  No one could have trust and  confidence

in  such  leaders  of this minority  Government  any

longer.  As  a  minority Government that  refuse  to

budge  from  their cushy seats of power  after  they

have  lost  the  support of the people,  the  P.A.P.

Government  today  cannot be  expected  to  have  any

consideration for political principles and  for  the

normal  standards of decency and fair play. It  will

be  the  people of Singapore who will suffer at  the

hands   of  this  minority  Government  if  such   a

dictatorial  minority  Government  is   allowed   to

continue in office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the current series of debates in this

House, the people of Singapore have been treated  to

a  fantastic exhibition of twists and turns  of  the

P.A.P. leaders.  It was a beautiful  exhibition  of

somersaults,  malicious  distortions  and  malicious

falsehoods  on  the  part of the P.A.P.  There  were

dishonest attempts to maliciously distort the  stand

of the Opposition on merger.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Of the Barisan Sosialis, not the

Opposition.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We saw how a general Referendum

Bill  had  been  changed into a specific  Referendum

Bill  almost  overnight.  And  now  this  so-called

general Referendum Bill will even



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>



have to be scrapped immediately after the dirty work

has been done. There were also dishonest attempts to

make political capital out of our original intention

of  not  wanting  to  reveal  the  contents  of  the

exchange  of  letters between our Secretary-General,

Mr  Lim  Ching  Siong, and the Tunku.  Now,  the

P.A.P. have  to eat their own words and  their  own

mischievous  distortions. They want  the  people  to

believe that today, although their own comrades have

broken  away from them in large numbers, the  P.A.P.

Ministers   are  still  gaining  new  admirers   and

supporters  with each passing day. This, of  course,

is a fond hope which they themselves know will never

be  realised. Many are surprised at the thickness of

the   skin  of  the  P.A.P.  Ministers.  I  am   not

surprised,  Sir,  this  is the  only  way  left  for

them - i.e. to have a thick skin. [Interruption]  I am

a  medical  man - I should know, Sir, how thick  their

skin is.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> You have cow-hide!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> After defeats in two by-elections, if they had any sense of decency, they

would   have  considered  it  highly  improper   and

immoral, not to have gone hack to the people  for  a

fresh mandate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, on a point of

elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> He can have plenty of

opportunities later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the P.A.P. leaders appear, as you will gather

from the remarks of the Deputy Prime Minister, to be

of a different kettle of fish.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Ikan bills!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> They still talk of the mandate

they  received from the people three  years  ago  in

spite  of  the fact that I have repeatedly explained

to  the House that the P.A.P. never had a mandate on

merger  in  the  1959 general elections.  Today  the

P.A.P. can  no  longer claim  to  have  any  right,

constitutionally  and morally,  to  carry  on  as  a

Government. Not only are they a minority  Government

but  in  each of the constituencies of the Ministers

and the other P.A.P. Assemblymen, it will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>



be  found  that  there is no more  support  for  the

P.A.P.  There are no more safe seats today  for  the

P.A.P.  Ministers. The chances are that  should  the

Ministers go back to their respective constituencies

in  a general election, most of them will lose their

deposits. A Gallup poll in Tanjong Pagar should tell

the  Prime Minister what chances he will have if  he

should  dare go back to Tanjong Pagar. My  guess  is

that the Prime Minister will lose his deposit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we see that though the P.A.P. had the support of

the  majority of the people in 1959, they no  longer

have  that  support  today. The  P.A.P. bank  their

precarious  existence only on the simple calculation

that the U.M.N.O. and the S.P.A. cannot just as  yet

dispense  with the P.A.P. Government. The S.P.A. in

all  their  somersaults want to give the P.A.P. all

necessary  support at the present  moment  in  order

that they may capitalise on the unstable status quo.

At  the  same  time,  all of  us  realise  that  the

Opposition  Parties  are divided both  ideologically

and in our immediate objectives.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is right.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And it does look as if there is

as yet no common issue that can unite the Opposition

Parties  to  bring the P.A.P. Government  down.  The

only unfortunate thing about this P.A.P. calculation

is  that they cannot any longer put up a pretence of

being  non-Communists. If the P.A.P. really  adopted

an   independent  line  as  was  proclaimed  by  the

Ministers in the past, then it would be difficult to

see  how  the P.A.P. should accept the prop  of  the

Right-wing  reactionaries today,  forces  which  the

Prime   Minister  used  to  deride  as   inert   and

ineffective two years ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, Sir, to quote a small paragraph here

of  what the Prime Minister himself said on the 12th

September,  1957.  May I refer  you,  Sir, to  col.

2604?  I  do not wish to quote too big a paragraph.

Sir - he  was talking about the fight to the Left,  to

the Right, and how he was trying to keep a tightrope

balance right through. He said:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>



(it is the last sentence of the second paragraph)-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`But in this fight we shall not make the mistake

of allying ourselves with so-called anti-Communist

forces which are often cloaks to hide reactionary

elements ranging from colonial vested interests to

enemies of democracy.



<br><br>Brave,  inspiring  words, Sir, I have  informed  the

Prime Minister before that I admired the way he  was

going  about  his political work. And I admired  him

very  much  at that time, Sir, It is so  unfortunate

that he has changed so completely today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the P.A.P. will have to rely on any force,

because  they are no longer thinking of the  people:

they are thinking only of themselves. The cards  are

all on the table - face upwards. We know the U.M.N.O.

will  support any government that helps  to  further

the realisation of the Malaysia plan. But as regards

the  S.P.A., all Singapore know how they somersault,

and  their  policies  are beyond comprehension.  The

Member  for  Cairnhill  said that  the  blank  paper

clause  is undemocratic and dishonest, and he  voted

against the clause in Select Committee, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It seems to me now that we are

having  a debate on the S.P.A. There is a motion  of

no  confidence in the Government. I do not think  we

can have a debate on the S.P.A.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> We are not the

Government yet!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I bring in the S.P.A., Sir,

only  in relation to the support that they can  give

to the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, that, of course, is quite

legitimate.  But when the hon. Member  goes  further

and  talks about a somersault. I do not know whether

he  means  somersaulting across the  Floor  of  this

Chamber.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I want to say only this, Sir.

Although  the S.P.A. keep on saying that the  P.A.P.

is  dead,  every  time the P.A.P. ghost  moves,  the

Member  for  Cairnhill gets up to salute the  ghost.

Everybody  in  town  knows that  it  is  the  S.P.A.

support for the P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>



that  keeps the P.A.P. alive today. The Prime Minister

himself will have to admit that. That is why he dare

not  even  attack the S.P.A. Members  nowadays.  The

P.A.P. are completely mum. There is a blackout.  To

the  P.A.P., the S.P.A. are now no more  effete  and

ineffective!  They  are now the Grand  Alliance! I

would suggest to the S.P.A. - especially the S.P.A.,

Sir, since the U.M.N.O. have their interest bound up

with  the  Malaysia  plan - that  if  they  have   the

interest of the people at heart, now is the time for

them  to  show  it,  by knocking out  this  minority

P.A.P.  Government which is at its last  gasp.  They

should  not allow a dishonest Government to continue

to  perpetrate  a fraud on the people of  Singapore,

because never before in history has there been  such

a  minority  Government that clings on to  power  so

desperately   without   constitutional   and   moral

justification. The P.A.P. Government  is  not  loyal

and  sincere  to the true wishes and aspirations  of

the  people  of Singapore, because, at  the  present

moment, the P.A.P. leaders are only thinking of  their

own  interests. The future of Singapore  is  at  the

crossroads.  The P.A.P. have committed the  future  of

our  people to forces outside Singapore, without our

consent,  and  against the collective  will  of  the

people.  This is the P.A.P. sell-out. One extra  day

of  the  P.A.P.'s existence and P.A.P. misrule  will

mean one extra day of unhappiness for the people  of

Singapore.  As the P.A.P. no longer have a  majority

in the House, it is our duty as Parliamentarians and

representatives of the people of Singapore  to  take

the   necessary  stand  and  action  to  compel  the

minority Government to go back to the people. We  in

the  Barisan Sosialis believe that there is no other

alternative  before the country than to compel  this

discredited  and  dishonest minority  Government  to

resign.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

You should have resigned yourself!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> To summarise, the P.A.P. today

have,  because of their selfish interests,  deviated

from their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>



original    stand   of   democratic    non-Communist

socialism.  They  are now dishonest and  dictatorial

and  have  lost  the support of the masses.  In  the

words of the Prime Minister himself, the P.A.P. have

destroyed the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Five-Year Plan, which is also known as "The

Tasks  Ahead", represents the mandate that was given

to  the  P.A.P. in the 1959 general elections.  All

those  promises  in the Five-Year Plan   "The  Tasks

Ahead"  - have  been forgotten, and all  because  of

what?  It is because the Prime Minister thinks  that

by  playing about with merger, he could distract the

people's attention from the promises which  he  gave

to  the  people of Singapore. At the present moment,

Sir,  the Government is not a Government run by  the

elected  representatives of  the  people.  It  is  a

Government which is self-running. The civil servants

run  the  Government,  Sir, It makes  no  difference

whether the P.A.P. Government is there or not.  They

have  lost already all justification to remain as  a

Government.  There  is  no Government  in  Singapore

today  truly  run  by  the elected  leaders  of  the

people. The Prime Minister had said a few years  ago

that  if  we  want  to run a democracy  and  a  good

government,  we must have the people  on  our  side.

Today  we  cannot  allow  the  Government  that  has

already  lost the support of the masses  to  pretend

that it still is a respected elected government.  We

cannot  also allow the vicious communal line of  the

P.A.P. propaganda, under the cloak of nationalism in

the  controversy of the merger issue,  to  continue.

This  is  a  very dangerous drift which  the  P.A.P.

communalists must stop. One of the ways of  stopping

this  is to stop them as a Government because  today

they  have all the facilities of propaganda in their

hands.  They are the people who can stir up communal

feelings. I will not go much further, Sir, except to

say  that we must hold a general election so that  a

new government may be formed that can really have  a

new  mandate to continue our constitutional struggle

ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> S.P.A. Alliance!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Let us truly put the happiness

and the national interests



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>



of  the  people above sectional and party interests.

Let us do our duty to the people and get rid of this

lousy,   dishonest,  untrustworthy  and  dictatorial

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before closing, Sir, let me quote one small

paragraph of what the Deputy Prime Minister  himself

said  last  year. May I refer you, Sir, to  Hansard,

Vol.  14,  No. 13 of 22nd February, 1961, in  column

1029. It is somewhere in the middle, Sir, I think it

is  a  very good quotation because the Deputy  Prime

Minister had always given us indication before  that

if  the  P.A.P. Government had no support  from  the

people,  he would not like the Government  to  carry

on.  I  am  sure he will remember the time  when  he

said,  "I  would rather stop now than having  stones

thrown at me."



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Let us hear the quote.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> "Let us hear the quote?" I will

quote.  He was talking on the motion on Algeria.  In

column 1029, the Deputy Prime Minister said, in  the

last  paragraph - it is a very interesting  paragraph,

Sir, I  think  it deserves mention, especially  now

that the Deputy Prime Minister is here:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`During the period of the Rendel Constitution in

1956, the first Merdeka talks were held. Mr  David

Marshall,  then  Chief Minister,  led  an  all-Parts

delegation to London. Our representatives  at  those

talks  were the Secretary-General of the Party,  Mr

Lee  Kuan  Yew. Mr Lim Ching Siong and Inche  Ahmad

bin  Ibrahim. Let me remind the Member for Cairnhill

that  nothing came out of those constitutional talks

under  the  leadership of David Marshall.  In  1957,

following  the  resignation and  collapse  of  David

Marshall,   Mr  Lim  Yew  Hock,  now   Member   for

Cairnhill, became Chief Minister, and he in turn led

a second round of talks in London.'



<br><br>Now, these are the interesting words, Sir. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`However, let us be quite honest-'



<br><br>I hope the Deputy Prime Minister will be honest this

time -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`about how the trend of those talks was carried

out; who provided the mass base, the mass support,

so that the 1957 talks could be  successful, and so

that a new Constitution could be  drafted out which

would give complete internal self-government to Singapore.'





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>



Now in Singapore the mass base is no more supporting

the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> That is not my quotation, is

it?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You see, the Deputy Prime

Minister has forgotten the words that he said. It is

only  one year ago. How quickly people change! Their

memories are very short. May I carry on, Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is not the achievements of those - meaning the

Member for Cairnhill and his colleagues - who were  in

the  Government at that time. It was an  achievement

of the people of Singapore, of the masses -'



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Beautiful!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`---who had confidence in the P.A.P. that confidence

had  been very ably demonstrated in the City Council

election and in the general elections in 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. cannot claim that by itself it will

lead Singapore to complete independence unless it is

also supported by the masses.'



<br><br>Now  today, Sir, the P.A.P. have not got the support

of  the  masses. They dare not even hold a rally  to

meet the masses.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> That is what you say.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But the most significant few

lines which I want to quote today, Sir, is this.  It

is somewhere in the middle. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`However, the Constitution has promised [and I

hope  he will not eat his words] that in 1963, there

will  be   a review of the Constitution, and  we  are

determined to see that that clause is honoured.'



<br><br>"determined to see that that clause is honoured"!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know how the hon.

Member  for  Queenstown  gets  those  inflexions.  I

cannot see them in the Hansard. I am sure the Deputy

Prime  Minister never said those words in that  tone

of voice.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You see, Sir, our Deputy Prime

Minister said those words, and he said that he would

he  determined to see that that clause is  honoured.

which means that in 1963, there will be  a review  of

the Constitution.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Earlier.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> See how they have twisted, see

how  they  have turned! I only wish, Sir,  that  the

Deputy  Prime  Minister could really honour  truth

and honour promises. I said before, Sir, that  I

thought that the Deputy Prime Minister, because  of

his scientific training, would at least see truth as

truth  should be  seen and not distorted versions  of

things.  But  I  see  now that he  is  completely

infected-



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> By whom?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - and that he has already lost

all sense of decency and fair play.

rabbits.

skulls remember it.

ears.  Sir, as I said, the S.P.A./U.M.N.O.  Alliance

express  no confidence in the Government in that  it

has   failed  to  discharge  its  sacred  duty   of

protecting the internal security of Singapore by not

restraining  known Communist and Communist-front

leaders    from    manipulating   and    controlling

organisations like the Barisan Sosialis -



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands):</b> Alamak!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - thus endangering the well-being of the people of Singapore. Sir, my colleague

has been rather taken aback by my naming the Barisan

Sosialis.   I   think  he  said  "alamak mati"?

[Laughter].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Queenstown said a la

McCarthy,   but  may  I  say  "alamak mati"?

[Laughter].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now propose to move an amendment to this

motion, but I would like first to seek your guidance

as to whether or not my amendment is in order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Amendment handed in,

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The amendment reads as follows:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At end, to add:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'in that it has failed to discharge its sacred duty of protecting the internal

<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I received enthusiastic support from the

Member  for  Anson before he heard me  out,  but

after  I said that I had tried to nail the crime

of  the  Government in that it has  endangered

the  well-being of the people of Singapore  by

not  discharging  its sacred  duty, there  was

some silence. I trust, Sir, that the Member  for

Anson,  who  is  a great fighter  against  these

Communist   pests,  will  fight   shoulder   to

shoulder  with  me in ridding Singapore  of  the

menace   of  Communist  subversion.  Communist

penetration into organisations like the  Barisan

Sosialis  in  damaging  the  well-being  of  the

people  of Singapore. The leader of the Barisan

said  he could not find common cause. In  fact,

he  appealed to this House, "Let us  sink  party

differences  and  serve the  interests  of  the

people  of Singapore." I call on them,  "Let  us

serve  the interests of the people of Singapore,

sink all party differences. Let us show that  at

least  we have one common cause and that  is  to

protect   the  interests  of  Singapore   from

Communist  subversion."  That  is  the   common

cause, if  the Barisan Sosialis want  a  common

cause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown, in moving his

motion,  gave a very long account of  what  his

Party  saw  wrong in the P.A.P. All  I  can  say

here  at  this time is this: The pot is calling

the  kettle  black. They were on that  side  of

the  House less than a year ago and they  were

the people who, together with the remnants  of

the  P.A.P., perpetrate - the crimes that he now

- says the P.A.P. did. The Barisan Sosialis  are

just as guilty, If they say the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>





P.A.P  is guilty, of what they have done  to  the

people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us examine the charge sheet of the

leader  of  the Barisan Sosialis when he  makes  his

indictment of the P.A.P. I have a few listed here  and

what  I  have, read like this: Three years of P.A.P.

misrule will be recorded in history. Yes. The Barisan

Sosialis were there, so the misrule includes  the

Barisan Sosialis arrogance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we who have been in the Opposition ever

since  there were 43 Members in the P.A.P. did touch

on this arrogance of the P.A.P. They kept on crowing,

and crowing like a cock every  day,  but

like  the cock their throats may be  slit  in  due

course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, arrogance they enjoyed. The Barisan Sosialis,

when they were on the other side of the House, also

indulged in arrogance against  the   Opposition, and we had been bearing the brunt of

it  for three years. We got it bad, but we did  not

feel   hurt,  because,  after   all, Sir, arrogance has been  practised  by the P.A.P. against their opponents.  It

is  aimed at their political opponents. It  is

not  a  crime that has damaged the well-being  of

the people of Singapore. We can take it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrogance was indulged in by a number of

Ministers,  Parliamentary  Secretaries  and   Back-benchers,

although the P.A.P. claim that they have a

Ministry  of  Culture.  Arrogance  is  a   sort   of

personal  vice that can only be found in  a  person

who lacks culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I was a little boy in school. I was

attracted  by one short verse. I think  it  was  by

Longfellow, and it reads like this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He who is down need fear no fall,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He who is low no pride;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He who is humble ever shall



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have God to be his guide,"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because of the arrogance of the

P.A.P. that even the gods frowned on them and showed

their  displeasure  by causing a water  shortage  in

Singapore. [Laughter]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government Front-benches do not believe

in God, but if I remember



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>



rightly,  it was the Prime Minister who said,  "Only

God can save us."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He never said that.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> A water shortage that was never

heard of in the history of Singapore happened at the

time  when  the P.A.P. was the Government.  We  have

not  got out of the threat of a water shortage  yet.

Maybe  the gods have been a bit kinder today because

the  P.A.P. saw the error of their ways and have got

rid  of  their Communist sleeping partners. May  the

gods  be a bit kinder to them when they do discharge

their sacred duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us go back to the charge sheet of the

Barisan  Sosialis.  Dishonesty - both  are  dishonest.

Party  considerations above national  interests - both

come  from  the  same school and practise  the  same

things. Sell-out of the interests of Singapore. Now,

what  is  this sell-out? A sell-out of the interests

of  Singapore by doing their best to achieve  merger

to  serve  the interests of Singapore; or a sell-out

of   the  interests  of  Singapore  by  the  Barisan

Sosialis to the Communist cause. I do not know  when

the  sell-out ends. Sell-out to achieve  merger, as

the  end result, will mean prosperity, happiness and

security  for the people of Singapore;  whereas  the

sell-out  of  the Barisan Sosialis to the  Communist

cause will bring misery, despair and hardship to the

people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the Barisan Sosialis said earlier - I

think  he  used the word "destined" twice - that  the

P.A.P. was destined to have a brilliant future. I do

not  think  the P.A.P. could be destined to  have  a

brilliant future. Its symbol is lightning.  It  came

like a flash: it dies like a flash.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the P.A.P. had wanted to have a brilliant

future,  they  should  have  consulted  the  Barisan

Sosialis earlier and have a star-



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is right.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - that could be a brilliant star;

but  this  star of the Barisan Sosialis is  one  of

the  dangerous stars of the Communist group in the

firmament.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> A shooting star! [Laughter]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Another hon. Member:</b> Tell them their horoscope!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Ah, yes. The leader of the

Barisan Sosialis said this - he referred to this, yes,

he  did - "It was indeed a very ridiculous picture in

July  last  year when the P.A.P. with  39 Members  on

their  side  tabled  a motion of  confidence."  What

happened  at that time? Did not the S.P.A../U.M.N.O.

Alliance  then  say, "We have no confidence  in  the

Government."? What did the Barisan Sosialis  do - the

13 bright stars? If then they had meant to pull the

Government down, they could have voted with us,  but

they  abstained. Why did they abstain then, but want

to  do  it  now? Why did they abstain then when  the

opportunity  was given to them? Was it because  they

had not received fresh orders yet? Or was it because

they were caught unawares and they did not know what

to  do?  If  they  really had no confidence  in  the

Government and I am sure they had not if one were to

believe  the  lengthy  speech  of  the  Member   for

Queenstown when he recited the crimes of the  P.A.P.

for the past three years - then why did the 13 bright

stars in the Barisan Sosialis abstain? Why did they

not  vote with us against the Government and express

no confidence in it? They did not do it. And now, it

seems  funny, they  have  tabled  a  motion  of  no

confidence. Why? From the long speech of the  Member

for  Queenstown, it is clear that they kept on their

fight  wanting to wreck referendum and merger  every

step of the way - from the merger debate in November

to  the debate on the motion by the Member for Anson

for  a  referendum  to be held, through  the  Second

Reading of the National Referendum Bill right up  to

the  Committee Stage and still right up to the Third

Reading;  and  still  further they  kept  on  going.

During  this series of sittings, every day we  heard

nothing  from them but a disclosure of their  desire

to  wreck the merger referendum. Even now their  aim

in  tabling this motion is just to try their best to

put a halt to the carrying



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>



out  of  the  merger referendum - to call  a  halt  to

merger  and  Malaysia.  Are  we,  as  a  responsible

Opposition, going to be misled by them into creating

trouble, into creating chaos for the country?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They want a common cause, Sir, I will show them

this common cause: vote with us, that the Government

has   failed  to  discharge  its  sacred   duty   of

protecting the internal security of Singapore by not

restraining   known  Communist  and  Communist-front

leaders    from    manipulating   and    controlling

organisations  like the Barisan  Sosialis  and  thus

endangering   the  well-being  of  the   people   of

Singapore.  Vote  with us and  pull  the  Government

down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A common cause. Nothing from them. Perhaps they

will be waiting for further orders when they go  out

later  on.  They want a common cause: we have  given

them  a  common cause. But we will not have a common

cause with them to wreck merger. [Interruption]



<br><br><!--Mr John Mammen(Deputy Speaker)-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Mammen):</b> Order.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, it is only those who are

capable  of dishonesty who see dishonesty in  almost

every move of everybody else. I have shown the  Bansan   Sosialis  a  common  cause.  Let  us  put  the

interests of the country first and foremost. Let  us

forget the interests of our Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis leader, the Member for

Queenstown, has said that the Government  will  have

the  support of the S.P.A./U.M.N.O. Let the  Barisan

Sosialis not give their support to the Government in

voting  on my amendment. Who knows? They gave  their

support  in July last year. That was 21st July,  not

13th  July last year. They abstained when  they  had

the  opportunity  then to pull the Government  down.

They did not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us now touch on the speech of the Prime

Minister  yesterday. As usual, he tried to  give  us

his assessment of the security situation up to date.

He  said  that  what is happening  today  follows  a

similar  pattern in 1956 and 1957, and yet he  takes

no action.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Emperor Nero fiddled while Rome burnt. Prime

Minister  Lee plays zugzwang while Singapore  burns.

Sir, the people of Singapore cannot afford  such  a

luxury.  The  threat  is  genuine.  The  threat   is

growing,  so  says the Prime Minister.  And  yet  he

said, "Huh, I have got them in a zugzwang. Huh, they

could  not move." That is not the way to look  after

the internal security and economic well-being of the

people  of Singapore. It is not a game. The  way  is

clear and simple. If I were a medical man and if you

had a bad leg, I would advise you to chop it off. So

if  you  have bad Communists and bad Communist-front

leaders in the political arena in Singapore, use the

guillotine  on  them.  I hope when  the  12  o'clock

guillotine falls tonight, it will spell the doom  of

those  who are so foolish as to be  led by the  known

communists and Communist-front leaders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in fact, the Prime Minister laughed at me and

said,  "Ah, look at them, the foolish Lim  Yew  Hock

Government!  I  was on the other side  planning  the

game of zugzwang and he got caught." And he said,  I

am  not  going to get caught like this poor  foolish

Lim Yew Hock!"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not solve the situation, because there

were  men  then who were prepared to work  with  the

Communists to achieve their own political ends.  The

action I took could be said to be  not enough.  There

were  still  a  number  of pockets  left  untouched,

because then I still was a democratic animal. But if

I had known that there was going to be that group of

P.A.P.  leaders  who are still in  the  P.A.P. now,

still  working with them and planning with them  the

general  elections were a great success for them  in

1959  I would not have hesitated. And if I had known

then that the Prime Minister was consorting with the

person  he called "The Plen". I would have sent  him

to  keep Lim Ching Siong company in gaol, so that he

could  at  least have some re-thinking as Devan  Nair

had, re-thinking to some good purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wise after the event, Sir, but it is all right. So

long as one gets wise after the facts are known.  As

the P.A.P. says, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>



should  get wise after the facts are known.  I  hope

they will be wiser after his debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister is still in a stalemate.

He  does not believe that the only way to check  the

danger  is  to  withdraw the source  of  danger.  He

believes  in playing a game of chess, and in  trying

to sell his idea of his own particular form of game,

he  has  made  12  awful disclosures  through  Radio

Singapore, now  enshrined in what he  describes  as

"The  Battle  for Merger". This book  contains  many

awful  disclosures, but what is more relevant to  my

amendment  is  that  a number of persons  have  been

named as Communists and Communist-front leaders.  It

has   described  the  Barisan  Sosialis   as   being

manipulated  and controlled by the Communists.  This

is  evidence produced by the Government. Because  of

the evidence here, which has not been refuted by the

Barisan  Sosialis.  I  have seen  fit  to  table  an

amendment to name the Barisan Sosialis as one of the

organisations   that  are  being   manipulated   and

controlled  by subversive forces. I do not  know  it

myself because I am not in the Government, but I  am

prepared  to  accept the word of our Prime  Minister

when  he  said  that the Barisan Sosialis  is  being

controlled  and  manipulated by the  Communists.  He

even  went  to  the extent of making a  few awful,

disclosures   about  the  Members  of  the   Barisan

Sosialis.  If  I  may seek your indulgence,  Sir, I

would  like to quote from this great masterpiece  of

the  Prime  Minister who has seen fit  to  say  that

Communist and Communist-front leaders should receive

honourable   mention  in  the  book  and   also   in

broadcasts over Radio Singapore. I believe the  only

way  to give them honourable mention is to put  them

in  Changi, but he believes otherwise. He gives them

an  honourable place even in a book which  is  being

sold at one dollar. He gives them honourable mention

over  Radio Singapore. He has one interesting  thing

to  say about the leader of the Barisan Sosialis.  I

quote  from  page  95  at the  bottom  of  the  last

paragraph:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Yet Dr Lee (that is, the Member for Queenstown)

in   an  interview  reported  in  the  Guardian   on

September 22, stated, "I am not a Communist, and, if

I  became  convinced there were  Communists  in  our

party  I  would  expose  them  and  let  the  people

decide."'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But instead of exposing them, he aided and abetted

them by acting as a courier. In other words, he  was

like a post box for someone from Sarawak. This, Sir,

is  in  direct contradiction of an earlier statement

by the Prime Minister in an earlier disclosure. That

can be  found at page 73, second paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They used Dr Lee Siew Choh as the front leader of

this group. Dr Lee had told Dr Goh and me that he

was convinced that so long as the British bases were

left  untouched, it would be perfectly all right  to

run   a   pro-Communist  government  with  Communist

support in Singapore."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this has not been denied or challenged by the

Member for Queenstown. In fact, he could have taken

the Prime Minister to court on this. But he did not.

So  what is the conclusion to be arrived at  by  any

one,  any  third  party or any disinterested  party,

that what the Prime Minister said was the truth  and

nothing but the truth?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, so in a simple paragraph, you know the mind

of  the Member for Queenstown, why he is standing up

in  this  Assembly talking so much and  claiming  to

fight  for  the interests of the people of Singapore

when  he  admitted  chat it would be  perfectly  all

right   to  run  a  pro-Communist  government   with

Communist  support in Singapore. And yet I  heard  a

few    interjections   of   "Dishonest, dishonest,

dishonest!"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would ask the Member for Queenstown to be

honest  at  least with himself, if not with  anybody

else.  Be  honest  with himself.  What  game  is  he

playing in this repeated assault on the Government - repeated for 13 days, today is the 13th day - wanting  to pull the Government down when  the  time

for merger and Malaysia-



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Will the Member take a long

time?  I  think we will suspend for tea.  I  suspend

this sitting until half-past five.



<br><br><div align="right"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended at</i></div>

<br><br><div align="center"><i>Sitting resumed at 5.30 p.m.</i></div>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Queenstown tried his very best in his speech to  get

us  away from doing our duty in a responsible manner

by  appealing  to  our emotions. He  said  that  the

Government poked fun at the S.P.A./U.M.N.O. Alliance

with  disparaging  and insulting  remarks.  What  he

meant  to suggest to us was now is the time to  take

our   revenge.  Sir,  as  a  responsible  Opposition

conscious  of the heavy burden that now  falls  upon

us,  since the Government is now a minority of  one,

we  will  not be deterred from even voting with  the

Government on any issues that are meant for the good

of  the people of Singapore, on any issues that will

mean the extermination of the Communist pest. If  we

have  been  insulted  in the past  three  years - the

Barisan Sosialis are not free from blame; when  they

were  there,  they did the same thing; they  are  as

equally  guilty  as  the P.A.P. - must  a  responsible

Opposition  take  note  of such  insults  that  were

heaped upon us? We want to tell the Barisan Sosialis

that  we can take it and take very much more  if  in

taking  it  we  are  guided in the  service  of  the

interests of the people of Singapore. So let me tell

the leader of the Barisan Sosialis that there is  no

need   for   him   to   attempt  to   ridicule   the

S.P.A./U.M.N.O  Alliance so that we  can  be  veered

from doing our duty as a responsive organisation. On

the  one  hand,  the leader of the Barisan  Sosialis

tries to make us feel spiteful and vengeful. On  the

other  hand - in fact, he has repeated this many times

in  his  speech  aimed at the Back  Benches  of  the

Government  he says, "Ah, the Member for Bras  Basah

has  seen the error of her ways and has disowned the

P.A.P. and the Back benches of the Government should

also wake up and disown the P.A.P. before it is  too

late."  I  would  tell  the  Back  benches  of   the

Government, "Now is the time when you have to  prove

your  mettle,  when you have to show your  worth  in

this fight against Communist



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>





perversion,   Communist  subversion  and   Communist

threats.  Let  us show that we are united  and  rout

them from the political life of Singapore."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, the Member for Queenstown said, "Oh,

after the defeat at Hong Lim, the P.A.P. should have

resigned." But, Sir, if the awful disclosures of the

Prime  Minister are to be given credence, and I  see

no  reason why they should not be given credence, it

was the Barisan Sosialis who told the Government not

to  resign  after Hong Lim. It is for them  to  deny

this.  They  were the people who told the Government

not  to  resign after the defeat at Hong  Lim.  They

should  not come to this august Assembly to distorts

facts  and  try to make out that they are  the  true

champions  of democracy when they have been  charged

in  this  book  [Indicating]  that  they  are  being

manipulated   and   controlled  by   Communist   and

Communist-front leaders to damage the  security  and

well-being  of  the  people of  Singapore.  No  one,

especially  we  the Front Benchers here,  will  ever

swallow  any distortion, any threat, any attempt  by

the  Barisan  Sosialis to deter us  from  doing  our

duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And another thing. Sir, they try to ridicule us.

They  say.  "Well, the S.P.A./U.M.N.O. Alliance  are

just  waiting to share in the spoils."  Come,  come,

they  had been sharing in the spoils until they  got

kicked  out,  or they ran away, or until  they  were

found  out  that the plan of the Communists  was  to

capture the P.A.P. Government. We do not want to  go

over  there. We do not have to, Sir. We will  remain

here  against every attempt by the Barisan  Sosialis

to  pull the Government down for Communist purposes.

We will meet that threat; we will fight them, and we

will  challenge  them  any time,  anywhere  even  in

Queenstown. If the Member for Queenstown  wants  to

have  a by-election in Queenstown tomorrow, we  will

meet  them  there,  and prove to the  world  and  to

Singapore  that the people of Singapore are  fed  up

with  Communist  subversion and with  the  so-called

leaders  who are prepared to lend themselves  to  be

made  use  of by Communists for their evil ends.  Do

not talk of general elections. Go to Queenstown,  we

will meet them there!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Queenstown who is a medical

man   tries   to  make  out  that  he  is   also   a

constitutional  expert.  He  says,  "Now  that   the

Government  is  reduced  to  a  minority   of   one,

constitutionally they should resign." The Government

has said, and I say it to him, "Go on, try your best

to   pull   down  the  Government  and   serve   the

Communists,  but  you will find us always  there  to

back  the  government  against Communist  subversion

any  time."  He is not a constitutional  expert, it

could  be   that  his  speech has not  been  properly

vetted  by  people who know how constitutions  work.

Yes,  I say. "The P.A.P. came in with 43 Members  in

1959." Yes, we all know that the P.A.P. came in with 43 Members in 1959; the Barisan Sosialis were there;

the  United People's Party were there and the Member

for Bras Basah was there. On the whole, they did all

they could to try to put an end to a responsible and

effective  Opposition. They ridiculed  us  at  every

stage. They say that the P.A.P. are in the process  of

disintegration  today.  The Communists  have  thrust

upon  me  the responsibility of defending  democracy

against their subversion. The fact that the P.A.P.

are  25  today means that they are stronger,  better

and  cleaner  than  they have  ever  been  when  the

Barisan Sosialis was with them, and I would like  to

pay  tribute  to them that they have fallen  to  the

threats  and  intimidation of the  Communists.  They

have  at  long last wakened to their responsibility.

They  are  not  disintegrating.  They have  cleansed

themselves   and  I  think  they  can  work   harder

now - freer  and  happier - much to the discomfort  of

the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I were to start quoting from this hook.

[Indicating]  it will take a very, very  long  time,

but  as there is a guillotine at 12 midnight. I will

give  every  consideration to  the  Members  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis to state solemnly in this  Chamber

whether  or  not they find common cause with  me  to

pull  the  Government  down  for  having  failed  to

discharge  their  sacred duty of  restraining  known

Communist    and   Communist-front   leaders    from

manipulating and controlling



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>



organisations  like the Barisan  Sosialis.  If  they

want  to find common cause, I offer them that common

cause. We say that that is the biggest crime of  the

Government.  All  the others - arrogance,  dishonesty,

Press intimidation are pin-pricks to be expected  of

political  enemies. These pin-pricks do  not  damage

the  well-being of the people of Singapore.  We  can

take it and we can give it at the same time, but not

when the well-being of the people of Singapore is at

stake, when the Government is fully conscious of the

building up of Communist forces in Singapore to tear

down parliamentary democracy.



<br><br>5.43 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If what the Prime Minister has tried to tell the

people  of  Singapore and the world  is  true,  that

there has been a mounting of Communist forces,  then

this  is  now the hour to put an end to this threat.

Sir,  it  would  be   foolish  on  the  part  of  the

Government - if, as they have admitted, the Communists

are  mounting an onslaught on the democratic  forces

in  Singapore - to allow them time to  build  up  the

organisation.   I  think  it  is  wrong   for   the

Government  to  say. "They make  one  move.  I  make

another  move.  Zugzwang! Ha, ha, ha! The  Communists

are beaten." This is not the way to run the country.

If the Government feel and I know they do feel-

that this Communist threat is genuine-



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> They do not mind it.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> -and if they are sincere in their

new utterances that they will see that the interests

of  the  country  are protected at all  costs,  they

should wake up to the danger that is building up. It

is easier to cripple them now and put an end to them

than   for   the  forces  to  mount  up   in   every

organisation in Singapore whose members,  and  where

even  some of the leaders, are foolish enough to  be

beguiled by them into supporting what they claim  to

be  "defence of the democratic rights of the  people

of Singapore". They are making



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>







use  of this and they are preaching the practice  of

democracy   in  order  to  damage  and   pull   down

democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson was sincere when he said

that he had no confidence in the Government. He  was

sincere. In fact, in July 1961 the Member for  Anson

and the S.P.A./Alliance voted "no confidence" in the

Government. He is sincere. He is honest. But in this

scheme  that  the Communists are now putting  up.  I

would  urge  upon him to reassess the  situation.  I

would  remind him that at the time when he  was  the

Chief  Minister he was a real stalwart of  democracy

and  he  was  prepared  to  fight  all  out  against

Communist  subversion and Communist "plague-carrying

rats".  That  was  what  he  called  them,  "plague-carrying rats".

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Let us try to find out the

reason  that  impelled  the leader  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis to table a motion of no confidence at  this

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Why not?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Not because they want to pull

down the Government because the Government committed

all the crimes alleged by them - they were a party to

those  crimes - but because they want to  stop  merger

and stop the referendum on merger.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Dishonest referendum.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear! hear!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I would appeal to the Member for

Anson, with whom I was fighting shoulder to shoulder

against the Communist threat during the time when he

was   Chief  Minister,  to  remember  that  at  this

particular juncture, when the life and well-being of

the  people of Singapore are being threatened



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>



by the so-called  democrats, in an organisation  that  has

been  proved  to  be manipulated and  controlled  by

Communist  and Communist-front leaders,  not  to  be

misled. He was prepared to fight then, and I know he

will be prepared to fight now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of course, the Member for Anson and the

S.P.A./Alliance   voted   no   confidence   in   the

Government in July, but the other Members not  named

by  me,  abstained. I hope that in this call to  rid

the country of "plague-carrying rats"-

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> -the Opposition will be united to

prove  that the interests of the country  are  above

the  S.P.A./U.M.N.O.,  above the  Barisan  Sosialis,

above  the Workers' Party, and above the U.P.P.  Let

us  prove it. Those who do not prove it, do not  try

to put up the pretence of fighting for democracy, do

not  pretend any more. Today is the day, Friday  the

13th,  and this political event is unfolding  itself

in this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You have had your democracy.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, after this

debate,  it will be clear to the people of Singapore

who are on the side of democracy, in defence against

Communist  subversion, and who  want  to  play  with

fire, in the hope that they may be returned to power

when  the general elections take place. I would  say

to  them, the P.A.P. played that game and got  their

fingers  burnt. That is why today we  have  contempt

for  them. I would suggest that they too should  not

fall  into  the  trap that they say the  P.A.P. has

fallen  into. Let us be  honest. Honesty is something

that  is  a  bit  difficult to measure,  but  it  is

relative.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, what is more important is

this.  Never mind other people's estimation of  what

your  honesty  is. What is more important  is  this,

that  in  your  own estimation you are  honest  with

yourself and honest in the eyes of God.

got to do with this present amendment? What has Chew

Swee Kee got to do with the Communists? in fact,  if

that  money had been given, we would have wiped  out

the Communists.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> May I remind the Members of

the  Opposition, particularly the Barisan  Sosialis,

because  they  moved this motion, that they  should

give  a  fair  chance to other Members to  speak, a

clear hearing of what the other Members have to  say

on this motion, Tun Lim.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, as I say,

Sir,  at the end of this debate, at twelve midnight.

the forces that are against Communist subversion and

the   forces  that  lend  themselves  to   Communist

subversion.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I would not like to talk

too  long, because there are so many Members of  the

Barisan  Sosialis who want to stand up and  say  how

democratic they are and how they are going to see to

it  that Singapore is rid of Communism. In fact, the

Member for Queenstown has said, "If you can prove to

me   that  there  are  Communists  in  the  Barisan

Sosialis,  we  will expose them." I  say  there  are

Communist and Communist-front leaders in the Barisan

Sosialis. I dare him to expose them.



<br><br>5.53 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, Sir, that the motion introduced by the

Barisan  Sosialis  is an attempt  to  discredit  the

S.P.A.,  thinking that the S.P.A. would be so  weak-kneed  as  to  be  frightened by the smear  that  the

Barisan  Sosialis can indulge in by  going  to  the

people  and  saying that the S.P.A. voted  with  the

Government, and that the S.P.A. is afraid of general

elections.  We  know they did. This  motion  is  not

aimed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>





at  the  Government. They know that  the  Government

cannot   fail.   This  motion  is   aimed   at   the

S.P.A./U.M.N.O. Alliance. It is a challenge to us.

We take up that challenge and we challenge them that

if they really mean to pull the Government down, let

them pull the Government down on a common cause. Let

us nail the real crime of the Government. Let us say

that  we express no confidence in the Government  in

that  it has failed to discharge its sacred duty  of

protecting the internal security of Singapore by  not

restraining   known  Communist  and  Communist-front

leaders    from    manipulating   and    controlling

organisations   like  the  Barisan  Sosialis,   thus

endangering   the  well-being  of  the   people   of

Singapore. Those that love Malaya, those  that  love

Singapore,   those  that  are  not   for   Communist

subversion,  should show  themselves  to  be   so  by

their votes on this debate. Anyone who votes against

it.  I  am going to take it from now on that  he  is

fighting  the  Communist cause. I now dare  them  as

they have dared me.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Amen!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original Question was,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House expresses no confidence in the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since which an amendment has been moved, at the end,

to add-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"in that it has failed to discharge its sacred

Singapore  by  not restraining known  communist  and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the words proposed to be

added, be there added."



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> On a point to order, Sir. Mr

Speaker. I think I should clarify our stand  on  the

amendment  moved  by the Member for Cairnhill  first

before we proceed further on the debate. I just wish

to  inform  the  House  that we  do  not  treat  the

amendment as moved by the Member for Cairnhill as  a

vote  of  no  confidence in the Government.  But  we

rather  treat it as what the Opposition  wishes  the

Government to do. In other words, we treat it  as  a

directive to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>



Government,  of  giving  the Government  a  mandate.

Therefore, we will be abstaining from voting on this

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, it is interesting to

watch  the  roaring  lion  of  Cairnhill  inveighing

publicly   against  the  Communists.  Sir,   it   is

perfectly   true   to  say  that  from   our   first

association, he was always willing to co-operate  in

measures  that  were  necessary  to  deal  with  the

Communist  threat.  But when  it  came  to  speaking

against  Communism, Sir, in public, he was  bashful,

and  as a good politician, his advice was I  am

sure  he  would not mind if I tell you this - at  that

time  he  said  to me, "Don't keep on talking  about

anti-Communism.  The people might misunderstand  you

and  think you are anti-Chinese." I am glad to  see,

Sir,  that  today he frankly and openly, in  public,

declares  strongly his anti-Communist stand,  and  I

trust  it  means that he recognises that  today  our

populace and our citizens do distinguish between the

Chinese and the Communists.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I hope.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, the original motion before the

House is a motion to express the deep antagonism  of

the  people  of  Singapore for a lifetime  of  three

years  of  crime  of  the  P.A.P.  The  Member   for

Cairnhill himself recognises that their crimes  have

been  manifold and grievous. I say it is unnecessary

to single out one aspect when there are so many; but

since  he  has seen fit to single out one aspect.  I

want to say to him that I am happy to support him in

his  attack on Communism; I am happy to support  him

in  his attack on the Communists in this area;  for,

Mr Speaker, progress in the democratic process has,

I  think, awakened more and more people to the basic

evil  of Communist dictatorship and its dangers  for

this  territory, an evil that is, if possible - it  is

possible.  Sir - even greater than the evil  of  the

P.A.P. Fascist Government. Sir, insofar as the Prime

Minister  has  alleged that he has  information  and

evidence in respect of persons in Singapore who  are

Communists. I agree with the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>



Cairnhill  in  condemning  him  and  condemning  the

Government for not making that evidence available in

a court of law and for not charging those persons so

that  they  might  be  dealt with.  Sir,  there  are

courts,   and  there  are  laws  against  Communism.

Insofar  as there might be an implication  that  the

P.P.S.O. should be used - I would wish. Sir,  not

to  evade any aspect of this motion; I say  to  you,

the  Member  for Cairnhill knows my  stand;  it  has

always been the same - the P.P.S.O. is a breach in the

rule  of law necessary to meet emergency situations.

It  should be  used in an emergency or to prevent an

emergency, not otherwise. And he knows, having  been

in   association  with  me  in  the  enactment   and

implementation  of this law, that  that  has  always

been  my  stand, not its utilisation  as  a  routine

measure.  Sir, but its utilisation when there  is  a

genuine threat to the security of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it irks indeed, and irks very much, that the

Prime  Minister himself, who of all people  in  this

country  should  know the law  and  should  seek  to

comply  with  the  law, should refrain  from  taking

action   against   known   criminals - such   known

Communists - and  thereby make  himself  an  accessory

after the fact. That he should be  condemned is right

and  proper. Even more, Mr Speaker, it is right and

proper  to  condemn the Government for  using  these

very  men as an excuse for measures endangering  the

welfare,  the harmony and the unity of  our  people,

such as section 29 of the Referendum Ordinance which

was  introduced on the excuse that these people  may

commit  certain  offences. If they could  have  been

dealt  with  by  our  courts,  then  at  least  that

specious excuse would not have been utilised. To the

extent  that  such people have not been charged  for

measures  endangering the welfare of the  people  of

Singapore. I agree with the Member for Cairnhill  in

condemning the Government. But, Sir, I ask  whether.

in fact, the Member for Cairnhill genuinely condemns

the  Government.  You see, Sir, he has  phrased  his

amendment not merely to condemn the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>



Government, not as a vote of no confidence  in  the

Government,  not  as  a  vote  of  censure  on   the

Government,  but also as a vote of  censure  on  the

majority  Party in the Opposition.  It  is,  Sir,  a

double vote of censure.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri:</b> Not by the vote of the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> It is a clever parliamentary trick,

a  red  herring  in  order to prevent  the  vote  of

censure from succeeding, in fact, you have heard the

Deputy  Prime Minister say that in the light of  the

manner  in which the Member for Cairnhill has  moved

his  amendment, they do not consider it to be  a vote

of  censure  at  all. I understood  the  Member  for

Cairnhill to have said, long before the series of 12

radio  talks  on "How I stab my friends and  double-cross   my  colleagues"  was  given  by  the  Prime

Minister,  that he and his Party and his  colleagues

voted   against   a  vote  of  confidence   in   the

Government. Sir, he recognises now, in the words  of

the  Deputy  Prime Minister, that by virtue  of  his

amendment the motion of censure is no longer  deemed

to  be a motion of censure because it is turned upon

the  Barisan  Sosialis. I ask you, Mr Speaker,  are

the words "like the Barisan Sosialis" in this motion

in  any  way  pertinent to the  motion  because,  by

speaking  of  "Communist-front leaders  manipulating

and   controlling   organisations", he   obviously

implies,   in  the  plural,  that  there  are   many

organisations, why then limit it to one, if in  fact

that  is a Communist front organisation and  if,  in

fact,  he seeks to condemn the Government? Why  does

he limit the example to one? Why have any example at

all, Mr Speaker? On what basis does he say that the

Barisan Sosialis are Communist controlled? He  says,

"I  accept the statement of the Prime Minister  that

they  are Communist-controlled." I must confess that

I am surprised, Mr Speaker, that in a matter of the

major  Opposition  Party he  so  lightly  accepts  a

statement of the Government, which has proved itself

politically  dishonest in many  respects,  as  being

evidence  that  the Barisan Sosialis are,  in  fact,

Communist



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>



controlled.  I  say  to you, Mr Speaker, that  the

words   "like  the  Barisan  Sosialis"  are   wholly

unnecessary  to the operative words of  that  motion

and  are  indeed intended to defeat the  motion.  By

seeking  to  ask  the  Barisan Sosialis  to  condemn

themselves,  which  he knows he cannot  do,  because

they   deny   they  are  Communist  controlled,   he

therefore  wants them to vote against the motion  in

order  to  save the Government, whereas  the  S.P.A.

will  vote in favour of the motion. Mr Speaker,  he

rather  let the cat out of the bag when he  appealed

to  me - and I appreciate the appeal, Sir - to recognise

and reassess the position, because to bring down the

Government  would mean an end of the referendum  and

an  end of the immediate negotiation for merger.  So

he  made it known that he does not want to bring the

Government to an end and he does not want a vote  of

no confidence in the Government. This is a bit of an

eyewash.  Roaring to the bushes that he  is  looking

for wars, like Flagstaff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I trust you will permit me - it is incidental and arising out of what the Member for Cairnhill said - to explain my position with reference to this motion of no confidence. I will be very brief, Mr Speaker. I am convinced that the

perfidy of -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I take it the hon. Member is speaking

to  the  amendment. He must confine himself  to  the

amendment.  The hon. Member cannot now go back  to

the original motion. He will have his opportunity. I

take it, i.e. if the guillotine does not fall.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Indeed, Mr Speaker, I will abide by

your   ruling,  if  you  think  I  cannot  make   an

explanation.  I was asked why I wanted  to  vote  in

favour of a censure motion on the Government in the

light  of the fact that it might endanger merger.  I

thought  I would like the opportunity of explaining,

if  you will permit, Sir. It is because of this that

I  believe - it may be I am wrong, Sir; many  disagree

with  me - that the merger proposals as  they  stand,

through  the referendum as it stands, would endanger

the stability of this area in the not distant future

and that if, in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>



fact, they were to fail at the present juncture,  we

would  have  a  permanent basis in  the  foreseeable

future for happy permanent relations. It is a matter

of  temporary postponement and no more. I will go on

from  there, Sir, having, I trust, not taken up  too

much time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Member for Cairnhill - I am

sorry he cannot answer, Sir, but perhaps a Member of

his  Party could - whether it is just at this juncture

to  condemn the Barisan Sosialis on the word of  the

Prime  Minister alone, and whether it is appropriate

at  this juncture to move a double-headed motion  of

censure.  You  know, Sir, there is a phrase  that  I

learned as a small boy about "Slowly, slowly,  catch

monkey" - one thing at a time. Sir, let us  have  this

motion first which deals with the Government. In due

course, if and when the occasion arises and there is

evidence  that  the Barisan Sosialis  are  Communist

controlled, I would be only too happy to support him

in  a  vote  of  no confidence or an analogous  vote

against the Barisan Sosialis themselves. But  it  is

inappropriate at this juncture because it is  a  red

herring and seeks to abort itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment seeks to prevent itself from being

passed  by preventing a major Opposition group, quite unnecessarily, from voting in favour of the amendment he seeks. Mr Speaker,  I

have  a  very minor amendment to make, an  amendment

which I hope they  will accept  and which will still deal with the so-called

democrats  who  threaten and strangle  democracy  in

Singapore and who threaten the lives of our  people.

It  is a simple amendment, Sir, It is a deletion  of

the  words which are completely unnecessary  to  the

spirit  and  intent of the motion. I move  that  the

words "like the Barisan Sosialis" be left out. If he

will  accept that, I will be happy to vote  for  his

amendment, although, in fact, Sir, I am a  supporter

of  the  main  one. I say the P.A.P. have  committed

innumerable crimes. I shall speak on that  if  there

is time on the main Question. But at this juncture,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>



since  he wants to pinpoint their perfidy in dealing

with   known  Communists  against  whom  they   have

evidence,  I  am with him. But I say, do  not  abort

your  own  amendment by making it impossible  for  a

major   political  Party  to  support  it  and   by

condemning a major Opposition Party without adequate

evidence  as being Communist controlled. Let  us  be

practical. I say, accept my amendment. I am with you

in  condemning both Communists and the action or the

inaction  of  the Government in dealing  with  known

Communists.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original Question was



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House expresses no confidence in the

Since which an amendment has bean moved, at the end,

<br><br>Since  which  an  amendment has been  moved  to  the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question now is "That the words `like the

Barisan  Sosialis' proposed to be left out, be  left

out." The debate must be confined to that amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill is entitled to speak again

on this amendment to the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Minister for Health and Law

has  given  me the opportunity to reply to  give  my

views  on  the amendment proposed by the Member  for

Anson. As I said earlier, Sir, the Member for  Anson

is  honest in his desire to see that justice is done

when  injustice has been perpetuated.  I  was  right

also  when  I said he will still stand for democracy

against Communist forces. But then he asked me,  how

it  is I have named the Barisan Sosialis and on what

evidence?  I  accept  the  statement  of  the  Prime

Minister.  The  Member for Anson even  went  to  the

extent of saying that when he was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>



a  little  boy  in  school he  was  saying  "Slowly,

slowly, catchee monkey."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the leaders who are now running the Barisan

Sosialis   were   people  whom  the   Labour   Front

Government  detained as Communist  subversives.  The

fact  that  the P.A.P. came out openly  without  any

pretence and defence and nail them for what they are

just  proves  that what the Lim Yew Hock  Government

did  was right. The same men are running the Barisan

Sosialis today in as much as they were, in my  view,

Communist  subversives - they are still, in  my  view,

Communist  subversives. It is  quite  fair  for  the

Member  for  Anson  to ask why  I  should  name  the

Barisan  Sosialis. It is something  like  a  double-headed  motion, Sir, If the Member for  Anson  wants

to  learn why, let me tell him that this motion  is

not  aimed  at the Government. The Member for  Anson

feels  strongly  against  the  evil  deeds  of   the

Government.  But  the  Barisan  Sosialis   are   not

governed  by such pure sentiments. They are  out  to

ridicule  the Singapore People's Alliance. That  was

what they said. It was clear in their speeches. "Ha!

The  S.P.A.-U.M.N.O.- Alliance want to share  in  the

spoils.  They  are  sure not to let  the  Government

fall." In as much as they tried to do it on us,  it

is  not  political  trickery; it  is  fair  game  in

politics  to nail them as they try to nail  us.  Let

them  wriggle out of that. But it has to be left  to

the Member for Anson to come to their defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he asked whether I was sincere in my

condemnation of the Government. All I can  ask  him,

Sir, is for him to refer to Hansard of the 21st July

when the Government tabled the motion of confidence.

He made his speech. I made my speech. Members of the

S.P.A.  Alliance made their speeches. It is  clearly

stated  here  that  we  have no  confidence  in  the

Government.  But today, because of the manipulations

of  the  Communists in trying to  wreck  merger  and

bringing up a motion to try to discredit the  S.P.A.,

it  is  but  fair  that the S.P.A. should  name  the

Communists for what they are. Exposure? Counter



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>



exposure, if the Member for Anson likes

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Singapore People's Alliance are not

little  children  who play "slowly, slowly,  catchee

monkey."  We are grownups. We are out to  catch  the

Communists  at their own game, not playing  "slowly,

slowly, catchee monkey" at all. The Member for Anson

may be fond of playing it, but we are not. This is a

serious  business,  not  for  school  children   to

indulge in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we gave our views whether we have or have no

confidence in the Government in July last year. This

year it is a different move, as I have said, but  if

the Member for Anson thinks I am doing this in order

that the Barisan Sosialis will not vote for it - I  do

not  worry  whether they vote for it or not.  All  I

know  is they are Communist controlled, and  it  is

fair  for  me to nail them as they try to  nail  me.

The only thing is that my nail happens to be a  bit

bigger  and  hits harder. That is all. I accept  the

amendment proposed by the Member for Anson-



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!

and  I  believe in this fight - "Down with Communism!

Up with Democracy in Singapore!"



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

original  motion before the House today is that  the

Opposition  has no confidence in the Government.  We

are  challenging  the right of  this  Government  to

carry  on  its  moral right, and  perhaps  even  its

constitutional  right, because it has  no  majority.

Then what has happened is that we have the amendment

of  the  Member for Cairnhill which has shifted  the

issue  from whether this Government should carry  on

or not to, the issue of Communism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, now we have further

confusion - confusion as if a spanner has been  thrown

into the works



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>



by  the  Member for Anson who has shifted  from  the

issue  of  no confidence in the Government,  to  the

issue of Communism, and now to the issue of whether

the   Barisan   Sosialis  is   a   Communist   front

organisation or not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, because of that, we're voting

against  the amendment to the amendment and  to  the

amendment itself.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Inche Ahmad Jabri. On the question on

the amendment to the amendment only.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I rise

to  support the amendment to the amendment moved  by

the  Member for Anson. Speaking on the amendment  to

the  amendment, on behalf of U.M.N.O., Mr  Speaker,

our stand on Communist subversives is clear.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the hon. Member has not

understood  me. We are now on the issue  whether  or

not the words "like the Barisan Sosialis" should  be

left in the amendment. We will deal with that first.

After  that has been disposed of, we will come  back

to the original amendment. Then the Member will have

a chance to speak on it.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I understand, Mr

Speaker,  and  I  wish to give further  evidence  to

delete  the words "like the Barisan Sosialis".  This

is  to  further strengthen the speech  made  by  the

Member  for  Anson to determine now as  to  who  are

really  fighting based on democratic principles  and

who  are  depending on Communist support. With  this

amendment, it may be that the Members of the Barisan

Sosialis  can show their true colours in  regard  to

this  matter.  They  have been charged  on  numerous

occasions,  as contained in the book issued  by  the

Government,  that the Barisan Sosialis  is  a  Party

where the strength of the Communists lies.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No other Member wishes to speak on

the amendment to the amendment?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendment

to  the amendment only seeks to leave out the  words

"like the Barisan Sosialis".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today the P.A.P. Government has been seeking

opportunity to put a label on any organisation.  Any

person,  any movement, that is against  the  P.A.P.

will  be  a labelled "Communist, Communist-inspired,

pro-communist". What difference does it make whether

it  is  like the Barisan Sosialis or like  something

else?  It merely falls into the trap of the  P.A.P.,

and  that  is what they like. I will speak again  on

the  Member for Cairnhill's amendment. This is only

a  red herring, as was pointed out by the Member for

Anson.  It is to give a chance to the S.P.A. not  to

vote  against the Government in the original motion.

You  see, the S.P.A. want to support the P.A.P. yet

they  do not want to support it openly. So the  only

way  for  the  S.P.A., under the  circumstances,  in

order to get out of their trouble, is to draw a  red

herring  across the trail and say something else  to

divert  attention from the original motion.  I  will

speak  again when it comes to the amendment  by  the

Member for Cairnhill.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Any other Member wishes to speak on

the  amendment  to the amendment to  leave  out  the

words "like the Barisan Sosialis"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That will still give me the

right to speak on the amendment proper.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Any Member who wishes to speak and

who has not yet spoken can speak to the amendment to

the  amendment. When that is disposed  of,  we  will

come  back  to the original amendment. The amendment

to the amendment is to leave out the words "like the

Barisan Sosialis".



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was out of

the  Chamber  when the Member for  Anson  moved  his

amendment to the amendment. I understand the  Member

for  Cairnhill  has indicated that  he  accepts  the

amendment by the Member for Anson.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in so far as the Member for Anson in his

usual legalistic way defines it accurately, in other

words,  the  intention  is that  the  definition  of

"organisations"  should not be restricted  to  "like

the  Barisan  Sosialis",  he  is,  in  fact,  as   I

understand this amendment, extending the area  which

is covered by the word "organisations". If there are

the  words  "like the Barisan Sosialis", then  there

may  be   some doubt that it may be confined only  to

political  Parties  or to bodies  like  the  Barisan

Sosialis  which are akin in nature. But  with  those

words  left  out,  as I understand it,  the  ejusdem

generis clause does not apply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for those Members opposite who are not

familiar  with  the  rules  that  guide  people   in

construing  and  interpreting  documents,   let   me

explain,  particularly to the Member for Queenstown,

the  purport of the amendment to the amendment moved

by   the   Member  for  Anson.  If  we   say   "from

manipulating and controlling organisations"  without

the words "like the Barisan Sosialis" you have given

no  example. Therefore, it is all organisations - old

boys'  associations, back-scratching  associations,

grandmothers'    and   grandchildren's    friendship

associations and-



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mothers' Day.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> -Mothers' Day Committee, Trade

Unions  Working Committee, Council of Joint  Action,

Human  Rights  Committee,  Banging  of  Woodensticks

Committee, and so on. [Interruption] No, no, this is

serious.  I am giving an example. Now, if the  words

"like  the  Barisan Sosialis" remain,  then  in  the

execution of this directive one will have to  go  by

the  yardstick. Is the Council of Joint Action  like

or  unlike the Barisan Sosialis? Is the Trade Unions

Working   Committee  like  or  unlike  the   Barisan

Sosialis?   Because  we  have  given   an   example,

therefore we are covered by a rule of interpretation

which  says, if you have given a series of examples,

then  all  the  others must be  like  them -  ejusdem

generis - of the same genus.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I thought it was the Member for

Cairnhill who gave the example.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Well, exactly. The Member for

Cairnhill, I think without a proper grasp  of  legal

principles  and so on, probably thought in  his  own

layman's way that if he pinpoints it on the  Barisan

Sosialis,  then  everybody will  understand - I  mean

like   the  Member  for  Queenstown  who  is   being

manipulated and controlled.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> What about Radio P.A.P.?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> But the Member for Anson quite

rightly,  I think, has done a service to this  House

by  removing  this  restriction which  probably  was

never intended by the Member for Cairnhill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the stand of the P.A.P. is quite simple. On

the   amendment,  Sir,  there  is  no  question   of

confidence.  This  is  an amendment.  It  is  not  a

motion. Therefore, it is not a motion of confidence.

It  can be voted upon; we shall abstain and it is up

to  the  Opposition to give the country a lead.  The

views of the Government are well known. We say  that

our  first  duty  is  to throw light  on  the  whole

situation.  Everybody understands what this  is  all

about,  what  the game is for, who is playing  what

role.  It has been suggested, Sir, that some  of  us

have  slept  with  Machiavelli.  Well,  it  is   our

business  to  show who Machiavelli is,  what  he  is

doing, what his objectives are, who his other  dolls

on  the stage are. Having done that, I think we will

have  done  our  democratic duty  in  informing  the

people exactly what is going on; and they also  know

the role the Member for Anson is playing. Of course,

from time to time, he gets confused. For instance, I

am  not sure when he moved this amendment whether he

realised  that, in fact, he helped the  Member  for

Cairnhill  in achieving his original intention.  The

Member for Cairnhill has often said  -  publicly once

in a radio forum with me, he egged me on - Our "sacred

duty  is to arrest and detain these people,"  and  I

explained  to  him that I felt our sacred  duty  was

first to explain to the people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>



what  this was all about. These people knew,  and  I

knew,  that the game was up for them and, as I  said

yesterday, it is a fair cop. Therefore, I  say  that

when the amendment to the amendment is taken and  if

it is carried by the Opposition, it will be the duty

of  the  Government  to bring this  to  the  highest

constitutional  authority for  security - namely, the

Internal Security Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson has helped us in this,

and  I would say that our business as the Government

of  Singapore  is to ensure that everybody  gets  an

opportunity  on  this  motion  to  state  where   he

stand's.  Our  stand is to spotlight all  the  moves

that  are  being made. Everybody can understand  why

people  are against merger, why they are doing  what

they are doing, why if one condition were asked  for

and  agreed to, another condition is raised, and  so

on, and so on.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Prime Minister will agree

that  he  is  going away from the amendment  to  the

amendment.   We  will  come  back  to   the   other

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> As you wish, Mr Speaker, Sir.

In our view, this is an exemplary move by the Member

for  Anson to define more broadly and in wider terms

the   purport  of  the  motion  by  the  Member  for

Cairnhill.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, memories are short

sometimes.  As  the  Member  for  Anson  said,  only

elephants have long memories. My memory is not  that

long  and  that is why I have to refer  to  Hansard.

Now,  in  1955, when the Member for Anson was  Chief

Minister, he had this advice to give to the  Member

for  Tanjong Pagar, now the Prime Minister.  Let  me

quote him, in column 241, Hansard of 16th May, 1955.

This is what the Chief Minister, now the Member  for

Anson, said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If the P.A.P., which consists of responsible,

decent, honest men - many of them - if they would  purge

themselves  of  the Communists and fellow-travellers

that  they know they have, if they would face  their

own  responsibility, they could be the  organisation

that  they  hope lo be that would one day lead  this

country to win its independence.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>



This  was  solemn  advice given to  the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar  in  this very Chamber  barely  seven

years  ago. Mr Speaker, the P.A.P. has not so  much

by   itself   purged  what  the  Member  for   Anson

considered Communists and fellow-travellers. He  was

the Chief Minister-



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker,

Sir.  The Deputy Prime Minister seems to be  reading

from  a  text which is not relevant to the amendment

to the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have been watching the position

very  closely  and I am wondering  when  the  Deputy

Prime  Minister  is coming to the amendment  to  the

amendment. He probably is; I do not know.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes, I was coming to it. I am

afraid the Member for Anson is a little like the cat

on a hot tin roof. Sir, those Communists and fellow-travellers  purged themselves out of the  P.A.P.  We

did  not  do  that ourselves. They purged themselves

out  in  May last year. They did it, and  all  arose

from  a  difference  of views  on  the  question  of

merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Member for Anson seeks to protect the

leaders in the Barisan Sosialis. He seeks to protect

the  leaders in the Barisan Sosialis and yet  barely

seven  years  ago - let me refresh his  memory - in  the

debate  on the P.P.S.O. Mr David Marshall, who  was  then

Chief  Minister, had this to say about Mr Lim Ching

Siong who was then in the P.A.P. and the Member  for

Bukit  Timah.  Let  me  quote Hansard  of  the  21st

September, 1955, columns 696 and 697. This was  what

the Chief Minister, now Member for Anson, had to say

vis-a-vis Mr Lim Ching Siong:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, a letter signed by the Member for Bukit Timah

(Mr Lim Ching Siong) throws light on the conduct of

these  pseudo-trade  unionists  who  organised   the

abortive    illegal   strikes - I   repeat,    illegal

strikes - of  last June. The letter was typed  on  the

head-note of the Singapore Factory and Shop Workers'

Union, 149 Middle Road, Singapore, 7, dated 12th  of

June, 1955, addressed to the Manager, Singapore Cold

Storage Company, Limited, Orchard



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>



Road,  Singapore.  In referring  to  the  so-called

sympathy   strike  of  the  workers  of  the   Cold

Storage, this is what it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to notify you that the action taken by

our   members  is  not  directed  against  your

Company  but is taken in support of the  common

demands  of fraternal unions presented  to  the

Government in respect of detained unionists."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There we have, Sir, the naive admission by the

Hon.  Secretary - the  name is Lim  Ching  Siong - the

admission that the workers are made to suffer,  not

in  pursuance of a trade dispute, but in  order  to

blackmail the people's Government by mob coercion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a technique, Sir, of the Communists

throughout the world to infiltrate trade unions and

to  work ostensibly for the welfare of the labourer

in  order  to gain his confidence. Then,  when  the

time  is  considered ripe, they sacrifice him.  The

Malays,  Sir, have a word for this type of  pseudo-trade unionists. They call them "topengs".'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he went on relating the case of one trade

unionist  who  was  detained,  Mr  Yong  Kok   Kim,

President of the Singapore Factory and Shop Workers'

Union. He was detained then by the Member for  Anson

who  was Chief Minister. And in column 697, this  is

what the Member for Anson had to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This, Sir, is what the Member for Bukit Timah had

to  say about the detention of Yong Kok Kim. I  read

from  an  article in the Straits' Times' of  Monday,

July 11, 1955, headlined "JAIL ME TOO, SAYS LIM". It

is cheap to shout to the hushes that you are looking

for  wars  when  it  is known full  well  that  this

Government does not arrest arbitrarily. Let  us  see

what  the statement was that the hon. Member issued.

In a statement issued from the Union Headquarters in

Middle Road, Mr Lim said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The abuse of power provided by the Emergency

Regulations has once more been

displayed by the arrest of Mr Yong Kok Kim."



<br><br>Abuse of power, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I", said Mr Lim, "share the same beliefs and

have  the  same aims as Fong Swee Suan and Yong  Kok

Kim.  I therefore challenge the Government to arrest

me too."'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister, now Member for Anson, went on

to  relate  to the House that Mr Yong Kok  Kim  was

convicted  in an open court of law and sentenced  to

five years' imprisonment for terrorist activities.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> And the ex-Chief Minister then

issued a challenge to the Member for Bukit Timah:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, in the light of this statement of the

Member for Bukit Timah - that he shares the same  aims

and  the  same beliefs as this convicted man - and  in

the light of the statements he has seen fit to issue

criticising  the present Bill, in lurid language,  I

think  it  is pertinent to enquire and  to  ask  him

whether  he  speaks as a man loyal to the democratic

process   and   to  the  people  and  territory   of

Singapore, or whether he speaks as a Communist and a

fellow sympathiser of the Communists.'



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> What did the P.A.P. Member say?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, it is

extraordinary  indeed  that the  Member  for  Anson,

previously Chief Minister, who knew all the  details

of  what  happened  during his regime,  should  this

afternoon  stand up not only to defend  the  Barisan

Sosialis but also to work in cahoots with them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all Malayan

nationalists  deplore  the  utter  lack   of   moral

principles  and  of ordinary human  decency  of  the

Member   for  Anson - a  former  Chief  Minister   of

Singapore - in  allowing himself  to  be  used  as  a

willing  tool  of the Malayan Communist  Party  and

their  open-front  leaders in  their  fight  against

Malayan   nationalism  and  condemn  his   political

dishonesty-



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker.

You   have   repeatedly  pulled   up   Members   for

misrepresentations.  Is that not  misrepresentation,

suggesting  that I am co-operating with the  Malayan

Communist Party on this motion?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I expected the Member for Anson to

get  up  on a point of order as to whether  this  is

relevant to the amendment to the amendment. We  have

not  come  to  the main amendment yet.  We  are  now

deciding whether or not the words "like the  Barisan

Sosialis" should remain in the amendment. Mr Byrne.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I am prepared to wait for my

opportunity.  I  am  going to  deal  with  him  very

adequately tonight.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I had better sound a

note of warning. If the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>



Minister  for  Law wishes to deal  with  the  Member

adequately, he must be relevant and he must not lose

his  temper.  Does any Member wish to speak  on  the

amendment to the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the original motion moved

by the Member for Queenstown and the Member for

Anson reads as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this House expresses no confidence in the

Government.'



<br><br>Then the Member for Cairnhill moved an amendment  to

add, at the end, the words:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`in that it has failed to discharge its sacred duty

of  protecting the internal security of Singapore by

not  restraining known communist and communist-front

leaders    from    manipulating   and    controlling

organisations   like  the  Barisan  Sosialis,   thus

endangering   the  well-being  of  the   people   of

Singapore.'



<br><br>After which, the Member for Anson, one of the movers

of  the original motion, suggested an amendment,  to

leave out the words "like the Barisan Sosialis".  So

the motion now reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this House expresses no confidence in the

Government  in  that it has failed to discharge  its

sacred  duty of protecting the internal security  of

Singapore  by  not restraining known  communist  and

communist-front   leaders  from   manipulating   and

controlling organisations, thus endangering the well-being of the people of Singapore.'



<br><br>We  are  now speaking on the amendment of the Member

for  Anson  who wishes to leave out the words  "like

the Barisan Sosialis". Now, Sir, I take it from this

amendment  that  he is in sympathy  with  the  other

words  of  the  amendment moved by  the  Member  for

Cairnhill;   in  other  words,  he   deplores   the

Government's failure to restrain known Communist and

Communist-front leaders. That I am taking is a  fair

appraisal  of the stand of the Member for Anson.  He

deplores   the  Government  inactivity  in  internal

security  matters.  His only  concern  is  that  the

Government should take action, not only against  the

Communists  who are manipulating organisations  like

the  Barisan Sosialis, but organisations in general.

including his own Party - the Workers' Party - which  he

has admitted has been captured.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Just how

often  is  falsehood  to be  permitted  when  it  is

refuted repeatedly, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I must ask the Minister for Finance

not  to  harp  on an old tune which has really  gone

very old. If the Minister for Finance feels strongly

about  it, he must file a notice of motion to allege

that  the  Member said that the Workers'  Party  has

been captured.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Let us get our facts straight:

first, on the facts; second, on the relevance of the

facts to the amendment. I would like to establish  a

direct  connection  between these  two.  Before  the

interruption,  I  said  that the  Member  for  Anson

admitted that his Party had been captured.  I  never

said  by  whom. And he said, "They have captured  my

Party, but they cannot capture me."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think we must not go back on

this - what  I  call "battledore and shuttlecock".  We

are  going back to my childhood days. Let us try and

be  men  now.  Let  us  try to debate  in  a  proper

parliamentary manner.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am talking on a point which

is   quite   central   to  the  amendment   to   the

amendment - that is, the capture of his Party. I  will

not, if you so desire, go into the details of who did

the  capturing. Let us agree that he has some  ideas

about  it, and we have some ideas about it. But  his

Party  has been captured. Let us stop at that.  This

is  directly related to his amendment, because I say

that  obviously  he  wants the  Government  to  take

action  against known Communist and Communist.-front

leaders  who  are controlling and manipulating,  not

only  the  Barisan Sosialis, but also other Parties,

including his own Party. That is the point.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> As far as that is concerned, the

Minister  is  in order. But if he alleges  that  the

Member  for  Anson said that his Party was  captured

when  the Member for Anson time and again says  that

he did not say that, I think



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>



that is just "battledore and shuttlecock". But he is

entitled to say that in his view the Party has  been

captured.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Quite so, Mr Speaker, Sir, but

you   will   recollect  that  at   the   moment   of

interruption by the Member for Anson, I  never  said

who  did  the capturing. The records are there.  The

moment I said he admitted his Party was captured, he

stood up and said that that was quite wrong.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Get a new record.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> So this, I take it, is the

purpose of the amendment to the amendment, and I can

see  no other possible interpretation. Now, Sir, the

stand  of  the P.A.P. Government on this  matter  of

internal  security has been stated every  so  often,

but  it  seems to bear repetition, because both  the

Member  for Cairnhill and the Member for Anson  seem

to be under some misapprehension as to the powers of

the Government in respect of internal security.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am sorry to interrupt again, Mr

Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker,

Sir.  The  issue  of  internal security  is  on  the

amendment  proper,  not  on  my  amendment  to   the

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I take it that the Minister for

Finance  is coming to the amendment to the amendment

and    not    debating   the   original   amendment.

[Interruption] Order. Mr Sergeant at Arms, I  think

order  should be kept in the Gallery. The  strangers

in the Gallery appear to imagine that they are in  a

theatre.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I just mention the powers of

the Government in regard to internal security really

in  passing, and I do not want to develop that theme

at  all  at  length.  But  it  is  relevant  to  the

amendment to this extent: insofar as we are not  the

final  arbiter - or indeed any arbiter - in  matters  of

internal security,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>



it  is a matter of complete indifference whether the

Member  for  Anson wants to take action against  the

Communists manipulating the Barisan Sosialis, or the

Communists in general. Therefore, we say, as between

the  amendment proposed by the Member for  Cairnhill

and the amendment to the amendment, quite frankly we

await directives from Members of the Opposition.  If

they  want the amendment of the Member for Cairnhill

to be passed in this Assembly, then we shall be most

pleased to take note of the wishes of the Opposition

Parties in this respect. On the other hand, if  they

think that the operations of Communist and Communist-front leaders are so extensive that action should be

taken on a broader field, then we are quite happy to

take  note of their wishes and transmit them to  the

proper  authorities who control matters of  internal

security.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I wish to speak on the amendment to the

amendment,  Mr  Speaker, Sir. When the  Member  for

Anson  moved this amendment, we were quite happy  to

accept  it, because, On reflection, it did occur  to

us  that  it placed the Barisan Sosialis in  a  very

awkward   position.  Although  the  Government   had

accused them of being manipulated by the Communists,

the  Barisan  Sosialis had always denied  it.  Those

denials,  to my mind, were worthy of belief.  So,  I

was a little horrified, Mr Speaker, when the leader

of the Barisan Sosialis got up and said, "I will not

accept the amendment to the amendment."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker He did not say whether he will support it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I thought he spoke on the amendment to

the  amendment. I am subject to correction  here.  I

thought  he  said, "I cannot accept the  Member  for

Anson's amendment to the amendment." Am I right?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps the Member for Queenstown

will confirm?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for Queenstown does not

say anything; then the hon. Member, must accept that

that is so.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Yes, I understood it to be that during

the  course of the debate, the leader of the Barisan

Sosialis,  or  somebody from the Barisan  side,  had

said  that he will not support the amendment to  the

amendment - that  is,  to  make  it  more  plain,  the

deletion of the

- phrase "like the Barisan Sosialis".



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Thank you, Sir, I was horrified when

the Member for Queenstown said that. It appeared  to

me   that  if  he  was  genuine  in  contesting  the

allegations  of  the Government that  his  Party  is

being either controlled or has been captured by  the

Communists  or  Communist-front leaders,  then  the

natural  implication  of  that  is  that  his  is  a

completely  democratic Party without any  Communists

or Communist sympathisers' affiliations; and on that

basis,  he  would have been able to agree  with  the

Member for Anson, which would have put his Party  in

a  position to vote on the amendment with the Member

for  Cairnhill.  Now, why then does the  Member  for

Queenstown  deny  the amendment  to  the  amendment?

Could  it  be for the reason that if he  denies  the

amendment  to  the amendment, then on the  amendment

itself,  he would not be in a position to  vote  for

the reason that he cannot himself condemn himself as

being    a    member   of   a   Communist-controlled

organisation? Is the game a deep one,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Any Member wishing - to speak on the

amendment to the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, may I rise on a

point of order? If the Member for Queenstown appears

puzzled,  perhaps  the  Chair  would  be  of   great

assistance to the whole House if the meaning of  the

amendment  to the amendment were made  clear.  He appears puzzled, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He has no directive.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Member for Farrer Park

repeated  the allegation three times.  I  asked  the

Member for Farrer Park to repeat it a third time so

that the Member for Queenstown



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>



could  hear  clearly, and the Member for  Queenstown

indicated  that  the  Member  for  Farrer  Park  was

correct.  In other words, the Member for Queenstown

did  not  wish  that  the words  "like  the  Barisan

Sosialis"  should  be  left  out.  The  Member   for

Queenstown  has  indicated that he wishes  that  the

words  "like the Barisan Sosialis" should remain  in

the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, our

understanding  of  the  amendment  is   this,   that

whatever the organisation, whatever the name of  the

person  or  organisation that is put down  makes  no

difference, because the whole idea of the  amendment

is to allow the Government a chance to put the blame

on the Communists.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I cannot allow the Member to

make   another  speech.  So  that  is  the   correct

understanding of the position. The Member for Queenstown  desires  that  the  words  "like  the  Barisan

Sosialis" should remain in the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No other Member wishing to speak? I will then put

the Question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, "That the words `like the Barisan

Sosialis' proposed to be left out, be left out."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment to the amendment accordingly negatived.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We are back to the original

amendment,  that  is,  at the end  of  the  original

motion,  to add, "in that it has failed to  discharge

its  sacred duty of protecting the internal security

of  Singapore by not restraining known communist and

communist-front   leaders  from   manipulating   and

controlling   organisations   like   the    Barisan

Sosialis,  thus  endangering the  wellbeing  of  the

people of Singapore".



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of elucidation,

Sir.  Since the amendment to the amendment has  been

defeated  it  is, in  fact,  significant  in   this

respect.  The words "like the Barisan Sosialis"  are

again part of the motion and the Barisan Sosialis is

thereby,    by    implication,   an    organisation

manipulated   and  controlled  by  the   Communists.

Perhaps you, Sir, would clarify?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Speaker

should  not be called upon to interpret what  is  in

the  amendment  and,  for  that  matter,  the  Prime

Minister will no doubt speak on it later on.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Penang and Malacca!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have heard enough of Penang

and Malacca.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not

our view that we have failed to discharge our sacred

duty in protecting the internal security of Singapore.

What  we  dispute  in  the  amendment  is  that   by

not restraining known Communist and Communist-front

leaders, from   manipulating   and    controlling

organisations  like the Barisan Sosialis,  we  have

endangered   the  well-being  of   the   people   of

Singapore.   So   the  purport  of  the   amendment,

therefore,  is  that  the Government,  in  order  to

discharge  its, duty,  has  got  to  restrain - a

euphemism,  restrain - known Communist and Communist-front  leaders  from  manipulating  and  controlling

organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been our view all along that this

simple   and  blunt  method  of  dealing  with   the

Communists does not provide a complete answer to our

security position. It is our intention to abstain on

the  whole amendment and let the Opposition  decide.

And  on  the decision  of  the  Opposition  to  this

amendment,   certain  consequences  and  significant

conclusions   will   be  drawn   by   the   relevant

authorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me explain the Government's policy and the

Government's approach to this problem. Yesterday  we

had   the  advantage  of  hearing  the  Member   for

Cairnhill admit in this Chamber that we do know  the

Communists   and   their  methods.   That   is   the

compliment he has paid us. And because we  do  know

how  they manipulate things and how to counter their

manipulations, we therefore abstained on  a  motion

moved  yesterday by the Member for Thomson. Now,  I

will  move  one step further, that not only  did  we

know, and we still know, how they operate, how  they

manipulate,  and therefore know how to counter  them

and their manipulations, but in the long-term, what

we are doing is a necessary phase in the history of

Malaya and of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is an aspect of the problem which I

think the people of Singapore and of Malaysia  must

see  clearly.  Our  view  is  that  the  problem  of

Communism and  the  Communists is  not  purely  the

security problem of restraining the - Communists  from

activity. Basically, this is an important aspect of

security.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>



restraining  them from doing damage  to  society.  I

will  later  on explain how we have prevented  them,

within  the  play of democratic methods, from  doing

harm.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, first, let me explain the whole problem. The

appeal, the  pull  of Communism, is  basically  one

which springs from poverty and frustration. Economic

and  social distress provide a breeding ground  upon

which the Communist creed can grow, can recruit  and

gain strength. Without those conditions, it has been

proved  over  and over again that however  militant,

however  cunning,  however  active,  their  movement

cannot gather strength.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, immediately after the Second World War, the

Communist  attack was on Europe, a  war-ravaged  and

destroyed  Europe. The industrial edifice of  Europe

was   nearly   completely  razed  to   the   ground,

literally.  Stalin's massive effort was  to  capture

Europe, for once he captured Europe, he had captured

the  whole of the industrial potential of the  known

industrialised  world,  and  he  would  capture  the

world.  But what defeated the Communist was not  the

effectiveness of the strength of the Italian police,

or  the  French  police, or the West German  police -

although  they were important factors  in  isolating

and  containing known Communist operators. The basic

factor  that prevented a Communist capture of Europe

was  the  economic booster that they  got  from  the

United  States  in  Marshall  Aid  that  rejuvenated

European  industries that have built now,  17  years

after the war, a prosperous common market in Europe,

one  so  prosperous that even Britain is reluctantly

compelled  to  consider joining.  True  the  Italian

Communist  Party still has a following, particularly

in  the  industrial north. It is also true that  the

French Communist Party is powerful. But what is true

is  that  they  have  been halted,  checkmated,  not

primarily   by   being  contained,  restrained   and

detained,  but  by  the  economic  prosperity   that

dispels  frustration, despair and  banishes  poverty

and brings in prosperity.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have explained this thesis before. I will only

broadly touch on the problem. Sir, a population that

is  advancing economically, that has something -  to

look  forward  to  tomorrow, something  better  than

today,  and for their children even something better

next year, the year after that, the next decade - that

is  not  a population which is likely to throw  away

the  past and grope madly for change and revolution.

It  is only, as in the case of China, when utter and

absolute despair has enveloped a whole people;  when

the  intelligentsia and the educated have lost faith

in  this  system  and  the  people  have  reached  a

breaking  point, that they cast off the old  because

nothing  could be worse than the old. That  was  the

point.  Communism  expanded and  overwhelmed  China.

When  one  day you found that your hundred  thousand

yen  would  buy half a katty of rice  and  two  days

later  you find that it would probably buy you three

tahils  of  rice - in that situation men's minds  lose

their  bearings and they go for a change.  In  North

Vietnam  a  situation approaching that  took  place,

slightly different in that the colonial power by its

stupidity in staying on brought about a united front

not  only  of  the Communists - even today  the  North

Vietnamese  Communist Party  is  not  known  as  the

Communist Party; the Vietcong Workers' Party brought

about  a  united front which gathered  together  the

Communists,  the non-Communists, the  liberals,  the

intellectuals and everybody against the society. The

net  result,  of course, was that in such  a  united

front,  they being the best organised of the groups,

when  victory  came, they were the  dominant  power.

Over  the  years  all  the peripheral  organisations

allied  to the united front will slowly wither  away

and  the  quintessence of the Communist  elite  will

slowly  take  over. If I were a Vietnamese  in  that

situation,  I would have joined them in  the  united

front,  as  I  would have gone on  with  the  united

front, my colleagues and I, with the Communists  and

with  everybody  else to fight the  British  to  end

colonial rule. But, fortunately for us, we  did  not

have  to  face  our  problems so hopelessly  as  the

Vietnamese have. By the time they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>



had finished with the colonial power, the whole  of

the  Vietminh Army, the whole of the officer  cadre

were Communists. There was no question of any other

alternative and going on with the united front.  In

the  South, well, a different situation obtains and

the  light goes on, not a fight which I would  have

liked  to  be involved in. But we are in a  happier

position,   that  even  before  independence,   the

British made it quite clear that they were going to

withdraw   from  the  political  arena.   That   is

important.  True, they have got economic  interests

in  this country, large vested interests in  rubber

or  tin and the distributive trade. But politically

they  made it quite clear, as far back as  1955  in

the   Federation,  that  they  were   prepared   to

withdraw.  So  the  objective of the  united  front

became   possible   of  consummation   before   the

Communist  forces became strong enough to overwhelm

all the other parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me take our problems of Singapore. The

British offered no such escape. Their original plan

in 1955 and 1956 was to hold Singapore indefinitely

as  a  military base. I remember vividly the  first

conference in 1956. I did not think the Member  for

Anson  knew  who was playing what game.  He  had  a

delegation  of 13, but I am quite sure the  Barisan

Sosialis  would  not be as unlucky  as  the  former

Chief Minister's band of 13. He wanted independence

to  allow Singapore to send representatives to  the

United  Nations. That is one of the most  important

things, Sir. But without independence you cannot go

to  the  United Nations. Sir, a worthwhile national

aspiration.  We  have  a delegation  there  in  the

United  Nations to play on the world  stage.  After

all,  Singapore  is  a small  place,  has  a  small

audience,  but there, there is the world Press.  So

he   devised   a  scheme  whereby  we   would   get

independence  and  he  would hand  back  almost  in

perpetuity by treaty, defence and external affairs.

It  was a mad scheme which I did not think had half

a chance of getting off the ground. However, he was

encouraged by the Member for Bukit Timah  to  fight

for no less. We finally persuaded



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>



him. They said, "All right. Let foreign affairs and

defence  be  in British hands." The clash  came  on

security. The British wanted the predominant voice,

the  chairmanship and the casting vote. We proposed

an  alternative with the concurrence  of  the  then

Member  for  Bukit Timah, which is  important,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, for then I could not be outflanked by

leftist adventurers in Singapore. He agreed that  a

fair compromise was that the Federation should have

the  casting  vote,  because  we  all  believed  in

merger;  we  all  believed that that  was  the  way

towards  independence.  Believe  it  or  not,   Mr

Speaker, the Colonial Secretary refused. May  1956.

The  intention  was  that they were  to  stay  here

indefinitely. No freedom was in sight.  And  if  no

freedom  was  in  sight, the united front  struggle

must  go  on. Sir, I put this argument to the  then

Colonial  Secretary. He was an extremely  able  man

who  not  only could run one conference at any  one

time  whilst he was doing the Singapore conference,

looking  after the ups and downs of the Member  for

Anson, who was then the Chief Minister; but he  was

also  looking after Malta and several other  places

besides, places which were all on the boil.  I  put

to  him this simple argument, if you lose Malaya to

Communism, then you have lost Singapore.  There  is

no  hope  of  holding Singapore. There is  as  much

chance of holding Singapore from a Communist Malaya

as  Hong  Kong from a Communist China. If  tomorrow

the  Chinese  Communist Government decide  to  take

Hong Kong, nothing can stop it. He did not see  the

logic  of it or he did not want to admit the  logic

of  it. I argued with him that as long as Malaya is

non-Communist, his base survives. And  what  better

way  of deciding the security of Singapore than  to

have  the casting vote in the hands of a Government

that  has a direct and vital interest in Singapore,

because  its  own  survival is intimately  tied  to

Singapore?    But    the    Colonial     Secretary

refused - 1956.   The  events  that   followed   are

familiar  to  you,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir.  Tumultuous

scenes  in this House. Moments of great excitement.

Then  the  anti-climax.  And  in  1957  we  reached

agreement. In that one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>



year  some progress was made in thinking in  London,

that  if  Malaya became Communist, then the base  in

Singapore  anyway  would be useless.  Therefore,  it

was  agreed that the casting vote would be with  the

Federation of Malaya. That was crucial. If one  side

disagreed, then a new phase opened. In other  words,

an  admission was made that the two territories were

intimately  linked. If one was lost, the  other  was

lost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from that moment the gradual

drift  away from the united front tactics began.  In

June,  we  reached agreement in London  that  Malaya

should have a casting vote. In August Malaya itself

became  independent. You will recall that I reported

in  this Assembly a conversation I had with the boys

then  in  camp - the people intimately connected  with

the  leadership  of the P.A.P. to  whom  we  owed  a

responsibility. They said that that brought about  a

metamorphosis  of  the  whole situation.  From  then

onwards the Malay soldiers, the Chinese Home  Guard,

the  Indian policemen - they are no longer mercenaries

of  the  colonial  power,  but  they  are  sentinels

guarding  the  independence  of  the  newly-acquired

Malayan independence. A basic and fundamental change

of  role. And the continuance of the M.C.P. struggle

thereafter  became  an attack not  on  the  colonial

power  but on a newly independent Government  freely

elected  by  the people. That began the  new  phase.

From then onwards we set down our new stakes - what we

were fighting for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Queenstown has talked about

our  mandate - that we had no mandate - to bring  merger

about.  Let me read to him his pledge signed, sealed

and  delivered with Tann Wee Long, the legal adviser

of  the  Barisan Sosialis, attesting. He said  here,

signed, sealed and delivered on the 11th day of  May

1959:  "I, Lee Siew Choh, of No. 358G Dunearn  Road,

Singapore, 11, hereby acknowledge that I  have  read

and   understood  the  4th  Anniversary  Celebration

Souvenir issue of the Petir, the organ of the P.A.P.

published on the 22nd November, 1958, and the  Five-Year Plan of the P.A.P. announced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>



at  a Special Party Congress of Saturday,  25th

April,  1959,  and  I declare  that  I  am  in  full

agreement  with  the  P.A.P.'s  policy  as  set  out

therein. I hereby covenant with the P.A.P. that if I

am elected to the Singapore Legislative Assembly and

if  I  should ever later resign or be expelled  from

the  P.A.P.,  I  shall  forthwith  resign  from  the

Singapore Legislative Assembly."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solemn words, Sir. This is what he read and said

he understood.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I take it this is relevant to the

amendment which deals with the Communists?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> This is to show how the

Barisan  Sosialis came about and why they  became  a

Communist-controlled organisation. We made it  quite

clear in this policy statement what we stood for. It

says  here. "The New Phase After Merdeka: Our  Tasks

and  Policy". This is a little book which I gathered

together and which I thought would contain  all  the

useful  documents to remind them of  what  they  had

subscribed  to.  It  said here, page  148 - "The  New

Phase  Since Merdeka." Can I read at the  bottom  of

the page, Sir, on November 21, 1954, we added:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`though because of the division of Malaya into two

territories  we  are technically a  political  Party

operating  in  Singapore,  we  shall,  in  all   our

approach  to the problems of this country, disregard

the  constitutional  division. We  are  as  actively

interested in the problems of our fellow Malayans in

the Federation as we are in those of Singapore. When

Malayans  in the Federation who agree with  our  aim

join us, we shall work throughout Malaya.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is even more true now than four years ago, for

to  achieve  freedom in an island  we  must  achieve

merger. Singapore, by itself an island of 224 square

miles with a population of 1.5 million     that  was

four  years ago. Mr Speaker; now it is 1.7 million,

as  the Member for Queenstown says living mainly  on

its  trade with the Federation and Indonesia, cannot

hope  for  anything more than the status of Hongkong

or Taiwan. It goes on to say  on page

151:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We must strive for national unity and solidarity,

and anything that stands in the way must be

overcome.'



<br><br>It is as simple as that. That is the foremost

objective-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Not the White Paper?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The White Paper is bringing

about the reunification-



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> A phoney merger!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Well, the Member for Thomson

will find out how very real it is after it has taken

place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we got the boys in Changi to

endorse it wholeheartedly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 148 - "Ends and Means of Socialism." They

issued  this. Subsequently it was suggested  at  the

Socialist Front Conference in Kuala Lumpur,  not  by

the people who signed this - because I think it would

have  been too barefaced a lie for them to say  that

it  was  under duress - that they were being  released

from  prison and they issued this on their  release.

But  the  Chairman of the Socialist Front Conference

said all these documents were not admissible because

he  feared it might have been under duress. Mr  Lim

Ching  Siong, he said, was under duress. We  allowed

him free passage in the C.P.A. Room, free use of the

C.P.A. telephone-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> And coffee!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> - coffee, tea, anything he likes. Mr Speaker, Sir, more democratic no government can be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Why did you not stop him?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Why should we want to stop

him? Sir, this is what he said. Page 184:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`With regard to the immediate tasks particularly in

the  new  phase since the achievement  of  political

independence by the Federation of Malaya, we endorse

the  stand taken by the P.A.P, in the document  "The

New  Phase  After Merdeka" [that is the one  I  have

just read].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me read just one short passage on page 187:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Once the problem of linguistic and cultural unity

is   on  the  way  to  being  resolved,  fears   and

suspicions  will fade away. We must face the  facts.

So   long   as   the   fight  was  against   British

colonialism, the differences between the peoples  of

Malaya  were  muted  and dulled  in  the  desire  to

achieve the common goal of freedom by common effort.

Now   that  this  freedom  has  been  won   in   the

Federation, all the differences come back into their

own. They



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>



can and must be resolved and we in Singapore can set

the   way   to  the  solution  of  these   important

differences in language and culture.'



<br><br>Now,  this  is what we can and must do in this  next

phase  of our struggle for freedom - the struggle  for

merger.  There is no nonsense there about  abolition

of  the  Security Council; more self-government  and

all this new-



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> No White Paper-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> -new united front line bringing the

two   territories   together,   getting    15 representatives into the Federation Parliament.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> What is bad about that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I thought they subscribed to

these views.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes, merger.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Merger? Alternative (b) - let

them  have it: complete and unconditional. But  this

was  the  point. A new phase entered and  we  pegged

them  down  to the nationalist line. They wanted  to

carry  on  a united front with us, it was  a  united

front   for  nationalist,  non-Communist,  socialist

purposes.  Not for Communist purposes. We made  that

decision  in 1957, Mr Speaker, Sir, and if  anybody

tells lies and is a traitor to any cause, it is they

who  told  lies  when they signed  these  documents,

never  sincerely subscribing to them and opting  out

of  these documents the moment they found that  they

could  not make use of us. Those are the facts.  The

Member  for  Thomson  was then not  with  them,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir.  He  knows  very  little  about  this

because what he knew were about the open documents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain the position. Had this Government

carried out the policy of the last Government,  then

we  would have got into an impasse. Sir, this  is  a

simple  exercise in logic. The British  wanted  this

base  to  go on as long as possible in the same  old

way,  with them as sovereign. The Federation  wanted

Singapore   to   be   reasonably  quiet,   peaceful,

prosperous  and  no  problem to  them.  A  Singapore

Government  elected can either fight for  the  long-term rights of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>



the  people  or  play  the short-term  game  of  the

British in keeping this situation contained. Sir, to

keep  the place happy and prosperous, you must  have

economic  expansion; you must have first an economic

base - a common market. Without that, nobody is  going

to  put his money in Singapore. We have tried it. We

have fought hard for a common market.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of order, Sir, Surely, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, this is irrelevant to the  debate  at

the moment.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was just wondering how it is

related.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It is very simple, Mr Speaker,

Sir.  The motion is that we have failed to discharge

our  sacred duty of protecting the internal security

of  Singapore, and then they define how we should do

it, by restraining known Communists and so on and so

on.  I am going to show that that is not the way  to

discharge our sacred duty. It is as simple as  that.

We did a lot of thinking. [Interruption.]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Lock them up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, indeed. That is what they

want us to do. Lock them up. Then they become

martyrs fighting against colonialism. Then we are

tools of the colonialists.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Anti-Communist, are you?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is their line. No, why

should  we do such foolish things? They run  around.

We  say, "All right, a common market first, economic

expansion, prosperity."



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Where is the common market?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It is coming. The U.N.

Commission is already on the way. The common  market

is  coming  with merger and Malaysia. And  a  bigger

common market too - 130,000 square miles.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Second-class citizens.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No. Mr Speaker, Sir, these are

foolish words by tender



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>



foots in the game. Tenderfoots fighting hard for the

second-class badge. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Opposition should realise there

is  a guillotine. If they interject in this way, the

Prime Minister must respond.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I always try to keep everybody

happy, Sir, including the Opposition, in so far as I

can.  I do not object to them, if it gives them some

release    from   their   inhibitions   and    their

frustrations. I say, so be it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain this exercise. If there is no

common  market, then it means no economic expansion.

Then   that   means   more   social   unrest,   more

unemployment,  more problems. We have  gone  through

this  drill;  so let us face the problem  now.  They

helped  us in 1961. They helped us enormously.  They

brought  home  the problem vividly to Kuala  Lumpur.

Everyday in the fierce things they say, they help to

bring  the  problems home. Suddenly it was generally

recognised that there must be merger; there must  be

a  common  market,  or  the position  could  not  be

contained.  Now had we played the other  game,  then

the  position  would  have been contained  for  five

years,  for the life of this Assembly. There  is  no

problem.  They are cornered. They are kept down.  We

are  the  stooges of the British for having cornered

them,  because  obviously with no  independence  the

interests that are served and protected are  British

interests, because they are the sovereign power. But

with  independence, that is a different proposition.

The  interests  that  are  served  are  Malayan  and

Malaysian  interests. When they go down, it  is  not

because  they are fighting against the British,  but

because  they  are  trying to  down  an  independent

popularly-elected government, and they will  deserve

what they get. That is a different proposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you see, Mr Speaker, Sir, very far from not

discharging our sacred duty, I submit that  we  have

discharged our sacred duty in the best possible  way

in these given circumstances. There would be no talk

of  merger, no Malaysia, had we continued the policy

of the last Government. The last Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>



unfortunately  did not understand what  it  was  all

about.  I  do  not  blame them because  they  opened

Pandora's  Box. It all started with the  Member  for

Anson.   He   opened  it.  He  asked  for  Assistant

Ministers.   He  kept  on  opening  Pandora's   Box.

Suddenly out popped a weasel and all the Member  for

Cairnhill  could do was to put the weasel  back  and

close  Pandora's Box. I do not think, in  the  long

term,  that  that is the right approach, because  it

has  to  be  resolved not on a sectionalised  basis - Singapore alone -  because Singapore is not viable. If

we  go down, it is not Singapore that goes down, but

Malaya and Malaysia also go down.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The P.A.P. goes down.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The P.A.P. going down is an

irrelevance. It is an utter irrelevance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. was quite willing to give up after Hong

Lim  in  May 1961, when there was no merger  and  no

Malaysia  in  sight,  because it  meant  progressive

deterioration  in  the  employment  situation,  more

unrest, more discontent, and no solution. It is that

simple.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> There is no change.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, but there is. Now, new

vistas  open up a common market, security,  economic

expansion, political stability-



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Phoney.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b>- a bigger common market. Mr

Speaker,   Sir,   these   are   facts - facts!    They

miscalculated  and they helped us  inadvertently  to

bring  about merger and Malaysia, at a  pace  and  a

speed  which  we  never  imagined  possible  at  the

beginning  of 1961. And everyday that they  continue

this,  they  help us more. I say, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

that  we have not only discharged our duty, but  we

have  done  it  in  the way most beneficial  to  the

people of Singapore in the long run.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of Communism is a world problem. The

problem  of  Singapore is a very special  one  of  a

small contained island dependent for its economic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>



survival on the Federation of Malaya.  It  is

not our business to run this as an appendage. Either

we  are part of the whole and the whole survives, or

we  are  not  interested in keeping  this  appendage

going,  kept down and contained for the  benefit  of

either   the  British  or,  for  that  matter,   the

Federation    Government.    If    the    Federation

Government's attitude had been that Singapore  meant

nothing to them and could go down the drain, then  I

say, so it would have happened. Logic, aided by  the

vivid  examples  of  their  own  postures  and  wild

statements, has brought about this sudden  change - a

realisation of the vital interdependence of the  two

territories  and  the vital interdependence  of  the

five territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the same time, let me explain, and they

know  full well how we kept the situation contained.

None  of  those whom we suspected of being insincere

when  they signed these documents were given  access

to  secret or confidential files. None of those whom

we  suspected  of being insincere when  they  issued

those  documents pledging support for  the  P.A.P.'s

policy  of  merger and Malaysia and a non-Communist,

socialist  Malaya  were ever given  their  citizenship. We are not going to be pushed and coerced into

doing  that.  Whether  Jamit  Singh  shouts  "Keras,

keras"  two-times or ten times, he does not get  his

citizenship.  Nor will Mr Fong Swee  Suan  get  his

citizenship.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Go to Tanjong Pagar.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is all right. We shall go

back.  We are not running away. We do not intend  to

run  away whatever our shortcomings. The Member  for

Thomson ought to know us long enough to realise that

we stay and fight for what we believe in. We are not

interested  in forming a new coalition to  keep  the

Government  going. If this Government is voted  out,

it will put down its responsibilities and discharge

itself  of  its obligations. But let me  inform  the

Member   for   Thomson - if  he  has  not   done   the

calculation - the boys behind him have done so-



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> He is a parasite. [Laughter]



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Confidence motion! Who wants a

general  election and defeat merger and Malaysia  in

the melee of a general election? The Member for Hong

Lim is an extremely alert-



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Let us have a general election

now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Now he wants a general

election.  Now  he wants to be given an  opportunity

when  he  knows he is absolutely safe.  He  knew  he

would be absolutely safe, so he voted with them. Mr

Speaker, Sir, we are glad that the situation is what

it  is, because it helped to bring a catalyst to the

whole situation. The pace at which events take place

and  develop will be quickened. He said that. He  is

on the record of this House that he does not want  a

general  election.  That  was  why  he  was   really

fighting us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Do not distort.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Hong Lim is a

much more seasoned Parliamentarian. He knows he  can

stand up on a point of elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It is in the Hansard, Sr.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.

The issue then was whether the White Paper should be

decided  in  a referendum or in a general  election.

From  what  we  know of a referendum and  a  general

election, we thought in a referendum there  will  be

only one issue, but in a general election there will

be  a confusion of issues. The situation has changed

now  because we know the Government is going to hold

a  sham referendum. Here we have a Government which

has  no majority. It is a minority government trying

to push through its White Paper proposals for a sham

referendum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for   Hong  Lim  will  get  himself  more  and  more

involved. All these things are on the record. He has

gone  on  record as saying that there should  be  at

least two questions posed - two alternatives - that  is

on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>



record. I am sending up for it, Mr Speaker. He does

not  want  a general election, because he  knows  he

will  be  corroded  with  this  process.  He  is  no

tenderfoot in this -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of clarification. Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I wish to remind the Prime  Minister

that those persons whom he smears as Communists  now

were with him fighting on the same platform together  on  the ground in the Hong Lim by-election. Still

how  many  votes could they get? Every time  we  are

ready  to  go  down  to  the people  for  a  general

election-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Big words which he knows will

never  be taken on. If they were to be taken on,  he

would be absent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Because you are scared.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, no, it does not matter

what   happens   to  us.  We  will   discharge   our

responsibilities,  because if we resigned  we  would

let down the people who have faith and confidence in

us,  who want to see Malaysia through. That  is  the

reason.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> opened his despatch box.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Pandora's Box!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am sorry, Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  am  not opening Pandora's Box. There is only  one

box  inside.  This is what the Member for  Hong  Lim

said - this  was  on  the 17th of April,  the  Revised

Transcript, page 36 [Vol. 17 No. 8, Col. 813]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If the worst comes to the worst and the people

were  asked  what type of merger they would  prefer,

then  the  ballot paper should put forward  the  two

alternatives which the two groups of Parties in this

Assembly have supported.'



<br><br>No  question of yes and no. Two alternatives - we gave

them  two.  If  they want three, we will  give  them

three.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Why put in an alternative?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Why put in an alternative, Mr

Speaker? Everybody knows this is not in the  larder.

It is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>



something more than what any other State has got.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is not for you to decide. It

is for the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, it is for the Secretary-General of the Barisan Sosialis to bring up an

exchange  of  letters between him and the  Tunku  to

show that that is an alternative. If he produces  an

exchange of letters, I will put that willingly  down

as  an  alternative.  He  produces  an  exchange  of

letters which said, "kind and warm regards", and the

other party was so surprised he thanked him for  the

"warm and kind regards". [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I remind the Barisan

Sosialis  that there is a guillotine at 12 midnight,

and  if  they  interject, I cannot  stop  the  Prime

Minister from answering them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We are a minority government

and  therefore We can be voted out. Collect 26 votes

and  vote  us out. I say we are properly  discharged

from our responsibilities, but as long as we are not

discharged   from   our   responsibilities   in    a

constitutional  way,  it is our  duty  to  see  this

through whatever the threats, whatever the price  we

pay  personally for it. Sir, they can choose Tanjong

Pagar.  Let  them all turn up at Tanjong  Pagar.  So

what? So we shall do what is right by the people.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Go to Cairnhill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We will meet them. If they are

so  confident, Mr Speaker, Sir, why do not  the  13

Barisan Members resign?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Opposition Members:</b> Shame, shame!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Prove to us-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Now I think I must ask the

Barisan  Sosialis  not  to interject.  We  are  just

wasting  time  and we are going far  away  from  the

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, we ended the last session

on  a motion of confidence called by the Government.

They  did not want a motion of confidence. "Withdraw

it, withdraw it." was the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>



plea.  "We all supported the Government."  That  was

the  plea. They had the choice then to vote  against

the  Government and show their displeasure, but  the

people  supported the Government. We must carry  on.

It  is  our sacred duty. They wanted us to carry  on

and  hoped to capture us from the rear. But we  were

fully  aware  of  the  problems connected  with  the

united front.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim is an experienced hand. He

was  booted out in 1957 by the machinations of these

boys.  And  he  talks about fighting on  the  ground

together. They were fighting against us whenever  it

suited  them. He knew it. That is why he has got  it

in   his  Constitution - cadre  membership - and   the

Central  Committee  is elected only  once  in  three

years,  not  like the P.A.P. Ours  is  once  in  two

years. We meet regularly bi-annually. His is once in

three  years.  And the Rules of the Party  are  such

that  nobody  can  capture it without  his  consent.

[Laughter]   It  shows  him  to  be   an   extremely

experienced man. They fixed him in 1957; we got  him

unfixed. That was our misfortune, we trusted him. So

we bear the cross. But they are not going to fix him

again.  He does not want them running around  fixing

him. We know that; he knows that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Cairnhill has no great

affection   for  me.  We  fought  many   a   battle;

temperamentally  and  ideologically,  we  are  poles

apart.  But can he afford to face his own supporters

and  say  he  let  the  country  down  and  not  the

Government down? It is no longer a question  of  the

P.A.P.  Government. Everybody knows  that  it  is  a

question  of  either merger and survival  or  chaos,

trials  and tribulations before ultimate merger.  Do

we  avoid the trials and the tribulations?  That  is

the issue. And every vote against the Government  is

a vote for the trials and tribulations. That is what

it amounts to. I say that there is no need for us to

try  and  go  round  and lobby  in  order  to  foist

ourselves  with responsibilities. The responsibility

is there. If any Member on the other side gets 26 to

vote us out, constitutionally we are discharged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me explain the other ways in which we

feel we have discharged our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>



sacred  duty. I say this hesitantly, in case  it  is

believed that we are immodest. But very few  men  in

Singapore  and few women at that, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

would  have  taken it upon themselves to  dig  their

toes  in the face of everything that the Communists

could  throw at us. The easier way was to play their

game  and cover up, push along, improvise and  carry

on  the idea of peace for our time, but disaster for

the  country,  while they built  up  more  and  more

ramifications  to  undermine  the  State.  We  never

allowed  that, Mr Speaker, Sir. Now, for the  first

time, the issue is solemnly and clearly posed to the

people. This is no humbug. "Bogey," says the  Member

for  Queenstown.  Is Chin Peng a  bogey;  is  he  a

ghost?  I  do not know if the Member for  Queenstown

looks  up the meaning of these words. I do not think

Chin Peng is a bogey. He is real.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Not something you can see, is

it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We do not let these chaps make

us  lose  sleep,  Sir, I can assure the  Member  for

Queenstown  that  I  sleep well at  nights.  I  take

regular exercise and I am fighting fit. For it is my

job  to  discharge these responsibilities and nobody

is  going to get us away from it. And Chin  Peng  or

Ching  Siong, Sir - I read in the papers today  and  I

thought  it read rather well. Is he a bogey?  He  is

real. We know him for so many years.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> He is a nice chap.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> He is a nice chap. More the

pity  of it! Gone the wrong way, on the wrong  side!

But  what can we do? Does it mean therefore that  we

yield,  we surrender, just because some of them  are

nice chaps? But some of them are ruthless chaps, Mr

Speaker, Sir, let us make no mistake about  that.  I

say  that  the sacred duty was discharged by  baring

the  facts to the people and carrying the fight into

the open. We could have concealed the fight, covered

up  the  tracks, carried on for five years, and  for

five years more. Sir, we are better able to give the

Communists a respectable cover. One of the  greatest

misfortunes of the Member for Queenstown is that  he

has a sense of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>



humour  and  every time he goes into  his  long  and

lengthy  tirades, at the end of it  all,  the  utter

silliness  and stupidity and comicality  of  it  all

strikes  him,  and  he  bursts  into  uncontrollable

laughter. He has got an engaging characteristic.  He

plays  his  role, difficult though  it  may  be.  He

rants, he gets angry; he puts on the act. All  these

lengthy pages - he does not speak in those words  and

phrases. Those are words and phrases that the Member

for   Thomson  read  out  yesterday - the   words   of

revolution,  anger  of  the people,  turn  to  other

alternatives, traitors. But at the end  of  it  all,

the   silliness  of  it  strikes  the   Member   for

Queenstown, and he is in a fit of merriment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> You act very well.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We have done our duty by

baring  this. The fight now moves into a new  phase.

That  is  our sacred duty - to carry it into  the  new

phase  without allowing the harmony that now  exists

between the people to be  cracked. Because once  that

is  cracked,  it  will never be put together  again.

They know it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well. Mr Speaker, Sir, I say therefore that the

first  sacred duty to the people was to  ensure  the

permanent  security  and  prosperity  of  Singapore,

which  is  only  possible  in  a  merger  with   the

Federation.  Any  other way meant  isolation,  meant

playing  to  the  Communists. It is  they  who  want

Singapore  to  remain a colony. Full internal  self-government,  abolish the Security Council - they  will

be  quite  happy. Because then the common  enemy  is

there - British  colonialism - and all those  who  fight

like  them  are anti-colonialists; whether  you  are

fighting  for  a Communist cause or a  non-Communist

cause,  you  are together, you must be, because  the

common   enemy   is  colonialism.   So   they   want

colonialism  for  their  purpose.  Their  logic   is

simple, because without the British, the Member  for

Havelock  becomes  an  aider  and  abettor  of   the

Communist movement. With the British, the Member for

Havelock  is  an  active  fighter  of  anti-colonial

revolution. But how can he be an active  fighter  of

anti-colonial  revolution if  the  colonialists  are

gone? That is the simple logic. It is not only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>



his  bosses who can think these things out;  so  can

others.  That is why they have a vested interest  in

colonialism. There is a word to be made  use  of  in

order  that they can expand on a broad front, absorb

all  classes, and using the words of the Member  for

Thomson's    resolution   yesterday,    Sir - workers,

students,  rural dwellers. If you use a simple  word

like  "peasants", it is too reminiscent of the great

lines of workers and peasants of China; so that is a

bit  tricky.  So  do not use such words;  change  to

"rural   dwellers".  They  only  forgot  the  grave-diggers,  Sir. They represent all classes, including

the grave-diggers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, what therefore is the significance of

this  amendment? The significance is this,  that  in

the opinion of the Member for Cairnhill, that is the

only  way  to deal with the Communists. We disagree.

But  we  say quite clearly that that is one  of  the

ways in which the Communists have been dealt with. I

have  said  all this before. The Member for  Thomson

always  quotes little bits that suit him;  he  never

quotes  the bits that do not suit him, made  on  the

same   occasion.   That   all   these   methods   of

"containment"  are of no value, unless  the  general

situation is kept out of it. It is like a  sick  man

in  a  community. It is no use having  a  quarantine

station  for  people  with tuberculosis  unless  the

general health of your population is good. Then  you

quarantine those that carry the virus and  you  keep

those  who  are  healthy,  healthy.  But  when  your

general  standard  of  health  is  down  because  of

poverty,  malnutrition and bad housing,  you  cannot

quarantine  the whole nation. That is the  point  we

make.  Let  me say this: a quarantine is a  valuable

method  of  containing the virus and  from  time  to

time,  regrettable though it may  be,  it  would  be

necessary-



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> To get a vaccine.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> True, I am reminded by my

colleague,  the  Deputy Prime Minister that  in  the

quarantine,  we  produce  an  anti-toxin  which   is

another necessary aspect of this whole process.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, our first duty is to keep the population

healthy.   That  we  will  secure  through  economic

expansion and prosperity; otherwise I say  it  is  a

waste  of time trying to do this. You will  have  to

quarantine  finally  the whole  of  Singapore.  With

growing   unemployment,   no   economic   expansion,

frustration,   and  bitterness,   the   basis   will

disappear  and  the  whole  thing  will  go   in   a

turbulent, and riotous and chaotic mess. But when we

have  ensured  that  standards  will  be  kept   up,

progress will be made, nutrition is forthcoming, and

better and better houses, better and better schools,

more  and  more factories, more and more  jobs  with

better  and better wages, then we isolate those  who

are unhealthy. Of course, we will try and bring them

back to health, Mr Speaker, Sir, We will feed them,

look after them-



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> And inject them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes. We will try our best, Mr

Speaker, Sir. All the known vaccines will be  tried;

all  the  latest in antibiotics. Sir, when  we  took

office - although these men fought against us  to  fix

us  and they fixed the Member for Hong Lim they were

in   Changi  Prison,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,   and   we

transferred  them  to St. John's Island  where  they

could get the sea breeze and open air-sports, basket

ball,  night reading, and even swimming! And I say - I

do  not  claim  credit for that,  but  that  is  our

humanity;  we  tried to do something for  them.  And

many  of them have been rehabilitated, recovered  in

health,  reacquired their balance, their ideological

serenity restored, and they have been released.  And

so  the  process  goes  on. But  it  must  be  in  a

contained  situation.  The  general  situation  must

first  be  firm, solid and healthy, and then  it  is

possible to deal with those infected. Those infected

would have to be dealt with. I mean, let us be quite

brutal  and  frank  about  these  things.  They  are

unpleasant  things, Mr Speaker, Sir. For  instance,

but  for  them,  I think the Member for  Queenstown,

despite  all his personal aberrations from  time  to

time,  will still be quite a reasonable fellow.  But

they infected him with something, that inspired  and

aroused tremendous hopes,-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You have sold out the rights of

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> -aspirations, ambitions,

and  he  went careering back. He went back  true  to

form,  what  they  call recidivist  tendencies,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir.  He has always had  a  hankering  for

games  of  chance. He is one of the great  names  in

some of the clubs in Singapore He is a man who takes

chances, a brave man. He has been-



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> What has this got to do with

the motion, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not think it has anything to do

with the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It has.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Has it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I was explaining how to a

certain   extent  I  agreed  with  the  Member   for

Cairnhill, and that is, in some cases, a sacred duty

to  prevent people from being enticed into games  of

chance,  which is exactly what is happening  in  his

case.  He  went back, true to form - put everything

he  had  on  this mad gamble - this time for  absolute

power.  We wanted to give up after Hong Lim. He  was

encouraged  by  certain elements  whom  I  will  not

mention, but everybody knows, and the bid was  made.

And now this mad venture has started.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Sir, to that extent, I agree with the Member

for  Cairnhill. But I disagree with him utterly  and

completely that this is the basic remedy. I say this

is the way to contain it, but the final solution - the

long-term  and enduring answer - is economic progress.

I  do not know whether the Member for Cairnhill  has

read  Rostow on "Economic Growth" and a few  others.

Well, they explain how these things take place.  You

get  off  into a stage of industrialisation like  an

aeroplane taking off from an aerodrome. And that  is

what  we must do once we take off. In no country  in

the  civilised  and industrialised  world  have  the

Communist Party been able to assume power when there

has  been a high rate of economic growth. They  have

assumed  power only when there has been no  economic

growth, when tomorrow is worse than today and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>



day  after  tomorrow  is worse than  tomorrow;  then

despair sets in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I say, Mr Speaker, Sir, very far from

not having discharged our duty, we have right up  to

date  discharged to the best of our ability what  we

consider  and  what we know to be in  the  long-term

interests  of  the  people of Singapore.  First,  to

ensure   our   economic  well-being  in   a   larger

federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Malaysia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> In Malaya and in Malaysia.

Then  with  a  healthy economy, merger and  Malaysia

will sustain its growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give this example again to Members on the

Opposition   side,  and  I  think   this   will   be

appreciated particularly by the Member for Nee  Soon

because he understands it. If a man has something to

live  for - if today he has a bicycle and  is  earning

enough,  feeding  his  family  in  nice  and  decent

surroundings, and with enough to buy  a  scooter  on

the  hire purchase - from the bicycle he goes to the

scooter - that is tangible progress. And he would  not

listen to all this wild and silly talk of revolution

and  violence. And if from the scooter he  is  doing

well  enough to go to one of the Mini-minor  cars -

there is the 500, the 600, the Mini-Cooper which  is

revved  up and can do 100 m.p.h. - he can take a  girl

friend  out  for  a  spin, that  is  reasonable  and

tolerable. After all, that is what they are fighting

for even in a Communist society and even in Moscow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that they have got the industrial take off,

they give tremendous cheers to jazz music.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Nylon stockings, too.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> And all the best things in

life. And if from the scooter to the small car, they

can,  like the Member for Thomson, go on to a bigger

car-



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> The Member for Nee Soon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Member for Nee Soon, I beg

his   pardon - Opel  Rekord,  two-tone,  adds  to  the

glamour of it all,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> White-wall tyres.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> White-wall tyres. Now, Sir,

there is then no frustration. But if the Member  for

Nee Soon has not got white-wall tyres, if last year,

his Renault fell to bits and he had to go back to  a

scooter and then this year from the scooter he  goes

down  to  the bicycle, we will now find a  different

Member for Nee Soon. Right at the moment he is a man

at  peace with himself, but, mind you, a bit fearful

of the hazards of the outer world. But nevertheless,

as  I  told  him publicly, he is not a  man  who  is

either  by  inclination or by  circumstances  to  be

forced  into violent action. And he assured me  that

there  will be no violent action whatsoever,  and  I

accept  his  assurance. I have no doubts whatsoever,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, that if you can go from a Renault

to an Opel Rekord - and with easy small numbers - then

I  say  there is hope. I do not speak in disparaging

terms.    I   say   that   is   the   business    of

society - incentives. People live in  this  world  for

fulfilment  of  themselves, be it a game  of  chance

whether  at  the  table or in the  larger  field  of

politics,  be  it  an  expression  of  their   alter

ego - whatever  it is - there must be  some  consummation

in  life.  I  am  told, Sir, there is  nothing  more

frustrating than to be a spinster all one's life.  I

am quite sure that is what happens when a population

goes  down;  when bicycles stay as bicycles.  Worse,

you  go  on foot and shoes get worse and you  go  to

sandals. If that happens, then frustration sets  in.

But  where  there is no frustration, when  there  is

freedom and liberty of movement, speech, expression,

personal  enjoyment of one's likes and dislikes,  so

long  as it does not affect the community at  large,

then  there  is  no violent upheaval.  There  is  no

manning  of  the  barricades. They  tried  it,  Sir,

several  times  in  the last one  year.  First,  the

unions  and  then  the  People's  Association.   All

flopped. We left them alone. They were doing  things

sometimes  which were unlawful; for  instance,  like

putting up tents. We did not mind. Is it our  sacred

duty  to lock these chaps up? They were just stooges

in  the game. I say no. It is not the purpose of it.

Focus  it  on the main actors, These are  the  minor

parts being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>



played  by the minor people. They are the supporting

cast.  Leave  them alone. The Work Brigade  flopped.

Why?  If  there  was  what they  called  in  Marxist

terminology   the  pre-conditions   of   revolution,

conditions of despair where the Government is unable

to  resolve them, people have no confidence that the

Government  can resolve it, or worse, the Government

knows it cannot resolve it, then you have the people

ready  to man barricades. And they have not got  it.

They  tried it with the Chinese Secondary IV boycott

examinations. A happy population, reasonably content -

I   am   not   saying  that   they   are   ideal

conditions - but   sufficiently  good   to   hold   an

expectation  of  better  for tomorrow.  The  parents

swept aside the petty little dictators who tried  to

prevent  their  fellow  students  from  taking   the

examinations.  But  they  went  in   to   take   the

examinations, without police intervention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They called for another strike of students

recently to stop the Commission of Inquiry. Is  that

a  bogey? What is happening causes a great  deal  of

embarrassment.   Everyday   they   see   this   with

discomfort. Every Barisan issue has long  scurrilous

tirades  on  the  Commission of Inquiry  which  they

supported  in  this House. How does the  Member  for

Queenstown  explain  all  this?  He  supported   the

Commission  of  Inquiry.  Now  he  is  throwing  the

spotlight  on what is going on. It is like switching

on.  I  do  not know, Mr Speaker, Sir, whether  the

Member  for Queenstown has ever tried this. You  put

your foot into a machine - I am sure he has put it on

the chest. I have tried it with my shoes. You go  to

a  shoe shop. You put your foot on it. You switch on

the  button and you can see the bones of your  foot.

That is what has happened. They want a Commission of

Inquiry.  The X-ray is put on by popular request.  I

say here, too, by popular request we leave it to the

Opposition. If they say this is what is right,  then

we  will convey this to the proper authorities. This

is  a  directive to the final authority for security

in  Singapore. We shall convey it. But as far as we,

as  the Government, are concerned, our duty has been

discharged in assuring long-term security,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>



long-term prosperity, for there is no alternative to

that.  Otherwise short-term from time to  time.  The

quarantine  method is useless in a healthy  society.

If  Members  on  the  other side  believe  that  the

quarantine  should be used right now, then  let  the

Opposition so decide.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have just

way?

standing  up. Is it a point of order,  or  is  it  a

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I want to know whether it is a

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The U.S.I.S. sends books and

talked  so much about the Marshall Plan and how  the

Marshall  Plan  helped  to  revive  and  resuscitate

Western Europe. I do not know. He might be a  second

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The Member for Anson?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, the Prime Minister started

talking about how Communism wanted to attack  Europe

after the Second World War. He was relating how  the

Marshall Plan rejuvenated Europe because it  brought

economic  prosperity, so much so that they now  have

this  Economic  Community of Europe and  the  United

Kingdom  is  even trying to join it. But talking  of

this,  he  missed the most basic and fundamental - his

usual pet words, "basic and fundamental" - reason  why

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>



how such poverty came about. I am sure that since he

has  been relating about words of Marx and  how  the

Communists  used  words,  he  must  know  the  basic

analysis of poverty. How it came about-

Singapore  by  not restraining known  communist  and

communist-front   leaders  from   manipulating   and

controlling organisations like the Barisan Sosialis,

thus  endangering the well-being of  the  people  of

Singapore".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the words proposed to be

added, be  there added."



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

propose to take very long because I realise there is

a guillotine on this and we still have to go back to

the  main motion. But I, of course, realise why  our

Prime  Minister  was giving a long  thesis.  He  had

hoped to stall in order that we might not be able to

debate  our main motion. Of course, it is  possible,

now  that  there is talk of his going to the  United

Nations,  that  he  wants  to  make  some  political

capital  out  of  this  before going.  As  everybody

knows, whoever wants to go to the United



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>



States must first proclaim himself as a big anti-Communist,  otherwise  he  might  not  get  a   good

reception there. And the United Nations are situated

in the United States.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kandasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kandasamy:</b> On a point of explanation, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> No, Sir. Time is rather short.

Of  course, I know that the Prime Minister had hoped

for a chance to replace maybe Chiang Kai-shek.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member for Queenstown

has  drawn the attention of this House to  the  fact

that   there  is  a  guillotine.  He  seems  to   be

completely  irrelevant.  He  has  lost,   I   think,

according  to  my  reckoning, two  minutes  speaking

irrelevantly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> No, Sir, I do not intend to be

irrelevant  except to say that what we said  of  the

possibility of the Prime Minister being  the  United

Nations  representative for the Federation  is  not

completely untrue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendment by the Member for Cairnhill to

my  mind is very dishonest. I think this is  one  of

his  usual double talk somersaults. It is very clear

that  the S.P.A. want to support the P.A.P. but dare

not  do  so openly. I can quote the instance of  the

S.P.A. objecting very strongly to clause 29 of  the

Referendum   Bill   in  Select  Committee   but   on

recommittal abstaining instead of really supporting,

and so indirectly supporting the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can say this to the Member for Cairnhill: that

when  we moved this motion of no confidence  in  the

Government,  there  was no intention  whatsoever  to

discredit the S.P.A. as he had thought. You can read

the  words of the motion and it says, "no confidence

in  the  P.A.P. Government". Therefore, if the  SPA.

agree  with us, namely, that they have no confidence

in  the  P.A.P. Government, whatever the reason  may

be,  they  still can join us in voting  against  the

P.A.P. But the reason given by the S.P.A. cannot  be

acceptable  to us because the amendment  only  falls

into the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>



trap  of the P.A.P. and allow them an excuse to  use

dictatorial methods against any organisation that is P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, Sir, at the present moment, there are

a  lot  of  people in Singapore who are against  the

dishonest referendum and against the sell-out of the

P.A.P., and therefore they combine together to  take

concerted  action against the P.A.P. And  since  these

organisations  put  up effective opposition  to  the

P.A.P., the obvious line left for the Government  is

to  smear these organisations as so called Communist

and   Communist   front   organisations.   I   hope,

therefore,  that  the S.P.A.,  if  they  are  really

sincere and honest and if they really think that the

P.A.P. are no good and should not have the confidence

of  the  people, will support our amendment instead.

But  it  is  curious that although the S.P.A. agree

with  us that they have no confidence in the  P.A.P.

Government,  yet  they turned round  to  attack  the

mover of the original motion instead. This is one of

those somersaults typical of the Member of Cairnhill

and,   I, suppose,  this  is  the  result  of   his

experience  as a politician for the past  12  years.

This  is  no surprise to us, Sir. Of course,  as  we

have seen all along, the S.P.A. tactics have been to

embarrass the P.A.P. and at the same time,  to  join

the  P.A.P. in smearing the Barisan Sosialis.  I  do

not  know what the Member for Cairnhill hopes to get

out of this. But-



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Another Tun!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I do not know, maybe a double

bar;  but  if the S.P.A. really are sincere and  agree

with  us that they have no confidence in the  P.A.P.

Government, then when it comes to voting,  let  them

join us in voting against the P.A.P. Government.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I speak on the amendment

moved by the Member for Cairnhill, namely, to add to

the original motion the words "in that it has failed

to  discharge  its  sacred duty  of  protecting  the

internal  security of Singapore by  not  restraining

known communist



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>



and communist-front leaders from manipulating

and   controlling  organisations  like  the  Barisan

Sosialis,  thus  endangering the well-being  of  the

people  of Singapore". Sir, I think we should  first

attempt  a definition of some of the terms  used  in

the  amendment. First, the words "sacred duty", that

is,  the sacred duty of the Government is to protect

the  internal security of Singapore. I do not  think

this  duty is sacred. I think it is the normal  duty

of  any  government to see that  law  and  order  is

maintained.  There  is  nothing  sacrosanct  in  any

government  performing that sort of  function.  Then

the method of maintaining or protecting the internal

security  of Singapore, according to the Member  for

Cairnhill, is to restrain the known Communists. What

does  the  word "restraint" mean? Members will  know

that every time the Member for Cairnhill speaks  on

the  subject  of  dealing with  the  Communists,  he

recommends  only  one method, and he  puts  it  into

several ways - put them in a place where they  can  do

no  harm. Now he used the word "restrain", when  all

he meant is to arrest them, put them in Changi Gaol,

put them out of circulation. That is the meaning  of

the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Correct.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member for Cairnhill says

"Correct". Sir, it is a very strange thing that  one

section  of the Opposition should ask us to lock  up

the  Members of the Opposition, while the  Opposition

that is supposed to be  the target of security action

constantly calls us Fascists. One or the other  must

be  wrong. There is a contradiction here. If we  are

Fascists,  then  it  is quite  unnecessary  for  the

Member  for Cairnhill to urge us on this  course  of

action.  We would have done it long ago. Of  course,

the  Fascists not only restrain the people, they not

only  lock them up in prison, but suddenly you  find

prisoners  completely disappearing and no  trace  of

them is found. So, Sir, it is obvious that when  the

Barisan   Members,  particularly  the   Member   for

Queenstown, accuse us of Fascism, they do  not  know

what  Fascism  means and they do not know  what  the

Fascists would do to people like him.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why cannot the Government agree with this

amendment?  The  Member  for  Cairnhill  is   always

instigating us to lock up the Communists  and  their

fellow  travellers. We can understand  this  easily,

because that was the way he dealt with them  in  the

past.  This is the method which he thinks will solve

the  problem. I could perhaps mention that it is not

only the S.P.A. Members who think that we should  do

it.  I recollect the rather hilarious occasion  when

one  of  the Barisan Sosialis leaders, Mr Woodhull,

and I were having a conversation in the C.P.A. Room.

We talked about how democratic the P.A.P. is, how we

believed  in allowing the Barisan Sosialis  all  the

opportunities to propagate their views, and he said,

"Come  off it! Come off it! You surely do  not  mean

that'?"  Well, the long and short of it is  that  it

ended in an uproar, and he said, "Why don't you lock

us  up?  You have got no guts. Tun Lim Yew  Hock  at

least  had  the  courage of his convictions  and  he

proceeded  to  massacre  the  Communists  and  their

sympathisers when he thought he had to  do  it."  He

thought  we should do the same thing, and  the  only

reason why we did not act in this manner is that  we

lacked the courage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is a point of view which I think we must

dispute.   People   can   point   to   the   various

shortcomings of the P.A.P. Some may be right, others

are not, but I do not think that lack of courage can

be one of our shortcomings. If we desist from taking

security  action against the Communists, the  reason

is not that we lack the courage to do it. The reason

is  that  in  the present situation  there  are  far

better and more effective ways of dealing with them.

Sir,  as  you  know, there is a saying  which  goes,

there  are  more  ways of killing a  cat  than  just

drowning  it  in cream. In the present situation  in

Singapore, our stand is that so far as the Communist

threat is concerned, we have never attempted on  any

occasion  to minimise it. So far as this  threat  is

concerned,  direct  security  action  against  them,

blocking  them up, putting them away in Changi  Gaol

is not the correct



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>



way,  for various reasons. The most obvious is  that

the   Singapore  Government  is  not  the   ultimate

authority  on this matter. The ultimate power  rests

with  the  internal Security Council  in  which  the

Singapore  Government  has minority  representation.

Therefore, if we were to assume powers which  we  do

not really have, the Government could easily, and  I

believe quite rightly, be charged with taking action

on  behalf  of some other interests, not necessarily

the interests of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is a more fundamental and more basic

reason why the game cannot be  played in this way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Do not filibuster. There is no

time.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Member for Queenstown

believes  that filibustering is the sole prerogative

of himself and his Members. I am trying to develop a

serious  theme in which one line of action has  been

recommended to the Government. True, if we  were  to

accept this line of action



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Come to the point on the main

issue.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Member for Queenstown

is  a  person who always raises his hands  in  anger

when there is any attempt to curb freedom of speech.

There you are.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I have already told the

Member for Queenstown and the Barisan Sosialis that

if  they keep interjecting I cannot stop the  person

who  is  speaking from replying to the  interjection

and taking up time. I think the Minister for Finance

is  quite in order in answering this amendment which

has been proposed. Dr Goh.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, as I was saying, there is

a  more basic and important reason why resort to the

use  of  knife must be refrained from.  This  really

stems  from  the  nature  of  the  Communist  threat

itself - the  very nature of the movement, the  system

of  the  organisation, and the way they  attempt  to

manipulate persons and organisations in our  society

to advance their own long-term political interests.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I explain what I mean by the nature of the

Communist threat in our present society so  that  it

will be quite clear that once the real nature of the

threat is recognised and is known, then the unwisdom

of  taking the course of action recommended in  this

amendment  would  be  apparent to  all?  On  several

occasions,  when  we  on the  Government  side  drew

attention   to   Communist   activities,   Communist

agitation   among   students,  the   trade   unions,

penetration  of political Parties like  the  Barisan

Sosialis and so forth, the reply always thrown  back

at us was, how many known Communists? The last known

estimate was 300. And they said, "How can 300 men be

so  dangerous to society?" Some of the  persons  who

make   the  statement  honestly  believe  that   300

Communists pose no threat to 1,700,000 people.  They

say  all  this repetition, emphasis on the Communist

threat  is a red bogey; I mean they believe that  it

is  a red bogey, that 300 people cannot possibly  be

any  danger to society. But there are others who are

fully  aware of what the real situation is and  join

the  chorus, thereby hoping to save themselves  from

embarrassing attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Communist Party as a political force in

any   society  is  always  a  minority  group.   The

Communist  Party is not like a football  club  or  a

turf  club  which  wants to recruit  more  and  more

members.  That has never been the way in  which  the

Communist Party operate and the way they operate  in

Singapore.  The  Communist  Party  is  a  leadership

elite.  They  themselves  in  their  own  literature

consider  themselves  as  a Marxist-Leninist  combat

party,  the  vanguard of the proletariat revolution.

And  a  member of the Communist Party is a full-time

dedicated  professional revolutionary, nothing  more

than that and nothing less than that. If we want  to

find  an equivalent in our society to this full-time

dedicated  revolutionary professional,  the  nearest

analogy  we  can find is that of a Catholic  priest,

equally dedicated to the faith. They are even better

indoctrinated  in  the school of theology  and  they

organise  themselves  into a disciplined  hierarchy.

Supposing you have in Singapore 300 Catholic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>



priests I do not know whether we have that  number

here,  Mr  Speaker - but supposing you do, then  they

can  extend  their influence; one priest can  extend

his  influence  over a herd. What is the  term  they

call it, Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The diocese.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The diocese. Yes, he is the

shepherd and one of them can bring several hundreds,

or  thousands. When we have 300 Catholic priests,  I

say you have a very powerful force.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of order, Sir, Is

all this relevant, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I understood the Minister for Finance

to  be   drawing an analogy between a Roman  Catholic

priest and a Communist.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, this is immediate and

direct because I say that you cannot understand  the

threat   posed  to  our  society  by  the  Communist

movement  unless you understand the  nature  of  the

movement,  the  manner in which it is organised  and

the  type of men that run these various organs. Sir,

the  full-time cadre is distinct from  amateurs  and

occasional misfits which they collect now  and  then

into  the  movement,  misfits like  the  Member  for

Queenstown, for instance. The full-time cadre  knows

what  he  wants. He is schooled in the  ideology  of

Marxism  and  Leninism.  He  is  trained;  years  of

training  go  into the upbringing  of  a  cadre.  In

Singapore, for instance, in Malaya, for that matter,

the  prospective cadre is not just  given  an  entry

form; then he signs, pays two dollars and joins  the

movement.  He  is selected, he starts in  a  primary

school, nurtured and-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think now I must stop the

Minister  for Finance. I think he is going into  too

many details. We do not want to hear how a Communist

cadre  is  nurtured from childhood. Let us  come  to

this amendment itself.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> So, Sir, I think we will accept

this  proposition and I will not expand upon it  any

further since you say sufficient attention has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>



been paid to it. We accept this proposition that the

operator  is a person of very high calibre.  Now,  I

want  to describe how they set about their work.  So

far I have been speaking about general propositions,

but  I  think we can confine ourselves to Singapore

because  the subject of the motion is the threat  of

the  Communist movement in Singapore.  Sir,  if  you

have  lots  of these people around the  place,  each

knowing  that his job is to advance the  revolution,

each school trained in techniques of operation, then

what do they do? Mr Speaker, Sir, they do not  go

to  work and earn an income, get married, advance in

life,  climb up the social ladder, accumulate wealth

and so on. They do not do that.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> They join the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Among other things, Sir, they

penetrate and capture organisations. Sir, it  is  an

extraordinary fact that in almost all organisations,

that is, all associations of men, an active minority

can  always capture power. It is so in trade unions,

it is so possibly, for all I know, Mr Speaker, Sir,

in  professional bodies that people who are prepared

to  do  the work and be nominated to committees  can

always  be elected. I do not know why it is  so.  It

may be that it is some inherent lethargy in mankind,

some  aversion from doing committee work.  The  fact

remains  that given this lethargy or indifference

or  unwillingness  to provide leadership,  of  being

elected  to membership of committees and running  an

organisation, an active minority always wins, always

captures.  Therefore,  we have  in  Singapore  large

numbers  of  organisations and associations  in  key

fields  of  human  activities  which  are  easy   to

penetrate,  easy to capture, and in fact  have  been

penetrated  and  have been captured.  In  Singapore,

Sir,  we know what these associations are, who  they

are.  They  are  the  famous  trade  unions  of  the

S.A.T.U. group,  the  Old Boys'  Associations,  the

Rural  Dwellers  Association, the  Country  People's

Association, one group of the Hawkers' Union. These

are the associations that have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>



been  penetrated and are being used for united front

purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average man may say, what is the paint of

doing  all these things? Why do a small group - there

are  not  many,  just a few hundred,  and  they  are

energetic  young men do - these things?  What  purpose

does it serve?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give a very simple and clear example of the

tremendous  value and importance which  a  group  of

persons can get from penetrating and capturing these

organisations. Take the Referendum Bill. There was a

Select  Committee on it of which you, Mr  Speaker,

were the Chairman. You no doubt were fully aware

not  only of the contents of the memoranda  sent  by

these  associations, but you even met  some  of  the

honourable  gentlemen who purport  to  have  written

these memoranda. Sir, on an important issue such  as

the  Referendum  Bill,  a basic  important  national

issue  of the utmost importance, we find a group  of

just  a  few hundred persons running around.  Having

already got these organisations under their control,

they set out long memoranda attacking the Government

on  a  stand  which they knew would be   against  the

interests  of  the Communists and their  open  front

organisations. Now, that happened and we  have  here

the  Member  for Thomson who proclaimed, "These  are

persons  who  represented only one hundred  thousand

people or two hundred thousand," I forgot the  exact

figure. A hundred thousand, but in fact just  a  few

hundred energetic young men and women who have  done

this job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on the one side, this is what a determined

anti active minority of people are doing, presenting

forcefully  their  point of view. There  is  nothing

wrong  with  that  at all. It is highly  commendable

provided   the   motives   are   honest   and    the

representation is honest. Well, they have put  their

point  of view. Now, what of the real view  of  the

vast majority?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Mr

Speaker, Sir, on today's motion we have a guillotine

at 12 midnight and it seems that the Minister and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>



the Government Benches are filibustering so that the

Opposition  have no chance to speak on the  original

motion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was watching the position very

carefully. I think the Minister for Finance  is,  in

fact,  going  much too far away from the  amendment.

The  amendment  charges  the Government  for  having

failed  to  discharge its - sacred duty of protecting

the   internal   security  of   Singapore   by   not

restraining   known  communist  and  communist-front

leaders    from    manipulating   and    controlling

organisations. All he is doing now is to  say  that,

in  fact,  they  are  manipulating  and  controlling

organisations.  Having said that, I  think  that  is

enough and he should not go into further details. He

should  now come to the point and answer the  charge

as   to  why  these  communist  and  communist-front

leaders have not been restrained. Dr Goh.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> What I was saying is of the

essence  of  the argument. It is not  sufficient,  I

think,    to   say   that   they   are   controlling

organisations.  What is important is to  demonstrate

how  they  do it and why they do it. Otherwise,  how

can  we  ever put across the view that, taking  into

account the whole modus operandi of these groups, it

is  not  in  the interests of Singapore and  to  the

advantage  of the people of Singapore to  lock  them

up;  it  is  not in our interests to carry  out  the

policy recommended by the Member for Cairnhill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I was comparing what an active minority could

do  in  capturing associations presenting forcefully

their  point  of  view  as against  an  inert  large

minority, which has an opinion of its own no  doubt,

but  are  either incapable of organising  themselves

into  a  cohesive  and  vocal  organisation  or  are

unwilling  to  do  so. And I say,  so  long  as  the

majority  of  people,  either  through  laziness  or

through  ignorance, remain indifferent  to  what  is

going  on around them, then I say to take the action

recommended  by  the Member for Cairnhill  is  quite

wrong.   Put   it  this  way.  Can  I  explain   the

proposition  this way? Supposing we do  this;  these

birds disappear, then everyone - the majority of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>



people - will breathe a sigh of relief. Then they fall

back  on the old former state of indolence. Does  it

help  the  situation, Mr Speaker?  Does  it  really

help?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if by locking up these birds you can remove

the threat once and for all, then perhaps the Member

for  Cairnhill may have his point, but I  say  this,

that  does not happen. Remove them - the top leaders,

the  top  echelon, all known open front leaders - they

disappear,  you  may have peace and  quiet  for  two

years,  three  years,  four years;  then  the  whole

process   will  start  again, because  this   whole

movement is based on an ideology and ideas;  because

it  is a revolutionary and real political force;  it

has  its  own  methods of drawing on new  people  to

replace those that have been put away, and you solve

nothing at all. On the other hand, by so doing,  you

give  the majority - the inert majority - a false  sense

of  security for a few years at the end of which new

crises will develop. They will be jolted into a  new

feeling   of  danger;  they  may  bestir  themselves

perhaps  for a few months, a year or two.  Something

has  gone wrong; but they will not know what  to  do

about  it;  they will be running around  frightening

others. Then the demand may come from some to  stage

another lock-up. So this can go on ad infinitum  and

it does not solve the basic problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what is the correct way of

dealing with the situation? I say the correct way is

the way we are doing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Is that so?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Precisely. Matching them move

for  move,  manoeuvres for manoeuvre. Finally,  they

find themselves in a zugzwang. And this is important

because  we have matched their manoeuvres correctly.

Coming  back to the point of developing hundreds  of

cadres  penetrating and controlling associations  of

various  types  so that all can work together  in  a

united front. Now, the whole purpose of this  is  to

mount  excitement  not only among members  of  these

organisations but in the general population. Have  a

feeling

of  excitement,  of tension, of  crisis.  Do  so  by

attacking  an  enemy  whom you  present  as  utterly

wicked,   utterly   renegade,  utterly   traitorous,

Fascist; in other words, choose the enemy,  in  this

instance, the P.A.P. Government, call them all sorts

of names, mount hatred among the people, and tension

will  rise.  If they succeed, more and  more  people

will  rally  round to their banner,  more  and  more

bitterness will be felt against the Government until

the point of explosion is reached.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Singapore we have seen how the Communists,

through agitation by united front tactics, were able

on several occasions in the past to bring about just

this  critical situation. They got not merely  their

own  immediate followers but the general population,

or  the  majority  of the general  population,  with

them. 1955, 1956, 1957, or 1958 - three, four times -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> 1957.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It was not merely the few

hundred  energetic, well-trained disciplined  cadres

who  caused  the  security problem,  because  a  few

hundred people cannot do anything, but it is because

these  few  hundred  people had thousands  of  other

people  on  their side that they posed a  threat  to

security, and they were able to do that because they

had  out-manoeuvred the government of the day;  they

were  able to get the majority of people in a  state

of excitement and tension.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since more than a year ago the Communists and

their   stooges   in  the  Barisan   Sosialis   were

attempting  just this and no more - a  repetition  of

what they succeeded in doing in 1955, 1956 and 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would not weary you with all the details

but  merely refer to the several attempts they  made

to create trouble just mentioned - the episodes of the

People's  Association, the Work Brigade, the  middle

school examination boycott, strikes, this, that  and

the  other,  the  last  one, you  know,  polling  in

Tanjong  Pagar - each one we met them blow  for  blow,

round by round, and I say we did not go under,  they

did not get the better of us.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Do not filibuster.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, how can the Member for

Queenstown  say  I  am filibustering?  I  mean  just

because these blows hurt him. It is very relevant to

the issue. Did he not listen to the last sentences I

was  saying? Did he not listen when I said that  the

Communists and their stooges in the Barisan Sosialis

were mounting all this campaign of agitation against

us,  and I itemised them one by one? How can you say

it is filibustering?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the way to meet them is not to get rattled

when  these challenges come up but to meet  them  as

and when they come up, deal with each issue, resolve

them,  meet  them  with patience,  with  benevolence

even.   Where  firm  measures  are  required,   firm

measures   should  be  taken.  Where  flexible   and

reasonable   methods  are  required,  flexible   and

reasonable methods should be used. The net result is

that   over   all  these  months  of  agitation   or

penetration  or  manipulation,  running  around   in

circles, they got nowhere. Nobody is excited.  There

is  no feeling of tension in the city, although  the

Barisan  Sosialis pretends that there is. Of course,

this  goes  on.  We are prepared to meet  them,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I think we have already had Round  7.

The  Member  for Thomson says the final  round  will

kayo us. That will not happen, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Singapore the political scene is rather

sensitive and vulnerable, much more so than in other

societies.  Put  it  this  way,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir.

Perhaps  I will explain it in this way. I will  make

the  point which I want to make, more vividly  if  I

were  to relate a conversation I had [Interruption] - I beg your pardon?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must ask the Minister for

Finance  now  to wind up his speech. He has  already

taken three-quarters of an hour.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I just want to make this

last  point, and that is in the political  field  in

Singapore we are more vulnerable to the assaults  of

minorities - active minorities - than  other  societies

are.  I want to develop this point in a rather vivid

way. I have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>



trying  several ways to present this  fact,  to  put

this point across. I think the best way would be  to

relate  what  some Japanese civil servants  told  me

when  I  went there the first time. They were asking

about   the  Singapore  Government, who  were   the

Ministers  and  so  on.  They  asked,  "Who  is  the

Minister  for Home Affairs? How old is  he?"  They

thought  I was the youngest Minister in the Cabinet.

I  said,  "No, no, actually I am one of the oldest."

"How could it be? How old is your Home Minister?"  I

said  he has not reached the age of 30 yet, and they

were  absolutely  appalled. I mean,  they  say  this

thing cannot happen. Their Ministers are 60 plus and

70 plus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that in Singapore here you have - mind you,

I am not saying there is any demerit in being young,

far  from it - a very youthful Cabinet points to  the

fact  that there is something wrong somewhere.  This

sort of thing does not happen in normal societies. I

mean,  you take the age of Cabinet Ministers in  any

well ordered society, and it is usually 60 plus.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Has age got anything to do with

restraining Communist or Communist-front leaders?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I want to make this point

without further embellishment. Singapore society  is

usually   vulnerable   to  active   minorities.   In

Singapore,  with  rapid political  changes,  it  has

always been the younger people who, being more  bold

and more rash than their elders, are prepared to put

down their stake and make their bid for power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Like the Member for Queenstown.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> There are several reasons why

this  is so. I see the Member for Hong Lim glowering

at  me, so I will not go into these reasons, but  if

you, Mr Speaker, Sir, will just give me two minutes

more.  The  reason is that there is  no  traditional

leadership  in  this country. There  is  traditional

leadership  in  the  Federation  among   the   Malay

population.  Therefore,  it  is  not  possible   for

energetic  minorities to penetrate organisations  by

united front tactics to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>



capture  power.  But  in  Singapore,  there  is   no

traditional leadership. After all, Mr Speaker, Sir,

150  years  ago  there  were  only  300  persons  in

Singapore -  mostly  fishermen or pirates - and  people

have   been   coming  in  without  any   traditional

leadership as it is understood in societies  with  a

long   history.  This  poses  for  us  rather  acute

problems.  How can you maintain political  stability

in   a  situation  where  there  is  no  traditional

leadership,  where  an  active  minority  can  quite

easily   win  political  power  through   fair   and

democratic    means;   active   and   well-organised

minorities like the Malayan Communist Party which is

the  most  active,  the  best disciplined,  has  the

longest  history,  the  toughest,  and,  from   all

accounts,  persons to be reckoned with? But  I  say,

for  reasons which I have dealt with at some length,

at this stage of our historical development, to wade

into  them  in the manner prescribed and recommended

by  the Member for Cairnhill would be a grave error.

We  say  it is always better to match them blow  for

blow  in  the hope, in the expectation indeed,  that

more  and  more  people  will  understand  the  real

meaning  of what is going on. When you get more  and

more people understanding the real situation, then I

say we will be in a position to face the assault  of

this  minority group, however active  they  can  be,

however dedicated they can be. We can meet them, in

the words of Mao Tse-tung "with ease and poise".



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a matter of

fact,  there is no need to filibuster because  there

will   not  be  much  of  Opposition  news  in   the

newspapers anyhow. Sir, we are still debating on the

amendment  moved  by  the Member  for  Cairnhill.  I

oppose  the  amendment because  it  does  not  state

sufficiently  the  reasons  why  this  House  should

express   no  confidence  in  the  Government.   Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the main reason why  I  support  the

original  motion  is that it is different  from  the

Member for Cairnhill's amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You are scared of us, that is

why.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> My reason is that today this

Government is a minority Government.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of Order, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Member for Hong Lim

must  be  patient.  We are now  dealing  with  the

amendment.  Let  us  complete the  debate  on  the

amendment.  If  there is no other  Member  on  the

Opposition  side  who  wishes  to  speak  on   the

amendment, I propose that we put the Question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> The amendment moved by the

S.P.A. serves only to sidetrack the issue,  which

is  whether  this  Government is morally  fit  and

competent to govern at this moment, because it  is

a  minority government. In the past week  we  have

tipped  the scales. Today we on this side  of  the

House have 26 Members and there are only 25 on the

other side.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. This must come on the main

motion.  We  are now debating the amendment  which

deals  with  the Communist threat, the restraining

of  Communist  and Communist-front leaders.  I  am

trying to bring that to a conclusion. Mr Ong  Eng

Guan, anything further to say?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I have nothing else to say.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On the amendment, Mr Rajah?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> On the amendment, Mr Speaker, Sir, I

am   grateful  to  the  Prime  Minister  and  the

Minister  for  Finance for having  made  our  task

somewhat  easier in the moving of this  amendment.

If  we  are  to  bring home our amendment  to  the

House,  we  would, first of all have to show  that

there  are  Communist and Communist-front  leaders

who     are     manipulating    and    controlling

organisations. That is the primary base from which

there could have been any possibility for us, from

this  side of the House, to convince the whole  of

the  House  that there is merit in our  amendment.

Fortunately  for us, and also from  the  point  of

view of the Member for Hong Lim, because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>



he  now  can  talk  more on the main  motion,  the

Government  has made it easier for all  of  us  by

accepting  the  fact that there are Communist  and

Communist-front   leaders  who   are,   in   fact,

manipulating  and  controlling organisations.  Mr

Speaker, we on the Front-benches here have been in

the  Opposition for the last three years. This  is

not  a  novel point we are propounding  today.  We

have been propounding it for the last three years.

We  have  been  propounding  it  on  every  single

occasion. Whenever we have thought it is necessary

to tell the Government of this threat and of their

duty  to  do  something about it, we  have  always

raised it. The threat that existed three years ago

has  continued to exist and still exists today.  I

can  point in the Prime Minister's argument  that,

in his view, the restraining and the incarceration

of  Communist leaders or Communist-front  leaders,

instead  of  containing the problem  that  affects

Singapore, might make it worse. That is a point of

view which is worthy of respect. It is a matter of

opinion. Perhaps the Prime Minister may be  right.

Who  should  know the Communists better  than  the

Prime Minister himself? He has admitted it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position up to the time when merger was in

the  offing was different, I am submitting to  the

Government,  from  what it  is  today.  One  could

argue,  and the Government could reasonably argue,

that before merger, politics were somewhat clouded

and  were not on a proper footing. We had not  got

down   to  the  level  of  national  issues,   and

therefore the arresting of Communist or Communist-front leaders might have been misinterpreted  into

meaning  the  arrest of opponents  who  have  been

dubbed  as Communists or Communist-front  leaders,

and  thereby bringing discredit on the Government.

That  is a possibility and one respects that point

of   view.   But  today  the  position  is   quite

different.  The  position  today  is   this;   the

Opposition,  the Government have all  united,  and

even the Barisan Sosialis, Mr Speaker, Sir.  The

most important thing for Singapore is the question

of  merger.  We  have different ideas  of  how  we

should merge, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>



possibly  when  we should merge. But  we  are  all

agreed - the  Barisan Sosialis, the Workers'  Party,

the  United People's Party and us - that  merger  is

important   and  that  Singapore  cannot   survive

without it, and the sooner we get on with  it  the

better.  Therefore,  I  put  this  point  in   all

seriousness. If anybody - be he a Communist, be he a

Fascist, be he some foreigner - does something with

malicious intent to wreck merger, then that person

should be put away. He should be temporarily  kept

aside. Today we have reached the position where we

have now before us a united national issue. And as

on this issue we are united, and when I say "we" I

mean we as an Assembly, the Government in advising

the  Assembly  has  a sacred  duty  to  advise  it

properly.  If then the Assembly is satisfied  that

there  are  dangerous persons who are going  about

intending to wreck merger and that they are  using

every  possible means to wreck it, then I  say  to

the  Government, "The time has come to  stop  them

from doing it, at least up till after merger."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention of the amendment, Mr Speaker,

Sir, is - and we hope we will have the House with us

on  this - if the Barisan really mean that they want

merger,   then   surely  they  must   accept   the

proposition that follows from it - to frustrate  any

element  that  tries to wreck merger  for  reasons

best known to itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand, Mr Speaker, Sir, that we have

been  asked  by  the  Member  for  Queenstown   to

indicate our line on the main motion. On  that  we

will  reply when our time comes, and when the time

does  come, Mr Speaker, Sir, we hope that we will

be  given  an  opportunity to reply  on  the  main

motion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No other Opposition Member wishes

to  speak? I propose to accept a closure  of  this

amendment.  Any Opposition Member  who  wishes  to

move a closure motion may do so now.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

it  has been repeatedly said that the action taken

by  the  Member for Cairnhill when  he  was  Chief

Minister was a mistake. He now calls upon the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>



Government   to   take  action,  and   again   the

Government say, "We are not going to make the same

mistake."  Sir, when you say it is a  mistake,  it

means you have brought disastrous results or  have

caused  damage. I ask the Government  what  damage

and disastrous results have been brought about  by

the  action of the then Chief Minister  by  taking

action against the Communists and putting them  in

Changi? The disastrous result was that we lost the

election  badly. I admit that was  the  disastrous

result.  It  has  not  brought  any  disaster   to

Singapore. Singapore has got one new Constitution.

We  have  got  the Prime Minister sitting  there.

Without  the  new Constitution,  he  will  not  be

sitting  there. Probably if that was not done,  we

might even be under Communist control now, or  the

British  might have possibly taken it back because

of the trouble and the bloodshed. We might even be

under  martial law now, Sir, and even Malaya might

not  have got its independence, if the then  Chief

Minister  did not act as he acted then.  The  only

disaster  that  was  brought  about  affected  the

S.P.A.  As  the  Member  for Cairnhill  repeatedly

said, he had always put the country and the people

before  the Party. We do not regret the fact  that

it has brought disaster to the S.P.A., although it

brought  us  to a defeat of five against  43,  and

made it necessary for us to endure the humiliation

and  the  harsh  words of the then  very  arrogant

Prime  Minister.  We swallowed that  and  we  were

happy  because  it  had not  brought  disaster  to

Singapore, but, in fact, it has brought  Singapore

on  the verge of independence. Sir, if they  still

say  that this is not true, I would like to  quote

from "The Battle for Merger", page 198, the letter

from Mr Puthucheary. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Right up to the end of 1955 it seemed

impossible  that  the  British  would   make   any

imaginative  political move which would  turn  the

flanks as it were of the armed revolt.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you read that passage carefully, it will

give  you the intention or the picture behind  the

minds  of the so-called Communists. They  did  not

think that the British would give up Singapore and

Malaya  so easily. They thought that armed revolt,

bloodshed, riots and force



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>



were  absolutely necessary to get independence  for

Singapore.  That was what they  thought,  and  Mr

Puthucheary admitted that it was a mistake that they

had  thought  that  the British would  not  give  up

Singapore so easily - and the British did give up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the then Chief Minister did not put

such  people with such misconceptions  in  a  safe

place and if they had been allowed freely to work

on the theory that the British would not give up

Singapore and Malaya without bloodshed and  without

armed  revolt, what would have happened, I ask  you,

Sir?  Would there be a Prime Minister sitting  there

with  a  Constitution  and parliamentary  democracy

existing today?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister gave that argument. I agree wholeheartedly that the happiness and the economic stability of the country have a lot to do with the fertility of the grounds for Communist manipulation. I quite agree with that. But, Sir, although that is

true,  it is not true to say that we must wait  till

there  is economic stability and everybody is  happy

before you can take action. It is like saying,  "Let

us  not  catch  the thieves; let us  not  catch  the

robbers.  Wait  till there is full  employment  when

everybody  has a job, then people will not  want  to

steal, except a few kleptomaniacs. Nobody wants  to

steal,  so  let  us wait till that  position  exists

before  we start arresting thieves and robbers."  It

is   like  saying  that  unless  there  is  economic

stability  all  round, let us leave  the  Communists

alone. I do not think that argument holds water. You

will remember, Sir, even a few years ago, when there

was  a  series  of  kidnappings  in  Singapore,  the

Government took the same attitude. They  would  not

move   until  pressure  was  put  on  them  by   the

Opposition.  I  think  the pressure  today  in  this

amendment  is very necessary to make the  Government

move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I move, "That the question be now put."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Standing Order 51 (1)

taken a decision to continue with the debate on the

amendment.  Mr  Deputy  Speaker,  we  are  not  an

irresponsible Opposition. We are not trying to usurp

power  nor  do  we  wish to wreck  anything  without

taking  into consideration the consequences.  So  on

this amendment moved by the Member for Cairnhill  it

has  been  the  stand of our Party  right  from  its

inception   to   defend  and  uphold   parliamentary

democracy  in  our country. For this  reason,  this

amendment   expressing   no   confidence   in   the

Government in that it has failed to take appropriate

steps  to  restrict the expansion of  the  Communist

movement  in Singapore is wholeheartedly  supported

by  us.  But I wish to make it clear that in  giving

our  support, our anti-Communist stand is not  anti-Chinese, for there has been a suggestion that  anti-Communist  means  anti a certain community.  It  has

been our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>



fundamental stand to create a united nation  and  to

inculcate  a national consciousness in the  various

races in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not happy with the stand taken by the

Government. Although the Prime Minister has dwelt at

that  they  are an anti-Communist Party,  except  to

tell  the  people  that they are  a  length  on  his

Government's  way of fighting the Communist  threat,

they refuse to acknowledge non-Communist Party.  But

it  is  clear to us that the P.A.P. Government  have

slept  and  eaten  together  with  the  Communist

leaders. In this matter, it cannot be said that  the

Government had made a mistake because  they  knew

very  well  and  they realised who their  companions

actually   were.  These  former  friends  have   now

deserted  them. It is true - as has been said  by  the

Prime Minister of the Federation - that once a person

is a Communist, he will remain a Communist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our efforts to try and win the minds of the

Communists  cannot succeed. Why I cannot accept  the

arguments put forward by the Government, Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, is because it is merely an excuse  for

them  to work in close collaboration with  the

Communists. We have seen what the P.A.P.  Government

have  done  in  Singapore;  they  have  helped   to

disseminate an ideology which is dangerous to the

youths of the State. I say that it is dangerous  to

expose  our  youths to such an ideology  because  we

know  that  the  Communists  are  always  trying  to

infiltrate  into  organisations. We  have  seen  the

damage  done to this country immediately  after  the

P.A.P. came to power. And I am quite sure that there

are  many industrialists today who are reluctant  to

invest  their capital here because they would  first

like to have an assurance - an adequate guarantee - that

it  will be safe to do so. But today let us  have  a

look  at  the  state  of  the trade  union  movement

although the Government may believe that the setting

up  of  the Industrial Arbitration Court has brought

about  industrial peace in Singapore;  similarly  in

matters of education where damage has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>



done;  and, so too, the development programme  which

has been blocked by the Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, a point which has impressed us was that the amendment moved by the Member for Anson

which  sought to delete the words "like the  Barisan

Sosialis" was rejected by the Members of the Barisan

Sosialis.  They prefer the words "like  the  Barisan

Sosialis" to remain in the original amendment  moved

by  the Member for Cairnhill. It is not my intention

to  reopen  the  debate  on  the  amendment  to  the

amendment,  but it is clear to us that  the  Barisan

Sosialis  Members are openly accepting the challenge

contained in the amendment and they do not  want  to

escape from the original intention contained in  the

amendment of the Member for Cairnhill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, at the moment we are at the cross roads as to whether we are to uphold

parliamentary democracy in our State or we  will  be

forced  to  follow  the footsteps of  the  Left-wing

leaders who are dictated by the Communist Party. For

instance,  from  Indonesia, they have  followed  the

events  leading to the Malaysia debate. It is  clear

to the people of Singapore that there are two groups

now  which would like to shape the fate and  destiny

of the people of Singapore; one is for parliamentary

democracy   while   the  other  is   for   Communist

dictatorship in Singapore. The Barisan Sosialis have

moved this no confidence motion. Their intention  is

merely  to  create  an atmosphere  of  tension.  For

instance, if their motion is approved and adopted by

the Assembly, it means that the Government will have

to  resign and we will go hack to the people to face

another general election for the purpose of electing

a  new  government. This is clear  even  though  the

Referendum  Bill has been adopted by  this  Assembly

with   a   majority.   According  to   parliamentary

democracy, even those who oppose the Referendum Bill

must  accept  it;  they  must  accept  the  majority

decision.  But  this has been used  by  the  Barisan

Sosialis  as  another  occasion  to  criticise   the

Referendum Bill in spite of the fact



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>



that  it has been assented to by the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara. I am quite sure that the Government is under

an  obligation to carry out the referendum. But  because-



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member for

the  Southern Islands is going completely away  from

the amendment moved by the Member for Cairnhill.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Deputy Speaker, when

I   mentioned  the  Referendum  Bill,  I  wanted  to

emphasize my point, that the Barisan Sosialis  which

is   playing  an  important  part  in  opposing  the

referendum is clearly a Communist movement. There is

no need for me to elaborate on this point because it

is  clear that the Barisan Sosialis do not  like  to

see Malaysia or merger materialise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, we support the amendment whole-heartedly. This is our clear stand to the end. The

people will weigh our stand carefully and they  will

have  an opportunity to pass judgment when the  time

comes for us to go back to them.



<br><br>11.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not wish to speak

at  length, because I am tired and fed up. There  is

no  need  for  me  to remind the Minister  for  Home

Affairs of what we are discussing just now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not only hate the Barisan Sosialis but I also loathe to see the faces of the

Members of the Barisan Sosialis which Party,  in  my

opinion,  stinks with the odour of a Party that  has

gone  bad. It is clear that they are really traitors

who are out to do damage to the prosperity which the

people of Singapore are now enjoying.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the Member for Geylang Serai and I had occasion to exchange views and we are of

the  opinion that if the Member for Upper  Serangoon

were  a Minister, he would not be able to prove  his

sincerity, particularly to the indigenous people  of

Singapore and generally to the people of Malaysia.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I often thought that the Barisan Sosialis have not only been infiltrated by

pro-Communist and Communist elements - this is causing

concern  to  the  P.A.P. - but  that  they  have  also

attempted to disturb U.M.N.O., including myself. Not

only  from  within U.M.N.O. but also from the  other

side,  they suspect that I am an instrument to wreck

Malaysia, because there is a section in U.M.N.O. who

are demanding this and that hi the local newspapers.

Recently   the  Plebeian  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis

supported  a  section of U.M.N.O.  It  alleged  that

someone was fighting for the Cyprus Constitution  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis claim to be wise but they are

actually unwise if they want to play politics  as  a

game of chess. I have played this political game  of

chess  with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime

Minister  and also with the Parliamentary  Secretary

to  the  Minister for Health and Law.  In  order  to

attract  certain  sections  of  U.M.N.O. to   wreck

Malaysia,  the Barisan Sosialis must not indulge  in

this game at the moment. It is too late because  the

Barisan  Sosialis  struggle  is  inappropriate.  Mr

Deputy Speaker, this is the game being played by the

Communists  who  are  trying  to  set  one   against

another,  whether they are in the Government  or  in

the Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite recently, Mr Deputy Speaker, there was an

article - I  have  it  with me  and  I  will  read  an

excerpt - that U.M.N.O. has been accused of supporting

the  P.A.P. in its undemocratic action.  This  is  a

recent  news article in the Plebeian, the  organ  of

the Barisan Sosialis. I am surprised; why should the

Barisan  Sosialis  be  envious  or  jealous  of  the

U.M.N.O.  Members  in  the Assembly?  What  have  we

robbed  from  them? As far as I know,  we  have  not

given them any trouble. I have told them not to  try

to  offend the U.M.N.O. Members. If they want to try

to  offend  U.M.N.O. Members in  Singapore,  then  I

believe  that the consequences will be very bad  for

them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, it appears that the Minister for Home Affairs loves the Barisan Sosialis. The

reason  is  that  he pampers them.  They  are  given

$500/-  allowance  each and they are  granted  other

privileges. Even the constables on duty  show  their

respect  by  saluting every Member of this  Assembly

when  he enters or leaves the Chamber. On the  other

hand,  I  wish  to  remind the  Minister  that  when

U.M.N.O. supported the Government to eliminate  the

A.R.T.I.S. movement, why was he then afraid  of  the

Communists   and  the  pro-Communists?  Mr   Deputy

Speaker,   the  Barisan  Sosialis  said   that   the

Government  did  not arrest them because  they  were

afraid,  but tonight the Parliamentary Secretary  to

the  Minister  for Culture said that the  Government

are  not  afraid.  The people will  decide  who  are

afraid and who are not afraid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Deputy Speaker, this amendment moved by the

Member  for Cairnhill, regarding the pro-Communists

and  Communists who are playing their  role  in  the

Barisan Sosialis, is a good amendment. I say it is a

good   amendment   because  it  will   protect   the

leadership   of  the  Barisan  Sosialis   from   the

Communist   danger.  We  from   the   Alliance   are

conscious - and  we  hope  that  the  Government   are

conscious  too - that the Barisan Sosialis  have  been

infiltrated   by   Communists;   and    with    this

consciousness,  as  well  as  with  the  object   of

protecting the leadership of the Barisan Sosialis, I

plead  with the Government, if possible,  after  the

sitting  of  the Assembly, to instruct  the  Special

Branch to issue orders for the guards to be ready to

arrest and detain them at a place they think fit, so

that  our  plan can be proceeded with in  peace  and

harmony. That is all, Mr Deputy Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of order, Sir. I

understood  the  ruling  was  that  only  Opposition

Members would speak on this and we then will  return

to  the main motion. There is a guillotine, Sir, and

if you will allow us the chance, we might be able to

speak a little on the main motion itself.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> As far as I know, I do not

think  there is a ruling that the Government Benches

would not be allowed to speak on this amendment. But

if there are Opposition Members who wish to speak we

can  give  preference to the Opposition Members  and

then  to  the Government Benches. But since so  many

Opposition Members have spoken on this amendment, it

is  only  fair to give a chance to the Deputy  Prime

Minister to speak.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Mammen, may I know your

ruling  once  more? I still think we should  have  a

little time to speak on the main motion.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. A motion was moved for

the  closure  of the debate on the amendment  and  a

vote was taken with 31 Noes as against 15 Ayes. That

is all under the Standing Orders.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, when

the Member for Cairnhill moved his amendment he made

a  very  clear statement in regard to what he  would

have done if he had known that the Prime Minister - at

that   time   the  Member  for  Tanjong   Pagar - was

consorting with "the Plen". The Member for Cairnhill

made  no  bones about it that he would have put  the

Member for Tanjong Pagar in gaol so that he would do

a  little  rethinking. Probably if  the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar were in Changi Gaol he might  not  be

the  Prime Minister today, but I would have  thought

that  probably  he could have spent  his  time  very

usefully  studying Mandarin or Hokkien  so  that  he

could deliver better speeches in those languages  at

mass  meetings. The Prime Minister and the  Minister

for Finance have explained very well indeed that the

method  of  controlling the Communists, as advocated

by the Member for Cairnhill, is inadequate, and that

what  is more important is to consider the long-term

solution  to  the problem. Both of them  have  drawn

attention to the fact that the political and  social

conditions  in the country are vital  in  the  fight

against Communism.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson previously advised the P.A.P.

to  get  rid of its Communists and Communist fellow-travellers. Last year this group of people left  the

P.A.P.; they purged themselves out of the P.A.P. and 13  Assemblymen  went  across to  form  the  Barisan

Sosialis.  Those  who control the  Barisan  Sosialis

today  are  quite  well versed in the  united  front

tactics  which the Member for Anson and  the  Member

for  Cairnhill  knew only too well  when  they  were

Chief Ministers. May I just quote what the Secretary-General  of  the  Barisan Sosialis,  Mr  Lim  Ching

Siong,  had  to  say when he was  Member  for  Bukit

Timah, in Hansard of 7th June. 1956, col. 2050:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`But now the Liberal-Socialists also refuse to be

party  to  the  censure of the Colonial  Office  for

rejecting  the  minimum demands  of  the  people  of

Singapore.  They  go further. They are  prepared  to

censure  the delegation of the people of  Singapore.

This  is something which cannot be forgiven  by  the

people  of  Singapore. This Party proves once  again

that  a  change of name does not mean  a  change  of

quality. The old Progressive Party, composed of  the

"yes"  men  of  colonialism,  and  the  not  so  old

Democrat   Party,  composed  of  reactionary   local

capitalist  elements,  together  thought  that  they

could fool the public if they called themselves by a

new name - the Liberal-Socialists. The donkey tried to

pretend  that  it  was a horse. But  this  amendment

proves  once again and for all time that this  Party

is neither Liberal nor Socialist. If they are honest

with  themselves and with the people, they will call

themselves  by  their  correct  name -  the  Colonial

Collaborators Party.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today we find the Barisan Sosialis forming a

united  front  with the Liberal-Socialist  Party - the

very  same Party which the Barisan Secretary-General

in  1956  had castigated as a Colonial Collaborators

Party. The Barisan Sosialis Party can be very  aptly

named today as the Barisan Liberal Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the Member for Anson supported in principle the amendment moved by the Member for

Cairnhill; only he did not want the words "like  the

Barisan  Sosialis" to be included in the  amendment.

He  was  supporting in principle that Communist  and

Communist-front  leaders should be  restrained  from

manipulating  and  controlling  organisations.   The

Member  for  Anson in one sense is quite honest.  He

has said in this House that he is always



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>



the  champion  of  parliamentary  democracy  and  is

therefore against Communism. Throughout the  records

of  Hansard, since 1955, you can see that  there  is

only  one  consistent  line of  thinking  which  the

Member   for   Anson  has - he  is  for  parliamentary

democracy and against Communism. Therefore, in  that

sense,  he is honest. He has learnt from his  bitter

experience of how the Communists wove circles around

him  when he was Chief Minister. First, there was  a

rally   at   Kallang   to   send   off   the   first

constitutional delegation to London. At this  rally,

the  Member  for  Anson, then  Chief  Minister,  was

standing  side  by side with me,  or  rather  I  was

standing side by side with him on the platform.  The

platform collapsed and he disappeared from the scene

and  went  back to his Changi home. Subsequently  in

the  debate  in the House on the incident,  Mr  Lee

Kuan  Yew, Member for Tanjong Pagar, read statements

from  the Press concerning the stand of Mr David Marshall

towards  those  who had caused the collapse  of  the

rally.  We said that gangsters were responsible  for

the collapse of the rally, but Mr David Marshall insisted

that  it  was the Communists who caused the platform

to collapse and made a fiasco of the rally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to give an opportunity to the Members of the Opposition to speak on this

amendment, because this amendment is theirs and,  as

I  have  said  before, we are going to refrain  from

voting on this amendment.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, I will not take much of

your  time just  a few minutes. We of  the  Alliance

moved the amendment to the motion of the Member  for

Queenstown  because we are of the opinion  that  not

only  has  the Government not carried out  its  duty

towards  the  people  of  Singapore,  but  also  its

duty - as  the Prime Minister has said - to our  friends

in the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the Prime Minister has said that he and his Government do not wish to use strong-arm



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>



methods;  they  do  not wish to use  the  police  to

arrest those whom he accuses of being Communists  or

supporters  of  the Communists. He and  his  Government  are of the opinion that the methods which were

used  by  the former Government, of which  I  was  a

Minister,  were  methods that were not  correct  and

that   they  would  only  increase  the  number   of

Communist followers in Singapore. My Party do not at

all  agree with the stand of the Prime Minister  and

his Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, let us see how the Government of the Federation have overcome this problem of

Communism.  Being  at war with the  Communists  from

1948  to  1960  for  more  or  less  12  years,  the

Government  of  the  Federation of  Malaya  did  not

hesitate  to  use force against the  Communists  and

their  supporters, and in that war in Malaya against

the  Communists, the police and military forces were

used,  and many sacrificed their lives. In addition,

many  civilian lives were sacrificed - Malays, Chinese

and Indians. But, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Government

of the Federation of Malaya knew its responsibility.

It  had  no  fear  of arresting such Communists  and

their  supporters. What are the consequences  today?

Local  elections  have  been  held  throughout   the

Federation of Malaya. In places which were  formerly

Communist strongholds, what has happened now? It can

be  said that more than three-quarters of the  local

elections  have  been won by the Alliance  and  that

three-quarters of the places where they have won are

areas   which   were  formerly  dominated   by   the

Communists  or  by their supporters.  I  am  putting

forth   this  argument  to  refute  what  the  Prime

Minister has said that he did not wish to use force.

He  wanted to calm the people's minds; he wanted  to

attract  their  attention or to  win  their  hearts.

These  were the only ways by which he had  hoped  to

overcome  the  problem of Communism.  To  the  Prime

Minister  of  Singapore and  to  the  Government  of

Singapore,  I  say,  do  not  fear.  If  the  former

Government  could use force and strong  measures  to

overcome  the Communist problem - as was done  in  the

Federation of Malaya with success



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>



-why should the Singapore Government not use similar

methods  to  overcome the problem here?  Mr  Deputy

Speaker, I am not saying, as some of the Members  of

this  Assembly do, that all members of  the  Barisan

Sosialis are Communists; but the Government and  the

Ministers over the radio, in the Press and  in  this

Assembly  have  always accused the Barisan  Sosialis

and  its  supporters of being members and supporters

of the Communist Party. If the Government knows that

there are Communists in the Barisan Sosialis and  in

other    organisations,   I   think   it   is    its

responsibility  to deal with them if  it  is  really

keen  in  protecting the welfare of  the  people  of

Singapore  and  the security of our friends  in  the

Federation. The time has come for the Government  to

carry  out its administration and to use the  powers

given  by  this Assembly to deal with the  Communist

danger, which the Government has said is at large in

the   Barisan  Sosialis  and,  recently,  in   other

organisations.  I  am  compelled  to   believe   the

propositions put forward by the Government, for  the

Barisan,  which have been openly accused,  have  not

denied  that among their ranks there are people  who

are members of the Communist Party.



<br><br>11.32 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, here I would like to draw the attention of this House to the fact that many of the

leaders of the Barisan Sosialis have been accused by

the    Government   as   Communists   or   Communist

supporters. They have always uttered unsavoury words

against  the Government of the Federation of  Malaya

and its leaders. Many such people who are members of

the  Barisan Sosialis at this time have no shame  at

all.  I say that they have no shame because some  of

the  Members,  whom  I  need not  mention,  are  not

citizens   of   Singapore  but   citizens   of   the

Federation. And I know of two leaders of the Barisan

Sosialis  who,  when  attending conferences  in  the

Federation and elsewhere, used passports  issued  by

the Federation Government. These are some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>





of the leaders of the Barisan Sosialis, and they say

that  they do not like the Federation; that they  do

not like merger; that whatever the Government say is

not correct. They do not seem to have any shame,  as

if they are animals. They do not like the Federation

but  still  they use passports of the Federation  of

Malaya.  And such people are leaders in the  Barisan

Sosialis!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casually I say this so that the Federation

Government  could pay attention to this: that  their

citizenship be  taken away and that the Government of

Singapore  could pay attention to this  - that  those

people who are not citizens of Singapore should  not

be  given an opportunity to take part in politics in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, "That the words proposed to be added,

be there added."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment accordingly negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Original Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of guidance, Mr Speaker.

I  wonder  if  you could rule that  we  have  a  few

minutes  to  discuss the final motion on  the  Order

Paper, i.e. the Adjournment sine die motion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am afraid not. The guillotine falls

at  12 o'clock midnight and all matters will have to

be disposed of then.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, three years

ago - let us go back - the P.A.P. swept into power with

a  majority of 35 in this Assembly. It had just  won

43  out  of the 51 seats, which was a record  of  no

mean achievement in any parliamentary election. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  in those days I am  sure  the  eight

Opposition  Members on this side of the  House  were

feeling  a  bit  cool, particularly  when  the  air-conditioning  here is cooler than the average.  Then

during  the course of the following three years  the

tide  changed. The Opposition ranks started to swell

and,  Sir, you must be finding difficulty in placing

seats  for  those  new additions to the  Opposition.

With  26 now on this side and 25 on the other  side,

the temperature of this Chamber, from the effect  of

the  air conditioning, is just nice, because  it  is

evenly distributed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, Sir, the defection of the Member for Bras

Basah  has  tipped the scales. It  has  reduced  the

Government's   majority  of  one   to   a   minority

Government.  Since then this Government has  managed

to  survive not from its own majority but from  acts

of  chivalry and generosity displayed by the  S.P.A.

and  U.M.N.O. which managed to keep the P.A.P. from

being outvoted. Sir, I feel sorry, as I skip through

the events mentally, the rise and fall of the P.A.P.

Government  is like the rise and fall of  the  Roman

Empire. Looking back on its heyday, I could remember

vividly the days when the overwhelming masses of the

people  found in the P.A.P. a beacon of their  hopes

and  the depository of their aspirations. The masses

surged  forward -  [Interruption]  Sir,  they  were

hiding behind. They dare not come



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>



out  yet. The masses surged forward at the  call  of

the  P.A.P. The forces of reaction trembled  at  the

very  mention  of its name and at the sight  of  its

symbol. But, Sir, all these happenings have occurred

within  the  short space of one or  two  years.  The

arrogance displayed by the P.A.P. leadership led  to

the  antagonism of the intellectual and  the  middle

classes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What about the Mayor!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Its deviation from the stated

policy and the avowed aims of the P.A.P. has alienated

the  masses of the people who have swept the  P.A.P.

into  power. A stage has been reached when no  power

on  earth can resuscitate the P.A.P. even to a  mere

shadow  of its past. In Hong Lim, despite the forces

at  its disposal, the vast State and party machinery

at  its  command, the number of opportunists at  its

behest  and  those  who are prepared  to  abuse  the

sacred slogan of "Left-wing unity" at the bidding of

the  P.A.P.,  the forces of the people  delivered  a

crushing  defeat on this ignominious  alliance.  The

P.A.P. was smashed once and for all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me take you for a few minutes

back  to  what happened during polling  day  at  the

Victoria  Memorial Theatre, where the Prime Minister

was  ready  to  march into Anson preparing  for  the

Anson  by-election, I understand, with two  vans  of

firecrackers.  But the result was what  he  did  not

expect.  With  tears  in his  eyes,  he  spoke  with

emotion  in  the Hong Lim Branch that  this  is  the

finish  of  the  P.A.P. and that "We  must  resign."

Therefore,  Sir,  here  is  a  Government  which  is

prepared to go all out to beat a "graceful" retreat.

Here  is  a Government which has through its follies

and   its   serious  departure  from  its  political

principles forfeited the moral right to govern.  How

can  a  minority Government steamroller through  its

constitutional  proposals  which  have  far-reaching

consequences not only to ourselves but also  to  the

future?  How can such a Government, which exists  on

sufferance only, justify itself in the eyes  of  the

world,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>



a sham referendum to give a facade of democracy with

unacceptable constitutional proposals?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. is now no more, as I have said,

than  a  mere  shadow  of the past.  As  people  are

saying,  it is even difficult for them to  muster  a

few hundred to fill up the few hundred chairs in the

Cultural Centre. Let us recall the last open meeting

they  had,  that is, the celebration  of  The  Sixth

Anniversary  of  the P.A.P. at the  Badminton  Hall,

where  from the photos and from what I heard,  there

were about seven or eight hundred Party members  and

supporters attending the meeting. Since then we  did

not  hear of the P.A.P. having a seventh anniversary

celebration.  The eighth anniversary celebration  is

coming very soon and they are now having meetings in

the small little Cultural Centre. I am very doubtful

if  they  could  even  fill the few  hundred  chairs

there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, after the Hong Lim Resolutions,

the  thousands  of members the P.A.P. had,  suddenly

disappeared.  The last opening meeting,  as  I  have

said,  was attended by only several hundred members.

What  was  left after the Hong Lim Resolutions  were

only Generals, Colonels, Lieutenants, Captains-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Corporals.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Corporals. But the rank and file

have disappeared.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Quarter-master.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> This Government now lacks a

political  organisation for the proper discharge  of

its task and its responsibilities. Mr Speaker, Sir,

it  is  very  important for Government to  have  the

backing of a political organisation. Just 25 Members

here would not be able to understand what the masses

want  and  would not be able to translate Government

policies  into action for the benefit of the  masses

and  interpret to them what the Government is trying

to do. Therefore, this Government which now lacks an

adequate  political organisation  has  no  right  to

carry on any more.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the years that have been spent since November

1954 - nearly  eight years ago - and the  sacrifices  by

the  thousands of members of the P.A.P., are now all

wasted. The P.A.P. is now a spent force, with hardly

any  political  support  in  the  country.  Does  it

represent  the workers? No, Sir. Does  it  represent

the    farmers?   No.   Does   it   represent    the

intellectuals?   No.   Does   it    represent    the

businessmen?  No,  Sir, because  most  of  them  are

supporting  the S.P.A. Does it represent  the  civil

servants?  No. There is no section of the population

now which supports the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when I speak tonight, I do not

speak from any feeling of animosity or anger at what

the  Prime Minister did to me in the way of personal

insults  or  injuries. I forgive him. But,  Sir,  we

cannot forgive him for what he has been doing in the

past few months. We cannot forgive him for the White

Paper constitutional proposals which he is going  to

push through by a sham referendum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You said an alternative.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> A genuine alternative. Bread and

rice, not potatoes and bread. Sir, I only feel sorry-



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> For yourself!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> -that the final chapters of a

Party  and  a  Government  with  which  I  was  once

associated  should come to such an ignominious  end.

The final chapters of this Party and this Government

are drawing near. The curtains will soon be drawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> 12 o'clock.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> That is why, Mr Speaker, Sir, we

have  this  form  of  democracy.  Guillotine  at  12

o'clock, filibustering, so that the Opposition would

not  be  given  a chance. Why should there  be?  Why

should you worry?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member does not give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I have only seven minutes, Mr

Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What about the others?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> There is no need to filibuster

because  what  we speak tonight only  a  very  small

percentage will come out in the newspapers tomorrow.

For instance, we are having

a  mass  rally  on Sunday and we were  given  twelve

conditions. I will just take two minutes to  explain

one  of the conditions. There are twelve conditions,

Mr Speaker. And one of the conditions - condition No.

11 - reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That no caricatures or drawings of any description

may be displayed."



<br><br>And I have to sign on the form:



<pre>

  `I certify that I fully understand that any breach

of  the  conditions of this licence will lead  to  a

prosecution.

                                      Signature.'

</pre>



<br><br>Mr    Speaker,   Sir,   there   are   restrictions,

restrictions  and restrictions. The  Prime  Minister

now  is  afraid of caricatures and cartoons.  He  is

afraid of the Opposition Parties drawing his-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Handsome features!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> - handsome features. Why should

he  worry, Mr Speaker, Sir, because when we in  the

P.A.P. were in the Opposition in those days, we drew

cartoons of Chew Swee Kee, the Member for Cairnhill,

and everybody in the Government. There is no harm in

everyone  being  drawn. Like in  the  Hong  Lim  by-election, they drew cartoons of me riding  a  beycha

with  the  Member for Cairnhill and many  Right-wing

leaders at the back. We just laughed it off. But the

Prime  Minister now feels it. He is afraid  we  will

draw  big  caricatures, a big cartoon of  Government

leaders  displayed  in the mass rally.  We  are  not

supposed  to distribute anything. Nothing is  to  be

distributed, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Distribute prizes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> For the Minister for Finance!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He deserves a gold medal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> No banners or posters except

those which have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>



approved  shall  be  displayed. And  what  has  been

approved will be in the list. Persons attending must

not  display national emblems and nothing should  be

distributed   which  has  not  been  approved.   Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  what I deplore is that  despite  all

these  restrictions,  despite the  guillotine,  they

should still filibuster until the Opposition have no

chance  to  speak.  What has happened  in  tonight's

debate  was, instead of the P.A.P. being  on  trial,

the P.A.P. Government with the support of the S.P.A.

has  turned this Chamber into a trial of the Barisan

Sosialis. Mr Speaker, what I deplore is that in its

last  pangs, the P.A.P. Government, being a minority

Government,  with  only 25 seats out  of  51,  still

seeks   to  steamroller  through  its  White   Paper

proposals-



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Shame!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b>- very shamefully by means of ,a

dishonest referendum. It is still not too late, Sir,

for  the  P.A.P. to change its mind.  We  know  that

tonight  will  be the last sitting, the  last  three

minutes  of  the  Third Session. The  Assembly  will

prorogue  from  now onwards. Once  the  Assembly  is

prorogued,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, there  will  be  more

pressure put on the Press, more restrictions on mass

meetings.  Instead  of twelve conditions,  we  might

have 13, 14, 15 or 16 conditions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, we stop at 13. It is

unlucky!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> The next condition is this. We

must  give  the  list of speakers  and  the  subject

matter.  Next  time they will ask that the  speakers

must  give their photographs and thumb-prints. These

are  all  necessary. If the Government is  confident

that  its White Paper proposals have the support  of

the  people, it should allow the Opposition  Parties

to have rallies as freely as he had during-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You want an election?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Have it tomorrow. Come on.

Tanjong Pagar, Hong Lim -





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon.

Member  for  Hong Lim wishes to waste time,  he  may

waste time. He must address the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we know these

people  too well. We worked together for six  years.

We  are ready for any general election at any  time.

We  know these people will not commit the same folly

as  the S.P.A. - dilly-dallying, not sure whether  to

have  a  general election or not. We know  that  the

Legislative  Assembly Elections Ordinance  has  been

amended  so  that  they can have a surprise  general

election  in seven days' time. And all the  time  we

are  keyed up for a general election. That  is  why,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  two weeks  ago  we  had  a  big

membership  meeting which frightened  the  lives  of

members of the Government. We are ready at any  time

from now onwards to have a general election. We  did

not, Mr Speaker, Sir, challenge the Government  to

the  Hong Lim by-election, just spouting empty  air.

We  are  prepared br it. The organisation is  ready.

Any  time we can have polling. Tomorrow or  the  day

after tomorrow. Just give us only one rally. That is

all that is required.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Chan Say Jame will fix you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, they had one

hundred Chan Say James speaking on their platform in

the  Hong  Lim rallies. Did it make any  difference?

No.  How  many votes did you get extra? Only  a  few

votes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Be careful! He

is listening to you! [Laughter]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The guillotine has fallen on

that very pleasant note.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Original Question put, "That this House expresses no

confidence in the Government."
