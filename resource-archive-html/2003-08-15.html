<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>LAND ACQUISITION ACT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Compensation at current market value)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for Law

whether  he will review the Land Acquisition Act  to  pay

compensation   at   current   market   value   for   land

compulsorily  acquired as Singapore is now a  first-world

developed country.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Senior Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Law):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

MinLaw has an ongoing review of various legislation.  The

relevant  provisions of the Land Acquisition Act referred

to  by  the  Member will be included in that review.   In

fact,  Dr  Amy  Khor  and Mdm Cynthia  Phua,  during  the

Committee  of  Supply  debate  this  year,  made  similar

requests for review.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the current approach in the Act is to peg

compensation  to the market value of the property  as  at

the  date  of  gazette notification or a statutory  date,

which at present is 1st January 1995, whichever is lower.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2459</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the approach in this provision has not been

amended, Government, in fact, has regularly reviewed  the

statutory date to ensure that compensations are generally

in  line  with  market levels.  Previous statutory  dates

were  30th  November  1973, 1st  January  1986,  and  1st

January  1992.  We have not changed the current statutory

date  of  1st  January 1995 because, given the  depressed

state  of  the property market, current values are  below

1995  values.   This  means that,  today,  the  statutory

compensations  paid  to affected owners  are  already  at

current  market  value.  When circumstances  require  it,

Government will continue to update the statutory date  of

compensation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Government introduced an ex gratia

payment  scheme in 1982 to cushion any financial hardship

faced by owners of acquired properties.  This scheme  was

initially introduced to top up statutory compensation  to

market value, should the statutory compensation be  lower

than  market  value.   Since 1982, we  have  considerably

expanded  the scope and quantum given under  the  scheme.

For  example, whilst the scheme originally was  available

only  to  owner-occupied residential  properties,  today,

owners  of  other  types  of properties,  whether  owner-occupied  or  not, are eligible to be considered  for  ex

gratia compensation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst, as I have said, we are prepared to review

the  relevant provisions, let me say that I do not  agree

with  the suggestion inherent in Mr Chiam's question that

we  can completely jettison the Land Acquisition Act  and

its  provisions because Singapore is better off now  than

before.   Whether  or  not  Singapore  is  a  first-world

developed country today, one feature about Singapore will

never  change,  namely, that we are a small  country  and

land is, and will always be, a scarce commodity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Acquisition Act has made possible some of

the  important  developments in Singapore, including  our

public    housing    programmes   and   other    physical

infrastructure, such as our ports, expressways  and  mass

rapid transport system.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2460</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For future developments in land scarce Singapore, it

is  obvious  that  we  will continue  to  need  the  Land

Acquisition Act.  Of course, we will need to address  and

review  the  question  of how we must  strike  a  balance

between  the  interests of the individual landowners  and

the wider interests of the public good, which is to press

on  with development projects for public purposes without

unduly increasing the taxpayer's burden.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, I would like

to  ask the Minister to explain the rationale for the  $1

compensation for the land acquired from Faith Assembly of

God Church at Kim Keat Road.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, Dr Amy Khor refers to

the  recent  case,  publicised in the  media,  about  the

acquisition of part of the land of the Church at Kim Keat

Road.  Let me explain this case in greater detail.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Chief Valuer's Office accepted the

recommendation  of  a private valuer  on  its  panel  and

valued  the  strip of land acquired, which is  about  200

square  metres, at a nominal $1.  In making  this  award,

the Chief Valuer's Office applied existing law, including

relevant provisions of the Land Acquisition Act  and  the

Planning Act, which takes into account the zoning of  the

acquired  land.  On that basis, the Collector's award  of

$1  was  determined.  On a legal basis, Government stands

by this award.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, after further reviewing the case,

Government  has decided to give an ex gratia  payment  to

the  owners.   Let  me  explain why.   Before  1998,  the

portion  of  land,  which has now  been  acquired,  which

formed a small part of a larger piece of Church land  was

affected  by a road widening line.  The affected  portion

was  at  that  time not zoned as road.  If  the  affected

portion  had  been  acquired before 1998,  the  statutory

compensation would have been computed taking into account

the  existing use prior to acquisition, ie, carpark  use.

In  that event, more than nominal compensation would have

been  given.  In 1998, after amendments were made to  the

Land Acquisition Act and the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2461</b></font><br><br>



Planning  Act, the portion which was previously  affected

by  a  road line was zoned road in the Master Plan.  This

was a change in planning practice so that the Master Plan

would  better  reflect planning intention.  The  rezoning

led  to a valuation of a nominal $1 as there is no market

value  for  a strip of land zoned road.  But it  was  not

Government's   intention  to  change   the   compensation

approach  when  it designated road lines  as  road  zones

under the Master Plan.  In short, there was an unintended

effect when it came to valuing the affected strip of land

for  compensation purposes upon acquisition.  Hence,  the

$1 nominal compensation was an unintended consequence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Law and I asked our officials to

see  how we can help the owners in this case.  On review,

we determined that this case is a special one relating to

a  specific  situation.  Given what I have said  earlier,

Government  has now decided to make an ex gratia  payment

to  put the owners in the position they would have  been,

with regard to compensation, as if the land affected  was

acquired before 1998, ie, based on a road line instead of

a  road zone.  On this basis, a payment higher than $1 in

statutory compensation will be given.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have informed the Church of this and we are

working on the final amount with the Chief Valuer.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister  that in the light of the review  of  the  Faith

Assembly of God Church's case, how would this affect  the

compensation for the Chuan Park's case, which is  also  a

$1 compensation?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, we must not mix the

two  cases.   Like  I  have  said,  the  legal  basis  is

important for computing the compensation award.  What  is

the legal position which justifies the valuation of $1?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Chuan Park situation, it is entirely

different,   based  on  the  provisions   of   the   Land

Acquisition  Act.   There  is a  provision  in  the  Land

Acquisition Act which takes into account any increase in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2462</b></font><br><br>



value going to the owner whose land has been acquired and

who  has  got remaining land.  In other words, for  Chuan

Park, in fact, only 0.6% of the land was acquired out  of

the  entire piece of land  and the benefit to  the  owner

arising  from the proximity of the MRT station  has  been

estimated at about $18 million.  So there is this set-off

provision in the Land Acquisition Act.  Hence,  based  on

this set-off position, a $1 nominal compensation will  be

given  to  Chuan  Park owners.  Chuan  Park  owners  have

appealed.  I think we should leave it to the Land Appeals

Board to decide on this case.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, the payment

of  $1 for compulsory acquisition of land is almost  like

an  outright confiscation.  This is certainly a violation

of  human rights.  If it violates human rights,  does  is

also  not violate the terms of the agreement made between

Singapore and America under the FTA?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, Mr Chiam's premise is

that  the  award violates human rights, but I  have  said

that  it  is  based  on  the law.   Land  acquisition  in

Singapore is something which has gone on for a long time,

and  $1  cases, as I have explained before in this House,

are  given.  But when $1 awards are given, they are based

on  valuation principles which can be defended.  So there

are  established categories where $1 awards may be given.

For  example,  if  there is a strip of land,  part  of  a

larger  piece of land, set aside for public purpose  such

as a road or drainage purposes for which gross plot ratio

has  been  transferred to the adjoining land so that  the

land  ought  to  be  vested in the  Government,  when  we

acquire, benefit already has accrued to the owner of  the

land  in terms of higher and more gross floor area,  then

we give $1.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another instance, for example, will be when we

acquire   a  splay  corner  or  backlane,  incapable   of

independent   development,  it   is   $1.    Or   another

established category is when the owner has sub-leased the

land  to  a  sub-lessee for 999 years, so that  the  sub-lessee gets substantive and substantial compensation, the

owner who only has a small reversionary interest gets $1.

So we must not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2463</b></font><br><br>



be  fixated  by the $1 compensation and say  that  it  is

unfair.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that the Church's case has aroused some

interest.    The  Minister  and  I  do  look   at   these

compensation awards.  Because we feel that in this  case,

something  is not quite right, that is why we  asked  our

officials  to  take  a look at it.  We  then  found  this

unintended effect and we are now prepared to come forward

and  give ex gratia payment. I think that is an important

point.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, it is true that under the

Land  Acquisition Act, there are many cases in which  the

Government can pay a $1 compensation.  But the  point  is

that  the  payment  of $1 compensation,  even  if  it  is

defensible  under  our law, violates  human  rights.   My

question  is: if it is a violation of human rights,  does

this also not violate the terms of the FTA?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> How could it be a

violation   of  human  rights  when  we  are  acting   in

accordance with our laws?  Is the Member saying that  all

our  laws are in violation of human rights?  In any case,

an  important  point is that there is  the  Land  Appeals

Board.   We  have  an  Appeals Board which  is  currently

presided  over by an ex-Judicial Commissioner and  he  is

assisted by Assessors.  Anybody who is not happy with the

compensation   - many of the landowners whose  properties

are acquired may not be happy  -  there is this recourse.

That  is  an  important point.  Certainly, the  Board  is

properly constituted.  The process for judicial review is

there  and the valuations are given according to accepted

valuation  principles.  I do not  see  any  violation  of

human rights.

<div align="center"><b>MAIN UPGRADING PROGRAMME AT PANDAN GARDENS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock</b> asked the Minister for

National  Development  if he will consider  granting  the

Main  Upgrading  Programme   (Standard  Package)  to  the

Pandan Gardens precinct as the polling

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2464</b></font><br><br>



results show that a majority of 68.84% of eligible voters

voted "yes" even though it fell below the 75% mark.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under the Housing and Development

Act,   the   Main  Upgrading  Programme  (MUP)   can   be

implemented  in a precinct only if at least  75%  of  the

eligible households vote for it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Pandan Gardens precinct, 68.84% of the

eligible voters voted for the MUP.  As this is less  than

the  required  75%, the precinct cannot  be  upgraded  as

there is no legal mandate for HDB to proceed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MUP is heavily subsidised. Having residents

poll  and  co-pay for the programme ensure that upgrading

is   only  carried  out  in  precincts  where  there   is

overwhelming  support for it.  That is  why  the  minimum

support  level  is  set  at 75%,  rather  than  a  simple

majority of 50%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MUP was introduced in 1990 to upgrade older HDB

estates  to  a  standard  that  is  comparable  to  newer

estates.  HDB residents find upgrading attractive  as  it

brings  them  tangible  benefits.  Five  other  precincts

polled  for  the MUP earlier this year have all  strongly

supported  it.   Three precincts achieved more  than  90%

"Yes"   votes,  while  the  other  two  had  "Yes"  votes

exceeding 80%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Pandan Gardens, some residents felt

that it would be prudent not to commit to expenditure  on

upgrading  during  this  period of economic  uncertainty.

Nevertheless,  I  note  that more than  two-thirds  still

voted for the programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB will continue to offer upgrading to older HDB

estates  as  it  improves the living environment  of  our

residents.   The  number of precincts we select  for  the

various  upgrading  programmes  will  take  into  account

prevailing  economic conditions and what the Government's

budgetary position allows.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2465</b></font><br><br>



consider  the precinct for Interim Upgrading as the  vast

majority   of  families  have  supported  the   upgrading

programme,  not  in the immediate future but,  at  least,

later on?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, the Main Upgrading Programme

(MUP)  and the Interim Upgrading Programme (IUP) are  two

separate  programmes,  and  selection  of  precincts  for

upgrading  under  these  two  programmes  is   based   on

different criteria (age, flat types, geographical spread,

etc).   So, if this particular precinct in Pandan Gardens

is  one  day  nominated for interim upgrading  under  the

interim upgrading selection criteria by the adviser, then

we   will   consider  it  together  with  other  eligible

precincts.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, is it true that if a

precinct   rejects  the  offer  of  the  Main   Upgrading

Programme,  its  chances  of future  upgrading  shall  be

forfeited?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> No. As I explained in my answer to

Dr  Tan  just now, if at some future point in  time  that

particular  precinct  is nominated  again,  it  could  be

selected for MUP or IUP.

<div align="center"><b>(Measures to encourage)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</b> asked the Acting Minister

for  Education in view of the recent NIE survey  findings

that  there is very little inter-racial mixing in schools

(a)  what  measures  have the schools  and  the  Ministry

introduced to encourage inter-racial mixing; (b) will his

Ministry   consider  implementing  further  measures   to

encourage inter-racial mixing, and if so, what these are;

and   (c)  if  his  Ministry  will  consider  encouraging

students to volunteer for community projects with  multi-racial  objectives at the Community Clubs and recognising

these for Co-Curricular Activities points.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam</b> asked the Acting

Minister for Education (a) what courses are available  to

trainee  teachers to equip them with skills to deal  with

the inadvertent racial prejudices among

school  children;  (b)  what  is  the  content  of  these

courses;  (c) whether such courses can be made compulsory

for  all trainee and in-service teachers, principals  and

other  support  staff in schools; and (d)  how  will  his

children.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (Acting Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I take Question

Nos. 3 and 4 together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Dr Amy Khor referred to

the  recent  NIE  study  on inter-racial  mixing  in  our

schools.   The  NIE  study was  a  useful  one,  and  its

findings  should not surprise us.  The findings reinforce

our   schools'  belief  in  the  importance   of   racial

understanding  and racial mixing.  They  also  illustrate

that nation building is a long and continuing process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor asked what we have done to encourage

racial  mixing and if we will consider further  measures.

Both  MOE and our schools take this very seriously.  Last

year  MOE  set  up  a  Committee on Strengthening  Racial

Harmony  in  Schools, chaired by Parliamentary  Secretary

for  Education  Mr Hawazi Daipi, to provide  guidance  to

schools,  keep  up the momentum, and help them  to  share

effective and interesting practices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through both the formal curriculum and a range of

informal  practices, pupils of different  races  interact

with  each  other,  work in teams, and learn  first  hand

about  each other's cultures.  Besides the staple  events

which  every  child  takes part in, like  celebration  of

ethnic festivals, Racial Harmony Day, Heritage Tours, and

so  on,  every school also organises and adopts  its  own

programmes.  For example, several schools have  organised

multi-racial  team games, home visits and home  stays  in

which  students  get a chance to live with  each  other's

families.  Others have introduced the learning of another

mother  tongue  as a third language at the conversational

level.  And there are many other examples.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2467</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Co-curricular activities (CCA) programmes, such as

sports,  dance,  uniformed groups, provide  an  excellent

platform  for students to play together, train  together,

and build friendships.  In many instances, they allow for

strong bonding experiences, especially when students have

to  overcome challenging tasks together.  Not every sport

or  dance attracts pupils from all races, and we may have

to  do more to interest pupils in activities that they do

not  naturally gravitate towards.  Many schools, in fact,

take  special  effort  to  ensure  a  mix  of  pupils  of

different races in various CCAs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor also asked if we encourage students to

volunteer   for  community  projects  with   multi-racial

objectives at Community Clubs and recognise these for CCA

points in our schools.  Our schools are doing so.  Pupils

doing  community  projects, organised  by  the  Community

Clubs or the CDCs, are recognised as performing community

service and are awarded CCA points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Braema Mathi asked if our teachers are equipped

with  the  skills to handle racial prejudices.   All  our

teachers  are  trained in a repertoire of  classroom  and

pupil  management  skills which include  handling  racial

prejudice, if it does occur.  There are a number of  pre-service  as  well as in-service training courses,  forums

and workshops which raise the awareness of principals and

teachers and sensitise them to racial issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Braema Mathi had also asked that we further

promote the use of the English language within schools as

a  common  social  glue  for children.   I  should  first

emphasise  that the use of the English language  and  the

mother  tongues  has  to be seen in the  context  of  our

bilingual   policy,   and  the  complex   home   language

environment  that  we  have in  Singapore.   We  have  to

provide  adequate opportunity for students  to  use  both

English  and  their  mother tongues in  school,  and  not

promote one to the exclusion of the other.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;English is the predominant language of the

classroom.  In addition, schools

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2468</b></font><br><br>



use  CCAs  such  as oratorical contests and  debates  and

various  other informal strategies to encourage  students

to  use  the English language, especially those  students

who are not confident in the language.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The language pupils speak in school naturally does

have bearing on the ease of interaction between pupils of

different  races.  But there is no one-size  solution  to

this  issue.   We do not, for example, intend  to  impose

common  guidelines on our schools on the  languages  that

pupils  should  be allowed to use outside the  classroom.

We  have a spectrum of schools in our system, with pupils

showing   quite   different   language   abilities    and

preferences.   In  schools where pupils speak  mainly  in

their  own mother tongue outside the classroom  and  have

little  opportunity to use the English language at  home,

teachers  look  for  creative ways to encourage  them  to

speak  English  in  school as much as possible.   But  in

schools  where  pupils speak English most  of  the  time,

sometimes  all  of  the time, there  are  perfectly  good

reasons  why  teachers should encourage their  pupils  to

speak their mother tongues, at least part of the time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depending on the profile of their pupils, schools

will  have to find the right balance, a sensible balance,

between speaking English and their mother tongues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have made great progress over the last four

decades.  We have an integrated, national school  system,

vastly   different   both  in  structure   and   everyday

experiences from the segregated, vernacular school system

of  the  past.  Our schools have reinforced this  with  a

range  of programmes and informal practices, through  the

year,  aimed  at  increasing  racial  understanding   and

interaction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we do more in our schools? Yes, we can. Many

suggestions have been made by the public, the  media  and

Members of Parliament, and we will look at them.  But MOE

does  not intend to impose a common or fixed template  on

schools  on  how  they should go about  promoting  racial

harmony  or  racial  interaction.  We  have  to  let  the

schools work out their own

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2469</b></font><br><br>



programmes.  Our principals and teachers are the ones who

are  in  the  best  position  to  devise  innovative  and

interesting  ways of encouraging this.  And many  schools

are  also  getting their students themselves  engaged  in

thinking  through ideas, coming up with  ideas,  and  how

they can spur this and get an ease of interaction between

the races.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But our schools are also mindful that we cannot

force  interaction  or contrive a  sense  of  comfort  or

friendship  between  students of  different  backgrounds.

There  has to be an element of self-motivation, a certain

spontaneity,  even a sense of discovery, in any  activity

that  aims  to  promote  racial  interaction  and  racial

understanding.   Our  children  have  to   make   friends

naturally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would encourage our schools to redouble their

efforts to promote inter-racial understanding and  mixing

among  all their pupils.  But schools cannot work  alone.

Parents  and the community at large play equally critical

roles.   I  cannot emphasise this enough.   This  is  why

schools  have  actively reached out to  parents  and  the

community  to  take  on  the  shared  responsibility   of

building  a  cohesive  society.   I  hope  they   receive

encouragement and support for their efforts.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister: would he not agree that the levels of promotion

of   inter-racial  mixing  in  school   can   vary   very

significantly,  depending on how much effort  the  school

puts  in  for such programmes?  This being the case,  and

judging  from  the NIE study, although I may  agree  that

inter-racial mixing takes a long time, would  it  not  be

more  effective if MOE plans a more coordinated  approach

and  concerted effort in asking the schools to  implement

programmes  to  allow for more inter-racial  mixing,  for

instance, through activities, say, in a particular period

devoted  for such projects?  Would the Minister also  not

agree  that students tend to mix amongst their classmates

within  a  class and generally not with schoolmates  from

other classes?  And this being the case, for instance  in

the case of streaming, would it not be better if you

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2470</b></font><br><br>



can actually promote activities which allow mixing across

the races through school-wide activities?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> MOE does not have a

hands-off  policy on this.  We are trying to spread  best

practices.   When  we  see  an interesting  idea  in  one

school,  we  publicise it within the cluster of  schools.

There is a fair bit being done so that schools learn from

each   other.   They  are  also  seeding  some   national

initiatives.  Some of the activities may be symbolic, but

taken together they go quite a long way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the basic point is that we have got to let

the  schools  themselves come up  with  innovative  ways.

There has to be that spark of ownership and innovation in

the schools, and it is happening.  If you look around our

schools,   you  will  be  surprised  at  the  amount   of

innovation that is taking place, not just in general  but

on  ways  of encouraging racial interaction.  I can  give

you  many examples.   For instance, Dunman High,  teaming

up   with   neighbourhood  primary  schools  on   reading

programmes,  involving  them  in  celebration  of  ethnic

festivals;  Nanyang  Girls  High  teaming  up  also  with

neighbourhood  schools which have a  high  proportion  of

minority  students, involving the girls in  coaching  and

mentoring.  Two weeks ago, Bukit Panjang Government  High

staged a Chinese opera at Victoria School.  Out of the 30

students in the cast, 11 were non-Chinese.  And the  lead

actress in this Chinese opera was a Faizah Samsudin.  Her

Mandarin  was yi dian dian.  But she recited  her  entire

script. Her fellow actors and actresses helped her,  told

her what the meaning of each phrase or each sentence was,

and she did it with aplomb!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Friday, I was at Bukit Batok Secondary School

where  it  staged an Indian dance.  Maybe one-third  were

non-Indians.  And, in my opinion, the best dancer  was  a

Chinese girl  -  style, and everything!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, it is happening. And I think our principals and

teachers have this at the back of their minds.   They  do

not want to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2471</b></font><br><br>



over-do  it.  They do not want to contrive it.  But  they

have  it at the back of their minds, encouraging students

of  different  races to get involved in activities  which

they do not naturally gravitate towards.  It is happening

and  I  do  not think we want to over-force it.   But  we

should  monitor it, spread best practices  and  encourage

our schools on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think streaming is the issue. If anything,

through  streaming, we have allowed in both  our  primary

and  secondary schools a much broader range of  abilities

within  the  same  school.   And  if  we  did  not   have

streaming, we would have more segregation of the races by

school,  where you have some schools with a  much  larger

proportion  of  minority students by virtue  of  academic

achievement.  That is the reality in some other countries

that  you can observe.  So, through streaming, a sensible

approach  of  being  able to match  academic  courses  to

abilities of students, we have been able to get  a  broad

range   of  students  within  the  same  school.    Every

Government school has more than one stream.  The issue is

how  do  we  ensure  that whatever  stream  you  are  in,

whatever class you are in, you have ample opportunity for

interaction  within the school, within  the  clusters  of

schools, and across schools.  It can be done, and  it  is

being done.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Can I

please  get  greater  clarity on  the  courses  that  our

teachers and principals, including support staff, go for?

That  is  the bedrock, and I would like greater assurance

on that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> There is a whole range

of  courses.    For  instance, at the pre-service  level,

there  is  a compulsory module where all our teachers  go

through,  on the social context of teaching and learning.

It  is  a compulsory module which includes issues  to  do

with   race  and  ensuring  that  they  have  a   certain

sensitivity  towards racial issues.  We have  our  annual

principals' forum and National Education Forum.  We  have

a monthly

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2472</b></font><br><br>



video which we call "News Teach".  All of these deal with

national  issues,  and  they  often  cover  issues  which

enhance  awareness and sensitivity to race.  So it  is  a

whole  plethora of courses.  I cannot say whether  it  is

enough.  If there is any specific feedback on how we  can

improve a particular module or course, I am sure NIE will

look at it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Would the Minister

agree  with  me  that the understanding  among  different

ethnic  groups could be better fostered if  students  are

given  opportunities to interact on a daily basis, rather

than on the occasional performances that they put up?  In

this  regard, I was wondering whether the Minister  would

consider  allowing SAP schools at the  primary  level  to

offer  non-Chinese  as  a second language  so  that  non-Chinese  students  can  enrol  into  the  schools,   thus

creating  a  better  environment  and  providing   better

opportunities for children to interact on a daily  basis,

rather than on an occasional basis.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> We need both, I think.

I  take the point that daily interaction does lead  to  a

certain  sense of comfort that you cannot easily  acquire

from  sporadic or episodic interaction.  It is being done

in  most  schools  when  project teams  are  formed,  for

instance,  within  the classroom or  within  a  standard.

Teachers bear this in mind, making sure that there  is  a

good racial mix.  More can be done probably.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On SAP schools, it may be precisely because they are

SAP schools and they are aware of the fact that they have

a  very largely Chinese population of students, that they

tend  to  think a lot harder about this issue  than  most

schools.  They think of all kinds of schemes they can get

involved  in.  They are the ones who have taken the  lead

in  reaching out to the neighbourhood schools - coaching,

mentoring, involving them in ethnic festivals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I visited one SAP school a few months ago, Kong Hwa

Primary  School.   They had introduced sepak  takraw  for

their  students.   While  I was talking  to  a  group  of

students  and asking them about their ambitions in  life,

and so on, one young boy put up his hand and said, "I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2473</b></font><br><br>



want  to  be  a  national sportsman."  I asked  him  what

sport.   He  said "sepak takraw".  He may  not  become  a

national sepak takraw sportsman.  But something has  been

planted in his mind.  So this is going on all the time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can include a few more non-Chinese students in

SAP schools, but we have got to make sure they remain SAP

schools.   We  have  got to make sure  that  they  remain

something   distinctive,  something  that   retains   the

diversity  in  our  school system  because  that  is  our

strength.   Let us not go for uniformity,  but  within  a

diverse system, create bridges, create opportunities  for

interaction, where meaningful.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I do not know whether the

Government  is  too  worried over the problem  of  inter-racial  mixing  in schools.  Singapore is 38  years  old.

America  is over 200 years old.  I would like to ask  the

Minister whether our level of inter-racial mixing in  our

schools is just as good as in America.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> That will require

another NIE study, Sir, and I am really not qualified  to

comment on this.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I would like

to  seek  the Minister's clarification as to whether  the

Ministry's  practice  is to have a hands-on  policy  with

regard  to  how teachers and principals encourage  multi-racialism in schools, or is it something where they  want

to  be  proactive  and  continue to monitor  what  really

happens  in  schools.  I think the problem in many  cases

may  be the principals and teachers who turn a blind  eye

to  the problem in the schools for various reasons.  I do

not know the exact reason and many people have gone on to

speculate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am just wondering, if such an instance that I

cited  is  the case, whether the Ministry could  be  more

proactive  and  also  give avenue for  parents  and  even

students  to  highlight  cases that  such  practices  are

condoned by teachers and principals and thereby lead to a

lack  of inter-racial mixing.  Feedback seems to indicate

that principals and teachers do contribute to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2474</b></font><br><br>



the problem, because they turn a blind eye to the matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, more importantly, I would like to ask the

Minister  whether the committee, that is  headed  by  the

Parliamentary Secretary, could come out with various ways

of  monitoring not only the measures but the  results  of

some  of  these things that the schools have implemented,

and   not  instances  where  a  Minister  or  Member   of

Parliament  visits the school, they put up a  show  as  a

model  of multi-racialism, but when the Minister,  MP  or

VIP leaves, what is the real situation in the school.  We

can   find   out  whether  this  is  what  the  Singapore

population wants.  Is it the reality, or is it that  some

policies or the principals and teachers in charge of  the

schools  are the cause of the problem?   So I would  urge

the  Ministry to pay greater attention to the problem  in

school.   It  is  no  point that we start  talking  about

nation building ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ravindran, no speeches, please.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> I restrict that to my question.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Let me reiterate that we

do  not have a hands-offpolicy in this matter and we  are

not closing our eyes to the matter.  In fact, we look  at

it  very  seriously.  We spend time and energy trying  to

figure out new ways of enhancing racial interaction.  The

point  is  that  the way to do it is  not  to  impose  on

schools  a  set formula, a fixed template.  It would  not

work.   It would be artificial, and it would not  achieve

what  we really want.  If we want to achieve a degree  of

comfort  that  lasts between pupils, it  has  got  to  be

bottoms-up, guided from the Ministry, encouraged  by  the

Ministry,  and our role is to ensure that best  practices

get  exchanged  quickly and innovation takes  place  that

way.  We will try and raise the water level.  But the way

to  do  it is not to pour a little bit into each  beaker.

The way to do it is to exchange best practices quickly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there are egregious examples of prejudice, we

take action.  We look into it.  There may be occasionally

a case of a principal or teacher who does not pay

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2475</b></font><br><br>



sufficient  attention to something and those  are  easily

corrected.  Because every principal I have met  is  aware

of  the  issue,  keen  to address  the  issue  and  doing

something about it.  But we are not perfect.  There  will

always   be  room  for  improvement.   So  when  we   get

suggestions, we take it seriously and we pass it down  to

the  schools.  I really have to emphasise the  fact,  and

this comes from teachers and principals that parents bear

a  considerable  responsibility in this process.   Pupils

bring  into  the  classroom and school values  that  they

imbibe  from their parents.  They may be direct  messages

that their parents give or just indirect messages by  way

of  behaviour.  And I get this message all the time  from

the  schools about how they have got to go out  of  their

way   to  counter  the  biases  and  values  that  pupils

sometimes  bring into schools.  So we have  got  to  take

this  as  a whole community effort, by involving everyone

and  trying to address the problem.  If schools do it  on

their own, they will go some distance, but they cannot go

very far.  Everyone has got to be involved.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Sir, I have to come back

to  the  same question about teachers and principals.   I

feel  that the question has not been adequately answered.

Parents,  yes,  the key word I used in  my  question  was

"inadvertent".  Parents may directly or indirectly  bring

in some prejudices into a child's life.  It is imperative

in  the  early childhood as well as in the lower  primary

that  our  teachers have good coping skills to deal  with

such  prejudices  and  not turn away,  because  they  are

inadequately prepared for it.  So I would really love  to

know  what  are the courses that they are equipped  with.

What  are  the  skills?  What can  we  learn  from  other

countries?   What can we introduce so that  our  teachers

are better equipped to deal with such prejudices that  do

surface with young children, who do not even know perhaps

what they are saying?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Sir, I have mentioned at

least  one  course  earlier on.   There  is  a  range  of

courses, not just

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2476</b></font><br><br>



pre-service,    but   in-service,   forums,    workshops.

Training for Civics and Moral Education has as one of its

key  modules,  issues  to  do  with  race,  students   of

different  social backgrounds, cultures and  religions  - how you deal with it, how you sensitise pupils to it, how

you  raise the level of understanding.  I do not have the

whole  list and exactly how many hours are spent on every

course right now.  Can we improve?  I am sure there  will

be  scope for improvement.  And I will be quite happy  to

take  any  suggestions  on how any particular  course  or

module  can be improved.  But a lot is being  done.   Our

teachers  are  being  prepared.   They  may  not  all  be

practising what you expect to equal degree.  But, by  and

large,  they  are sensitive to this and they  are  trying

hard.  And they need the support of everyone else.

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, I am

curious  to  find  out  whether  the  syllabus  and   the

practices in school focus more on the differences amongst

the  various  ethnic  groups,  or  on  the  commonalities

amongst   the   groups.   Surely,  with  the   heightened

awareness  of differences, people will be more  sensitive

to  each other but they would also be more distinct as  a

group, and the reverse is also true.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> I think we have to do

both.   We  do  not teach differences.  But we  do  teach

every  pupil  to  respect the strength of the  traditions

that they each come from.  When you learn about Indian or

Malay  civilisation, you are not learning it in order  to

understand how different an Indian is from a Chinese,  or

a  Malay is from a Chinese.  You are learning it so  that

you  acquire a certain respect for the strength of  these

traditions,  how they develop.  You are also learning  it

in  order  to understand that they all share  values  and

precepts  in  common.   And if you  look  at  our  actual

syllabuses,  civics and moral education, social  science,

and  so  on,  you see a fair bit of it there, emphasising

the   common   values  and  precepts  that   cut   across

civilisations  and  cultures.  So we are  not  trying  to

teach  students how different they are from  each  other.

We  are  trying  to  teach them to  respect  each  other,

despite the fact that they have different

backgrounds,  religions  and  cultures.   We   are   also

teaching  them that there is a lot in common between  our

different cultures.

<div align="center"><b>LEVY ON COURSE FEE COLLECTIONS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Rationale of imposition by People's Association)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Charles Chong</b> asked the Minister for

Community  Development and Sports (a)  what  is  the  (i)

rationale  for the People's Association (PA)  imposing  a

10%  levy  on  the course fee collections from  Community

Centres  (CC)  and Residents' Committees  (RC)  from  1st

September 2004, (ii) approximate cost incurred by  PA  in

providing  support to trainers and private  operators  in

the  running  of  the CC/RC courses and  activities,  and

(iii) estimated amount that will be generated as a result

of  the  proposed  levy; and (b) how does  PA  intend  to

ensure  that  individual trainers and  private  operators

absorb  the  levy rather than pass it on to residents  in

the form of higher fees, reduced service or reduced share

to the CCs and RCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Community Development and Sports (Mr Chan Soo Sen) (for the Minister for Community Development and Sports): Mr Speaker, Sir, the 10% levy

was  imposed  on the course fee collections  because  the

People's Association (PA) has been incurring higher costs

over  the  year providing capital, manpower and operating

expenditures to support Community Clubs/Community Centres

(CCs)  as well as Residents' Committee (RC) centres.   It

also  provides trainers and course operators a wide range

of  support.  These overhead costs are not charged to the

trainers and course operators.  This is obviously  not  a

sustainable state of affairs.  Hence, PA has  decided  to

recover  part  of the costs by levying  a  10%  share  of

course  fee  collections  in two  stages:   5%  from  1st

September 2003, and 10% from 1st September 2004.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current manpower cost of supporting CC and RC

courses  amounts  to  about  $5  million  per  year.   In

addition,  about  $3  million  per  year  is   spent   on

maintaining facilities needed to conduct the courses.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2478</b></font><br><br>



The  total  cost incurred by the People's Association  in

supporting trainers and private operators in the  running

of  the  courses  is therefore about $8 million  a  year.

This cost does not include the expenses incurred by PA in

upgrading  the  trainers  as well  as  in  upgrading  the

facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CC and RC centre course fee collections range from

about  $15  million to $20 million annually.   Therefore,

the  10%  levy means PA would eventually receive  between

$1.5  and  $2 million per year.  In the first year,  only

half  of  this  amount  will be  collected.   Hence,  the

collection of 10% levy recovers only a small part of PA's

cost  in  organising the courses.  This is just  a  small

sharing  of costs by the trainers and operators with  the

PA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PA does not think the levy will lead to reduced

service  or reduced share to the CCs and RCs.  Conducting

courses  at  the  CCs and RCs remains attractive  to  the

course  operators.  At 40%, the total levy  collected  by

CCs/RCs  and  PA  remains lower than the private  sector.

The  CCs  and  RCs continue to give good support  to  the

course operators.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the course fees, the CCs and RCs have agreed

to  PA's appeal to hold course fees at current level  for

at  least  six months until February 2004.  Beyond  that,

course  fees  will  depend  on  the  willingness  of  the

customers to pay.  However, the course operators need not

increase course fees to cover the 10% levy if they do not

want   to,   because  they  could  recoup  by  increasing

productivity,  such  as by taking two  or  perhaps  three

additional participants per course.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  is  the Minister of State aware that some of  these

operators  have  contractual agreements  which  would  be

valid  beyond 1st January 2004?  Does PA intend to honour

these contractual agreements with the operators?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> What type of contractual

agreements?  PA can look at them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I draw the

Minister of State's attention to a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2479</b></font><br><br>



letter which was sent out to all grassroots leaders.   In

the  letter,  it  says that "where there are  contractual

agreements  with private operators, PA, CCs or  RCs  will

renegotiate to apply 5% of the share for the  PA  at  the

first opportunity on or after 1st September 2003, and  in

no  case later than 1st January 2004".  Some of these RCs

have contractual agreements with the operators which last

for two years, and these go beyond 1st January 2004.  So,

will these contracts be honoured?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> As I have said earlier, we will

look  at the contractual agreements specifically and then

advise the Member.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Charles Chong, could you please

raise your hand first so that I know you want to speak?

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> I am sorry. Mr Speaker, Sir,

could  I  have  a clearer response from the  Minister  of

State?   Do we honour these contracts or do we not honour

these contracts?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> The Member has quoted the word

"negotiate".   We  will negotiate with the  intention  of

complying with the circular that has been sent.   But  if

there  are very, very strong contractual agreements  that

affect  the ability to reach an agreement, PA is prepared

to look at it on a case-by-case basis.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if

increasing  cost  is  of great concern  to  the  People's

Association,  can the Minister of State explain  to  this

House  why  is  it  necessary to have  the  logo  of  the

Residents'  Committee changed at such a time?   How  much

did the whole exercise cost the  PA,  and  how  much would it cost  all  the  RCs  in

Singapore to effect the change?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Can the Member repeat the part

about the increase as I could not quite get him?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> I said that if increasing cost is

of  great  concern  to the PA, why did  the  PA  feel  it

necessary  to change the RC logo at this point  of  time.

How much does the whole exercise cost



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2480</b></font><br><br>



the PA and how much would it cost all the RCs in Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> I do not have the cost figure for

the  changing of the logo.  But the change of logo  is  a

separate issue.  We have come to the stage where we  feel

that  it  is good to review the logo.  In fact,  quite  a

number  of Members of this House had also given  feedback

that  it  was about time to consider the change of  logo.

We  therefore conducted that particular review.  A design

competition  was organised and a new logo was  introduced

by  looking at some winning designs and modifying to suit

our needs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Would the Minister of State not

agree  with me that if the cost is going to be passed  on

to  the  residents, imposing a levy of 5% at this  moment

may  not  be an appropriate time because, ultimately,  it

would be the residents who end up picking up the 5%  levy

rather than the trainers?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> I think we can accept that there

is  no good time to impose an additional levy, and we did

say that, because of the economic condition, we asked the

RCs  to hold the cost to the residents for six months and

they have agreed.

<div align="center"><b>SHOWER ROOM TEMPERED GLASS DOORS IN HDB FLATS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Shattering)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Miss Penny Low</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  as  the shattering of shower  room  tempered

glass  doors  has been classified as "rough handling  and

improper  renovation works" (a) what are  HDB's  criteria

for determining rough usage as research shows that a very

high  force or stress is required to cause tempered glass

to  shatter; and  (b) as there were two cases  where  the

shattering  has resulted in shards rather than fragments,

what  is  the  quality control process that HDB  uses  to

ensure the safety of the homeowners.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2481</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, HDB

uses  tempered  glass for its shower  screens  as  it  is

stronger compared to normal glass, and tempered glass  is

less  likely to cause injury when broken.  While tempered

glass  is  able to withstand stronger impact than  normal

glass,  it  can  still break, if used improperly.   Rough

usage  may  cause chipping of the glass.  Over time,  the

chips may develop into cracks, causing the glass to break

suddenly when they widen to a certain crack width.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to pinpoint the actual cause of the

breakage  after  the  incident.   Nevertheless,  in  some

instances,  there  are  signs  that  would  indicate  the

possibility of rough usage.  These include:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Cracks on the brackets holding the frameless

glass  door, which may be caused by repeated slamming  of

the glass door;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Dislodgement of the frame holding the fixed

glass panel from the outer frame;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Chips at the glass edge on the unbroken glass;

and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) Scattering of glass fragments over a big area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the shower screens are installed using

specialised systems, according to the prevailing industry

standard.   The glass suppliers supplying tempered  glass

to  HDB  projects  have  their in-house  quality  control

testing  to  ensure  that the tempered  glass  meets  the

required  standard.  Since mid-2002,  HDB  also  conducts

additional  sample testing to ensure the quality  of  the

tempered glass.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, may I ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary whether

the  HDB  has  a code of practice on the use of  tempered

glass and whether it is suitable to use tempered glass in

our  public  housing estates, especially in those  public

areas?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, there is a standard

for  the  use of glass in Singapore and that standard  is

called Singapore

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2482</b></font><br><br>



Standard 341 (SS341).  The latest standard is SS341-2001.

I  have a copy here, and the standard specifies the  kind

of glass that can be used.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is tempered glass a suitable glass for use in HDB

homes?   Sir,  tempered  glass  is  a  standard  building

material.   It is used in offices, hotels, in  Parliament

here,  and  it is therefore suitable to be  used  in  HDB

flats.

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> In one of the past sittings in this

House  when the shattered shower glass screen  issue  was

brought up, I was given the assurance that all units with

tempered  shower screens would be checked.  I  understand

also  that indeed the HDB officers had gone around to  do

the  checking.   Nevertheless, a  number  of  units  that

experienced  shattering  shower  screens  recently   were

inspected units.  Not only that, they resulted in  shards

rather than rounded-edge pieces of shattered glass.  That

indicates certain defects within the material itself.  In

other  words,  it  is not due to rough  usage  but  to  a

defective product.  May I ask what is the explanation for

that,   since  they  were  already  checked,  they   were

inspected  to  be good and not defective,  and  yet  they

cracked into shards, and that is defective?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, following the

Parliament session last year when I replied to Miss Penny

Low,  HDB went to about 15,000 flats and inspected almost

30,000 shower screens.  The purpose of that exercise  was

to inspect for the quality of the hinges and the fixtures

that  were  used  to  hold the frameless  tempered  glass

screens.   At  the same time, during the inspection,  HDB

officers  also  inspected for any  chips  resulting  from

rough  usage.  At that exercise, some glass  panels  were

changed  because they found that some of the hinges  were

not  in  order  and we suspected that these  hinges  came

loose  because of rough usage.  So, we made good all  the

glass shower screens we thought at that time were not  in

order.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two accidents came about after the inspection.

The  inspection  process does not guarantee  that  future

accidents would not occur.  But it did guarantee at

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2483</b></font><br><br>



that time that the inspected batch was safe for use.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, may I ask the Senior

Parliamentary  Secretary  how does  the  Ministry  define

rough  usage in HDB's context, and whether SS341  defines

rough usage?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, SS341 defines three

methods for testing the safety of tempered glass.   SS341

specifies  that the glass should go through three  tests.

The  first  one is called the impact test, ie, you  break

the  glass  upon  a certain impact.  The second  test  is

known  as  the fragmentation test.  It is to  pierce  the

glass  to see how many pieces it breaks into over a small

area.   The  third  test is the surface compression  test

which  sends  a light ray through the glass and  measures

the angle of bending of the glass.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rough usage, unfortunately, is quite common in many

of the instances that we have inspected.  In fact, in the

incident in Block 130 Edgedale Plains, HDB suspected that

the glass broke because of rough usage.  But, having said

that, once a shower screen has broken into pieces, it  is

difficult to ascertain whether it is truly rough usage or

any other cause.  But based on the inspection on a sample

size  of  about 30,000 shower screens last year, we  have

come  to the conclusion that rough usage is the principal

cause of many of the accidents that have happened in  the

HDB flats.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, I wonder whether

it is cost effective and necessary for the HDB to install

such shower screens in completed HDB flats.  I think  the

owner can easily get a contractor to install whatever  he

wants.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, the use of tempered

glass is a common practice in the private sector, whether

it  is  in  the  office or in the homes  of  the  private

estates.   Therefore,  HDB  was just  following  standard

practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we have learnt from this episode and we will

have to decide whether we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2484</b></font><br><br>



will  continue the use of glass shower screens in  future

HDB contracts.

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Could the Senior Parliamentary

Secretary   then  explain  what  instances  would   cause

tempered  shower  screens to shatter into  shards  rather

than  in  rounded  pieces?  Because, if the  incident  at

Block 130 Edgedale Plains was caused by rough usage, then

it should not have shattered into shards.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> In the incident

mentioned  by  Miss  Penny Low, we suspected  that  rough

usage was the cause of the shattering.  The fact that the

shower  screen  shattered into shards  rather  than  into

small  little  pieces is something that  HDB  has  to  do

further tests on.  So, we will subject some of the  glass

shower  screens in the cluster of flats around Block  130

to   the  surface  compression  test,  which  is  a  non-destructive  testing which can be done in-situ.   We  are

willing to go to every unit in the Block 130 cluster.  We

will  instruct HDB to work with Miss Penny  Low  and  her

grassroots leaders on the possible replacement of some of

these shower screens, if Miss Penny Low thinks that  they

should be replaced.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I would like to

ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary whether there is a

possibility that tempered glass can shatter in shards and

not necessarily in rounded pieces.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, tempered glass can

break  and, when they break, they break into small little

pieces.   When they break into shards, we have to subject

the  glass  panel to further tests to see why they  break

into shards rather than into small little pieces.

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> I am happy to hear the Senior

Parliamentary Secretary assuring us that they would  look

into  the  shattered  shower  screens  together  with  my

residents and grassroots leaders.  Can I propose that  we

form a special task force to jointly look into this issue

as  well  as  other estate developmental  issues  because

there  have  been  some  unhappiness  and  inconveniences

brought to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2485</b></font><br><br>



residents due to the slowdown in the building project  in

Punggol 21?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yes, we

would  ask HDB to work with the MP of that area  to  look

into all the issues in the estate, including the issue of

broken shower screens.

<div align="center"><b>DEPOSITS COLLECTED AND TRANSFERRED TO SP SERVICES</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for Trade

and  Industry  (a) what is the total amount  of  deposits

collected to-date from domestic consumers and transferred

to  SP  Services by its predecessor (PUB); (b)  how  much

interest  has been earned on the said deposits;  and  (c)

whether  SP Services will offset the interest  earned  by

each consumer against his/her monthly utilities charges.

<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as of end June 2003, the

total deposit collected from domestic consumers was  $148

million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For each consumer, SP Services buys electricity for

immediate  delivery  while  the  consumer  pays  for  the

electricity  only 1.5 months later.  By law, SP  Services

is  allowed to charge a deposit, up to 1.5 months of  the

consumer's monthly bill, to finance SP Services' purchase

of  electricity  for the consumer's use.   Therefore,  SP

Services does not earn interest on these deposits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deposit also acts as a safeguard to minimise the

risk  against  default payments.  Without the  safeguard,

default  payments  will  end up being  recovered  through

higher  electricity tariffs, which will be borne  by  all

consumers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, is it correct for me to say

that SP Services does not deposit these deposits in fixed

deposit accounts in the banks?

<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</b> I do not know the

details of SP Services' practice

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2486</b></font><br><br>



with  regard to the deposits.  I think the intent of  his

Question was how much they have collected, which is  $148

million.   As  I  have said, this basically  gets  offset

because   it   purchases  the  electricity  without   the

consumers  paying for it.  The consumers get a credit  of

45  days.  For his information, only 75% of consumers pay

on  time  and 25% actually pay after the 45 days.   Right

now, as at June 2003, the amount of arrears with domestic

consumers is about $246 million.  In other words, we have

$246  million that is owing to SP Services and they  have

collected  $148 million.  So they do not  make  money  on

these deposits.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Is the Minister of State saying

that the deposits collected are, as he has said, in fact,

used by SP Services for the purchase of oil or fuel?   If

that is the case, then it is a misuse of deposits.  As  I

understand it, in law, a deposit is a deposit and it  has

to  be  returned  when it is due.   You  cannot  use  the

deposits for your business purposes. No doubt SP Services

can  collect  up to 1.5 months of deposits.   But  is  it

also,  in  law, that they can make use of these  deposits

for their business purposes?

<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</b> Let me explain it again

to  Mr  Chiam.  SP Services buys upfront the  electricity

that the consumers use.  So, they are out of pocket. This

is  one part of the transaction.  The other part is  they

have  the deposits which they collect from the consumers.

It  gets offset.  They do not make any money out of this.

As  I  have  said, there are $246 million in arrears  and

$148 million which they have collected.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> My question is: do they have a

right  to  make use of the consumers' deposits for  their

own  business purposes?  Because, as I understand  it,  a

deposit  is  just  a  deposit to offset  any  overuse  of

electricity by the consumers. Now the Minister  of  State

is saying that SP Services takes the deposit and uses it.

That  means they are using the consumers' money for their

own business purposes, which is not right in law.

<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</b> I am actually puzzled

with Mr Chiam's question.  When you put money into an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2487</b></font><br><br>



account, as you know, money is basically fungible ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> This is not SP Services' money.

This is a deposit.

<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</b> Yes, if you close the

account, you get back the deposit. That is the issue.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, I would like

to  ask  the  Minister of State whether any other  public

utilities  company in the world pays interests  on  their

deposits.

<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</b> Not that I know of.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> The Minister of State

said  just now that the deposits would be offset  against

the arrears.  But how do you actually use the deposits to

offset the arrears.  Because arrears are arrears.   Money

collected  as deposit is deposit.  So I do not understand

whether,  in  accounting term, we  can  say  we  have  no

deposit balance because we have so much arrears.  Can  he

explain that?

<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</b> The issue here is

whether or not they earn interest.  I think that  is  the

intent of the question.  Did they earn interest?  If they

earn  interest,  can  we  use  this  interest  to  offset

electricity tariffs?  What I was saying is that  when  we

net it all off, there is no interest that is earned  -  a

45-day  deposit  against a 45-day credit.   The  separate

issue  that  Mr Chiam brought up is how can  we  use  the

security  deposit.  The real issue is that when you  want

the security deposit back, when you close the account, do

you get it back?  The answer is yes.

students'   active   involvement  and  participation   in

grassroots  work as part of the CCA curriculum;  and  (b)

how  can  his  Ministry review its overall curriculum  on

holistic character development of its students through  a

more  practical approach of linking project work  to  the

community  setting  on a longer term  period  and  for  a

greater number of students.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Question No. 8 , Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

community service, which includes working with grassroots

organisations, has always been a significant part of  the

CCA  programme in schools.  This component has been given

a  renewed  emphasis  following our  review  of  the  CCA

Guidelines  and Grading Scheme in 2002.  This  scheme  is

known  as "LEAPS" in our secondary schools, standing  for

Leadership,   Enrichment,   Achievement,   Participation,

Service.    It   recognises  students'   involvement   in

community  work as a separate category; in  other  words,

they  can obtain recognition for the number of hours they

put  into community involvement and earn CCA points.    A

similar  scheme  exists at the Junior College/Centralised

Institutes  level, recognising students'  voluntary  work

with the community organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho also asked about linking project work in

schools to a community setting. The project work that our

pre-university students are engaged in requires  them  to

collect  and  evaluate information from the  real  world.

Their  projects  typically involve them  collecting  data

through  observation, by interviewing people, or  through

surveys.   The  design  of  the project  work  curriculum

therefore  helps keep them in touch with the  issues  and

concerns  of  the community in which they live.   At  the

primary  and secondary levels, schools also engage  their

students  in  a  whole host of projects, including  those

which involve working with the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of holistic character development for

students,   many  schools  have  embarked  upon   Service

Learning.  Service

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2489</b></font><br><br>



Learning  is  an  extension of the Community  Involvement

Programme   (CIP).   Service  Learning   integrates   the

objectives  of the school curriculum, both  the  academic

curriculum  as well as the CCA curriculum with  community

service and project work.  By applying the knowledge  and

skills they learn in schools to their community projects,

students  engage  in activities that benefit  the  school

community and the community at large.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Could I ask the Minister whether his

Ministry could ensure that the CCA does not increase more

stress  to  our students as the present load  is  already

very high?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Sir, the inclusion of

community projects does not lead to an increased load  of

CCA  but  increased breadth of CCA.  It provides students

with  the  opportunity to get involved in things  outside

the  school  and  that  develops in them  quite  valuable

skills as well as valuable attitudes which they will take

into life.

<div align="center"><b>STRESS IN STUDENTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Trend)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mdm Ho

Geok Choo -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. To ask the Acting Minister for Education whether

there  is  a  trend which shows that students, especially

those in the higher level, are increasingly succumbing to

stress  arising from relationships and studies  and  what

are the measures being taken to address these issues.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Question No. 9, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Mr Chan Soo Sen) (for the Acting Minister for Education):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  a  short answer to Mdm Ho's  Question  is

"no".  There is no evidence that students at  the  higher

level   are   increasingly  succumbing  to  stress   from

relationships  and  studies.   Stress  is,  in  fact,   a

complex phenomenon with multiple causes.  How individuals

respond to stress also varies widely from

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2490</b></font><br><br>



individual    to   individual,   depending    on    their

dispositions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education adopts a comprehensive

approach  to provide psychological and emotional  support

for  students.  We believe that prevention is better than

cure.   Hence,  all  pupils are taught lifeskills,  which

cover topics on personal and interpersonal effectiveness.

For  example, the focus of sexual education for  students

at  the  JC/CI level, implemented this year, is  also  on

interpersonal relationships, covering topics such as self-worth in courtships, dating, conflicts and the importance

of   family  support.   This  helps  our  students  build

satisfying  relationships  and  cope  with  life  changes

effectively   as   they  grow  up.    Complementing   the

structured  teaching  of lifeskills,  schools  also  have

systems  to  facilitate  the  early  identification   and

support  of  students who need help, and refer  them  for

counselling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All teachers are now first-line caregivers and are

given  training in basic counselling skills so that  they

may  provide  immediate basic counselling to students  in

need.  Students with more difficult problems are referred

to  teacher counsellors in their schools.  In fact, there

are  two  of  them in each school. Students  with  severe

needs   are  referred  to  the  Ministry  of  Education's

educational  psychologists and  guidance  specialists  or

external counsellors engaged by the schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While schools provide support for the students, the

support  from  the  home  is  also  very  important.   In

establishing a warm and nurturing relationship with their

children, and maintaining it into their late adolescence,

parents  lay  the  foundation  to  develop  strength   of

character  in them.  Parents can help their children  set

realistic  expectations and model healthy problem-solving

strategies.   Schools and parents can  work  together  to

achieve this for their children.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister of State

whether  we  have  any schemes in place to  detect  early

suicidal cases in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2491</b></font><br><br>



students who suffer from a lot of stress in our schools.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> As I have said, this depends on

the  observation  by  the teachers.  Sometimes  when  the

students interact and if between their conversation, they

detect  that  some  of  their classmates  may  have  this

tendency,  they may raise this to the teachers  and  then

follow-ups can take place from there.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, is the Minister of State

aware  that  there were recent cases of suicides  in  our

junior colleges?  Has it been established that there is a

link between the suicides and the study stress?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> We are aware of the recent suicide

cases  in the JC students.  Investigation is still  being

undertaken  by the Police.  So far, there is no  evidence

to  show that the suicides were related to stress arising

from  school.   Let the investigation go through  and  we

will  be  able  to answer that question.  We  should  not

speculate  at  this  stage.    The  junior  colleges   do

organise support for the families as well as the  friends

of the students concerned.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> The Minister of

State  mentioned  that  there  are  counselling  services

provided  to  students.   But  I  understand  from   some

teachers  that  counselling services have been  cut  back

because of the cut in the Ministry's budget.  Can I  seek

an  assurance from the Minister of State that counselling

services will not be the first to go or the first  to  be

trimmed because of the cut in the Ministry's budget?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> I am very surprised to hear that

counselling services have been cut in schools.  In  fact,

in addition to what I have mentioned in my reply, MOE has

a  scheme to engage part-time counsellors from the  group

of  experienced teachers who have left the service.  With

their  wealth  of experience plus training by  MOE,  they

become  part-time counsellors.  They are paid  allowances

for their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2492</b></font><br><br>



services.   And the schools find this service very  good.

In fact, we plan to look into expanding it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, would the Minister

of State give an assurance that, notwithstanding the fact

that there is a scheme, there would be no further cuts or

reductions in the budget set aside for the engagement  of

counsellors for the schools?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Minister of State, in his earlier

reply,  said  that  a lot is dependent on  the  teachers'

ability to spot students with such suicidal tendency.   I

am  wondering whether the Ministry would put in  place  a

more proactive scheme to work with the students regularly

to  detect  and  sieve out the students  who  have  great

difficulties in managing relationships or work stress.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> I do not think I can give such an

assurance.  In fact, I do not think anybody can.  Piority

in allocating budget to programmes change over time.  But

I  would like to say that, as of now, there is no plan to

cut back allocation to counselling services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second question, I just want to say that

teachers  interact constantly with students.  So students

who have difficulties can raise their problems with their

teachers.   Or  if they raise their problems  with  their

friends,  their friends may be able to raise the problems

with the teachers, and the teachers follow up from there.

Our  best assurance is to have teachers trained in  basic

counselling  skills so that they will be able  to  detect

problems.  This has already been done.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Sir, the

Minister  of  State just now mentioned that there  is  no

indication  that  students  in  the  higher   level   are

succumbing to stress.  First, is there any difference  in

the  incidence of students at different levels  receiving

psychiatric help from institutions like NUH or IMH?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, what are the indicators used by MOE to

determine  the extent to which students are able  or  not

able to cope with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2493</b></font><br><br>



stress, and whether the Ministry is monitoring or keeping

track of these indicators?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> The number of students who are

seen  by IMH and the hospitals is not really a very  good

indicator.  An increase in number can be due to a greater

willingness   to  see  psychologists,  not  the   problem

becoming greater.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for numbers of the last few years, I do not have

them  with  me  at  the moment, but I  did  see  it  this

morning.  It is more or less steady, and it has gone down

a  little  in  the  last 2-3 years.   If  the  Member  is

interested, we can share those figures with him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have a list of formal indicators. As I

have  said,  we  depend  on  teachers  who  are  in   the

frontline.  We teach them how to observe signs of  stress

as  well as problems.  If it goes beyond a certain level,

it will be detected and follow-up action will be taken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as stress is concerned, I do believe that in

all  forms  of  learning, there is some form  of  stress.

Stress  is generated as we go into areas that are unknown

or  uncertain.  Learning, by definition, is  to  go  into

areas that are unknown so as to know more.  So, a certain

amount  of  stress in the learning process is  inevitable

and,  in fact, necessary to provide the drive.  If  there

is  no  stress, all of us will become very lethargic  and

lacking  in drive.  But the important thing is to  ensure

that when stress goes beyond a certain level, is becoming

dysfunctional and the student is unable to cope, the case

is detected and followed up on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stress exists in our education system. We do not

deny it.  But I just want to say that we have a system in

place to detect and follow up.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister of State whether

the  Ministry had investigated every suicide case of  our

students in the past, so that more precautionary measures

can be taken to prevent loss of lives?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> We take all the cases very

seriously and we try to learn from

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2494</b></font><br><br>



them.   But I want to say that from the tone Dr Lily  Neo

has put the question, I feel she may be saying that there

have  been  many such cases.  I do not think  there  have

been many such cases.  And for those cases, the stress is

not  necessarily with school related.  If we are  talking

about the recent cases, let the police investigations  be

completed.  We will certainly learn from there.  Like all

Members, MOE is very concerned about each case.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, would the Minister of State agree with me that

suicide is the result of a failure of our society to hear

the  last cries for help from the afflicted, and that  we

need  to improve on our helping process to those affected

who  feel a great sense of helplessness?  Something needs

to be done more than what is currently available.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Mr Steve Chia is assuming that

before  people commit suicide, they always cry for  help.

But  in  many instances, this does not happen.  Sometimes

there  is not even a symptom that the person is about  to

do  it.   As  I  have  said, if there are  symptoms  that

something is wrong that we can detect, we will intervene.

But  in cases where nothing of that sort happens and  the

person  just commits suicide, we will have to investigate

before  deciding what conclusion to draw, what to do  and

what lessons to learn.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, notwithstanding the various reasons for a person to

attempt  or  commit  suicide, I would  like  to  ask  the

Minister of State to give an idea of what the schools and

MOE  are  doing to reach out to parents and the community

to have a collective effort of trying to deal with stress-related  issues of our students, because  they  are  very

precious  resources  for  us.   And  I  think  from   the

indications  given, more needs to be done.  What  is  the

Ministry's contribution in this regard?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> There are additional channels that

we  can do to work with the community as well as with the

parents.  For example, under COMPASS, more and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2495</b></font><br><br>



more schools are forming the parent-teacher associations.

This  is  one mechanism that we can use to work with  the

parents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools also work with Community Development

Councils and some of the CDC projects also carry a social

element.   And  if Members have any other suggestions  of

what we can do, we will be very happy to look at them,

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> The Minister of State has

asked  for  suggestions.   We  have  gone  through   this

discussion a few times.  Is it possible perhaps to  think

about  conducting a proper research into this  matter  to

see exactly how vulnerable our children are?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Maybe the Member can be more

specific  about the terms of reference of the study,  and

we will look at them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> A point of clarification,

Sir.   Are  there  really no symptoms  expressed  by  the

afflicted  or  are  we,  as a society,  the  school,  the

teachers,  etc,  not  sensitive enough  to  the  symptoms

expressed  by the students?  Maybe the teachers  and  the

schools  need  to be more sensitive, rather  than  saying

that the students are not expressing any symptoms at all.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was responding

to  Mr  Steve Chia's point about crying for help.   If  a

person  cries  for help and we did not  respond  and  the

person commits suicide, yes, something is very wrong.   I

am  saying  that it is not a case of a person crying  for

help and we did not respond.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for being sensitive, we have to bear in mind that

if  our  teachers  become  too sensitive,  they  may  see

suicidal tendencies in everybody, and that is not the way

to conduct a class.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, I want to check

with  the  Minister whether there has been any survey  or

even a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2496</b></font><br><br>



dialogue  that  has been organised for students  to  hear

from them whether they are indeed going through stress of

all sorts in school.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> As I have said, all these may have

been  happening  on  the ground.  The  Ministry  did  not

organise.   The schools and parents would have  discussed

this  subject.   I would like to go back  to  my  earlier

point  and  say, yes, stress is inevitable in a  learning

environment.   And that stress is motivating.   It  is  a

drive.   The point is that if it becomes excessive beyond

the level that the person can cope, then intervention  is

necessary.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, I could not quite understand

the  Minister  of  State's answer  regarding  the  recent

suicide  cases.  First, he has dismissed study stress  as

the cause.   Then, in the next instance, he says that  we

should wait for the police's investigations to come  out.

But  what I want to ask him now is that, in view  of  the

fact  that  there have been several teenage  suicides  in

past years,  surely, by now, his Ministry would have come

to  some conclusions as to what were the causes of  these

suicides, and do something about it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, if we are talking about the

recent  suicides,  the investigations  are  still  taking

place.   What I said was that there was no evidence  that

MOE  knows  of  to suggest that the students  have  study

difficulties.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> How do you know?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> We do ask the teachers, the

principals and from the schools' perspective.  We did not

find  any evidence that it is because of a school related

element   from  the  inquiries  that  we  have  conducted

internally.   So,  we  say we will wait  for  the  police

report.   It may be more comprehensive.  We are  prepared

to look at additional facts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member asks me about the suicide cases in

recent years,  I do not have the information on the cases

that  happened  in the last few years with  me.   If  the

Member is interested, he can file a separate question and

we will give him the answer.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2497</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to clarify that

I  did  not  imply any number or large number of  suicide

cases  I would appreciate for the number that happened in

the  past  few  years and the reasons why these  suicides

happened.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, if the Member files a

Question, we will give her an answer.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Sir, the Minister of State

asked for terms of reference.  Maybe it is timely to form

a  task  force and I will be more than happy to give  the

terms of reference to the task force.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, it would appear to me that we

seem  to  be only responding to the source of the problem

and  therefore  we  take a very reactive  approach.   The

Minister  of  State mentioned earlier that, depending  on

the  threshold  level,  the individual  schools  probably

would  be organising some of the fact-finding programmes.

Since  the  Ministry  is now taking  cognisance  of  some

symptoms  that  are  already  occurring  in  some  junior

colleges,  would  the  Ministry not consider  mounting  a

programme where we take a more proactive approach towards

some of these symptoms that we are seeing today?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, what I said was that stress

exists  in  our system.  Our proactive approach  involves

training all our teachers in basic counselling skills and

training two teacher-counsellors per school to deal  with

the   more  serious  cases,  bring  in  former  education

officers who are experienced, train them and deploy  them

at  cluster level.  At the Ministry of Education, we have

psychologists to give guidance as well as  to  deal  with

the  more complicated cases.  We do not want to see every

symptom  of stress as potentially serious.  This  is  our

approach.  We regret that there have been suicide  cases.

For  the recent cases, we have not established that  they

were due to school related issues, but we are prepared to

wait  for  the  investigations to be completed.   And  if

there are things that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2498</b></font><br><br>



we  need to do, we will do it.  So we do have a proactive

system in place.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen (Acting Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to establish the Singapore Workforce

Development Agency (WDA).

<br><br><i>Importance of workforce competitiveness</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February this year, Deputy Prime Minister Lee

Hsien  Loong announced in his Budget Statement  that  the

Government  would  set  up a statutory  board  under  the

Ministry   of   Manpower  (MOM)  to  promote   continuing

education  and training (CET) for workers.  This  was  in

response  to  a  recommendation by  the  Economic  Review

Committee  that the Government form a CET  body  to  help

Singaporeans  cope  with economic  restructuring  through

training and skills upgrading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Structural unemployment takes place when segments of

the workforce are not able to acquire the suitable skills

required for the new types of jobs created.  The pace  of

skills upgrading of our workforce must keep up with rapid

changes  in  the  business  environment.   If  industries

cannot  find the right type of skilled worker they  need,

they  will  not  come here.  And even if they  do  invest

here,  Singaporeans  without the  necessary  skills  will

remain unemployable.  Therefore, the Workforce

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2499</b></font><br><br>



Development Agency (WDA) has a key role in ensuring  that

Singaporeans continually upgrade or develop new skills to

stay employable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the Budget Statement, we undertook to

establish this new agency within 6 to 9 months from  end-February.  We understood the urgency of this task.  I  am

pleased to report to Members that we are ready to  launch

WDA  in mid-September, within 61/2 months.  My Ministry's

efforts  to establish this new agency have culminated  in

this  WDA  Bill,  the various clauses  of  which  I  will

elaborate on later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government started on this journey to

promote  lifelong learning and workforce  development  as

far  back as 1979, when the Skills Development Fund (SDF)

was   established.   The  SDF  was  the  first   training

initiative  to be driven at the national level.   Several

other  national-level  initiatives  such  as  the  Skills

Redevelopment  Programme,  National  Skills   Recognition

System and Strategic Manpower Conversion Programmes, were

subsequently put in place.  More recently, two years ago,

this House passed a Bill to establish a Lifelong Learning

Endowment  Fund (LLF).  Let me elaborate  a  bit  on  the

Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LLF was launched with an initial contribution of

$500 million from Government in March 2001, and topped up

twice  since  then,  to reach the current  size  of  $1.5

billion.  The setting up of the LLF reflects Government's

commitment to promote lifelong learning by our workforce.

The Government aims to set aside $5 billion eventually to

create  a  secure  and steady stream of  income  to  help

workers upgrade and retrain.  The LLF has enabled MOM  to

implement  new  programmes and initiatives to  complement

those  under  the  Skills Development  Fund  as  well  as

manpower  development plans spearheaded by other economic

agencies.   The Workforce Development Agency will  manage

both  the  Skills  Development Fund  (SDF)  and  Lifelong

Learning Fund (LLF).

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2500</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>WDA - Jobs for Singaporeans</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have spoken much during these past few

months  about the challenges of globalisation.   We  will

meet  these  challenges  head-on.   We  cannot  rely   on

artificial barriers to protect our jobs.  We must upgrade

and  give investors an incentive to locate and stay  here

because  of a highly trained workforce. The establishment

of  WDA  signals Government's strong commitment  to  help

Singaporeans stay employable and maintain our lead with a

disciplined and technically competent workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this, WDA will lead, champion and drive

adult  education and training in Singapore.  It  will  be

the  champion for workforce development.  It  will  build

upon  current CET capabilities and develop  new  ones  to

support  and  strengthen workforce  competitiveness.   It

will  coordinate,  consolidate and  rationalise  existing

manpower  development  efforts for  the  adult  workforce

carried  out by various Government agencies, for  greater

effectiveness.  WDA will also sharpen the  nexus  between

industry and the Singapore worker so that plans to  train

and   develop  a  skilled  workforce  for  industry   are

coordinated with plans to develop and grow that industry.

As  a  statutory board, the Workforce Development  Agency

will have a clear mandate as well as operational autonomy

and  flexibility  in  championing workforce  development.

This enables WDA to be nimble and interface with industry

effectively,  and thus be able to respond  to  industry's

needs in a more timely and flexible manner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mission of the Workforce Development Agency is

completely pro-Singaporean.  Jobs for Singaporeans is the

mantra.  The WDA will reach out to all workers, rank  and

file,  as  well as professionals and executives, employed

or looking for jobs.  It will help those who want to work

to  find  meaningful  jobs, and  those  who  are  already

working to become or stay more employable.  WDA will seek

through  CET programmes to equip our workforce  with  key

employability  skills  so  that  workers  can  adapt  and

respond to volatility in the labour market as well

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2501</b></font><br><br>



as demands of new jobs.  This desired outcome is captured

in  the vision of the Workforce Development Agency, which

is to build a resilient, skilled and agile workforce.

<br><br><i>Key thrusts and strategies</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on the key thrusts to WDA's

programmes and plans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, WDA will ensure that training is relevant

to the job in the company.  Put simply, we do not want to

train  for  training's sake.  We train and develop  skill

sets  so  that  Singaporeans can find new  jobs  or  stay

employed.  Members had spoken on the need  to  strengthen

this  connection  between  training  and  industry  needs

during  the Committee of Supply in March this year.   WDA

will do this systematically by identifying current skills

gaps  as  well as future skills needs at industry  level.

We  will  work  closely  with  leaders  in  industry  and

training  providers to make sure that training programmes

meet  correct  needs.  Training must  be  more  industry-oriented and market-driven.  The outcome must be  greater

employability  for  the Singaporean  worker  and  greater

value to the company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To implement this effectively, the Workforce

Development Agency must build partnerships with  industry

players  and  other economic agencies.  Work has  already

begun.  Over the past few months, my Ministry has engaged

key  leaders  in various industry sectors with  available

jobs.   As  a  result, WDA will be able to  launch  these

Industry Manpower Development Partnerships in the process

industry,  precision  engineering and  infocomm  sectors,

over  the next few months.  These partnerships will  help

WDA  to identify where jobs are available and what skills

employers  are  looking  for.  We will  place  retrenched

workers  into these jobs and train them with  the  skills

they  need.  This approach is currently being adopted  to

place  job seekers in the precision engineering  industry

where there are 700 jobs available.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WDA will also work very closely with the economic

agencies such as EDB, to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2502</b></font><br><br>



ensure workers are trained for the jobs generated by  new

investments.   WDA  will  work  with  other  agencies  to

redesign  jobs so that Singaporeans will find  such  jobs

more   attractive   to  take  up.    We   are   currently

collaborating  with  the National Environment  Agency  to

seek out opportunities in the environmental sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, WDA will strengthen the CET training

infrastructure.   We  must teach in a  way  that  enables

adults to learn better and quicker.  During the Committee

of Supply, Members spoke about this need to enhance adult

training  methods  and curriculum.   We  must  understand

better  how  adults learn. Only then can  we  teach  them

correctly  and effectively.  Therefore, WDA will  develop

professional   expertise  in  pedagogy   and   curriculum

development for adult learning, and skills certification.

A  Member also stressed the importance of regulating  the

quality  of  the  CET  industry.   We  agree.   WDA  will

establish  standards for the training industry to  ensure

that  publicly funded workforce training programmes  will

be  useful,  effective and industry-relevant.   Workforce

training   should  also  fit  within  a  broader   skills

framework  defining  clear  competencies  at  individual,

industry  and job levels.  Such a framework  should  have

clearly  defined skills standards and established  skills

upgrading roadmaps.  This will help workers to plan their

skills  upgrading  throughout  their  career  within   an

industry  or  across  industries.   In  line  with   this

objective,  the  National Skills Centre  currently  under

SPRING,  which  manages the National  Skills  Recognition

System, will come under WDA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agency will also be working closely with

training  providers  and  industry  players  to   promote

holistic  development of CET infrastructure in individual

industries.   The  Agency  will  work  with  industry  to

develop      comprehensive     vertically      integrated

infrastructure to provide industry-specific training from

entry into management level.  This includes new industry-based  training  infrastructure, for instance,  specialty

academies   such  as  the  Retail  Academy   to   provide

specialised training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third thrust of WDA is to help retrenched

Singaporeans find jobs.  This

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2503</b></font><br><br>



Agency  and  its partners will provide a more  customised

support to unemployed workers who want to transit back to

the  labour  force.  With job displacements or disruptive

employment  being key features in our employment  market,

there will be greater demand for more job information and

placement  assistance.   WDA will  build  up  a  stronger

capability  to  disseminate in a  systematic  and  timely

manner,  relevant  labour  market  information   to   job

seekers.  It will also strengthen the capabilities of the

centres in the Distributed CareerLink Network, run by the

CDCs,  NTUC and the self-help groups that provide  career

coaching, job placement and training assistance.   During

the  Committee  of Supply, a Member suggested  that  more

attention be paid to career counselling.  I agree.  I  am

pleased   to  report  that  WDA  will  develop   a   more

professional  career  counselling service  to  serve  job

seekers  that need professional guidance and  more  hand-holding in their job search.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all recognise that ultimately, whether we have

enough jobs depends substantially on new investments  and

new  business demands.  But, employment also  depends  on

the  willingness of workers to compete for jobs at market

wages.   At the individual level, it remains the personal

responsibility of the job seeker to get and keep his job.

But  by helping our workforce upgrade their skills,  both

hard   and  soft  skills,  by  searching  out  employment

opportunities  from  current  business  needs   and   new

investments, and helping job seekers to more  effectively

find and secure the right jobs, the Workforce Development

Agency can help workers stay more employable.

<br><br><i>Value to stakeholders</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will be our value to our stakeholders? To

employers  and  businesses, this  Agency  will  be  their

partner to identify skills needs, support the training of

workers, and establish human resource systems to build  a

workforce that can sharpen their competitive edge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To job seekers, WDA will develop more customised

support and a broader range

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2504</b></font><br><br>



of  assistance schemes to help them get jobs.  Those  who

are  willing to adapt and adjust to the realities of  the

job  market will find jobs.  They can approach a  network

of  dedicated CareerLink centres that provide more timely

information on the labour market, such as where  the  job

openings  are,  the  type  of  skills  required  and  the

remuneration  for the jobs.  This Agency will  work  with

the CareerLink centres to proactively seek out employment

opportunities  for  job seekers and  help  them  overcome

skills and other barriers to get back to work.  WDA  will

develop   targeted   Place  and   Train   programmes   in

partnership  with employers to help job  seekers  acquire

the skills needed to take up new jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the employed, the Workforce Development Agency

will  work  with  employers  to strengthen  in-employment

training so that workers can retrain and re-skill  to  do

better  in  their  current jobs, and to  serve  the  fast

changing  needs of businesses.  This helps the  workforce

to stay employable and competitive.

To   training  providers  and  institutions   of   higher

learning, the Workforce Development Agency will  help  to

develop  greater knowledge on how adults learn,  so  that

curriculum  can  be better designed to be accessible  and

effective  for  the  working adult.  WDA  will  be  their

partner  in  strengthening  the  nexus  between  training

institutions  and industries, which is  critical  to  the

development of continuing education and training.

<br><br><i>Leadership</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the challenges that I have set out for the

Workforce Development Agency, we will all agree  that  we

need  a strong management team to lead the group of  240-odd  WDA  staff.   I  have therefore asked  my  Permanent

Secretary,  Ms  Yong Ying-I, to be the  Chairman  of  the

Workforce Development Agency. My Deputy Secretary, Mr Leo

Yip,  will  be  the  Chief Executive  for  the  Workforce

Development  Agency.  I have also appointed  a  Board  of

Directors from the public and private sectors.  The Board

members have rich and diverse backgrounds in industry,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2505</b></font><br><br>



union  and  workforce development.  I am  confident  they

will  provide a strong stewardship to the running of WDA,

as  well  as facilitate the networking with its partners.

Among  the  Board  of Directors are two Members  of  this

House, Mayor Teo Ho Pin, who will represent the Mayors of

the CDCs and Mdm Halimah Yacob who will represent NTUC.

<br><br><i>WDA BILL</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the Bill itself. Part I and Part

II  propose  to  establish and incorporate the  Workforce

Development Agency as a statutory board under the purview

of  MOM  and  provide for the appointments  of  Chairman,

Deputy  Chairman  and  members  of  the  Agency  by   the

Minister.  Part III sets out the functions and duties  of

the  Agency and powers by the Minister to give directions

and the Agency to form committees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV and Part V cater for standard provisions

relating  to staff and finance, including the appointment

of  Chief  Executive  and the investment  powers  of  the

Agency.  Part VI, read in relation to the First Schedule,

provides   for   the   transfer  of   property,   assets,

liabilities  and  employees from  some  of  the  existing

departments under MOM and SPRING to WDA, as well  as  the

transfer  of  policy  oversight and administration  power

over   the   Lifelong  Learning  Fund  and   the   Skills

Development  Fund  to WDA.  Part VII  grants  the  Agency

power to enforce against offences and to make regulations

with the approval of the Minister.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setting up of the Workforce Development Agency

marks  a  significant milestone in our continuing efforts

to  strengthen workforce development.  As a small country

with  no  natural resources, human capital  is  our  only

asset.   A  competitive workforce is key  to  Singapore's

continued growth and prosperity.  All of us recognise the

strong economic competition Singapore faces but there  is

no  need for our workers to lose heart.  Singapore  still

has a competitive edge.  Our world-class infrastructures,

investments in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2506</b></font><br><br>



education of citizens, a hardworking and highly organised

workforce,  are  reasons  that  will  continue  to  swing

investors in our favour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way where the entire nation rallied

behind   the  Government  to  fight  against  SARS,   the

Workforce  Development  Agency  will  require  the   same

support   and  cooperation  of  workers,  employers   and

strategic  partners  to tackle workforce  competitiveness

challenges  head-on.  Together, we can  renew  heightened

hope  to our workforce, to help them stay employable  and

even more competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

recently,  when  I  made visits to  workplaces,  a  union

leader  remarked to me that it is increasingly  difficult

these  days to get a happy conversation going about jobs.

There is truth in the comment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, downturns were often cyclical. Today,

the  changes  are more structural.  Product lines  become

outmoded  quickly.   Competitors  move  into  lower  cost

countries to sharpen their competitive edge.  Workers are

replaced  by  technology  or displaced  as  a  result  of

factory  relocation.  These structural changes  are  long

term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new, harsh economic realities, which

globalisation  has driven, will continue  to  change  our

socio-economic  environment.  We have to adapt  and  live

with  it.   In view of the situation we are in,  we  must

continue  to  be vigilant and be nimble to react  to  the

changes.   But we must not be incapacitated  by  the  bad

news.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst it is perfectly normal to express insecurity

over  the  job, a positive outlook in the midst of  these

bad  time  situations will allow us  to  see  the  silver

lining when it comes.  Staying positive and possessing  a

willingness to work hard and accept responsibilities even

in areas we have no experience in is a sure way to go.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology may have taken over the job. Companies

may relocate to China, or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2507</b></font><br><br>



India,  where workers there do the same job for half  the

price.   We have to face this reality squarely and  react

with a new mindset and a new willingness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key word is "mobility". In a tight labour

market,  the  employee  is seen  to  have  greater  power

because  he can move to another job, and get better  pay.

In  a  downturn, the power of the employee  lies  in  his

skills to perform.  The skills they pick up help them  to

move on to other jobs.  How much power he has depends  on

his skills level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the workers today have to constantly

upgrade  themselves to remain employable.  If  they  have

the  skills that companies need for the future, they will

be able to prolong their value worth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the establishment of the Workforce Development

Agency  is  timely.  We expect WDA to be very focused  on

training that is directly relevant to getting and keeping

jobs,  to help and ensure Singaporeans remain employable.

I  am  very  happy  that WDA will do more  in  developing

training  methods that are suitable for  adult  learning.

Very  often, we tend to use methodologies that are  meant

for  the  young  and students.  We have to  consider  the

learning  methodologies  that the  adults  require.   The

Agency  should devote more resources to find ways we  can

make our adult learning and training more effective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Workforce Development Agency should be open and

responsive  in  providing labour market information.   To

help Singaporeans stay employable, the training has to be

relevant  and  more  responsive to the  needs  of  labour

market.   I  would like to know what is the plan  of  the

Agency  in this area.  Are we able to effectively project

job opportunities available in the short and medium term?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also concern of the employment situation of

our  polytechnic  and  university graduates.   Could  the

Ministry  enlighten us on how severe is the  unemployment

or under-employment situation

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2508</b></font><br><br>



of  our fresh graduates today?  What would WDA do to help

them?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, DPM Lee mentioned at the People's Association

Conference  that the Government is ready to do  more  and

commit more resources to help the unemployed.  It  is  to

help  needy  Singaporeans get back on their  feet.   What

would  WDA do to better coordinate all the agencies,  for

example,  CDCs and NGOs, that provide employment services

in  different locations?  Is there any plan and how would

the  WDA  further  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  these

agencies to help Singaporeans?  Can MOM also confirm  the

re-employment  rate  of our unemployed?   Does  WDA  have

plans  to  help improve the chances of re-employment  for

the older workers?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were also media reports that some training

providers abuse the Government's support.  Does WDA  have

any   plan   to  ensure  effectiveness  of  funding   and

respective Government schemes to help the unemployed?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the SARS outbreak drew the whole country closer

and taught us several lessons in overcoming difficulties.

Let  us tackle the difficulties and challenges ahead with

the  same  spirit as we tackled SARS.  Our workforce  has

been  ranked as the No. 1 workforce in the world.   I  am

confident that we will continue to stand tall as a little

red  dot.   Let us continue to move ahead with a positive

spirit and strong tripartite collaboration in making  our

economy more competitive and worker-friendly.  We have to

mobilise  every  stakeholder  to  move  together   ahead.

Employers need to redesign jobs to produce higher  value-added  jobs so as to compete in a globalised marketplace.

The  companies, as corporate citizens, should play a more

active role.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, looking back over the past 38 years  since

our independence, Singapore has been able to successfully

mould  its national human resource policy to provide  the

needed

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2509</b></font><br><br>



skills for each phase of our development.  Local training

institutions  progressively  focus  on  technical  skills

development   complemented   by   technology   transfers,

wherever   necessary,  from  institutions  of  the   more

advanced countries.  Foreign corporations locating  their

operations  here were provided with subsidies and  grants

to set up training programmes which further propelled the

growth of skills training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our country then swiftly moved into higher value-added manufacturing. Education reform that emphasises on

technical  and  vocational education  was  buttressed  by

expanding  our  polytechnics in response  to  the  demand

created  by the variety of industries set up  here.   Our

universities  too had to undergo transformation  both  in

areas of curriculum as well as approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, as we are at the crossroads of charting our

way to another phase of national development, efforts  to

make  our country a leading knowledge-based economy  will

demand  new learning and training approaches that  expect

workers to be innovative and creative.  With unemployment

expected  to  feature more prominently as we continue  to

restructure  the  economy, we  need  a  more  coordinated

effort to help workers who are periodically displaced  to

get  back  on  their feet and be absorbed back  into  the

changing economic landscape as quickly as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our past and current success in placing us at

the  forefront in an increasingly competitive  world  has

been  our  ability to continually move up  the  education

ladder  and  create and produce a qualified, skilful  and

creative people.  To remain at the forefront, there is no

other  way but to sustain these efforts of improving  the

level  of education and skills training for our citizens.

This is the only way for us to keep abreast of and remain

relevant  in  the changing world.  As the  world  becomes

increasingly   borderless  with  knowledge,   technology,

talents   and  capital  moving  freely  across   regional

boundaries, the need to develop the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2510</b></font><br><br>



potential  of  people to the highest possible  level  has

become even more urgent.  This era rewards those who  are

in  control of information with power and those  who  are

the  leading edge of technology with wealth.   Those  who

have  neither of the above are likely to be left  behind.

Considering  that our people are our only  resource,  our

future   survivor  solely  depends  on  them.   We   must

therefore develop this resource as best as we can.  It is

also  the best approach to address the threat of  digital

divide which our society is increasingly being confronted

with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the International Labour Organisation in its

General Conference Report of the 88th Session in the year

2000 quoted:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A critical challenge that faces human society at

the   start  of  the  21st  Century  is  to  attain  full

employment  and  sustain economic growth  in  the  global

economy  and also social inclusivity.  As a country  that

holds  the  principle  of  meritocracy  close  to  heart,

education  is  a crucial vehicle for our social  mobility

and inclusivity."



The  phenomenon, with all its ramifications which I  just

mentioned,  is  universal.  No country in  the  world  is

spared  from  it.   More  and  more  countries  are   now

realising that lifelong learning is the key to  pave  the

way for sustained employability of their citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where I believe the formation of a one-stop

agency, as proposed under this Bill, with a comprehensive

range of human capital development services will be  most

apt  to  develop and unleash the full potential of  every

Singaporean.   The amalgamation of functions,  which  are

now  scattered under various Ministries and  administered

by  several statutory bodies, will provide the new agency

with  the  means  to  coordinate and orchestrate   worker

education,   skills  training  and  skills  redevelopment

activities  under  one  roof.  It should  facilitate  the

linkage of our workers to sources of expertise and assist

them  in  the most efficient manner as to enable each  of

them to make informed choices of what is best for them to

enhance    their   employability   in   an   increasingly

sophisticated economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from placing worker interests as the focal

point of the Workforce Development Agency's activities, I

also envision that this newly created central body

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2511</b></font><br><br>



will lead in restructuring and harmonising our workforce,

organising  activities that create greater  awareness  of

shifts  and  changes in our increasingly  knowledge-based

and  technology-intensive economy, continually  assisting

our  workforce  in identifying sectors and  job  families

which  are  relevant  to Singapore's current  and  future

economic  needs, so that they can make informed decisions

about  career  choices and impressing upon the  workforce

that innovation and value creation are the way ahead  and

that focusing on these will reap the best rewards for all

of us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intertwined with all of these, Sir, is the subject

of  lifelong learning.  I know much has been said on this

subject  in  this  House.  But  I  believe  it  is  worth

reiterating this until its importance is ingrained in the

minds  of every one of us.  In the current context  where

continuous changes and uncertainty prevail and  represent

the  new normal, no country can ensure employment  and  a

job for every one of its citizens.  The smarter countries

are  rigorously  promoting lifelong learning  as  one  of

their key agendas recognising that a highly educated  and

trained  workforce  leads to sustained  employability  of

their  workforce.  It is a fact that countries  with  the

highest  incomes  are also those whose workers  are  most

educated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist countries create a learning

infrastructure,  the  International  Labour  Organisation

introduced the learning chain to enable a workforce adapt

both  to the demands of a knowledge society and the  need

for  an improved level and quality of employment.  In it,

the  state will have to develop the individual's learning

abilities  by  offering opportunities  for  learning  and

training  that are tailored to target groups at different

stages of their lives, young people and unemployed adults

and  workers  who  are  at risk of  seeing  their  skills

overtaken  by  rapid change.  This new approach  includes

three  main  components.  These are  the  development  of

local  learning centres, the promotion of new skills,  in

particular, in information technologies, and increased

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2512</b></font><br><br>



transparency of qualifications.  This is where synergy of

policies  from our Ministries, such as the Ministries  of

Education,  Manpower and Trade and Industry, if  properly

coordinated,  could  help produce  a  workforce  that  is

informed  and  responsive to the changing  needs  of  our

economy.   Such  a multi-dimensional approach  will  also

showcase  our commitment that we, as a nation,  are  avid

promoters of lifelong learning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a fast changing world, it does not take long

for  knowledge  and skills to get outdated very  quickly.

The abundance of new knowledge and technological advances

that  become  available in the public  domain  every  day

makes  it  difficult to keep up with what  is  going  on.

University  graduates  can expect that  even  their  most

advanced  technical knowledge can become  outdated  in  a

matter  of  months.  Skilled workers need  to  constantly

adapt  to  new products and techniques, bearing  in  mind

that  some  careers do not even have a chance to  change.

They  simply  disappear.   We must  therefore  constantly

retool  ourselves and become perpetual students, or  risk

the prospect of becoming obsolete.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifelong learning is the only way to remain

competitive and maintain our relevance in the job market.

Workers  must understand that they need to take  personal

responsibility  in  continually investing  in  their  own

growth  development  and self-renewal,  like  the  way  a

progressive company invests in R&D and comes up with  new

and  better  products or services it  can  offer.   One's

future  employability and appeal as a job  candidate  now

depend  on  one's relentless drive to update credentials,

acquire  new knowledge and skills and staying abreast  of

what is happening in one's own field of expertise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many unemployed workers groan in not being able to

find  jobs  after  going for retraining or  learning  new

skills.   Many of them feel that it is a wasteful effort.

This  perception  must  be quickly  corrected  before  it

becomes widespread.  Workers must realise that it is  the

low external demand which is not within our control

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2513</b></font><br><br>



that  contributes to the current soft employment  market.

The   Ministry  of  Manpower  estimates  that  there  are

currently   only  24  jobs  available   for   every   100

applicants.   One  is  better off with  new  and  updated

skills,  even  though he may not have a job now,  because

once  the  market turns, he will be the first to  benefit

with  the new skills in hand.  Make no mistake about  the

relevance of knowledge upgrading and reskilling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the process of formal education and training is

progressively becoming less of one passing on information

but more of an individual's learning to learn so that  he

can  discover  for himself.  The relevance  of  knowledge

about facts is diminishing while the need to learn how to

access, analyse and exploit information and transform  it

into  new  knowledge is increasing.  While I know  strong

efforts are being made to impart such soft skills through

programmes such as CREST, I feel more needs to  be  done,

particularly for our mature and older workers.   This  is

the  group that is most vulnerable to shifts and  changes

in our economic structure and, therefore, they need to be

more   adequately  prepared  to  be  more  flexible   and

responsive to change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, beyond any economic considerations, human

capital  development underpins the fundamental values  of

society   -   equity,  justice,  gender  equality,   non-discrimination,  social responsibility and  participation

of  all  in  economic  and social life.   Human  resource

development   and   training   contribute   to   improved

productivity  in the economy, reduce skill mismatches  in

the  labour market, and promote a country's international

competitiveness,  all of which are vital  to  Singapore's

short and long-term interests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to my next and final point,

which  is the current perception that foreign talent  and

workers are wresting away jobs from Singaporeans.  I know

this  has  been elaborated on by the Acting Minister  for

Manpower  in this House yesterday, but I still feel  this

is  a  subject worth revisiting.  Owing to our  smallness

and lack of critical mass, it is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2514</b></font><br><br>



important for us to keep explaining to Singaporeans  that

Singapore  cannot  tick efficiently  without  foreigners.

There are high-end jobs and economic activities where  we

lack  or do not have the talent to fill, and low-end  and

inconvenient jobs, such as garbage collection or rotating

shift  work, where Singaporeans just do not want  to  do.

We  need  foreigners  to fill both of  these  categories.

Foreigners  are naturally attracted to the  opportunities

we  have created here because of the vacancies that  need

to  be  filled.   Together with Singaporeans,  they  have

contributed to our development and progress.   They  have

also  contributed to making our pie bigger.  We can elbow

them  out,  but  that would mean that  we  too  would  be

deprived  of  opportunities for bigger and higher  value-added jobs because multi-national companies with high-end

activities  will  not be able to locate their  operations

here  because  of  our  lack of talent.   Those  who  are

already  here,  especially those  with  capital-intensive

operations,  such  as  the wafer fab  and  pharmaceutical

industries, will not be able to grow if they are deprived

of  workers needed to run their business activities round

the clock.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me use the analogy of a soccer game to

illustrate  my point.  As our nation of young footballers

readies itself for a game against the adept skills of  an

established international team, there are but a few  ways

to  come out the winner.  Using protectionist methods  by

having  an  umpire that is biased or by  brute  force  to

defeat the opponent could get us a point or two, or  even

a  win,  but  not for too long.  The game's international

audience would pick up on this, leaving us a team without

a  league  to  play  in.  By improving  our  skills  set,

enhancing  our capabilities and gradually progressing  to

the  same level as our opponents, we earn the respect  of

our peers and that of our competitors.  A soccer game  or

an  8-hour  workday  will be more of  an  interaction  of

minds,  ideas  and cultures, rather than the anticipation

of  the final whistle.  We should not allow ourselves  to

be  unduly overcome by the present emotions arising  from

the  current state of unemployment and lose sight of  the

big picture.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2515</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we need to move away from this issue,

if I may call it a polarised "dual workforce".  By this I

mean  our local workforce and foreign talents, especially

in  the middle and middle to lower income brackets, which

often  evolve  into  a sensitive topic  and  stir  heated

debates whenever we have an economic slowdown.  To strive

to  amalgamate this "dual workforce" should be one of the

priorities of this new agency.  By evolving to  a  single

bracket  without  any differentiation between  local  and

foreign workers, our workforce will signal the coming  of

age,  where  the  need for employers to hire  beyond  our

borders  would be purely for reasons of labour or  talent

shortage, and not because specific skills cannot be found

within our shores.  Employers could then focus solely  on

getting the best hands and minds for any job vacancy from

an  existing pool where any employable resident  here  is

considered equally.  It has to be borne in mind that  the

economy of tomorrow will be truly borderless, virtual, to

some  degree,  and driven by solutions and results.   Our

challenge  is  how  do  we build an inclusive  Singapore,

where    Singaporeans   and   foreign   residents   could

collectively  share a bigger and ever-growing  pie  which

will be win-win for everyone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the ethos of this new Bill as the creation of

a  homogenous  workforce  in the  long  term,  comprising

locals  and  foreign  residents with  a  shared  goal  of

contributing  jointly  and effectively  to  our  nation's

continued growth and prosperity.  I am confident that the

strategy  of  continually  improving  the  education  and

training of our workforce will make us better prepared to

confront   the   challenges   of   globalisation,    cost

competitiveness of our businesses, and arrest the fear of

unemployment in our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wholeheartedly support this Bill, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, this Bill seeks to

incorporate a public body to be named Singapore Workforce

Development Agency (SWDA), and to consolidate

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2516</b></font><br><br>



within  the Agency the functions, properties, liabilities

and employees of the departments within the Human Capital

Development  Division and the Labour  Market  Development

Division  of  the Ministry of Manpower,  and  the  Skills

Development  Fund  Secretariat,  the  Critical   Enabling

Skills  Training  (CREST) Secretariat  and  the  National

Skills   Recognition  System  (NSRS)   Centre,   of   the

Standards, Productivity and Innovation Board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This exercise of consolidating various departments

into  one  corporation is in line with  the  Government's

overall  policy  of  making all Government  organisations

slim  and trim.  I am certain that with this new  Agency,

productivity  will go up.  But, at the same  time,  I  am

also  certain  that there shall also be  job  losses.   I

wonder  what  the  unions have to say.  Have  the  unions

liaised  with the Government to redeploy the workers  who

may  have  been  made  redundant  as  a  result  of  this

exercise?   If  not, have the unions asked  for  adequate

retrenchment  benefits for those workers  who  have  lost

their jobs?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question uppermost in my mind is: will this

exercise,  bringing  the various  departments  under  one

roof,  so  to  speak, create benefits and  jobs  for  our

workers?  I would like to ask the Minister:  what  is  it

under the old set-up that the Government could not do  or

do  just  as  well as under this new Agency  when  it  is

formed?  One would also ask: if the Government is  unable

to  do  much for workers in the old set-up, what can  the

Government achieve with this new Agency?  Some people may

speculate that under these difficult economic times,  the

Government  is  expected  to do  something  to  show  the

workers that it is concerned and is doing something.  But

I  think  this  reorganisation exercise  of  transferring

various   Government  departments  to   a   newly-created

statutory body shall not help the workers very much.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing of names will not do much. It is a case of

calling a spade by another name.  How can calling a spade

by  another  name increase the usefulness of  the  spade?

You  cannot.   A spade by any other name shall  remain  a

spade.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2517</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Bill itself, I see that its main

thrust is to promote adult education and training.  As  a

former teacher, I can say that the promulgation of  adult

education by the Government is something not new  to  me.

The  Government has adult education programmes  from  the

early  days  since it came into power in  1959.   In  the

1960s,  almost everyone then was familiar with the  adult

education  programme carried out by the  Government  body

commonly known as "Lembaga", which means "institution" or

"board" in Malay.  The word "Lembaga" is a short form for

the  Adult Education Board.  In those days, it  was  more

fashionable to use names of Government bodies  in  Malay.

Hence,  in  the early days, the Malay word "Lembaga"  was

used,   and  not  its  proper  English  name,  the  Adult

Education Board.

As  mentioned  earlier, the main function of  the  Agency

concerns  the  areas of adult continuing  education.   It

would   appear  that  the  Government's  adult  education

programme  has come a full cycle. When the PAP came  into

power,  it rightly embarked on a vigorous adult education

programme  and after 38 years, when Singapore has  joined

the  ranks  of  the first world countries, we  are  still

making  new laws to ensure that our adult workers  get  a

decent  education  and training. I hope  that  the  trade

unions  make  sure that this time round,  the  Government

gets it right - to provide the right and meaningful adult

education to our workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one issue which I am concerned is the

discrimination against the older workers.  I  have  often

heard  complaints  in  my  meet-the-people  sessions   by

residents who are 40 years old and above. They said  that

their  applications  for  jobs  were  often  unsuccessful

because the employers rejected their applications because

they  were too old.  These employers preferred to  employ

younger  workers.  I certainly want the  Minister  to  do

something  against this current practice in Singapore  by

employers  who  discriminate against  older  workers.   I

would  like  to  urge  the Minister to  pass  legislation

against  discrimination of older workers.   If,  for  the

time being,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2518</b></font><br><br>



the  Minister  is reluctant to do so, he  can  still  act

against  employers  who  practise discrimination  against

workers  under  clause  11(1)(f) of  this  Bill  when  it

becomes  law.  I hope the Minister would do something  to

protect the older workers in the job market.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, Mr Chiam See Tong doubted the purpose  for

the  establishment  of the Workforce  Development  Agency

(WDA)   and   suspected  that  it  was  meant   for   the

retrenchment of workers. As the Minister has pointed out,

there  are in fact a lot of jobs out there but not enough

people  with the relevant skills to fill them.   So,  the

important  thing  is to find out how  to  get  the  right

people  for  the  right  post.   He  commented  that  the

Minister for Manpower should "call a spade a spade". This

is  not old wine in a new bottle.  It is an entirely  new

agency. We want our people to change their mindset.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our workers should learn not to be too choosy with

the  jobs  offered to them.     In the old  days,  people

used  to  say that you could die but you should not  lose

face. Now, I would say, "Losing face is not going to kill

you.  It is only when you can no longer breathe that  you

would die!"  No doubt, nowadays, it is difficult to  find

jobs,  and many people have different perspectives  about

it.  The workers who are retrenched, especially the older

workers, think retrenchment means the end of the road  to

them. The employers, on the other hand, lament that  they

cannot  get  enough  workers with  the  right  skills  to

satisfy their demand. Each has his own perspective on the

matter. Mr Chiam See Tong too has his own perspective and

his own way of looking at this.  The establishment of WDA

is a way to help the workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Minister said that he wanted to first

take  immediate  action to help certain  sectors  of  our

workers.  That gives hope to the people. If  the  workers

feel that the Minister is not taking any action, then  it

is no good.  I agree that some immediate action should be

taken

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2519</b></font><br><br>



to  help the workers and the industry. We must share  the

experience with the various industries and help  to  work

out  programmes  to  train the workers.  We  should  also

encourage the  companies to re-engineer their work,  help

the workers phase into their new jobs and improve methods

of  working.   This will ensure that we transit  smoothly

into  the  new economy.   We should look at  how  we  can

redesign the work so that we have the right workers to do

the right work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to point out is that we must

reshape  the image of some of our workers.  In the  past,

some  people have a set frame of mind for their work.  We

should  change that image.  In the past, some  jobs  were

traditionally done only by women. This need  not  be  the

case. Men could also do them.  For example, when you talk

about telephone operators, the first thing that comes  to

mind  is the sweet female voice that says, "Hello!"  But,

come  to  think of it, what is wrong with a rich baritone

voice saying the same thing?  Why can the job not be done

by men as well?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is taxi-driver. It is traditionally

conceived that taxi-driving is a man's job.  When a  taxi

drives up and one finds a woman at the driver's seat, the

immediate reaction is inevitably that, "Wah! Woman  taxi-driver!"  What  is  wrong with a woman  driving  a  taxi?

Likewise,  in  the  past,  all trishaw  riders  were  old

people, who spat everywhere. But now we see young  people

in  colourful  batik shirts, armed with  a  walkman,  and

happily  riding  the  trishaw and  speaking  in  English,

Japanese  or Korean to the European, Japanese  or  Korean

tourists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, even hawker food was divided along

dialect lines.  The Teochew people would be selling  kway

teow;  the  Hokkien  would sell fried  noodles  or  prawn

noodles  while the Hainanese would sell chicken rice.   I

think  such division is no longer found among the various

dialect  groups  in Singapore nowadays.   This  has  been

extended beyond ethnic groups.  For

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2520</b></font><br><br>



example, satay was typically a Malay food but now we  see

just  as many Chinese hawkers selling satay too!  We even

find  Indians singing in the Chinese wayang stage  during

the  "Hungry Ghost" festival. There is nothing wrong with

all this integration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the WDA would have some very creative

civil  servants  so that they can change the  mindset  of

these workers. So long as they are willing to work,  they

should be able to do it.  If they cannot do it, we  would

help them to do it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on adult education, Mr Chiam mentioned Lembaga.

I  learnt  Malay  from  Lembaga (Adult  Education  Board)

during  my younger days, and now I can converse  with  my

grassroots in Malay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the long term, it is important that we place

more  emphasis on adult education.  It is not the Lembaga

of  the  old days. We want to help our workers learn  new

skills.  That is an important point.  It is said that  if

we have a skill, we can be employed forever.  Now we need

to be multi-skilled so that we have better employability.

We  could  also  think of the ways in  which  the  adults

learn. We should make it easier for the adult workers  to

learn  by  tailoring the learning to suit their aptitude.

This  way, we can encourage the older workers to continue

learning,  and  acquiring new skills, so  that  they  can

continue  to be employable. It is not a matter  of  "just

sitting there and waiting to die".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the short term, of course, we

see many people are unemployed.  If we can encourage them

to  be less choosy and take up jobs that are available to

them, we would have succeeded 50% already.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I propose to take the break

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as Singapore

stands  on  the threshold of creating history  or  a  new

chapter    in   Singapore's   employment   and   economic

development, may I make these humble observations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reading of this Bill is timely in view of the

challenging and difficult employment situation where  the

skills and competencies of the Singapore workforce need a

drastic  makeover.  This is in order that  the  Singapore

workforce  of today can stay relevant and competitive  in

the  harsh new global economy, dominated by rapid changes

and a new work order.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is a step in the right direction in

addressing   an  array  of  heart-tugging   events   like

retrenchments  and  announcements on restructurings  that

have  been advocated in recent months.  These range  from

economic  restructuring  to  wage  restructuring  to  CPF

restructuring    and    pre-emptive    layoffs.     These

restructurings  are  like dosages of medicine  that  have

come one after another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans feel rather sedated by these continual

dosages of medication for the economic ills that  we  are

going  through.  At the same time, they also look forward

to  recover  before the next dosage.  As a reprieve  from

the  over dosage, hopefully, this Bill will give a breath

of  fresh air to Singaporeans and a sense of hope for the

long haul.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spirit of revitalising and promoting

continuing   adult  education  and  training,  employment

facilitation and developing the HR industry through  best

practices in human capital management in an ever changing

operating  environment, I would like to put forward  some

suggestions   for   consideration   to   facilitate   the

implementation of this Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2522</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A constantly changing operating environment means

skills  and  knowledge get obsolete  at  a  faster  pace,

making  it  necessary  to unlearn, relearn,  reskill  and

pursue upgrading in skills and knowledge.  It calls for a

drastic  change  in mindset for both the  individual  and

employer.   This is a sure way for Singaporeans  to  stay

relevant  and  employable, and  for  businesses  to  stay

viable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I envisage that such an Agency will contribute

to  the  economic progress of Singapore and help build  a

skilled, adaptable, enterprising and resilient workforce.

Of  particular importance is the Agency's quick  response

to  facilitate  employment  for  the  unemployed  and  to

partner  the  human  capital professional  institutes  to

develop  and  promulgate best practices in human  capital

management.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we embark on this journey of re-making our

workforce,  it  is important to nurture and  enhance  not

only  a  pro  workforce development culture but  also  to

inculcate   an  adaptable  mindset,  not  only   in   the

Singaporean  workforce, but also in business  owners  and

employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recent press sentiments, for example, the

article  in Today, 8th August 2003, headlined  "Too  many

statutory boards spoil the show", implied that businesses

and  people  are  not benefiting from  the  70  statutory

boards  in  Singapore.  The article argues that Singapore

can do with less of such regulatory bodies in order to be

nimble, proactive and quick-thinking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the new statutory board has its roles to play,

it  is  therefore important to dispel some of  the  mixed

feelings  and  the  notion that the  creation  of  a  new

statutory  board  would add costs  and  inconvenience  to

building up our manpower capability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, I would advocate that clarity of vision and

outcomes  arising from the establishment of the  SWDA  be

properly articulated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the functions, duties and powers of SWDA are

well  defined.   What  is  more  important  for  the  new

statutory board to evolve, in the implementation  process

of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2523</b></font><br><br>



each of the functions, is transparency in respect of  the

information and data the public needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is important from the point of view of the

benefits  that  Singapore and Singaporeans  would  derive

from  an integrated continual adult education and further

training   infrastructure  that  incorporates   effective

employment facilitation and creation of jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, a pro workforce development culture must be

inculcated   to  spur  on  the  further  development   of

continual  adult  education and further training  of  our

Singaporean workforce.  I am therefore happy to note that

the SWDA will put in place, support and infrastructure to

provide  the necessary funds/incentives, and will  induce

employers and manpower development players to collaborate

in initiatives and measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, can the SWDA seek ways to ensure

that   the  weaker  segments,  the  unemployed  and   the

economically  inactive population, of the  workforce  are

helped   to   level  up  their  knowledge,   skills   and

capabilities  and  to  ensure them  of  equal  employment

opportunities?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the SWDA has many challenges and issues to

overcome.  For example, in the area of unequal employment

opportunities,  can  the  SWDA  muscle   in   to   remove

discriminatory  practices  in  employment,  promote   the

employment  of  the mature workforce,  especially  in  an

ageing  population, promote innovative and new  workplace

practices, flexi-work arrangements and family-friendly HR

policies?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, the SWDA needs to provide

directions  to support a work culture that, for  example,

does   away   with  retirement  age  because  an   ageing

population dictates a need for financial independence and

career options through continuous working.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill should throw light on how the SWDA would

focus on a healthy and productive workforce among the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2524</b></font><br><br>



mature  workforce  and  how to incentivise  employers  to

provide  jobs to the mature workforce.  Perhaps a  higher

funding  mechanism  or tax incentives for  employers  who

invest  on  further training and who employ  more  mature

workforce,  can  tip the scale towards  being  pro-mature

employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, an adaptable mindset for both the

individual  and  the organisation calls for  an  attitude

that  will go the extra mile to acquire the aptitude that

will ultimately determine the altitude of attainment  and

success.   In other words, so long as there  is  a  right

mindset  with relevant skills, Singaporeans will overcome

and prosper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am hopeful that employers will also look into

job re-design to facilitate the employability of the less

skilled  mature employees.  I am pleased to know  that  a

career  counselling service is being  considered  by  the

SWDA to help the job seekers.  Similarly, I would like to

urge that this be expanded to provide a proactive service

to employers to assure them that the retrenched employees

are not necessarily bad hats.  And employers with jobs to

offer  should  not  shun them.  A dedicated  match-making

role  may  be adopted by SWDA, so that it can  assist  to

change the perception that the unemployed retrenched  are

marginal performers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having followed the recent discourse on the

participation of our local residents in the newly created

jobs,  I would like to offer this humble opinion:   There

are  non-exportable  service jobs in  the  local  retail,

hairdressing, hotel and horticulture sectors.  There  are

jobs  as  drivers  in the local transport  and  logistics

industry.  There are jobs as nurses, care attendants  and

technicians  in healthcare and medical welfare  industry.

These  jobs  command quite decent salaries  ranging  from

$1,500 to $2,000 and they are performed by a large number

of non-local residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may not be perceived well in these difficult

times.  It would seem to me that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2525</b></font><br><br>



one  of the more urgent tasks for SWDA is to increase the

participation rate of Singaporeans in these jobs that are

mostly filled by non-residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there are also other lower-end jobs that

are  not  filled  because they are paid ridiculously  low

rates,  eg,  jobs  in the construction and  manufacturing

sectors,  which  explain the low number  of  Singaporeans

doing these jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another observation is the need for a national

databank  on  jobs  and on the unemployed  in  Singapore,

together   with   a  breakdown  in  terms   of   sectors,

industries, executives and non-executive types.  I  would

like   to   reiterate  the  points  of  my  parliamentary

colleagues  that the perception on the ground  indeed  is

that foreigners are taking away the jobs from locals, and

that policy makers are not listening because they are not

experiencing  the  pain  that  Singaporeans   are   going

through.   We need to change this perception.  A national

data  bank  will  allow a more dedicated approach  to  be

taken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps a good start would be to review the

statistics collected under the Labour Force Survey.   Are

there  other  statistics which need to  be  compiled  and

presented so that researchers and the public can be  more

discerning in using the statistics for studies,  analysis

and policy formulation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to dwell on several questions

that I have with regard to the provisos in the Bill:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) How does the transfer of the Human Capital

Development  Division and  the Labour Market  Development

Division from the Ministry of Manpower to the new Agency,

together  with  the transfer of the SDF Secretariat,  the

CREST  Secretariat, and the NSRS Centre of SPRING  better

help  achieve  the  objectives of the Government  in  the

upgrading  of  workforce training and  development?  What

synergies  will  be  gained by  placing  them  under  the

auspices of the new Agency?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) One of the new Agency's mandate is to expand

industry-focused CET development.  Does this mean that it

will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2526</b></font><br><br>



neglect  more  generic  skills, like  general  management

skills,   human  resource  skills,  and  basic   computer

literacy  to the workforce in general? Furthermore,  what

steps  will the new Agency take to ensure that  there  is

the integration of industry needs with that of curriculum

development?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Some of the industry sectors targeted by the

proposed  new  Agency  already has  established  training

providers.   For  example,  there  is  SHATEC  in   hotel

industry,   Nanyang  Polytechnic  in  the   health   care

industry,  and  so on. How will these training  providers

benefit   from  the  development  of  CET   systems   and

infrastructure?  Will there be duplicated development and

how  can  resources  be streamlined and  optimally  used?

Will  the new Agency help new training providers come  to

the  fore to offer new and better training programmes  to

industry players?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) In view of the relatively high percentage of

unemployed  executives, professionals and managers,  what

are some of the initiatives and programmes that will help

them  to cushion their existing plight?  What plans  does

SWDA  have to continue with existing programmes  such  as

the  career  placement and workskills training programmes

that have proven to be of benefit to the white-collar job

seekers.   What  plans  does SWDA  have  to  enhance  the

existing   employment  facilitation  infrastructure   and

effort  rendered  by  the CDCs, SPEC  and  the  self-help

groups?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) What plans does the SWDA have for the Skills

Redevelopment Programme (SRP) in general, in terms of the

number of training places by industries, types and  jobs?

What improvements or refined work would the SWDA make  in

terms of the often expressed sentiments that Singaporeans

tend to go through many cycles of retraining because  the

training is free and they are reluctant to take  up  jobs

for which they have been trained for?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) In view of the high number of unemployed and

their  lack of labour market skills and knowledge,  would

the  SWDA  consider  extending the  life  and  workskills

programmes as they are serving a critical

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2527</b></font><br><br>



need under the current high unemployment situation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the important point is that we have to ensure

that  those  who have gone for retraining will eventually

take  up jobs offered to them.  A monitoring system  that

will   penalise   those  who  decline  job   offers   and

incentivise  those  who  retain  their  jobs  should   be

considered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Some important industry sectors seem to be

missing from the ones targeted for help and for action by

the  Agency,  for  example,  the  financial  sector,  the

education  sector,  information  technology,  the   media

sector,  and  the  arts sector.  Would  the  Agency  also

consider working closely with executives in these sectors

to ensure that their training needs are provided for, and

that there is sufficient choice out there for people  who

want to pursue further adult education in these sectors?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) In involving itself with employment

facilitation, can the Agency elaborate on how the  Agency

will  integrate and streamline with the self-help groups,

the  CDCs and the MOM CareerLink Distributed Centres such

that  we will not see duplication of resources?  Sir,  it

has been confusing to Singaporeans.  Many who are looking

for   simple  information  or  answer  feel  that   their

experience is like looking for a needle in the  haystack.

We need to be clear on who is in charge of what and where

Singaporeans can go to to look for this service provider.

WDA needs to be clear here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I ask the Minister on the basis and

criteria for the composition of the members of the  Board

of  Directors of the Agency?  The Minister has cited rich

diverse  experience of the Board that he has  identified.

But  we  would  like  to  know more  specifics  on  these

criteria.  There are a number of credible employer groups

and  professional bodies with resources that the WDA  can

tap   on.   Combined,  these  institutions  represent   a

significant  number  of companies and professionals  that

deal with human capital issues as their main

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2528</b></font><br><br>



business.  In my opinion, the Agency would have much more

to gain to have them on the Board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to the Agency incorporating my

suggestions.  On this note, I would like to  support  the

passing of the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr A Nithiah Nandan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A Nithiah Nandan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  fully support the Bill for the formation of  the

Singapore Workforce Development Agency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a trade unionist, I am deeply concerned and

involved  in workers' training.  I am very glad  that  we

will  now  have a Government agency that would look  into

skills  upgrading, training and retraining of our workers

-  the  only natural resource of the nation.  It is  very

timely  and  appropriate  under  the  current  industrial

environment  where  workers  need  to  keep   pace   with

technological  changes and the structural change  of  our

economy.  It would also add emphasis on the importance of

training  and  retraining of workers  to  the  employers.

And,  especially  now, Sir, when we are  experiencing  an

increase  in  retrenchment  of  workers  in  the  various

industrial  sectors, the relevance and  urgency  to  have

such an Agency is very obvious.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to outline some of the areas that

I  hope  the Agency would give additional attention  when

carrying out its functions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Provide training for older workers on jobs that

are available in the industry and suit their age profile;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Identify needed skills in the various industries and

provide  opportunities for multi-skill training  for  the

workers which would enhance their employability;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) To equip professionals and executives with relevant

skills needed for the emerging economy;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Explore the possibility of providing entrepreneurial

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;training;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Collaborate with the training providers, adult

education agencies and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2529</b></font><br><br>



employers  to  formulate a training schedule  that  would

suit  and  allow  the shift workers  to  be  trained  and

upgrade  their  skills and potential.  In  this  respect,

Sir; I wish to say that this has been a perennial problem

for the shift workers;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) To explore the possibility of setting up a database

with  information  on  the structural  and  technological

changes  in  the  employment and business sectors,  which

could  be  used  as  a guideline in formulating  training

programmes  that  would  suit  the  requirement  of   the

industries  and hence the employability of  the  workers.

Employers  have a greater role to play in  this  respect,

with the unions helping to motivate the workers to accept

training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the most important challenge facing us today is

the  plight  of  the  low income  workers.   Despite  the

affluence  that we seem to see around us, we  still  have

approximately  400,000  workers with  low  education  and

skills and amongst them, there are quite a number earning

just above the poverty line.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need persistent efforts and find innovative

ways  to  help  these  groups of  workers,  who  are  our

citizens, to break out of the poverty trap and  to  allow

them  to  have  a stake in the economic progress  of  our

country.    Macro-level  policy  of  providing   training

facilities  and subsidies alone will not be effective  to

these  workers.  A much more holistic approach is needed,

such  as  providing skills training during working  hours

and make provision so that family commitment will not  be

a  stumbling block for them to go for training.  I  would

suggest  that a special task force be set up  within  the

Agency  to  address this problem not only  at  the  macro

level but also at the individual worker's level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before concluding, I wish to also highlight

another  issue of work redesigning.  This has  become  an

important  issue with the number of retrenchments  taking

place and the number of Singaporeans out of work.  I hope

the  Agency  will  give  its due  consideration  for  job

redesigning and retraining of workers so

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2530</b></font><br><br>



that  Singaporeans could take up jobs currently  done  by

foreigners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for this Agency to succeed in its mission, I

call  upon the employers to play a greater role and  give

every  assistance  and  adopt  a  proactive  approach  to

workers' training and retraining.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Agency must set up certain targets for

itself,  otherwise it will be just words and  statements.

So  I  would  like  the Agency to come up  with  targets,

especially for the 400,000 workers who have below Primary

6 education and low-skilled.  They should set up targets,

and  after one year, in this House, we should take  stock

of  what  the Agency has done for such workers.  Then  we

will be really approaching the problem head-on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Sir, I would like to focus

on  two  vulnerable groups which need particular help  to

cope  with the ongoing economic restructuring.   The  two

groups are women and older workers, especially those with

lower skills.  I would like to urge the WDA to factor  in

their concerns in their planning and programmes.  Let  me

explain why.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the women. Women, especially those above 40,

tend  to  be hit harder by economic restructuring because

of  their  relatively lower level of skills.   They  also

tend  to  be  more concentrated in sectors  sensitive  to

international demand conditions, such as the  retail  and

travel-related sectors, and in production jobs which  are

migrating  to  cheaper locations.  Women are  also  over-represented in clerical and administration jobs and  they

are often the first targets of downsizing measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another trend: employers are more and more looking

for  workers  who  are willing to do shift  work  in  the

evening, late night or weekends.  Women find it  hard  to

take on these shifts and these demanding jobs because  of

their family responsibilities.  They have to go home  and

take care of their children or their ageing parents.   It

is especially hard for divorced women and widows who have

to support their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2531</b></font><br><br>



children, and also single women who have to support their

ageing parents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the same reason - their family commitments - these women find it hard to enrol for skills upgrading

courses.   They  have not gone for training  not  because

they  do not want to or because they do not see the  need

for  it,  but because they need to go home after work  to

care for their family.  As a result, these women are left

either  without a job, or with a low-wage and low-skilled

job with little prospects of improvement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make it harder for them, there is also the

prevailing  notion that women are secondary earners  and,

therefore, perceived to be more dispensable in the labour

market.   At the same time, more and more, we  see  women

needing  to  join the labour force to help  maintain  the

household,  especially  when their  husbands  are  losing

their  jobs.  And, more and more, we see women with  low-skilled jobs being haunted by job uncertainty.  Just last

night, it came to my attention that two sisters, in their

40s  and 50s, lost their jobs over one weekend.  That was

a big blow to their family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to make it easier for women to take up

the  job  opportunities and to stay  employable.   It  is

especially  important  for  women  to  work  as  long  as

possible  as they have a longer life expectancy  and  may

not  have  enough savings for their old age.   But  these

women  may  face  work and training  barriers  that  have

nothing to do with their attitudes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A big barrier for women, especially the low-skilled

women,  is  the  lack  of  good  quality  yet  affordable

childcare arrangements.  The long-term solution  to  this

problem   is   to   supply   more  affordable   childcare

facilities.   But in the short-term, we can  help  reduce

this  barrier by providing a childcare subsidy  to  women

who  take  on training courses and need to find childcare

arrangements for their children.  The subsidy should  end

when the training course ends.  This childcare

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2532</b></font><br><br>



subsidy  should be incorporated into the training package

for  low-skilled  women, and perhaps also  for  women  in

general.    Such  a  scheme  would  help  support   skill

development and the labour force participation of women.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, women are a resilient lot. In the past, when

faced  with hard times, women would on their own  go  out

and hawk food.  They would set up shop to cater food from

home.  But these days, such jobs are no longer available.

It  requires a heavy investment upfront to get  a  hawker

stall and just to run a little shop at home to sell  food

requires  getting  different licences from  the  relevant

agencies.   They need training and help to negotiate  the

more  complex self-employment landscape today.  While  we

are  integrating the different bodies into a new  agency,

there is also a need to integrate our economic and social

agendas  and  not  see this as a MCDS problem  or  a  CDC

problem.   It  is also a MOM problem.  We want  women  to

work  and  upgrade  their skills,  and  yet  raise  their

families as the primary caregivers.  We do not want  them

to  rely too much on foreign maids, yet we want women  to

have  more children.  At the same time, we lecture  women

when  we see that they do not want to take shift work  or

work overtime.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the new Agency to take responsibility

for  developing  a strategic plan for women's  employment

and  training,  taking into account the women's  role  as

primary  carers  at home and also their  qualities.   The

proper  infrastructure and facilities should  be  put  in

place so that they can take part in the labour market and

all the opportunities that will be created.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Agency should also be the lead agency in the

drive  towards  more  flexible working  arrangements  and

conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on older workers. We continue to hear, until

today, complaints from older workers that they could  not

find  a  job  because of their age.  I think many  of  my

fellow  MPs  have  raised this and the  Government  often

cites  the  People-for-Jobs Traineeship Programme  as  an

example of what has been done to help

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2533</b></font><br><br>



these  workers  above  40.  I know the  statistics.   The

programme  has  helped almost 12,000 older  workers  find

jobs.   But  this is actually a small drop in the  ocean.

Somehow,  talking to older workers, they do not see  this

scheme  as  helping  them.   And  so  they  continue   to

complain.   Perhaps this is because of ignorance,  or  it

could  also  reflect the limitations of this  scheme.   I

would urge the WDA to embark on the kind of exercise that

the   Education  Ministry  did  to  change  the  public's

perception  of  the  Institute  of  Technical   Education

(ITEs), that is, to invite MPs and grassroots leaders and

the  media  to  visit companies which  support  the  PJTP

scheme  and see for themselves how useful it has been  in

helping  older  workers.  Otherwise, the scepticism  will

remain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Agency should work with the

relevant agencies, including the labour movement, to push

the  effort  to  redesign jobs for older workers  and  to

create better working conditions for them.  We talk about

upgrading the skills of workers but it must go in  tandem

with upgrading the conditions at work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know one beehoon factory in Defu Lane which hires

about  50  workers, and most of the workers are above  45

and lower-educated.  They are still short of workers.  In

this  factory, all the workers are lined  up  in  a  row.

They  blow-dry,  cut and pack the beehoon.   I  know  the

employer,  and so the unemployed residents that  come  to

see  me and beg for a job, I will just refer them to this

employer of the beehoon factory.  When they come  to  me,

they  always  tell me, "I will do the job.  Any  job  you

give  me  I will do.  I am that desperate."  But  at  the

beehoon  factory, none stayed beyond  a  few  days.   The

reason:  the factory has no air-condition.  It cannot  be

air-conditioned,  the  employer  tells  me,  because  the

beehoon  cannot  be damp before sealing.   He  said  that

factories  in  the region are also without  air-condition

for the purpose of packing the beehoon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the one hand, we cannot expect Singaporeans,

who  are used to a certain comfort, to go and work  in  a

sweatshop.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2534</b></font><br><br>



But,  on the other hand, I think we need to try and  help

these  workers  by  helping SMEs to upgrade  the  working

conditions to see how they can fit the environment around

Singaporeans.  It is like you have been for a  long  time

trying  to  smash  a  round peg into a  square  hole  and

getting really frustrated at this round peg.  Why  is  it

not  fitting?   But I think we should also  look  at  the

square hole and see whether we can make it more round and

if  we  can find a mid-way to meet the two.  At the  same

time,  we  must moderate the expectations of workers,  of

course.   But  I  think  SMEs  especially  need  help  to

redesign  the jobs and upgrade the working conditions  so

that Singaporeans can take on those jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the labour movement is now working with 50

employers to redesign jobs and is working hard behind the

scenes.  I urge the WDA to promote the need for more  job

redesigning among more employers so that we can have more

jobs created for Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much has been said about creating jobs for

Singaporeans.   I just want to add one last  point  about

this  issue.   I hope that in the process of  emphasising

the  need to create more jobs for Singaporeans  -  and  I

support  this fully  -  we would not send a wrong  signal

to  foreigners  that they are not welcomed in  Singapore.

Because  if  we  keep on saying that, yes,  we  are  only

creating jobs for Singaporeans, if I were a bright kid in

Malaysia, China, India or Australia, I would think  twice

about  coming  to  Singapore  to  study.   Because  after

graduating,  will I find a job or will  the  priority  or

preference be given to Singaporeans?  It would affect  my

decision whether to come to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that, while it is populist and perhaps

sounds very good to say that we only want to create  jobs

for  Singaporeans, we must also be careful about  sending

the right signal.  Because foreigners who come here, they

do  help Singapore to grow, and eventually, some of  them

may  strike  roots  and  become  Singaporeans   -    like

myself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I support the Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2535</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

focus  on  another group of workers.  According to  MOM's

Labour   Market  Report  for  the  first   quarter,   job

retrenchment is fast extending beyond the older and  less

educated  to include better educated, mid-career workers.

This   is   reflected  by  statistics  that   show   that

professionals, managers, executives and technicians  form

43%, the largest group of locals retrenched.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, two other significant pieces of information in

this  Report  bear  out further the changing  profile  of

retrenched  workers.  One third of those retrenched  were

either  degree or diploma holders. And 60% of  those  who

lost  their jobs were people in their 30s and 40s.  I  am

concerned  about  this.  Degree and diploma  holders  are

people  the State has invested most heavily in over  many

years  through  our  education  system.   Those  who  are

unemployed in their 30s and 40s are people in  the  prime

of  their  lives.  Many with heavy financial  commitments

have  difficulty in seeing through when they  lose  their

jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is even more alarming is the difficulty with

which  these  people can find new jobs.  In general,  re-employment  prospects for all those who lose  their  jobs

have deteriorated in the past few months.  Around half of

those  retrenched  remain unemployed  after  six  months.

Degree holders are the worst off.  The re-employment rate

for  those  in the 40s is 41% and those in their  50s  is

only 33%.  In other words, more than half do not get  re-employed even after six months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some of these people are friends of mine. And

I  can  feel their sense of loss.  They too have invested

heavily in their earlier education, in terms of time  and

money.  And, today, they have been told that they are  no

longer required.  And the reason given to them is a  very

loose    term    that   we   nowadays   call    "economic

restructuring".   It  is  a  very  high-sounding  word  - "restructuring".    But   to   many   people    nowadays,

restructuring is a dirty word, that means bad  news.   It

is  like when your banker calls on you and tells you that

it  is  time to restructure your loan, you know that  you

are in trouble.  To such

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2536</b></font><br><br>



people, labelling their predicament as an exercise in pre-emptive  layoff,  as we now call it, and  describing  the

prospects  of  being  re-employed as  dim,  even  if  the

economy turns around, because of what is now termed as  a

possible  jobless  recovery, is like  rubbing  salt  into

wound.   However  you  describe it  and  no  matter  what

reasons  you  give, no matter how you  tell  people  what

drastic changes the whole world is undergoing, a loss  of

job to someone means a loss of income and the ability  to

feed  himself and his family.  It is a loss of  your  own

dignity when you lose your job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that when the Asian financial crisis

first   hit   us  some  years  ago,  we  had  our   first

retrenchment  exercises  in many  years.   In  the  early

stages,  there  were actually people  who  did  not  mind

getting  retrenched because they had a  golden  handshake

and  many even went on a holiday first because they  knew

that they could get another job when they came back.  But

as  reality  set in, that the economy would  not  recover

that fast, people then began to fear that they would lose

their  jobs.   Today,  the unemployed  harbour  no  false

illusion  that  a job is round the corner  and  many  are

prepared to work for lower wages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the challenge that faces us today is not

just to get people to change their mindset about the type

of  wages they can look forward to in future.  I think it

has to do also with getting people to understand that  in

times  of  big changes, as we are now going through,  the

biggest change that will have to take place is to be with

oneself.   In  practical terms, how do  you  convince  an

accountant, or an engineer, or a bank officer in his 40s,

who  has  lost his job, that he has to reinvent  himself,

and what new skills can you ask him to pick up?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Sir, I think this would be one of the

challenges facing the new statutory board, the setting up

of  which  must  receive the full support of  the  House.

Retraining our workers and equipping ourselves  with  new

skills is not a panacea for all our ills.  But it will go

a  long way in ensuring that our people become employable

when

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2537</b></font><br><br>



the  economy  turns  around.  Retraining  our  workforce,

upgrading their skills, these are not new things  to  us.

We  already  have  a  slew of programmes  -  work  skills

training programme, People-for-Jobs Traineeship, WISE and

BEST  -  and  multiple agencies ( EDB,  SPRING)  and  the

labour movement handling all these programmes.  But as  I

understand  it,  even if the number of people  going  for

retraining  has  increased over  the  years,  demand  for

retraining still falls below available training places.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the principal tasks of this new agency will

be  to  ensure that the demand for places is kept up;  in

other   words,  people  want  to  continue   to   upgrade

themselves.   And  I would say that we  would  need  some

coordination of our efforts.  To achieve this,  WDA,  now

that it is an amalgamation of many agencies offering  the

different programmes, must be able to communicate clearly

to workers what types of available programmes match their

learning  abilities and aptitudes so that  we  can  equip

them with the right skills that will make them employable

in  the  future.   While retraining must cut  across  all

levels of the workforce, I hope that the Agency would pay

strong   focus   on  these  people  who  are   mid-career

professionals and executives as they are likely to be the

one  group  which  would be the hardest  to  retrain  and

rematch with jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this statutory board, in my opinion, is

probably the most important one that we are setting up in

recent  times.  I was very encouraged to hear the  Acting

Minister  conclude  yesterday in his statement  that  his

mission is to get the jobs back for Singaporeans.  And  I

am sure that all Members of the House would also want him

to succeed in this mission fast.  Therefore, I would like

to  urge  the  House  to give this Bill  its  unqualified

support.

<br>4.55 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines):</b> Sir, I rise to speak in

support  of  the  Singapore Workforce Development  Agency

Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2538</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there is an extensive range of workforce

development programmes and initiatives being  managed  by

the  Ministry of Manpower and the Standards, Productivity

and   Innovation  Board  (SPRING).   The  new   Workforce

Development Agency's objective is to bring most of  these

programmes under one roof and provide better coordination

of  these programmes in addition to developing new  ones.

I   would   like  to  raise  some  concerns   about   the

reassignment of the existing initiatives and programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, SPRING runs a total of eight workforce

development  initiatives.  Three of  these,  namely,  the

Skills  Development Fund, CREST (Critical Enabling Skills

Training) and National Skills Recognition System, will be

transferred  to the new WDA.  I would like to  know  what

would  happen  to the others, like Work Redesign,  People

Developer,  Industry Capability Upgrading and  On-the-Job

Training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of particular concern in the area of workforce

development are the People Developer programme and On-the-Job  Training programme.  The People Developer  programme

offers  a quality standard on Human Resource Development,

which  is one of the stated functions of WDA, and On-the-Job  Training  programme is an initiative  for  employer-based training to equip employees with skills to meet the

challenges  of the new economy.  Will SPRING continue  to

run  them,  perhaps in collaboration with  WDA,  or  will

these programmes cease to be offered altogether?  I would

like  to ask why these two programmes should not be  also

transferred to WDA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, on the other hand, SPRING is only a couple of

years old and before SPRING has the chance to spring,  or

be  sprung, we are now taking away from it three  of  the

more important human capital development and productivity

initiatives.  Why are some initiatives being moved across

to  WDA  and some being retained in SPRING?  I  think  we

should  use the opportunity offered by this Bill  to  set

this straight.  Otherwise, we will have to do a reshuffle

again in a couple of years' time.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2539</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I am wholeheartedly supportive of

this  Bill.  Due to the recent increase in the number  of

retrenchments, there is now more of an immediate need  to

reskill  the  unemployed and the retrenched.   One  group

that  would benefit greatly from retraining would be  the

low-skilled, less educated in their 30s and 40s who  have

a  potential of at least another 20 working years or  so.

These are the people who have dependants, possibly at all

three  levels - parents, spouse and children - to support

and, to top it off, various loan obligations to meet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many, the economy has evolved bewilderingly in

such  a way that, contrary to their earlier expectations,

their  skills  are  no longer relevant in  a  marketplace

which  prizes higher skilled workers.  However,  this  is

the  very  group  of people who are the least  likely  to

undertake   continuing  education   due   to   inadequate

knowledge of programmes available and lack of funds.  The

WDA must find ways to reach out to them and convince them

of  the  benefits  of  training and  reskilling  at  this

difficult and frustrating time in their life.  It is  the

task of the Agency to devise relevant programmes, through

careful   studies   and  close  consultation   with   the

industries, to cater to this group by equipping them with

the  tools  to rise from the doldrums of unemployment  to

better  opportunities in the workplace through retraining

and  reskilling.  The WDA must also not forget that,  for

their programmes to truly benefit this group, they should

aim   unwaveringly  to  provide  easily  accessible   and

understood information, better incentives and funding for

this group of low-skilled older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to focus on another group of

workers  who  can be helped if we have clearer  standards

for  the  various  trades  and businesses.   In  the  new

economy,  companies have to be nimble,  must  retain  the

flexibility to downsize, right-size, or up-size, to  meet

the changing demands of the economy.  This will result in

more and more dislocation among workers and more and more

people becoming self-employed, contracting to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2540</b></font><br><br>



provide specific services and engaging in freelance  non-full  time independent jobs, either for a temporary  part

of  their  working life or their whole working life.   In

our  daily  lives,  we  come across  various  people  who

provide  different  services from white-collar  ones  who

provide business consultancy, financial planning advisory

services,  even private tuition, to blue-collar  services

like   plumbing  and  gardening.   For  the  professional

services,  I  think  the consumer  would  take  time  and

exercise care to gauge, find out and agree on the quality

of service that he wants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, if you want to engage a plumber, tailor,

tuition  teacher, computer repairman, swimming instructor

or  local  domestic help, how do you assess and find  out

what  skills that person has and how good are his  skills

and  the  quality of his work other than through word-of-mouth recommendation or by trial and error?  The consumer

is,  hence, wary about engaging freelancers and, in turn,

this   consumer   distrust  limits  the   potential   and

opportunities  available  to the  freelancers.   To  grow

these  trades and help these individuals who  have  these

skills to find an income, I believe we have to reduce the

present  obstacles  of the absence of consistent  quality

and standards, and the lack of avenues for resolution  of

disputes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if you are skilled in IT and

retrenched, how do you publicise your services to provide

freelance IT consultancy?  As a consumer, if you  need  a

PC  doctor to fix a bug in your home computer,  how  sure

are you of his skills?  Would you have more confidence if

he  proudly  wears a badge that tells you that  he  meets

with   certain  standards  established  by  a   reputable

organisation and governed by its code of ethics?  What if

the  repairman  is  backed by an  organisation  that  can

provide assurance of a certain quality to its consumers?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in other developed countries like the United

States,  there  is a multitude of such organisations  and

associations,  and  their members proudly  display  their

badge  of identification.  We have imported some of these

foreign  organisations  with their established  standards

into our community.  The Agency can fulfil its role in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2541</b></font><br><br>



developing this section of the workforce by roping in  or

helping  to  set up more such local private  associations

that  represent the various trades who can then establish

and  maintain the standards, have a strong code of ethics

governing   its   members,  provide   training   courses,

recognised  skills  accreditation, skills  upgrading  and

continuing education of its members and resolve  disputes

and  complaints concerning its members.  This  will  help

promote  the  "cottage industries" of  the  new  economy.

Once  these  associations  are properly  established,  it

would  be easier for those who wish to acquire new skills

and enter a fresh trade whether to tide over a period  of

unemployment or on a more permanent basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, even though Singapore's

economy  is  expected to recover in  the  coming  months,

there  is  still no cheer in sight for the jobless.   The

Government  and many companies continue to warn  of  more

job  losses,  corporate  restructuring  and  cost-cutting

measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More worryingly, this phenomenon of a jobless

recovery is not peculiar to Singapore.  USA, the  world's

largest  and  strongest  economy,  has  not  been  spared

either, as even executive jobs are at risk of being moved

outwards  to lower-cost countries like China  and  India.

For   all   its  promises,  there  is  a  dark  side   to

globalisation and the new knowledge economy and, that is,

higher  and speedier job obsolescence and, thus,  chronic

structural unemployment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2542</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mdm Deputy Speaker (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua) in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>5.05 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economist notes in a recent issue: "America's

economy  is  now supposedly on the road to recovery,  but

somebody  forgot  to  tell the labour  market."   Merrill

Lynch  notes  in  the same article: "If the  early  1990s

upturn  was  the jobless recovery, this is  the  job-loss

recovery."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As structural unemployment is set to become a staple

of  the new economy, the establishment of a single agency

to  focus on continuing education and training of  adults

and employment assistance comes none too soon.  This will

ensure   that   all  the  well-intentioned  but   perhaps

sometimes disparate efforts by different agencies will be

better organised for greater effect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I urge the Agency to take cognisance of the

following four main concerns as it pushes ahead with  the

two   key   objectives  of  employment   assistance   and

continuing education and training for adults.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under employment assistance, I would like to

highlight two key issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Agency should look at ways to further

improve its job-matching schemes and optimise the use  of

limited  resources  available.   Despite  the  tremendous

resources poured in for job matching, the success rate of

such  efforts  has remained low, at less than  20%.   The

ends do not seem to have justified the means.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Agency is to become the coordinating body for

job-matching efforts, I would like to find out  from  the

Minister   how   the  Agency  plans  to  undertake   such

coordination  with the various CareerLink Centres.   What

would  be their roles and duties as against those of  the

Agency?   I  understand, for instance, that each  of  the

centres   has  different  job  databases.   One   of   my

grassroots members, who was recently retrenched, told  me

that  he  was given different listings when  he  went  to

different  centres.  It appears that many job  applicants

are now going all over the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2543</b></font><br><br>



island  to the different centres to apply for jobs.   So,

the  number  of  job requests recorded at  the  different

CareerLink Centres may be significantly lower,  if  these

multiple visits are discounted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Agency to set up a centralised national

job database, so that an applicant need only to go to one

centre to apply for a job.  This would not only save  the

time,  effort and money of the applicant, but also  avoid

duplication of work, wastage of scarce resources, as well

as  improve  efficiency.  This centralised  database  can

also  be  used  to  help the CDCs better  link  financial

assistance  to  job  placements.   Those  who  repeatedly

reject  jobs must be counselled to find out their reasons

for rejecting jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some jobs, which have traditionally been the domain

of  foreign workers, are shunned by Singaporeans  because

of  the  low  pay, which is deemed insufficient  for  the

worker  to  support even himself, let alone  his  family.

Besides  job redesign, Singaporeans may be encouraged  to

take  up such jobs and, at least, catch some of the  fish

themselves,  if the Agency could work together  with  the

MCDS and tie a subsidy or financial assistance scheme  to

the job placement of the worker.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, feedback from one of my residents who

had  been  retrenched and recently found a job  is  that,

while  the job-matching efforts of the CareerLink Centres

are  commendable,  they  could  perhaps  learn  from  the

private  sector  job placement agencies  to  improve  the

success rate.  This resident shared with me that  he  had

eventually  gotten  a job through a  private  sector  job

agency.   He  said that the agency, no doubt incentivised

by  a  commission  for  successful  placement,  was  very

proactive  in  helping him identify a suitable  job.   In

fact,  they had taken an active role and even helped  him

negotiate  with the prospective employer  to  consider  a

slightly higher salary as a delivery driver, even  before

the interview.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, the Agency should consider outsourcing at

least part of the job-

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2544</b></font><br><br>



matching  efforts to private sector job agencies.   These

agencies  already  have  the  expertise  to  handle   job

matching,  and  their  skills and  experience  should  be

tapped.  Why re-invent the wheel?  Outsourcing could help

to  minimise  the  necessity for the  various  CareerLink

Centres  with  limited  budget  to  expand  their   staff

strength and increase resources for job matching.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Agency should continue to help change

the mindsets of both employers and employees to match the

current  employment  landscape.  The Government  and  the

employers have constantly cited the poor attitude of  our

workers  for the job mismatch and high unemployment  rate

even  while  we have more foreign workers than unemployed

Singaporeans.   There is obviously truth  to  this.   For

instance,  a  resident  in my constituency  whom  we  had

successfully placed in a firm, came back to tell me  that

she  had quit her job after one week as she found working

at  a  computer,  for which she is unfamiliar  with,  too

difficult.   And  this was in an air-conditioned  office.

She  asked me to help her get a stall in a school canteen

instead,  as  she  had figured that this  would  be  much

easier work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, anecdotal evidence suggests that many

laid  off  Singaporeans are now willing to  change  their

expectations,  take significant pay  cuts,  and  work  in

industries which they might have previously shunned.  For

instance,  I came across a 50-year-old resident  who  has

diplomas   in   both  computer  studies  and   industrial

relations  and  was previously a computer support  staff.

He  now works as a security guard earning about $1,000  a

month.   He said that he has been rejected for many  jobs

because   of  his  age.   He  has  encountered   numerous

prospective  employers who tell him over the  phone  that

they need someone much younger.  He was not even given  a

chance to be interviewed!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOM has tried to encourage employers to employ older

workers  by  providing a subsidy for six months,  if  the

firm  hires a worker above 40 years old.  However,  there

are still employers who are averse

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2545</b></font><br><br>



to  hiring older workers even with the subsidy.  In  this

respect,  Mdm  Deputy Speaker, I would like  to  ask  the

Minister what further plans the Ministry has to encourage

employers  to give older workers a fair chance to  secure

jobs.   For a start, the Agency could work together  with

all  the  Government Ministries and agencies to encourage

them to employ older workers whenever possible.  Does the

Minister  know  how  many  older retrenched  workers  the

Government Ministries and agencies have employed  in  the

last two years?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tales also abound of employers who prefer to employ

foreigners as they work longer hours, do not have  to  go

for  reservist training and are not entitled to  CPF.   A

participant in a feedback group I chaired shared that  in

the media industry she works in, she feels that between a

Singaporean  and a foreigner with similar qualifications,

the  foreigner is usually preferred.  As evidenced by the

recent  Straits Times poll, most Singaporeans acknowledge

that foreign talent has a role to play in Singapore.  So,

they   are   not   saying  "Foreigners   -   no   entry".

Furthermore,  we  do  not want to  impose  labour  market

rigidity by limiting foreign workers, especially for  the

higher  skilled jobs and, in the process, make  Singapore

unattractive to business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in a period of an all-time 15-year high

unemployment rate, there is a real need to relook at  our

foreign   worker  policies  to  balance  the   legitimate

concerns  of the citizens as against those of businesses,

the  economy  and, yes, foreigners.  Without compromising

on  the  premise  that  foreign talent  is  necessary  to

supplement   our  local  talent  and  boost   Singapore's

economy, I think drastic times call for drastic relook at

existing  measures, at least on a temporary  basis.   For

instance, the foreign worker quota could be reviewed  and

varied  during periods of high unemployment  where  there

should  be  an adequate number of locals for  hire.   The

ratio, for example, could be tied somehow to the rate  of

unemployment,  within  a certain  band,  to  give  policy

flexibility, but generally moving up when unemployment is

low

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2546</b></font><br><br>



and  moving down when the opposite happens.  I  note  the

Minister  did  say  yesterday that  the  quota  would  be

monitored and reviewed periodically.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to highlight two key issues under

the  Agency's second strategic thrust of adult continuing

education and training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, industry consultation and collaboration.

Reading  Part III of the Singapore Workforce  Development

Agency  Bill  gives the impression, rightly  or  wrongly,

that  the  Agency  will  be in competition  with  private

sector  organisations  offering education,  training  and

upgrading programmes, as well as with professional groups

like  the Singapore Human Resource Institute which  seeks

to develop HR best practices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough has been said about public sector crowding

out  private  sector initiatives when this House  debated

the  Temasek  Charter last year.  I urge the Minister  to

assure  the  public  that this is  more  perception  than

reality.   Efforts  should  therefore  be  made  whenever

possible to collaborate with professional bodies,  course

providers  and  other  appropriate organisations  in  the

training  of  the  workforce.  These  specialised  bodies

would  know the state of the industry and understand  the

needs  of  the  workforce much better than  a  Government

agency tasked with a diverse range of functions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the real estate industry with which I am

familiar,  I have previously come across instances  where

attempts  to  initiate  standards and  training  for  the

continuing  education of real estate practitioners  by  a

Government agency have been based on inadequate  feedback

from  the  ground because not all relevant  organisations

were  identified and consulted.  This would lead to  time

wasted,   unnecessary  costs  incurred,  and  less   than

desirable  outcomes.  In its efforts to develop  training

programmes, the Agency should be mindful not to duplicate

and  compete  with private sector efforts and initiatives

but,  rather,  to facilitate any on-going programmes  and

courses.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2547</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outsourcing, so widely practised by the private

sector,  should  be the norm rather than  the  exception.

Already, there have been murmurings about what SPRING  is

doing in conducting educational courses in alliance  with

overseas   institutes,  something   which   the   private

education industry has been carrying out for a long time.

Secondly, like my colleagues before me, I would  like  to

talk  about  training of older workers.  Adult continuing

education  and  training  would provide  useful  learning

opportunities  for  older workers, especially  the  lowly

educated  ones whose livelihoods are more at risk.   This

is  particularly  crucial  in  the  light  of  an  ageing

population  and  a longer life expectancy.   In  fact,  a

special  task force within the proposed Agency should  be

set  up to focus on this group of older workers who  have

not  been  adequately  prepared to meet  the  drastically

changed circumstances. Their fishing skills are outmoded.

As  testimony of the urgency to help older workers, based

on  MOM's  data as at the first quarter of 2003,  amongst

the  75,000  unemployed then, those  aged  40  and  above

formed  the  largest group at 43%.  Moreover,  of  these,

more  than  half  (15,900) have  below  secondary  school

education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task force can work together with the private

and  people  sectors as well as Government Ministries  to

identify  and/or re-engineer jobs to make  them  suitable

and  more attractive for older workers. Training  courses

to help older workers obtain the skills for jobs in these

sectors  can  then  be designed and promoted.   The  task

force should look at ways to encourage employers to  hire

these  older workers, but nonetheless competent and able.

It   should   also   look  into  ways  to   prevent   age

discrimination  of  such workers.  The  plight  of  these

workers has to be championed as this problem is likely to

remain with us for a long time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a time not too long ago when Singaporeans

were  enjoying high economic growth and, in the  process,

became   asset-rich  and  cash-rich.    Then   came   the

unprecedented and prolonged period of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2548</b></font><br><br>



uncertainty  starting  from the Asian  financial  crisis,

followed by a series of shocks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans have, in the last few years, lamented

that  they are both asset-less and cash-less, or  perhaps

now  more  appropriately, "asset-loss"  and  "cash-loss".

Now,  for  the  typical Singaporean, there is  the  added

dread  of yet another loss, "job-loss", if they  are  not

already in this state.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helping Singaporeans to get jobs, retain jobs and

remain  employable over their working life should clearly

be  one  of  the Government's key objectives.   Hitherto,

other  than  defence and national development,  education

takes up the biggest share of our national budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without minimising the importance of training of our

young  for  the  future,  brutal  global  competition  is

hammering  home  the point that the adult  workforce,  by

sheer  numbers and current contribution to  the  economy,

deserves  as  much,  if  not  more,  attention  and   the

collective  efforts  of  the  Government,  employers  and

employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I therefore support the setting up of the

Singapore Workforce Development Agency.  This signals the

Government's commitment to ensure that Singaporeans  will

remain employable in the face of dramatic changes in  the

employment landscape.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Mdm Deputy

Speaker,  I  welcome  the proposed establishment  of  the

Singapore  Workforce Development Agency that  will  bring

together  various divisions of the Ministry  of  Manpower

and  SPRING  Singapore.   The  issues  that  need  to  be

addressed in tackling the challenges that lie ahead of us

in ensuring employment opportunities for Singaporeans are

multi-faceted and it will be good to have one agency that

can focus its entire attention and energies on this task.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOM and SPRING Singapore must be given kudos for the

many and varied training and reskilling programmes that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2549</b></font><br><br>



they  have already developed and introduced in the recent

couple  of years, even without the existence of the  WDA,

and the generous funding that they have made available to

support these programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the support and provision of training and

reskilling  programmes is only one small part,  in  fact,

the first step in the whole picture and process.  What we

want and need is ultimately, that the worker is placed in

a  job,  that he stays in the job, that he makes  a  good

contribution  to his employer and that he  earns  a  wage

that  allows  him to discharge his financial  obligations

and maintain a reasonable living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many other factors that will significantly

impact  on WDA's effectiveness and ability to deliver  on

this ultimate goal.  These include Singaporeans' mindsets

and  attitudes towards work, both as individuals as  well

as  a  society; the realities that Singaporeans  face  in

earning a viable living in the face of the complex impact

of  CPF contributions on take-home pay and the ability to

pay  mortgages on the one hand, and the issue of business

cost  on  the other; and finally what we can  do  in  the

whole area of self-employment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Singaporeans' attitudes and expectations with

regard  to jobs, we hear different stories from different

quarters.  I am sure that all the stories are,  in  fact,

true and factual and simply reflect both the diversity of

people's  backgrounds  and  experiences,  as  well  as  a

society which is in transition from having known so  many

years  of high growth and full employment to one  dealing

with a much less certain future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had spoken in this House before on the very

positive experience of all parties when you have a  happy

confluence  of  determined  and  adaptable  workers   and

employers  willing  to take on mature  employees  in  the

instance  of our experience in healthcare.  We must  find

the  occasion to highlight more of such success  stories.

There is, however, a long way to go yet to encourage many

other  Singaporeans to adjust their mindsets with  regard

to  what constitutes an acceptable and worthy occupation.

This applies

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2550</b></font><br><br>



to  both individual Singaporeans looking for jobs as well

as Singaporeans as a society in how we view workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent encounter reminded me both of the progress

made  as  well as the way yet ahead. This has to do  with

the area of domestic services.  I served in early 1997 on

the  Back-to-Work  Committee  of  the  then  Ministry  of

Labour.   We  had  identified  domestic  services  as  an

industry  which  had  potential  to  solve  two  problems

concurrently.   It  is  a great example  of  the  win-win

solutions we are always looking for. We thought it  would

help  solve  the  problems of working  women  juggling  a

career and housekeeping responsibilities, without further

increasing our reliance on foreign maids on the one hand,

and  providing opportunities for other women  wanting  to

get  back  to  work in an area that they would  have  the

necessary skills and aptitudes on the other.   Since that

time,  quite  a  number  of  companies  have  sprung  up,

providing  housekeeping services and  they  are  doing  a

booming business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I use the services of such a company to help keep my

apartment in habitable condition.  They send two  workers

in  a team to do the cleaning and they actually do a very

good  and professional job.  Just last week, I discovered

that  both the workers assigned to my apartment are  non-Singaporeans.  I was rather taken aback because I had, up

to  then,  always thought happily that the work that  the

Committee  that  I had served on, and our recommendations

had  made  some  contributions  towards  encouraging  the

growth  of a sector that provided good opportunities  for

Singaporeans.  As it transpired, the picture was not that

bad.  On talking to the owner, who was surprised to get a

call  from  me,  I  found that, in  fact,  70%  of  their

workforce  is local.  So we have created some  good  jobs

there.   However,  they  do face  significant  difficulty

finding  and  keeping Singaporeans.  In fact,  they  have

just done a review.  In a recent 7-month period, they had

hired  160  Singaporeans and put them through  structured

training.   At the end of that period, regretfully,  only

20 of this group have stayed on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons is the same as the one that my

colleague, Ms Irene Ng,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2551</b></font><br><br>



has   just  brought  up.  They  relate  to  the   working

conditions,  such  as a non air-conditioned  environment.

But  there  is also another factor that comes into  play,

which relates to whether the house owner would be at home

or   out  when  the  housekeepers  come.  The  latter  is

preferred, as the workers do not like to be seen at their

work, being shy of being identified.  The job is not  one

that they are proud to be identified with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where, as a society, we must move from

mouthing  platitudes about the dignity of  honest  labour

towards truly according the appreciation and respect that

we  should have for any worker who discharges his or  her

duties  competently and responsibly,  regardless  of  the

nature  of the work itself. These are mindset issues  and

the  WDA  will  have  an impossible task  if  we  do  not

consciously work on our attitudes and behaviour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next come the realities of what a displaced worker

needs in terms of earning a viable living. The company  I

spoke  of starts their housekeepers at $1,000.  In  fact,

the  range moves up, when you get to be a supervisor,  to

$1,800.   This is actually not bad when you  look  at  it

that  way.   But a simple and clear illustration  of  the

problems Singaporean workers face, with regard to salary,

was  given  by  a Mr Jack Sim, who wrote to  the  Straits

Times'  Forum  page  last week.  He gave  a  very  simple

illustration of why he employed Malaysian workers  rather

than Singaporeans and further of why it was difficult   - he  was not casting aspersions on Singaporean workers   - for  a  Singaporean worker to manage on the  same  salary

that  his Malaysian counterpart would be happy to accept.

He  used a simple calculation of $1,000, which is easy to

work  in terms of percentages.  It is simply that at  the

starting salary of $1,000, the Malaysian worker costs  Mr

Sim  $1,030 ($1,000 + $30 levy) and a Singaporean  worker

costs  him $1,160 ($1,000 + $160 CPF). That is  from  his

perspective as an employer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the perspective of the Singaporean worker, he

only gets $800 as take-

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2552</b></font><br><br>



home pay ($1,000 less $200 employee's contribution).   Of

course, the $1,000 that the Malaysian counterpart  brings

home  gets  him  a  lot further than the  $800  that  our

Singaporean worker takes as take-home pay.  This is not a

session on CPF, but I think that what he does bring home,

this  re-tuning of the CPF scheme, which is being  mooted

by  various quarters recently, is certainly badly needed.

In  fact, the question is whether it is a re-tuning  that

is required or a fairly major overhaul because the issues

are  so  intertwined  and complex as to  the  conflicting

demands  that we need to see addressed.  In this context,

all  that I wanted to say is that even as the WDA  pushes

ahead  with the issues of training and reskilling,  which

the  Agency will, in fact, move this in parallel,  as  it

certainly  will have impact on the success, or otherwise,

of the ultimate goal of jobs for Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, to turn attention to another approach, ie,

self-employment.  Much effort will go into creating  jobs

in which Singaporeans may be employed.  But I trust WDA's

remit  also includes looking into supporting the creation

of  opportunities for self-employment or freelancing,  as

my  colleague, Mr Ong Kian Min, has just earlier referred

to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOM had sponsored a course last year on "How to

start  and  run your own business". This was co-organised

by  the PSB Academy and DEW Credit Cooperative.  I  think

they  trained,  in  the period of 3-6 months  last  year,

1,200  people.   How about supporting this effort  beyond

sponsoring  the training?  How about, firstly,  extending

this  effort  to  minimising rules and  regulations  that

prohibit  or that are not helpful to helping  people  who

actually  want to go out there and do some small business

or  provide some services on their own? This principle of

helping you how to start and run your own business is the

principle that we always use, as an analogy, of  teaching

people how to fish.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be helpful then in that scenario to make

sure  that we are not putting a lot of "no fishing" signs

on all the bodies of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2553</b></font><br><br>



water that may exist.  What is the point of teaching them

to  fish  and  then at every pond, every pool  and  every

little  rivulet you have this "no fishing"  sign  on  it?

With  regard  to  these "no fishing" prohibitions,  I  am

reminded  of a story.  I recently heard from  one  of  my

long-time  serving Parliamentary colleagues  who  had  to

plead for 10 years before finally being able to secure  a

licence for a constituent to set up a little corner in  a

marketplace  outside  a  clothing  shop  to  do  clothing

alterations.  This constituent is a woman who  is  single

with  a  sick  mother, whom she has to take  for  medical

appointments  and whom she has to stay home  periodically

at  short notice to take care of.  So for her, the  ideal

solution  was  the  flexibility  of  a  part-time  income

generation  job. She was not asking for a  handout.   She

has  this  skill.  But  it took that  long  to  get  this

licence.  Presumably, the appropriate authority was  very

mindful  of  the  tidiness  of the  environment  in  that

marketplace,  in a bigger context.  But I think  you  can

see  that  it was not really helpful for this woman,  who

was trying to make a living and not having to depend on a

handout.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is a case to be made. We are now

facing  a situation that is complex and we want  all  the

diverse  solutions that we can get.  Apart from  creating

jobs in big and small and medium sized companies, I think

we  should find a way so that individuals with skills can

have lots of flexibility to set up and provide their  own

services.  This too, I trust, will be something that  WDA

will champion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Madam, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mdm Deputy

Speaker,  I  rise  in support of the Singapore  Workforce

Development Agency Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we all know that Singapore is experiencing

the  most  difficult period of growth and development  in

its  journey  as a young nation.  The country's  economic

growth  turned sharply negative in the second quarter  of

2003,  falling to - 4.2% from positive growth of 1.7%  in

the first quarter.  The volatility of Singapore's economy

is becoming more and more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2554</b></font><br><br>



apparent.    I  believe  that  the  Singapore  Government

realises that an economy that is overly dependent on only

electronics, shipping and financial services is prone  to

sharp  swings.   Hence,  over  the  years,  and  more  so

recently,  its  courtship  included  chemical  companies,

pharmaceuticals  and drug manufacturers,  biotech  firms,

health and nutrition companies in the Government's bid to

diversify.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I hope no one is still holding his breath,

hoping   against  hope  that  the  years  of  rapid   and

exponential  growth will return soon.   This  realisation

must  set  in,  so that we can move forward  effectively.

The  main story is not whether the cycle is slowing  down

or not, but that the economy has become more difficult to

predict.   Moving  forward will  not  be  an  easy  task,

because the rules of the game have changed.  The problems

that we are currently facing are different from the past,

hence requiring different solutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two main issues that we need to look at, which

were  clearly  articulated by  the  Acting  Minister  for

Manpower, are job creation and workers' employability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MTI quarterly review recently pinpointed the

loss  of  more than 20,000 jobs in the last quarter,  the

8th   straight   quarterly  decline  in  employment   and

significantly more than the 4,000 jobs lost in the  first

three  months  of  the  year.  This trend  will  probably

continue  through 2003, and a recovery in the job  market

is  only expected in 2004, if we are lucky.  Exporters in

Singapore  have  been slashing jobs and some  are  moving

production  to  countries such  as  China,  Malaysia  and

Thailand,  which have lower land and labour costs.   Wage

costs  in  China,  on  average, are much  lower  than  in

Singapore.  Some of the sobering examples, just to cite a

few,  are Japan's Seiko Epson Corporation, Sanyo Electric

Company  and  Hitachi Limited, and have all cut  jobs  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we all know that everyone needs a job.

Generating   jobs   has   always   been   an    important

preoccupation  of  our Government.  Bringing  in  foreign

direct investments (FDI) into our economy has,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2555</b></font><br><br>



among   other  things,   created  jobs  for  our  people.

However,  this  tried and tested formula does  not  yield

effective  results today.  The reasons  are:  first,  the

number  of  jobs  FDIs  bring  in  is  significantly  and

comparatively smaller.  Second, the profile  has  changed

with  regard to the specific skill set that is  required.

Third,  an issue which is quite sensitive at the  present

time,  foreigners may be more suitable at the end of  the

day,  either  because they have the experience,  fit  the

requirements  or they are basically cheaper  to  hire  or

simply more willing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An over dependence on FDIs is not ideal. We all

acknowledge the need to develop our local industries, our

home-grown  entrepreneurs  and  companies  that   provide

employment.   While  we  encourage  FDIs,  we  must  also

seriously commit to developing home-grown businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is not enough, to further complicate

matters,  there is the destabilising effects of  security

or rather insecurity in the region that must now be taken

into  account.   We  know  that  such  developments  will

influence  investors' sentiments and  decisions.   Moving

forward, it is going to be tougher to get FDIs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads us to the most vital question: what about

our   workers?    Are  Singaporeans  keeping   up   their

employability?   Even  if  there  are  enough  jobs,   do

Singaporeans  have the know-how or skills to  carry  them

out?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning new skills can mean new job opportunities.

Are Singaporeans willing to match employers' expectations

in  terms of salaries, or are employers compelled to hire

foreigners to cut cost?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way ahead is to equip our workers with the

skills,  the knowledge and the know-how so that they  can

look at the employers in the eye and tell them, "Anything

a foreigner can do, I can do better."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be a need to be reminded time and

time again that like

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2556</b></font><br><br>



hills  and the open grounds, we are constantly  swept  by

the  winds  of change.  Progress will not come unless  we

have  changed.   I  guess we realise its  importance  and

Remaking  Singapore  is indeed the  right  thing  to  do.

Similarly,  as  the economy undergoes restructuring,  the

"worker", being the basic unit of the economy,  needs  to

be redefined.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, to me, the ideal worker is the

"superworker",  one  who  possesses  the  versatility  to

perform  any  task  required of him  or  her  because  of

changing   conditions.   The  master-of-all-trades,   the

superworker,  may not materialise, but a generalist  with

some value-added expertise to offer is very possible,  if

only   the  worker  would  change  his  attitude  towards

learning. Hence, to the workers, I would say the  biggest

opportunity  probably lies under their own  feet,  be  it

their  current job, industry they are in, their education

or experience.  So, do something about it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that economic evolution is inevitable.

Companies  will always pursue the lowest cost  structure,

because of the tide of globalisation, because competition

has  suddenly become tougher and cutting cost becomes the

only way to survive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, you may say that the superworker, which I

mentioned earlier, is ideal but not realistic.  The point

is,  the  worker needs to understand that  jobs  are  not

"safe"  any  more, even skilled jobs of the  white-collar

type,  as highlighted by the other Members earlier,  once

considered safe are not safe any more.  Thus, our workers

need to recognise that the careers that they studied  for

may not be able to maintain them throughout their working

lives,  because someone in India or China may be able  to

perform the same thing for a lot cheaper.  Those who have

spent  years  establishing themselves and  their  careers

would have reached a comfort level and cannot imagine how

all of that can now be at risk.  Well, let me remind them

that it can  -  all in the name of cost-cutting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restructuring or Remaking, the message being sent

out  is clear: the people need to change before it is too

late.  By

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2557</b></font><br><br>



that,   I  mean  the  employer,  the  employee  and   the

establishment.   We  need  to  have  a  broadly  educated

workforce that keeps on learning.  With the establishment

of   the  Singapore  Workforce  Development  Agency,  the

Government  has institutionalised life-long learning  for

the workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It represents an earnest and proactive effort by the

authorities  to  help the people and the  economy  become

more  resilient and increase the possibility of life-time

employability.  However, I hope the Agency will not  make

its  operations a labyrinth of rules and regulations that

it becomes a hurdle rather than a door for the workers to

enter  and  realise their ambitions.  The  Agency  should

judge  its success not by the monies it has amassed  from

fees, grants and donors, but by the number of workers  it

has reached out to and assisted them in their retraining.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is probably appropriate also to remind employers

that  they should not see the birth of the Agency as  the

beginning  of the end of their role in employee  training

programme. We know of many workers who have gone  further

up  the career ladder than they thought they could.  Why?

For some, it is because they know their own potential and

they  develop it.  But for others, it is because  someone

else,  often  the employer, thought that  they  have  the

potential  to  go higher and gave them the  training  and

support.    This  is  where  employers,  human   resource

professionals,  should continue to  look  out  for  these

people, and render them the support and encouragement  to

upgrade their skills and knowledge to enable them to move

ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers should also shift their thinking and be

more  magnanimous towards training and  upgrading.   With

the  opening of new opportunities as Singapore  undergoes

economic  restructuring, employers should be  sympathetic

towards  workers  who seek training in  an  area  perhaps

quite  unrelated to their field of work.  Employers  must

overcome any selfish thoughts of denying the workers  the

training for fear of losing them in the months ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that there are people who have undergone one

form of training in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2558</b></font><br><br>



the  past, trudging to change career path midway  through

life, holding the view that he has perhaps gone down  the

wrong  road.   I feel that if someone is going  down  the

wrong road, then he does not need motivation to speed up.

What  he  needs  is education and training  to  turn  him

around to the lane where he will excel and thus become  a

multi-disciplined worker.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I urge the Agency, the workers and

employers  alike  to please take full advantage  of  this

opportunity, as a platform for everyone to move in tandem

with  the Government's role to remake and take our nation

to a new era of economic development and growth.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Madam, I rise in

support  of  the  Singapore Workforce Development  Agency

Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every parliamentary sitting in the last year and

a  half  or  so,  we  hear  Members'  concern  about  the

unemployment   conditions   facing   Singaporeans.    The

unemployment rate has been creeping up steadily from 2.4%

in  March  2001 to 4.5% in March this year, and   we  are

told that it may still go up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various schemes have been put in place - from the

financial  assistance programmes for  those  affected  by

retrenchments   and   unemployment  to   the   employment

assistance   programmes  like  the  Skills  Redevelopment

Programme   (SRP)  and  the  People-for-Jobs  Traineeship

Programme  (PJTP).  We have also heard  the  Ministry  of

Manpower  giving  figures of how many  Singaporeans  have

benefited from these programmes.  But the reality remains

-    75,000   or  more  Singapore  residents  are   still

unemployed,  with one-third remaining unemployed  for  at

least  six  months.  We have seen the impact of prolonged

unemployment  on  their self-esteem and on  their  family

members  -  most importantly, on their survival and their

ability to meet basic needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes the setting up of an Agency that

will  consolidate the efforts targeted  at  ensuring  the

Singapore resident workforce is competitive in the global

market.  The Agency also aims to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2559</b></font><br><br>



ensure that Singaporeans remain employable for as long as

they  are  able  to. This is important at  a  time  where

streamlining  and retrenchments seem to be the  order  of

the day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spirit of streamlining and consolidation, the

proposed Agency brings together several divisions of  MOM

and  other  related secretariats.  It is hoped that  this

will  further  enhance  our  efforts  at  addressing  the

employment  and  unemployment issues comprehensively  for

the whole must be bigger than the sum of its parts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the issues we are facing, and thus facing the

WDA, go beyond helping Singaporeans remain employable and

competitive.    No  one  wants  to  be  nor   to   remain

unemployed.  The social support system that is  currently

in  place is not a disincentive to work.  It is sometimes

confusing  when we read in media reports that  there  are

jobs  out  there but there are no takers, ie, the  common

complaint  that Singaporeans are choosy and fussy.   Such

attitude  is  apparently changing and it is certainly  an

encouraging sign.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the fundamental issue today is that there

are  just  not  enough  jobs to go  around.   The  Acting

Minister  tried very hard yesterday to explain  that  the

fundamental issue is to bring the jobs back to Singapore.

MOM's labour market report for the first quarter of  2003

showed that as at March this year, there were only 24 job

vacancies  for  every  100  unemployed  persons.   If  we

exclude the construction industry, the ratio was 21  jobs

for  every 100 unemployed persons.  I hope the figures  I

am  citing are correct for they are obtained from the MOM

website, and I hope I am interpreting them correctly too.

The  reality today is "jobs no enough".  So no amount  of

changing  attitude towards jobs is going to help  if  the

jobs are just not available.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Madam, WDA should seriously look at

self-employment as an option for the unemployed.  We know

that the Self Employment Training Programme, or SET,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2560</b></font><br><br>



has  been introduced to help entrepreneurial Singaporeans

in  self-employment, creating jobs for themselves and for

others  in  the  process.   The  programme  is  currently

managed  by  SNEF and I think WDA should further  enhance

the   outreach  of  this  programme  to  more  unemployed

Singaporeans.  In this regard, I would like  to  ask  the

Minister  how successful has the programme  been  so  far

since  its  launch and what further support is needed  by

the budding entrepreneurs to facilitate their efforts  at

starting  up  a  business.  Will WDA look into  enhancing

this  programme  by  meeting the  other  needs  of  these

budding  entrepreneurs?  WDA should also look at  setting

up  a  one-stop information and consultancy service where

these   budding  entrepreneurs  can  seek  the  necessary

assistance.  For example, the unemployed who  intends  to

start   a   small   business  may  need   assistance   in

participating in a simple tendering process.  WDA  should

also continually monitor and review governmental policies

and  procedures that inhibit the process  of  setting  up

small businesses here - the "No Fishing" sign highlighted

by Dr Jennifer Lee earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, in the last year or so, I have

lost  count  of  the number of times  I  have  spoken  to

residents   about   the  importance   of   training   and

retraining.  It has been a cliche, somewhat.  I  find  it

hard  to  believe that while 80,000 people have benefited

from   the  SRP,  we  still  have  thousands  who  remain

unemployed.  It is not clear the proportion of those  who

have  undergone SRP through surrogate employers like NTUC

and  the  other  self-help groups.  But official  figures

show very few participate in SRP through their employers.

What  is clear is that I have heard repeatedly the lament

of  many  residents about having gone for training  under

the  SRP but not able to secure jobs after that.  To such

individuals,  prolonged unemployment,  despite  conscious

effort to train, retrain and seek jobs, will affect their

sense of self-esteem and hope immensely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I think one weakness in the present provision

for training assistance is the catch-all, rigid structure

of the training and retraining programmes.  Training

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2561</b></font><br><br>



programmes are developed by the authorities, MOM,  SPRING

and  NTUC and while they design these programmes with the

requirements of the concerned industry in mind, they  may

not   be   fully   in  sync  with  the  latest   industry

requirement.   This is reflected in the Employer  Support

Training  2001 Survey conducted by MOM.  It was  reported

that  only  16% of the employers who sent their employees

for  training,  sent them under the  SRP.   It  was  also

reported  that 48% of employers who sent their  employees

for  training and another half of those who did not  send

their employees for training, gave the irrelevance of the

training as the reason for not utilising the SRP.   Thus,

whether  they  send the employees for  training  or  not,

almost half find the training programmes not relevant  to

their operations.  This, despite the SRP supporting  more

than  1,300  course  modules in  more  than  30  industry

sectors!  Are we barking at the wrong tree?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, staying abreast of new industrial trends is

important  as  most industries nowadays  face  a  shorter

shelf-life of skills, hence relevant skills at a  certain

point  of  time  may  quickly become obsolete.   Training

programmes  that  reflect  and address  the  varying  and

constantly  changing  demands  of  industries  are   thus

necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several examples in the region that we can

study  and  perhaps emulate in this regard.  Hong  Kong's

Employee  Retraining Board's "Tailor-Made Programme"  and

Australia's  "New Apprenticeship" programme are  examples

we  can  look at to better tailor training programmes  to

suit   industries'   needs.   Hong   Kong's   Tailor-Made

Programme   consists  of  ERB  and  the   training   body

collaborating  to  develop a training scheme  that  would

equip  trainees with the exact skills most vital  to  the

survival  and competitiveness of the industry.  The  "New

Apprenticeship" programme in Australia employed a similar

approach  as  there  is  close  partnership  between  the

training  bodies, the employers and employees  to  ensure

the  relevance  of the training programmes  and  for  all

three parties.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2562</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, another aspect of training and

retraining  that the new Agency needs to address  is  the

extent to which the workforce and the industry are  aware

of  these  training and support programmes.   In  another

MOM's  study  titled  "Adult Re-training  2000",  it  was

reported  that only 33% of those surveyed  had  gone  for

training.   Amongst these, only 12.5% reported  utilising

funding  from  the Government, primarily the  SDF.   More

than  one  third  had self-funded their  training,  while

close  to  60% had received partial or full support  from

their  employers.  The perception, perhaps, is  that  one

has to find one's own funds to be trained or retrained  - thus  the lower rate of participation in training due  to

lack  of  personal  funds.  This  lack  of  awareness  of

support  programmes seems prevalent among  the  employers

too,  with more than one third reporting not being  aware

of the SRP, as reported in the 2001 survey on employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, this is going to be the umpteenth time I am

going  to  call  on  employers to do their  part  in  the

training  and  employment  equation.   The  MOM's  survey

highlighted  that only 22% of the firms  surveyed  had  a

formal  training  policy.  There is a strong  association

between  having  a  formal training  policy  and  sending

employees for training.  I urge WDA to work closely  with

the  employers  and formulate some clear  guidelines  for

employers to have such policies.  Such guidelines  should

also  ensure  the  minimum period of  continual  training

employees  should be entitled to in a  given  year.   The

work place must provide the environment that promotes the

value  of  lifelong learning to ensure that  the  workers

consequently internalise these values.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, whenever a new agency or body is set up, much

hype  and  hope  often surround it.  Discussions  revolve

around stretching its potential and maximising its reach.

We  must  ensure  that this new agency lives  up  to  its

mission  of  being a catalyst for the workforce  and  not

just another bureaucratic set-up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, related to this issue is the current lack of

a  comprehensive  and complete database for  storing  job

seeker's

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2563</b></font><br><br>



information.   The  database  at  CareerLink   does   not

comprehensively  track  the  history  of  employment  and

training   offered  to  a  job  seeker   with   essential

information like detailed information of the courses  the

job  seeker had attended, the personality profile or  his

level of employability.  This results in difficulties  in

profiling  the  job seeker.  Without detailed  profiling,

emplacement will be harder as the placement officer  will

not  be able to attain a good job match and placement due

to  the lack of information.  I urge WDA to address  this

gap in the system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Agency will enhance the existing

system  of assisting our unemployed workers.  This system

must  assist  the  workers  overcome  their  barriers  to

securing employment.  It must ensure that programmes  and

services  are accessible.  It is not sufficient to  match

the qualification and experience of the job seeker to the

available jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need for more qualified job counsellors

to  provide a more comprehensive and systemic approach in

helping the job seeker be placed in a job.  There must be

a  thorough assessment process that will provide a better

picture of the needs of the job seeker.  Indeed, the  job

counsellors  must  not  just facilitate  but  attempt  to

ensure  that  the job seeker overcomes whatever  barriers

that are in his way of getting a job.  In this regard, we

can  study  the  examples  of Hong  Kong's  Job  Matching

Programme  and the UK's New Deal programme in  which  job

search  support  follows up and monitors a  job  seeker's

progress till emplacement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, these barriers go beyond the need to improve

the  individual's skills set.  That can  be  overcome  by

ensuring that he gets the necessary training.  There  are

also  other  real  barriers that  arise  from  the  costs

associated  with  job  search.   Transportation  for  job

interviews,   work  clothes,  interpersonal   skills   in

presenting oneself at job interviews are real barriers to

the  man  in the street seeking employment.  The barriers

are heightened with increasing period of unemployment,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2564</b></font><br><br>



with  his  self-esteem lowered and sense of  helplessness

and frustration raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often times, his financial obligation to his

dependants  forms the bulk of his thought process  as  he

considers  what job to take.  The Agency must  work  with

the  relevant  social support agencies in assisting  such

individuals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, it is easy for us to tell the people to

tighten  their  belts,  spend  less,  do  not  use  their

airconditioning,  do not allow their  children  to  watch

television  too much, and take whatever job  that  comes.

The latter is a perennial problem encountered by many  of

us  who  meet them - they are not willing to take up  the

job  that is offered because sometimes it is hard to live

on  an  income of $1,000 or less as a cleaner, having  to

support  a  wife and four school-going children.   Having

been unemployed for some time, the arrears to some of the

household  expenditure  would already  have  accumulated,

making the financial hardship more acute.  These are real

issues  faced by the unemployed.  The WDA must  recognise

these   issues   and  make  available  a  more   systemic

assessment of the needs of the unemployed for  it  to  be

effective.  It must work closely with the CDCs and  other

social   service   providers.    Today,   the   financial

assistance schemes are pegged to the person's  effort  at

seeking  employment.   It must  go  beyond  that.   Given

severe  shortage of jobs available, and to encourage  the

unemployed  "not  to  be  choosy",  financial  assistance

programme should address the shortage of the funds needed

by the family to continue its functioning, even after the

unemployed head of household accepts a job offer that may

pay  lower than his previous salary.  These are the  jobs

that  the  foreigners come here to do.  We can  encourage

Singaporeans to take up these jobs.  Yes, it is  what  is

left on the buffet table as the Acting Minister suggested

yesterday.  Yes, it may still be nutritious, but  it  may

not be enough for him to ta pau (pack) back and place  on

the dinner table for his family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, today financial assistance is generally

stopped  once  the  person  is gainfully  employed.   The

assistance for such

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2565</b></font><br><br>



individuals  must be provided based on the needs  of  the

family.   There  is thus a need for closer  collaboration

between WDA and the CDCs and others in the social service

sector  in this regard.  Otherwise, WDA will have a  hard

time  understanding  why the unemployed  individuals  are

unwilling  to accept a particular job offer -  ending  up

labelling them as unmotivated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Madam, we have and are still going

through  a  very  difficult patch in our country's  life.

Singaporeans  are  struggling to make  ends  meet.   Even

those who have jobs are struggling with pay cuts and  the

threats  of  retrenchment.  The setting  up  of  the  WDA

provides  a  ray of hope - with a more comprehensive  and

systematic effort at making our workers more world-ready.

We  have  asked  much  of  the people.   They  have  been

swallowing  pills after pills, no matter how bitter.   We

must  understand and empathise with their  position.   We

must  provide an infrastructure that enhances their sense

of  competence  in  managing the challenging  environment

through this comprehensive programme of giving them  jobs

and   assistance  wherever  necessary.   They  must  feel

mastery over their destiny.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is thus imperative that the WDA work closely with

the   social   support  agencies  in  setting   up   this

comprehensive   system  that  will   achieve   the   dual

objectives  of ensuring the unemployed Singaporeans  take

up the jobs and still be able to support their families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we may teach them how to fish and they may

try hard to fish, but let us help them when the season is

bad  and there is very little fish to catch for that  day

and  what  they  catch is not sufficient  to  feed  their

children.  It will give them the sense that life can  and

should  go  on,  and that tomorrow may be brighter,  with

more fish to catch.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mdm

Deputy   Speaker,  we  are  facing  the   challenges   of

globalisation.  There are two options open to us.  First,

we can be an ostrich and bury our head in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2566</b></font><br><br>



sand,  with the hope that when we take our head out  from

the  sand,  everything will be back to normal.   Then  we

will be able to become an ostrich again.  The next option

is  to become the legendary phoenix.  Legend has it  that

the  phoenix jumped into the fire, and after the  baptism

of  fire, it became born-again and re-emerged a glamorous

and  dynamic "fire phoenix". Our choice is very  obvious.

We  want  to  be  a  phoenix.  But why?   We  often  hear

Singaporeans complain about their unwillingness to take a

more difficult choice or embark on a more difficult task.

Yes, no doubt, it is difficult to make hard decisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setting up of the Workforce Development Agency

(WDA)  now  is very timely. This will help our  workforce

make  the difficult but correct choice, thereby be a part

of  our transformation to the new economy, and face   new

economic   challenges   associated  with   globalisation.

However,  helping  our workforce to make  the  choice  of

transformation is never easy. First of all, the WDA  must

produce results to prove to our workforce and our workers

here,  to  persuade them that transformation is  possible

and  restructuring is inevitable.  This is  something  we

have  to do, because this is the only way to ensure  that

our   workforce   has  its  heart  in   Singapore.    All

Singaporeans  will be able to continue to have  jobs  and

enjoy  a  good standard of living.  That is the only  way

out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To change the attitude of the older workers and

persuade  them to embrace lifelong learning  is  quite  a

difficult job.  But this is something we must do, whether

we  like it or not.  WDA is established with this  target

in mind to convince Singaporeans to re-visit the offer of

jobs  and  the opportunity of retraining and  re-skilling

which  they have previously declined.  However,  the  WDA

must first show some results through some real action  to

be  convincing. Only then, can they succeed  in  changing

the mindset of the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the WDA should have a correct focus on our

employment   situation.   To  forecast  on   the   future

employment scenario is very difficult.  As the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2567</b></font><br><br>



Minister has said, we have to cooperate with the EDB  and

other  Government  agencies  to  touch  ground  with  the

various  industries, so that we know their needs and  the

development trends in the various industries. Only  then,

can  we develop programmes to train our workers and equip

them  with  the  appropriate skills to  meet  the  future

challenges.   Otherwise, the training would be  in  vain.

For  example, if we manage to convince the workers to  be

trained  in   biochemistry which was thought  to  be  the

industry with great potential, and suddenly we find  that

this  industry  is not taking off, all the sacrifices  by

the  workers and resources invested therein  will  be  in

vain. What is going to happen to the poor workers who are

now armed with irrelevant skills and no jobs?   This will

then  give  rise  to  yet  another  round  of  structural

unemployment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that the WDA should strive to

provide a one-stop service for all our workers.   At  the

moment, if Singapore workers want to learn, upgrade their

skills or acquire new skills, they do not know whether to

go  to NTUC, SHRI, MOM, SPRING, IDA, or CDC. There are so

many  agencies  to  go to before they  can  identify  the

courses suitable to them. When they go to a website  they

look  at the SRP, OJT, PJTP, SMC and what have you, there

is  a  whole  string  of acronyms.   There  are  so  many

different   training  schemes.   They  are  puzzled   and

confused.   As such, WDA must provide a one-stop  service

which  is user-friendly. There should be specialists  who

are  able to understand the market requirements and would

be  able to help the workers with proper counselling  and

advice,  and  match  them  with the  jobs  available  and

suitable to them. Arrangement should also be made to keep

a  register of those who are looking for a job, with  all

the  particulars fed into a database. Only then, will  it

be  encouraging  for the workers to accept  training  and

embrace the culture of lifelong learning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I believe that most Singaporeans want to

become phoenixes.  WDA is the agency that will help  them

become phoenixes.  I firmly believe that so long

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2568</b></font><br><br>



as we have confidence in this transformation, despite the

difficulties and frustrations, we will be able to  remake

Singapore,  and our workforce will become  even  stronger

and  more competitive, to justify our ranking as a world-class workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Dr Gan See Khem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Gan See Khem (Nominated Member):</b> Madam, when I

first  read  the  name of the new Agency,  which  is  the

Singapore  Workforce  Development Agency,  I  thought  it

smacks   a   little   bit  of  the  1960s.    But   after

deliberations in this House earlier and when  the  Acting

Minister for Manpower ensured the House that this  Agency

will  be devoted to the mission of developing Singapore's

human  capital and add value to our workforce, I am  much

heartened, and I fully support this Bill with  no  change

of  name because I think a rose with any name is just  as

sweet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human capital, without doubt, is the most valuable

human  resource we have in Singapore and WDA is entrusted

with  the  role  of enhancing the value of  our  national

wealth.   We  very  much support that  from  the  private

sector.   There  are discussions from yesterday  and  the

whole  of  today where many of us lament on the  loss  of

jobs  in  Singapore.  This is a mega trend affecting  not

only Singapore but in the US and there is little that  we

can  do  as a nation and we have to look at the  positive

side  on  how  to  increase  the  employability  of   our

workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we really do not want to see, after the

formation of WDA, is a society in Singapore where we  are

chasing papers.  We could get more training, we could get

more  certificates, but it would be very dampening if  it

does  not  result in the outcome which we want, which  is

continual  employability.  In order to do what  WDA  sets

out  to do, which is to enhance our human capital and get

them  employed, I think we need to change  not  only  the

mindset  on the part of the WDA, in terms of its mission,

but also on the part of our local talent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues have earlier spoken widely about the

training and retraining of women, the blue collar as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2569</b></font><br><br>



well  as the elderly.  I would just want to spend  a  few

minutes  talking about the white collar.  The first  wave

of  unemployment that has hit the US was the loss of jobs

for  the  blue  collar, which is what we  have  faced  in

Singapore.  The next wave of job losses in the US is  the

loss of jobs for the white collar and something which  is

on  the horizon for the Singapore workforce.  So I  would

like  to  spend a few minutes talking about  the  mindset

changes that we need to make for the local talent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw in the papers recently that many young

graduates  are  still not employed.  Many  graduates  and

professionals are finding it difficult to get jobs, and I

have   seen   over   a  hundred  Bachelor   of   Business

Administration and MBA programmes in the market.   People

are  being  upgraded and they are getting  educated,  but

they  still  cannot find jobs.  How do  we  address  this

issue?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major part of the change in the mindset of the

graduates  and the professional workforce  is  that  they

must  realise  that jobs now do not move  on  a  vertical

path, meaning that you do not get a job because you  have

a  certain  degree  or qualification and  you  expect  to

progressively move up the organisational structure.   The

professional  workforce must realise that  they  have  to

develop distinct competencies other than the degrees  and

being  able to work in project groups because the careers

of the future actually move along a horizontal bend where

the  professionals group together looking  for  projects,

they  succeed  in  the  projects,  make  themselves  more

marketable,  and  they can get on to  bigger  and  better

projects, thereby enhancing their employability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a scenario of the future, very much like in

the  movie-making business.  Nobody employs all the movie

stars, all the technicians, all the crew members all  the

time.  The studios cannot afford to do that.  Every  time

a new movie is being contemplated, a cast is put together

and that cast works together for 10 months, 24 months, it

needs to make the movie, the cast disbands and moves  on.

I think

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2570</b></font><br><br>



the  opportunity for the white collar of  the  future  is

very much going to be project-based.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue is that whilst we are talking about

enhancing the employability of our local talent, we  also

must  be mindful that, whilst the Government and the  EDB

are  trying  to  bring jobs to Singapore  by  encouraging

investment  in  Singapore, this is not going  to  be  the

easiest  route.   So  I  hope WDA would  also  look  into

training  our  Singapore  talent  for  the  regional  and

international markets.  Singaporeans must feel that  they

have  that distinct competency, the skills, the knowledge

set  that  they  can go out of Singapore  to  find  jobs,

develop even more skills and experiences and come back to

Singapore,  thereby enriching our Singapore  talent  pool

with  more  depth  and  breadth.   So  that  would  be  a

challenge  our  local talent needs to develop.   And  for

those of our local professionals and white collar who are

still  employed, they must continue to enrich  themselves

and  think  about  re-engineering themselves  and  adding

value   to  the  workplace.   Very  few  companies  would

retrench  a  staff who can continuously bring new  value,

ideas  and  new markets to the company.  And one  of  the

best  ways of avoiding retrenchment is to make sure  that

you are not obsolete.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of WDA, I have no doubt, would be much more

efficient  than  what  we  have now,  which  is  multiple

agencies  working in collaboration for the same  outcome.

The problem-solving abilities of the management team that

WDA has put together, I have no doubt that it would be  a

very capable team.  But in today's competitive world,  it

is  not  enough to be just efficient.  I would hope  that

the  team  at WDA will not be happy by asking themselves:

are  we doing things right?  Because in this day and age,

doing  things right, you can still go very  wrong.   What

the  team should be looking at is asking themselves:  are

we   doing   the  right  thing?   Because  the   business

environment changes tremendously and fast these days.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The WDA team, we hope, would develop a much more

conceptual and strategic

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2571</b></font><br><br>



thinking  mindset  and  always  asking  not  only   about

efficiency,  but what other values that we can  bring  to

enhance  the  value  of our human capital  in  Singapore.

Because  we need to look at employability, not  only  for

the  current industries, current jobs, but also for newer

challenges and future jobs.  We hope that the team  would

scan  the  environment regionally and internationally  to

find   new   niches  and  to  study  these   new   market

opportunities and study their feasibilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have read, and my colleagues have mentioned

earlier,  that in the US nowadays, white-collar jobs  are

moving  offshore.   They are moving to India  and  China.

Whilst  our wages may not be as competitive or as low  as

in  China  and India, I think Singapore and the Singapore

brand  of professionals do carry a premium value.  So,  I

would  urge SWDA to consider a study into the possibility

of  forming large manpower firms.  If jobs are not coming

to  Singapore, we have to go out and find  the  jobs  for

Singaporeans.  Can we form these big manpower  firms,  go

to  the  US  and compete for the outsourcing  of  certain

business functions that the US firms now want to contract

out  because the cost of conducting these services in the

US is too expensive?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier on, we have known that US firms and banks

are  sending  out  all  the backroom  operations  in  the

banking  industry to India.  Cost centres have  now  been

set up in India and the Philippines.  The next wave would

be the outsourcing of specific HR, finance and accounting

functions.  There are opportunities and we should look at

the  setting up of these manpower firms that will compete

with   Chinese  and  Indian  counterparts   to   be   the

outsourcing   centres  for  some  of   these   functions.

Singapore  has  a terrific brand name, our  professionals

are  recognised worldwide for their competencies,  and  I

can  envisage  that, if we try to develop these  manpower

firms,  we  can  successfully compete for,  for  example,

accountancy services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Singapore's cost will still be higher than

those in India and China, but if we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2572</b></font><br><br>



are  able to produce superior customer service, companies

in  the  US  may  be willing to pay a 15-20%  premium  to

outsource the services to Singapore companies rather than

the ones in India or China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SWDA has put together a very long list of things

that it wants to do, and whilst I appreciate the ambition

of  SWDA  to be a one-stop shop to satisfy the  training,

job matching and employment-seeking activities in today's

difficult environment, I would like to urge SWDA to focus

on  policy  issues  and on looking  for  new  niches  and

opportunities,  and to work with the  private  sector  in

fulfilling some of these needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mdm Deputy

Speaker, I rise in support of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formation of the Singapore Workforce Development

Agency  is  indeed  timely as Singapore restructures  its

economy  to  cope  with globalisation.   With  increasing

competition,  there is an urgent need  for  Singapore  to

develop  new  niches in its only key strategic  resource,

ie,  human  resource.  The formation  of  the  SWDA  will

provide a one-stop agency to help Singaporeans to develop

their skills to enhance their employability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The integration of the Skills Development Fund,

Critical  Enabling Skills Training (CREST)  and  National

Skills Recognition System (NSRS) as proposed by the Bill,

will   further   facilitate  skills   development   among

Singaporeans.  The Agency will have more flexibility  and

be  able  to respond much faster to global market changes

which  affect  our  economy and our  workforce.   In  the

global  economy,  speed of change is of  the  essence  to

maintain  competitive  advantage  and  increase  business

profitability.   In  Singapore, we  have  to  continually

strive to keep our business cost competitive and, at  the

same time, focus our efforts to enhance the value of  our

human capital.  Otherwise, our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2573</b></font><br><br>



workers  will not be able to command a reasonable  salary

to sustain a good quality of life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, Singapore is faced with an aging workforce

and  increased  competition  from  many  countries.    To

sustain  its long-term economic growth, we must  identify

niche  areas  in  both our local market  and  the  global

market.  As identified by the Government, we will develop

the  manufacturing and services industries  as  the  twin

engines  for  our economic growth.  But  is  our  present

workforce ready to support and drive these two industries

to world-class standards?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the experience of the Community Development

Councils  in job assistance services, we find  that  many

job seekers, especially those aged 45 years and above, do

not  have the relevant skills or appropriate mindset  for

many  jobs  in the manufacturing and services industries.

This  is a real concern.  Employers also find these older

workers to be slow in learning and some are unwilling  to

work in certain work environments, such as shift work  or

clean  rooms.   This situation will worsen  if  companies

continue to improve their business operations with higher

technology, and our older workers remain slow in learning

the  relevant skills.  At present, we are faced with such

skills and mindset mismatch problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With rapid globalisation, industries and companies

will change more rapidly in the future.  Our workers will

face  structural unemployment more frequently, if  we  do

not   plan   the  skills  development  of  our  workforce

properly.   Therefore, we need to adopt  a  flexible  and

sustainable approach towards developing our human capital

in  Singapore.  We must develop a quality workforce which

is  of  world-class standard.  The desired outcome  of  a

world-class  workforce should be one  that  is  diligent,

positive  and  flexible.   Our workforce  must  have  the

ability to respond quickly to the changing needs  of  the

marketplace.  With an agile workforce, we will be able to

seize more opportunities in the global economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, how do we enhance the employability of

Singaporeans?  We need

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2574</b></font><br><br>



to  adopt three different strategies for three categories

of adult learners/workers, namely:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The employed, ie, the existing workers;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) The unemployed job seekers; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) The potential entrants to our workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be effective, we must understand the needs and

aspirations of these three groups of adult learners.   At

the  same  time, we must help them overcome  the  various

constraints  they  face  and  facilitate  their  learning

processes.   I would like to suggest three strategies  in

training and nurturing a world-class workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Place and Train schemes for unemployed job

seekers.  We should place more emphasis to encourage more

companies to adopt Place and Train schemes, such  as  the

People-on-the-Job Traineeship scheme (PJTP).   This  will

help  our  unemployed  job  seekers  to  return  to   the

workforce as quickly as possible.  I understand that more

than  5,000  firms have participated in the PJTP  scheme,

benefiting  over  12,000 Singaporeans.   We  can  further

expand  this  scheme  to  all  strategic  industries   to

encourage more Singaporeans to upgrade their skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More support and incentives should be given to firms

which  are  providing on-the-job training.  Such  schemes

will  provide  better opportunities for  job  seekers  to

learn  new  skills faster and apply them  immediately  in

their  respective  jobs.  It will  also  enable  the  job

seekers  to  earn  an  income  while  undergoing   skills

training.  This will provide better incentives  for  them

to   make   changes  and  adjustments   in   their   work

environment.  Besides providing incentives for firms,  we

should  also  render support to job seekers who  take  up

Place  and Train jobs.  I would like to propose giving  a

special   or   start-up  allowance  to   encourage   more

Singaporeans  to  join  those strategic  industries  with

Place and Train schemes.  In addition, the Government can

support   firms   to   recognise   their   long   service

contribution of their workers

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2575</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Continuing Skills Development for the

employed,  ie,  existing  workers.   In  order  to  avoid

structural unemployment, we need to develop a passion for

lifelong learning among our workers.  Both employers  and

employees  must constantly identify new skills to  learn,

so  as to keep pace with developments in their respective

industries.   Continuing  skills  development  should  be

encouraged  among  workers so as to  keep  our  workforce

equipped  with  the relevant skills for  competition  and

employability  purposes.  But, how do we  facilitate  the

continuing  skills development efforts  of  our  workers?

And how can we incentivise employers to continually train

and upgrade the skills of their employees?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we need to allow more flexibility for workers

to  learn new skills, both within and outside their  work

environment.  One key motivation of any adult learner  is

the recognition of the skills they learn.  We must review

our  National  Skills Recognition System to increase  its

acceptance  among employers.  At the same time,  we  must

also  have better quality control of the training service

providers  and  the respective testing bodies  to  ensure

that high standards are attained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies must also make efforts to adopt best

practices and document their work processes to facilitate

training  and  retraining of their staff.   In  addition,

they  should be encouraged to continually redesign  their

work  processes  so as to enhance the value  of  work  of

their workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, self-learning for potential entrants to

workforce.   To be a world-class workforce,  we  need  to

widen  the scope of learning of our workforce, especially

new entrants to the industry.  Lateral thinking, creative

learning  and various self-improvement skills  should  be

introduced to adult learners more comprehensively.  These

learning  opportunities  must be  readily  available  and

flexible enough to allow adult learners to seize.   Faced

with various constraints, such as work and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2576</b></font><br><br>



family commitments, adult learners often cannot find time

to  self-learn new skills or knowledge.  There is a  need

to  set up a network of physical and virtual training  or

learning  institutions.  The use of IT  will  provide  an

excellent  platform for self-learning.  More  interactive

on-line  learning  should  be introduced  so  that  adult

learners can expand their knowledge and expertise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we must provide more opportunities for our

workers  to  learn  creative and self-improvement  skills

early,  especially  when they are  young  and  energetic.

This will enable them to apply these skills in their work

earlier  and gain more experience to add value  to  their

companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I support the Bill, and I hope that

the  Singapore Workforce Development Agency will  provide

an  integrated solution to nurture the development of our

human resource.

<br><br><!-- Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin (Nominated Member):</b> Mdm

Deputy  Speaker, I will make this speech as  short  as  I

can.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I support the SWDA Bill, and I believe that

it  will  allow better focus to be placed on training  of

our workforce so that they remain relevant.  As an Agency

solely dedicated to oversee the welfare of our workforce,

it  will definitely be in a better position to facilitate

employment   and  implement  measures  to   protect   the

interests of Singaporeans, both in terms of employment as

well as business sustainability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over yesterday's session, we had heard many Members

voice concerns that foreigners are taking away jobs  from

the  locals.   However, I would like to  present  another

view, ie, the view as seen from the business sector.   In

this  regard, I would like to quote the example of  local

textile  companies.  I know that this  is  an  unpleasant

taboo  subject, but I feel the need to speak up on  their

behalf because they do play a part in our economy as well

as provide employment opportunities.

In  Singapore, the textile industry is viewed as a sunset

industry.  It is not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2577</b></font><br><br>



glamorous,  and  certainly not  hip.   Most  Singaporeans

would not want to work in such companies.  However,  some

of  these  firms are profitable, and whatever  employment

policy  we  implement, we should make an effort  to  make

sure  that such companies stay afloat.  I personally know

of  one  local  textile company which employs  about  900

workers.  Of these, 600 are locals and the remaining  300

are  Malaysians.  This  company  has  been  operating  in

Singapore  for more than 20 years now. Many of these  600

local workers have been with the firm for a long time now

and  most  are  close to retirement.  When these  workers

retire, younger ones need to be recruited. This is  where

the  firm  has  been facing an uphill task in  recruiting

locals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss told me that when they tried to employ

those  retrenched  workers from the  hi-tech  industries,

such   as   the  electronics  industry,  many  were   not

interested to join them and often, the reason  cited  was

that  these Singaporeans felt that working in  a  textile

company is just not the "in" thing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was told that their workers earn wages ranging

from  $1,500  to  $3,000 a month per  worker,  with  8-10

working hours per day on the average.  They are facing  a

major  problem in recruiting workers, while they continue

to  receive  good  orders from the USA and  Europe.  This

company is earning money from overseas and bringing  this

money back to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To remain competitive and maintain profitability,

they  need a minimum workforce. Unfortunately,  over  the

past  few years, the number of workers employed here  has

fallen  from  1,200  to  900  due  to  an  ageing   local

workforce.   The alternative is for the firm to  wrap  up

here  and move elsewhere totally.  However, the boss  has

not  pulled out altogether, because he is considerate for

his  long-time local employees and he knows that once  he

closes down his factory here, these 600 workers would  be

out  of  job.   Hence,  while  he  expands  his  business

overseas,  he  hopes to continue to operate  his  factory

here for as long as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One may think that such companies belong to the

sunset industry, but we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2578</b></font><br><br>



must recognise that they do play a role here in providing

employment,  as  well  as inject into  the  economy.  For

example,  the company ships all their textiles  overseas.

Hence, they need transportation and shipping companies to

handle  their  goods. This creates business opportunities

for  these associated business partners and, in turn,  it

also provides employment opportunities. In addition,  the

annual  revenue is more than S$100 million.   Thus,  they

also,   for  example,  provide  good  business  for   the

financial sector.  I would like to know how WDA can  help

such companies in their workforce problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the WDA would not only focus on the

interests of the local workers and partnership with  MNCs

and  services industries, but also consider the  business

interest  of some local SME companies, such as this.   If

we do not take care of this type of business, there is no

employment  to  talk  about in the first  place  and  the

continuing retraining effort would be irrelevant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often, my friends in the private sector complain

that the Singapore Government is overly-protective of the

Singapore  workers  and  hence,  we  have  cultivated   a

population  that  is picky and spoilt when  it  comes  to

working conditions and environment.  I hope that the  WDA

would  seek inputs from the private sector when it  comes

to  recommending policies that would affect not just  the

Singapore workforce, but also the business sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also hope that WDA would put some of these old

industries in their radar screen.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, as Members have

been asked to be brief, I should try to be equally brief.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am deeply heartened by the overwhelming positive

response  from  the many Members who have supported  this

Bill.   I think we have all agreed that we need a central

coordinating  body  such  as  the  Workforce  Development

Agency.  I  have been heartened by Members' comments  and

positive  response.   In fact, I was  keeping  a  running

commentary of the adjectives on the Workforce Development

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2579</b></font><br><br>



Agency.  Adjectives  have been used - timely,  necessary,

better  focus  for  training, unqualified  support,  much

heartened.  We have been called "a breath of fresh  air",

"a  ray  of  hope", "a rose", except one,  when  we  were

called  "a  spade".  To Mr Chiam, the WDA does  not  mind

being  a  spade if it helps him to dig a hole  in  Potong

Pasir.   We  would be a spade to help his  residents  get

jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been many suggestions, too many. In

fact,  I  think  my staff downstairs are  now  scratching

their  heads and going crazy and saying, "My golly!  What

have  we  gotten ourselves into?"  We would have to  take

time to take all these numerous suggestions, look at them

seriously,  compartmentalise them,  priortise  them,  and

decide what we can do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like just to spend a few minutes explaining

what our main role is.  As a Member quite rightly pointed

out,  we cannot be all things to all men.  Employment  is

not  a  single agency's objective.  It is many  agencies.

But  we  are  very clear on what WDA's main role  is.  We

would   be   the  champion  for  Singaporeans'  workforce

development.  Yes, as Ms Olivia Lum said, there would  be

other agencies that need to champion various sectors  and

various  industries remaining in Singapore.  But  we  are

completely  pro-Singaporeans because this is the  way  we

can  help Singaporeans keep their jobs.  But it does  not

mean  that,  as an overall administration, we  would  not

also help other sectors remain here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WDA seeks to be the hub that would bring all these

spokes  of  training,  all  these  various  agencies,  in

alignment,  so that training would be better coordinated.

As a hub, it seeks to provide an integrated framework for

all  the  training  providers to articulate  the  various

parts  can  fit into a whole.  It is Singaporean  worker-centric.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I understand some concerns about what we

are  taking  from SPRING and what we are leaving  behind.

SPRING would continue to exist as it focuses on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2580</b></font><br><br>



companies at national level.  But when it comes to worker

training,  we  would put the integrated programmes  under

one whole.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said about changing mindsets and

imparting   attitudes.   I  agree.  That  is   absolutely

critical.   But as I have realised, that is  one  of  the

hardest aspects to do and it is not a point in time  when

you  can  say  that  you have done  it  and  people  have

understood.  It is a continuous process.  So  while  much

of  that has to go on, as Mr Tan Soo Khoon said, lifelong

learning,  Mr Ahmad Magad, Mr Ong Kian Min,  Dr  Jennifer

Lee,  of  trying  to  change the  mindset  of  employees,

employers,  changing stereotypes, WDA would  continue  to

focus  on certain aspects.  As I have said, we will build

the  skills, resilience and the agility of the workforce.

We  will  have to map skills. Yes, we will also  have  to

teach  Singaporeans  both the  hard  and  soft  skills  - literacy  skills,  critical  thinking  skills,  teamwork,

internationalisation  skills.  As   Dr   Gan   See   Khem

suggested,   we  have  a  Strategic  Manpower  Conversion

Programme for internationalisation efforts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of it, we must make training not only

more  effective  but more believable.  Singaporeans  must

believe  that  training  makes  a  difference.    I   can

understand why Mr Chiam See Tong feels that it may not be

effective.    We  would  not  discriminate  against   his

residents  in Potong Pasir and, in fact, I encourage  his

retrenched  workers in Potong Pasir to come  to  WDA  and

prove  him  wrong that if we can find them a  job,  train

them, it would make him believe.  At the end of the  day,

that is what must be delivered. We must stop training for

training's sake.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As all of you have said, we must be market-responsive, industry-relevant. We have to take this very

seriously because, at the end of it all, there may not be

enough jobs for new entrants if we do not upgrade.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we will strengthen this nexus between

training and employment and we will place priority on job-seekers and target them to fill specific positions. We

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2581</b></font><br><br>



will work with the industry.  Yes, as Dr Teo Ho Pin said,

we  will put more place and train programmes and we  will

find  people jobs and give them the relevant skills  they

need.  We will tie training with financial assistance and

other measures that he has talked about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now want to focus on some special groups that

Members   have   mentioned.   Yes,  we  will   focus   on

professionals,  executives, managers to  cope.  We  would

also  help  those  who  want  to  be  self-employed,  the

entrepreneurs, the older workers. All this  needs  to  be

done.   They are too numerous and I do not intend  to  go

into  details.  But they are on our radar screen  and  we

would take all your comments into consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to end off by saying that the WDA cannot be

all  things  to  all  men.  In  fact,  that  would  be  a

disastrous  starting point. We want to be  very  focused.

Yes,  the  point  of  focus  would  be  how  do  we   get

Singaporeans jobs.  We must never lose sight of it.   But

we  are  also mindful that to fulfill that objective,  we

would need to work with many agencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would reiterate my

last  point  that  we  would require the  same  unanimous

support   and  cooperation  of  workers,  employers   and

strategic  partners to tackle this problem  of  workforce

competitiveness  and  unemployment.   We  must  meet  our

challenges head-on, but together, we can renew heightened

hopes  to our workforce to help them stay employable  and

even more competitive.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can the Minister please comment

on   this  issue  of  discrimination  against  the  older

workers?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, we understand

the dynamics that occur at the workplace and our approach

is that, yes, there is a preference for certain employers

as they do.  We do not think legislation is the way to go

now.   We  believe  in  equipping the  workers  with  the

necessary  skills, sometimes, we may want  to  aid  them,

like our People-for-Jobs Traineeship Scheme where we  pay

half the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2582</b></font><br><br>



salary for six months, and that is to allow the worker to

prove  himself,  because  that is  sustainable.  We  will

continue  with  these efforts and with some  success,  we

have  placed  12,000 workers in that scheme.   I  believe

that we can do much more in those fields.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Ng Eng Hen].

notice  of  amendment  is notified  in  the  Order  Paper

Supplement. As inadequate notice has been given  of  this

amendment, it is subject to the assent of the majority of

Members present.  Is it the pleasure of hon. Members that

the amendment be moved?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 27, item (1), to leave out "paragraphs (b)

and (c)" in the second column and insert "paragraph (c)".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item (1) of the Second Schedule concerns a

consequential amendment to section 6(1) of the Standards,

Productivity  and Innovation Board Act (SPRING),  on  the

functions of SPRING. The deletion of sub-paragraph (b) to

the  section was originally proposed, as a new  statutory

board   is   intended  to  be  the  primary  organisation

responsible for development and upgrading of  skills  and

expertise of the

workforce.  However, as under that provision, SPRING  has

a  wider mandate in that it includes the promotion of the

growth   of  small  and  medium  enterprises  and   other

enterprises  requiring assistance,  we  have  decided  to

leave paragraph (b) in the SPRING Board Act.
