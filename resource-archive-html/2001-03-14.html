<div align="center"><b>ORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT-LINKED COMPANIES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Divestment programme)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

(a)  if he will give an update on the Government's divestment

programme for Government-linked companies (GLCs); (b) whether

the  large  Government shareholdings in  GLCs  have  hindered

their  efforts  to grow in the region; and  (c)  whether  the

Government

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>

has  any  plans to reduce these shareholdings, especially  in

companies like Singapore Telecom and DBS Bank.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  Government's  programme  to  divest  its

shareholdings   in   the   Government-linked   companies   is

progressing  smoothly.   We  conducted  the  initial   public

offering   of   Singapore  MRT  last   year,   bringing   the

Government's  shareholdings  down  from  100%  to  62%.   The

Government   also   divested  Semac  and   Indeco   Engineers

completely in 2000 and 2001 respectively.  Looking ahead, PSA

Corporation and Singapore Power are slated for listing, while

the  three  power generation companies (Power  Seraya,  Power

Senoko and Tuas Power) will also be divested.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to our GLCs' ventures abroad, many have been

successful.  PSA Corp, for example, has gone as far as China,

South  Korea, Middle East and Europe.  SingTel has footprints

in  Asia, including Thailand, Taiwan and India.  DBS bank  is

in Thailand, the Philippines and Hong Kong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some regional ventures, the Singapore Government

shareholding in GLCs has been an advantage.  It has given the

GLCs' partners and host governments confidence that this is a

bona  fide operation with a reputable, long-term shareholder,

which  will  uphold high standards of integrity and  not  cut

corners for quick returns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not all regional ventures of GLCs have been smooth

and  successful.  Many companies treat certain industries  as

"strategic"  and fundamental to their national  interest  and

economic  development.  But they are cautious about  allowing

foreign  players to enter or buy into their domestic  market,

especially   players  with  significant  foreign   government

ownership.   In  banking, for example,  regulators  typically

apply stringent standards and single shareholding limits.  In

telecommunications,    many    countries    limit     foreign

participation in their domestic market.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the Singapore market has substantial and visible

shareholdings  in  a company, regulators, political  leaders,

the press and local constituents tend to perceive the GLC  to

be  Singapore Government-controlled, operating on  an  agenda

that   overrides  normal  commercial  considerations.    Such

perceptions  can  unnecessarily  politicise  and   complicate

mutually  beneficial commercial deal strategic  alliances  or

mergers  and  acquisitions.  From time to  time,  GLCs,  like

SingTel  and  DBS,  have encountered such problems  in  their

regional ventures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a policy, the Government does not interfere in the

strategic  and commercial decisions of GLCs.  All  GLCs  must

operate  strictly  commercially, and are  expected  to  yield

proper economic returns.  They are supervised by their boards

of  directors  and  accountable to  all  their  shareholders,

including the non-government shareholders who often  own  the

majority of the shares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if these perceptions exist, we need to address

the  issue.   In  many  industries,  the  scale  of  economic

activity is increasingly global.  To be competitive and  have

growth   prospects,  companies  need  to  transcend  national

boundaries,  especially  in a small economy  like  Singapore.

The  recent  wave of mergers and acquisitions in  industries,

like banking and telecommunications, reflects this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has stated that its shareholdings in GLCs

are  not sacrosanct.  With very few exceptions, GLCs  are  in

play,  free  to  acquire or be acquired  in  accordance  with

commercial  dictates.   If anybody wants  to  bid  for  them,

whether  the  bidder is foreign or Singaporean,  friendly  or

hostile,  we  will  consider the proposition  seriously.   We

cannot afford to take a parochial, xenophobic approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies, like SingTel and DBS, are large players in

Singapore,   but  small  by  world  standards.    To   become

significant players, they must, over time, evolve  into  more

than  Singapore  companies.   This  is  why  we  have  lifted

requirement for banks and telecommunication companies  to  be

majority Singapore-owned.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government presently owns 78% of SingTel, and 37% of

DBS.   We  do  not regard these as strategic  stakes,  to  be

permanently   maintained.   We   are   prepared   to   reduce

significantly our shareholdings in SingTel and DBS  over  the

medium  term.   How  this  should be  done  will  be  studied

further.   It  can  be by dilution through a merger,  private

sale   to   institutional  investors,  a   SOTUS-type   asset

enhancement exercise for citizens, or some other means.   Any

divestment  should naturally take place at the  right  price,

and under the right market conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For SingTel, we will remove the "special share" which

gives the Government the right to veto major decisions in the

company.   Instead, we will meet our national security  needs

through appropriate safeguards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For DBS, we will need to ensure that the Singapore

character  of the bank is preserved, following any divestment

by  the Government.  It is important that we will be able  to

rely  on the local banks to keep Singapore's financial system

on  an  even  keel  in  a crisis.  The Banking  Act  and  MAS

Regulations help to ensure that the local banks retain  their

commitment to Singapore, even if they form strategic linkages

or merge with foreign partners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, MAS approval is required before single

shareholdings can exceed three threshold levels, 5%, 12%  and

20%.   Second,  MAS requires at least half of  the  board  of

directors  of  the  bank  to comprise Singapore  citizens  or

permanent residents.  This specific requirement may  need  to

be  modified, for example, in a merger with another party  of

comparable size, which is able to contribute to the bank  and

its  continued growth and commitment to Singapore.  But  even

in such a situation, MAS will continue to ensure a strong and

meaningful  Singaporean presence on the board of  the  merged

entity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that this statement of our intentions will dispel

some  of  the  misapprehensions  about  the  nature  of   the

Government's  shareholdings in GLCs, and give  them  a  freer

hand to pursue M&A deals with prospective parties.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 996</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> I would like to

ask  the  Deputy Prime Minister two supplementary  questions.

The  first is that, with regard to the report in the  Straits

Times that the Department of Statistics is doing a review  of

the  scope  and  range  of  GLCs, whether  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister  is aware of this study and whether this study  will

be  coming  up  soon.  It was mentioned in the Straits  Times

recently.   I  am not aware of this until I read  it  in  the

Straits Times myself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is whether there is a need to do

another review of the role of GLCs.  I recall that the  first

review   was  done  more  than  five  years  ago.    A   very

comprehensive review was done.  Could the review be conducted

by  a  joint  committee from both private and  public  sector

representatives since this committee can actually  look  into

the  benefits  of  the  GLCs,  how  their  strengths  can  be

exploited,  areas  of cooperation between  GLCs  and  private

sector  as  well as to give guidelines on how GLCs can  avoid

future encroachment in the private sector and, finally, maybe

even  ask the committee to hear complaints, if any, of  GLCs'

unfair competition versus the private sector?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think Mr Leong

is  referring  to a study recently done by the Department  of

Statistics which was aimed at determining what proportion  of

the  Singapore GDP was accounted by GLCs.  There was  a  time

inflated number of 60% to something originally.  And DOS  re-estimated  this and came out with some number  of  less  than

20%.  I think it was 13% ---

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> 12%

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> 12%. That was the main purpose of

the  study,  just  to  clarify  the  figure.   The  study  is

completed.  It is not ongoing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On review of the role of the GLCs, this is something

which   we   have   continued  to  do.    It   is   Temasek's

responsibility and the Ministry of Finance oversees this.  As

we  have explained, in nearly every case, GLC's function  has

to be to operate as a commercial entity.  There are cases

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>

where  there  are  social  considerations  as  well  as   the

DBS/POSBank  which we have discussed extensively.   But  even

with  that,  DBS  still should have a free  hand  to  operate

without being subject to undue impositions.  As long as  they

are  operating  completely  freely  and  without  any  hidden

Government assistance or subsidy, they should be free  to  do

their  business  as  they think fit.  I do  not  think  there

should  be areas where we push them to go and I do not  think

there  should be areas where we prevent them from  going.   I

know  that, every now and then, the newspapers will come  out

with  the  story  of  a GLC which went into  the  roast  duck

business.   I  believe the GLC subsequently  sold  the  roast

ducks  and  the  business, but that has  not  been  regularly

highlighted in the newspapers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is not our business to micro manage. They have

their  business.  They know what their focus is meant to  be.

If  they  are not properly focused, the shareholders will  do

something  about  it.   In most cases, the shareholders  will

include minority non-Government shareholders, in some  cases,

it  is  fully owned.  Then Temasek has to do something  about

it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> I would like to ask the

Deputy Prime Minister when are the expected dates of the IPOs

for Singapore Power and PSA Corp.  At the same time, what  is

the size of these offerings?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a little bit

premature  to say that now.  In the case of PSA, the  bankers

are now in the final stages of their due diligence work.  The

exact timing of the listing must be carefully studied because

of  the  uncertain  and  very  difficult  market  conditions.

Members  will  be aware of how the US market  has  come  down

sharply  over the last few days and weeks, and the  Singapore

market has followed it down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Singapore Power, its preparations are not

quite as advanced, but bankers have been appointed.  I cannot

commit  to  when they would be listed because it  depends  on

circumstances.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> To follow up from my question, the

Deputy  Prime  Minister said that it is not the intention  of

the  Government  to  micro manage the  GLCs.   But  will  the

Government  look  into  GLCs  which  are  not  covering  non-strategic  areas?  Are there plans for them to  be  divested,

especially if there are parties out there who are prepared to

either  invest  in them, or acquire them, in areas  like  the

Deputy  Prime Minister mentioned about roast ducks and  other

non-strategic areas?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> I think the Member means GLCs which

are participating in non-strategic areas.  Yes, indeed.  As I

explained  in my main reply, the Government is not  fixed  to

hold  all  these GLCs.  In very few cases there are strategic

reasons  why we want to maintain a stake.  In most cases,  we

are  open, and if there is a buyer available who makes us  an

attractive offer, we will be happy to transact.  And in  many

cases, over a period of time, we would be happy to reduce our

shareholdings down below where they are now and,  maybe  even

divest  completely.   Because  the  original  rationale   for

building  up  and  maintaining  these  companies  has  to  be

reviewed and may or may not continue to exist.  But these are

listed companies, so I would not like to speak lightly  about

what  we  will  or will not do until we have  firmed  up  our

plans.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We will allow one last question. Mr Chng.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> This is a follow up of my earlier

question.  If the market sentiments are favourable, will  the

IPOs take place this year?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, PSA and Singapore

Power  would  not  have  appointed  investment  bankers   and

proceeded  with due diligence unless they have  very  serious

intentions.  And we have said our intention is to list  them.

But  can we be ready this year?  We have to judge the timing.

The  timing is a tactical decision.  If it is not this  year,

it  will  be  next year, or the year after.  But we  are  not

seeing it as a very long drawn-out process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Debate on Question [13th March, 2001],

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for Head U of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100." - [Dr Teo Ho Pin].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.

<br>12.46 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head U - Ministry of National

Development.   Amendment No. (1).  Mr Loh  Meng  See  is  not

here.  Mr Ang Mong Seng.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the

Government  is  very  concerned  about  the  competition  and

challenges faced by the HDB neighbourhood retailers, and  has

established  the Retail 21 Development Plan to help  them  to

upgrade and develop their business. A sum of $16 million  has

been allocated for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of how these neighbourhood retailers

could upgrade their management and break out of the difficult

situation, may I make the following observations:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Change in shopping behaviour. In the past, when

people went shopping, they would have some specific needs  in

mind.   For  example,  Minister Mah  mentioned  that  in  his

younger days, when he went to the provision shop to make  his

purchase, he would already have in mind certain goods to buy,

eg,  sugar, oil, etc. However, with the changes in  time  and

lifestyles,  people  nowadays enjoy  going  to  the  shopping

centres  just  to  look around, without  having  anything  in

particular that they would like to buy.  If a certain display

at the window attracts the shopper, he would go into the shop

and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>

examine  it before buying.  On the other hand, if  the  goods

are  displayed in a haphazard manner, they will  not  attract

the   young  shoppers.   Furthermore,  in  the  old-fashioned

provision  shops where the goods are stacked  up  disorderly,

some dishonest customers may take away certain goods and walk

out  of the shops without paying for them. The shopkeeper may

not even notice it.  Therefore, these neighbourhood retailers

can learn a thing or two from the 7-Eleven stores where there

are always a good product mix and the goods are displayed  in

an orderly and attractive manner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Changes in shopping environment. One reason why

shopping  centres could attract the crowd is the  comfortable

and   spacious  environment.   Neighbourhood  retailers   can

attract  shoppers  by  improving  the  surroundings  of   the

shopping areas.  Chong Pang Town and Hong Kah Plaza are  good

examples  of how retailers got together and worked  with  the

Town  Council  to  improve the shop facades and  the  general

surroundings,   thereby  making  them   move   spacious   and

attractive.   The Gombak Town project which is underway  will

be yet another example.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Changes in rental. At present, all shops, whether

located  in  the  residential blocks, neighbourhood  or  town

centres,  are  charged market rental  rates.   How  does  HDB

determine  the  market  rents?   These  rents  are   computed

according to the 6-month tender price of the shops.  However,

two things happen when shops are tendered:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The "kiasu" tender where the bid is extremely high,

for fear of failure to secure the place; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The "kiasi" or "afraid to die" tender where the bid

is  very low for fear that the capital cannot be recouped and

the business will die.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither of these should be used as a benchmark for

determining   market   rate  rental.    A   more   reasonable

computation  would  be  the highest tender  rental  plus  the

lowest  tender  rental, divided by two, eg, $3,000  +  $1,000

divided by two, giving

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>

a  rental  of  $2,000,  which is more reasonable.   But  this

market  rent  should be charged only on  shops  in  the  town

centres  selling  consumer  and  expensive  goods,  such   as

watches,  jewellery and cosmetics.  I am sure Mr  Speaker  is

very  familiar with the watch trade.  A watch which  is  sold

for  $1,000  can  bring  the shop owner  a  profit  of  $100.

However, in a sundry shop, a bottle of soya sauce is sold  at

$1  and  the profit is only 10 cents.  Therefore, rental  for

shops in residential blocks or in the neighbourhood should be

benchmarked according to the type of residents living in  the

area.   They  should be charged a reasonable rental  rate  to

help  lower their business costs, so that they can  carry  on

with their business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Government buy-back package. Some ageing

shopkeepers are finding it difficult to continue  with  their

business.   They  could have been doing the business  from  a

tender  age  and stuck with it until a ripe  old  age.   They

cannot  carry  on  with  their business.   According  to  the

present  HDB regulations, those who want to return the  shops

to  the HDB cannot get any compensation.  They would have  to

fork  out  some  money  to refurbish the  shops  before  such

premises  are returned to the HDB.  When the shopkeepers  are

old, there is no one to take over.  Therefore, can HDB change

this  rule?    It  should  render a  helping  hand  to  these

shopkeepers.  HDB should consider allowing them to return the

shops and pay them a sum of, say, $48,000 as compensation, as

is  the  practice  under the Selective En-Bloc  Redevelopment

Scheme (SERS).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the shopkeepers, trade associations and HDB would

consider the above suggestions.  I believe retailers  in  the

HDB still have good prospects.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the poor

business  of HDB neighbourhood shops is a problem  which  has

been  in  existence for a long time.  Part of the  reason  is

that  their trades, as specified by the HDB, are not relevant

to the demands of the market in the present day

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>

and the shopowners are not allowed to change their trade.  As

such, they just had to carry on doing their business in  very

difficult circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the solutions to this problem are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Greater flexibility on the part of the HDB to allow the

shopowners or tenants to change their trades;  and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Permission by the Urban Redevelopment Authority to allow

those neighbourhood shops in the out-of-the-way localities to

change the use of their shops.  In places where there are too

many  shops, resulting in many shops being left vacant, URA

should allow them to be used for other activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any estate, the HDB specifies what trade the shops

should  be  engaged in.  It is, of course,  good  to  have  a

proper  trade  mix,  for the convenience  of  the  residents.

However,  when  the  convenience  shops,  like  7-Eleven  and

Cheers,   come   into  the  neighbourhood,  the   traditional

provision  shops could not compete with them.  On  the  other

hand,  the  HDB does not allow the provision shops to  change

their  trade,  so they have to just carry on  with  the  same

trade,  even when there is no longer any demand  for  such  a

trade. So, to solve this problem, the HDB should have greater

flexibility  to  allow the shopowners and tenants  to  change

their  trade and let market conditions decide the  number  of

various types of business in the neighbourhood shops. The HDB

should  also help those who cannot carry on, eg,  the  ageing

shopowners,  and let them exit by giving them  some  form  of

compensation.  Only then can the shops in the HDB estates  be

re-packaged  to  serve the residents under a  new  and  fresh

look.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to talk about change of use. URA

specifies  that the neighbourhood shops in HDB estates  could

only  be used for retail business and not for other purposes.

This  is  understandable.  However,  in  some  out-of-the-way

localities, there are too many shops, resulting in a surplus,

and  many of the shops could not attract tenants and they are

closed throughout the year.  If URA could permit these  shops

to change

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>

their  use and allow the tenants to use them as showrooms  or

offices,  then  at least these shops could be fully  utilised

and it could also bring more life to the housing estates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has already allowed those who are

involved  in  the  Internet-driven  companies  to  use  their

residence  as an office.  Why is it that we cannot allow  the

vacant  shops to be converted to offices and allow the start-up  companies to start their business at a lower rent to  cut

their overhead expenses?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another related question is the request of the residents

to  convert the upper floor of the shops for other  purposes.

According  to  the original design, the upper  floor  of  the

shops was meant for the shopowners and their families to stay

in. By staying on the upper floor, the shopowners will enjoy

great convenience in looking after their business downstairs.

This was a good conception, but this was 20 years ago.  Now,

with the changes of time, most of the shopowners have  their

own flats elsewhere and they use the premises  upstairs  as

warehouse or offices. According to the rules,  they  would

have to apply to the URA for change of use and, very  often,

it would be very difficult for them to get the approval.  My

parliamentary colleague, Mr Leong Horn Kee, mentioned  during

the debate on MTI's budget, that the owners  of  the  shops

along Upper Thomson Road applied to convert the second storey

of their shops into offices or other commercial purposes, but

their  applications were refused and the reason was  that  it

would cause traffic congestion.  As for HDB, they refused  to

allow  the  shopowners  to convert the  upper  floor  into  a

warehouse  because  the  floor  was  not  strong  enough   to

withstand  the extra weight of the goods to be stored  there.

So,  using  the upper floor for storage would pose  problems.

But  if  there  are people just working there as  an  office,

would there be additional weight as compared to people living

there?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that URA could reconsider these applications for

conversion   of   use   and   give  them   more   sympathetic

consideration.   In fact, URA has approved  applications  for

the change of use by some of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>

these premises.  However, the approval is valid only for  one

year.  So if they want to carry on using the premises for the

changed   purpose,   they  would  have  to   resubmit   their

application every year.  This is time and energy wasting.  As

a  result,  the shopowners would not dare to spend  money  on

renovation, because of the uncertainties.  So we should allow

them to convert the upper floors into offices.  This will put

the  premises  to optimum use and allow the  owners  to  save

their  business cost so as to cope with the uncertainties  in

the next couple of years.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would like to inform hon. Members that

the "guillotine" time for this discussion is 3.00 pm.  Dr Tan

Boon Wan.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, our neighbourhood

retailers   face  difficulties.   I  join  my   parliamentary

colleagues  in  expressing  our  concern,  and  to  urge  the

Government  to help them.  I support many of the  suggestions

made by my colleagues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, no business can survive if the customers do not

support  them  and do not need their products  and  services.

The  issues  of  the  management  of  the  shops,  and  their

relevance  to  the  community, impinge upon  their  long-term

viability.   They  need  help  with  these  issues.   But  to

overcome  their difficulties, they must want to change;  they

can  help  themselves.  Today, in many neighbourhood centres,

retailers  have come together to form merchants  or  business

associations. To help themselves, they can carry  out  market

surveys to determine the needs of the communities they serve.

They  can  get consultants to advise them.  They can organise

courses to upgrade their management skills and the skills  of

their  workers.  They can also organise visits to learn  from

successful shopping centres.

<br>1.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recently unveiled a slew of supports

under  Retailers 21.  I am confident that it will go  a  long

way  to assist retailers.  However, if retailers want to help

themselves, I hope that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>

the  Government would consider making available this support,

both funds and expertise, to the neighbourhood merchants  and

business  associations.  If this is possible, this help  will

be  brought  closer home.  The help can then be  specifically

tailored  to the needs of each neigbourhood shopping  centre.

By  being  directly involved, the retailers  will  be  better

motivated   with  a  sense  of  ownership  of   the   support

programmes.  Training will be more accessible and  convenient

to the retailers and their workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also want to make an appeal to our landlords.

HDB  has  sold many of the neighbourhood shops.  Many  owners

have  rented  out these shops. I have seen shops  that  enjoy

good  business fold.  A common refrain is that landlords have

increased  the rent.  There is nothing left for  the  tenants

after  that.   Landlords should charge a fair  market  rental

that  reflects  a  reasonable return  on  their  investments.

Reasonable  rental  means reasonable cost.   This  translates

into lower prices for the customers.  Everyone benefits.  The

landlord  gets  a  good steady rental, the retailer  makes  a

satisfactory return for his hard work and the residents enjoy

fair  prices and good service.  Hence, I urge our  landlords:

please do not raise the rent just because your tenants  enjoy

good business.  Tenants go into business to make money.  They

work  hard  for their profit.  It does not motivate  them  to

work  if  the fruits of their efforts are being creamed  off.

Neighbourhood retailers bring convenience and needed services

and  products  to the community.  We should  help  to  ensure

their continued viability and presence.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, I understand that the Government

has  stopped the sale of HDB shops.  In my experience, I  see

several plus points for this programme to continue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some years ago, I spoke against the sale of HDB shops on

99-year  lease  and I called for a change in  the  policy  of

selling HDB shops instead on 30-year lease, which is in  line

with industrial properties.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>

The then Minister for National Development, Mr Lim Hng Kiang,

accepted  this suggestion, and except for a small  number  of

units,  all  the shops in my constituency were  sold  to  the

sitting  tenants  on a 30-year lease.  This was  sometime  in

late 1995 and early 1996.  There was resistance from a number

of  shop  tenants for various reasons.  It was not a  popular

idea  at  that  time.   Most of them see shopowners  in  town

centres buying shops and making huge profits out of that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advent of the Asian currency crisis in July 1997 and

the  recession  that followed after, made all  my  shopowners

today  thankful that the decision they made was a right  one.

Almost  all of the shopowners rented out half of their shops.

This  rent  which they receive is sufficient to pay  for  the

mortgage  and, in some cases, turn in a surplus.  This  means

that  the  shopowners can continue to operate a smaller  unit

and  continue their business.  In other words, the  shopowner

has  his mortgage paid by someone else and, at the same time,

can  continue his livelihood.  Today, I believe my shopowners

in  my  constituency  are  a much satisfied  and  financially

healthy lot.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I strongly urge the Government to continue the

sale of HDB shop programme as this is one avenue to alleviate

the   hardships   and   difficulties  of  our   neighbourhood

shopkeepers.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, I would like to

join  in Mr Chng Hee Kok's call for the Government to  resume

the  sale  of HDB shop scheme because, since the  last  sale,

there has been no further activity in this particular scheme.

HDB  has  also not announced when it would resume the scheme,

nor  indicate  whether  it  has been   cancelled  altogether.

There   are,  in  fact,  many  neighbourhood  centres   whose

operators  are still waiting to participate in  the  sale  of

shops  scheme, on the assumption that the sale  prices  would

always be pegged at a discount to the market price.  This was

so  when the market was on the way up, and should be so  when

the  market  is  on the way down.  One of these neighbourhood

centres is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1007</b></font><br><br>

in  my constituency at Clementi Street 13 in Bukit Timah GRC.

Their desire has been highlighted in the press recently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all businesses were negatively affected by the

scheme.  Some of the more vibrant ones would like the  scheme

to  continue.   If  HDB  were to continue  to  do  so,  those

currently  settled  down  will  find  their  assets   further

depressed if HDB were to sell the shops at the current market

price.  In a way, I can understand why HDB is silent on  this

matter because no matter what it does, it can please no  one.

If  HDB were to suspend the scheme, it would be equivalent to

denying  the  opportunity to those who are still waiting  for

the  privilege  granted to many others, including  the  early

batches.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister not to leave everyone waiting

for  the  scheme  in  limbo and to  state  very  clearly  and

explicitly whether the scheme will be continued or suspended.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, the HDB Main and

Interim Upgrading Programmes have received much support  from

many   HDB   residents.    The  upgrading   programmes   have

revitalised our older housing estates and, at the same  time,

kept   our   communities  together.  The  success  of   these

programmes has spurred a lot of interest among HDB residents.

Many  are  now requesting for their flats to be upgraded.   I

would  like  to  suggest the following for  the  Minister  to

consider.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Revised MUP and IUP cut-off dates. Due to the age

criterion, and the cut-off dates set by HDB, many  blocks  of

flats  are  not eligible for upgrading.  I hope the  Minister

can consider revising the cut-off dates of flats so that more

Singaporeans can benefit from the upgrading programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Lift upgrading programme. Last year, I requested

for  a special lift-upgrading programme.  I hope the Minister

will consider implementing a Special Lift Upgrading Programme

to  expedite the installation of lifts on every  floor.   Our

fast  ageing society has created an immediate demand for such

added services in a high-rise public housing.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Design rectification. Many old HDB flats have

design  features  which  encourage  mosquito  breeding,   for

example,  bamboo  pole holders, concealed  drains,  canopies,

metal  decking roofs, etc.  These design features are  costly

to  rectify  to prevent mosquito breeding.   The  Environment

Ministry has been working closely with the town councils  and

HDB  to  resolve such problems.  But the lack of funding  has

slowed  down  the efforts, leading to frequent  outbreaks  of

dengue  fever.  To  address this problem, I  would  urge  the

Minister to consider implementing a one-time goodwill  repair

programme for these flats.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, the

HDB's  Interim  Upgrading Programme and  the  Main  Upgrading

Programme  have indeed benefited many Singaporean  households

living  in  the  public estates.  Many are anxiously  looking

forward for their turn to have this upgrading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask what is the status of these

upgrading  programmes so far, in terms of how many  precincts

have  already  undergone Interim Upgrading Programme  or  the

Main Upgrading Programme.  Also, I would like to ask how many

more  precincts are left, based on the revised criteria which

would go through the IUP and MUP. In recent times, in the new

announcements  of precincts for MUP, I notice  that  in  some

precincts,  for instance, in my constituency, there  are  two

point  blocks which are considered for MUP, while  there  are

five  or six blocks in the same precinct.   By just selecting

two  point  blocks, for instance, does not give the economies

of scale. Secondly, it also makes it very difficult for us to

explain  to  the  residents of the other  blocks  within  the

precinct  as to why they are not selected for the  upgrading.

If  there are other plans like SERS or things like that, this

should  also  be announced simultaneously so that unnecessary

rumour-mongering can be prevented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is on the lift upgrading programme, as

Dr Teo has just mentioned.  Many residents find that, whether

it is the IUP or MUP, lift upgrading has the most

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>

impact on these programmes.  We find, especially in the older

estates,  like  in the city centre, Kim Seng,  Kampong  Glam,

Moulmein,  and even in Toa Payoh, many residents  are  senior

citizens and they look forward to the MUP, but it takes  some

time.   Therefore,  you find that the town councils  are  not

able  to provide lift landing on every floor because  of  the

cost.   I  would  also like to ask that this  lift  upgrading

programme,  on a pilot scheme that has been planned,  can  be

expanded  and more of the mature estates in the  city  centre

can be considered for this upgrading.  It is possible to farm

it  out  for the town councils to manage this project because

this  can be done within a year or so, as opposed to  waiting

for  a  MUP which takes a long time. At the same time,  there

are many in mature estates which have gone through IUP in the

first  phase,  but they did not get their lift upgrading.   I

hope  that this scheme can be introduced for them as  quickly

as possible.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, unlike Dr Teo Ho Pin, I would

urge  the  Government to make a total review of the  IUP  and

MUP. The reason is because of the recommendations encompassed

in  Concept  Plan  21  where the land  use  review  envisions

Singapore with a population of 5.5 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on current land utilisation ratio, there is a

potential  shortfall of 4,000 hectares of  land.   The  focus

group  on land allocation, in its report, called for a higher

plot  ratio  in  general.  In high density  private  and  HDB

estates, the focus group urges that the GPR be increased from

2.5 to 3.65.  The reason I call for a review is that there is

limitation with the IUP and MUP.  As no new additional  units

will  be  built in those estates, existing residents have  to

move  out before new residents could move in. Thus, there  is

always a shortage of younger and more energetic residents  to

rejuvenate  the  older housing estates.  IUP is,  of  course,

always welcome by the residents as the improvements are  free

to  them.   But  MUP  requires co-payment by  the  residents.

Furthermore,  during the construction period, those  affected

have to live in the midst of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>

a  great  construction site.  Most of those  who  have  lived

through  it  would  not  recommend it to  their  friend,  but

perhaps to their enemy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the falling of HDB prices in the resale market, it

seems  to  me that MUP is losing its appeal to the  residents

nowadays.   As  I  said, the MUP and IUP do  not  change  the

landscape  in line with our future scenarios.  The  Minister,

in his reply yesterday, has already agreed that higher GPR in

existing  HDB  estates  would  be  more  cost-effective,   in

particular, if we were to include the infrastructure cost  of

building  new towns.  If we are planning for a population  of

5.5  million, would it not be more cost-effective  to  pursue

alternative  schemes like SERS with immediate  effect,  where

possible?

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, when you speak to

young  couples who have applied for new HDB flats,  you  will

hear  complaints  that they continue to face difficulties  in

meeting  the  downpayment, even with the present arrangements

of  two  instalment payments of 10% each.  To make it  easier

for  them, could the Minister reduce the downpayment  to  10%

and  in  two  instalments?  This will encourage them  to  get

access  to  housing  much  earlier and  that  would  also  be

enhancing  our  family policy of more than two  children,  if

they can.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to young couples who want to live near to their

parents in mature estates, we have encouraged them to do  so.

Yet, we are not making it easier for them.  It should not  be

seen  as a lip service to them.  It is important to find ways

to enhance the capacity to live near their parents.  The cash

upfront  and  downpayment  are major  hindrances.  Could  the

Minister consider reducing the downpayment to 10% and provide

an  additional housing loan to enable young couples  to  meet

some part of the cash upfront payment?  That seems to be  the

problems  of young couples who want to live near  parents  in

mature estates.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, the HDB has ceased the building

of 3-room flats and smaller units.  It has stopped the build-

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1011</b></font><br><br>

ing  of  executive  apartments. It has established  a  fairly

successful  partial privatisation of its  activities  in  the

design  and  build  scheme.  There is no  question  that  the

Executive Condominium scheme has taken off very nicely.  This

leads  me  to  revive  a suggestion I  made  before  in  this

Chamber.   I  suggested about five years ago that HDB  should

stop  building  large  flats and leave this  to  the  private

sector.  I suggested that there was no reason for HDB  to  go

beyond  providing  basic  housing  and  should  restrict   to

building 4-room flats and smaller units.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, today, with the slowdown in demand for new

flats  to  no more than 10,000 units a year, and unlikely  to

rise  as a result of demographic changes, there is compelling

reason  today for the HDB to privatise the building of  flats

altogether.  The  design-and-build scheme and  the  Executive

Condominium scheme should be able to take care of the  annual

needs of the demand for public housing.  This move is similar

to  the devolution of the maintenance role of the HDB to  the

town councils.

<br>1.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these changes, the continuing role of the HDB

should  be in setting policy, planning and upgrading  of  old

estates.  This move of leaving the building of flats  to  the

private   sector  altogether  will  strengthen  the  building

industry, give consumers a wider choice of public housing and

the  HDB  need not have an organisation when the  demand  for

public  housing  drops.  Will the Minister highlight  to  the

House whether there is a review of the role of the HDB  as  a

result of this shifting of demand?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I spoke of the continuing role of HDB in the

upgrading of old estates.  About five years ago, I  spoke  of

the  need  to launch a lift upgrading programme to complement

the  Main Upgrading Programme (MUP) and the Interim Upgrading

Programme (IUP).  The Government turned down the suggestion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three weeks ago, I conducted a survey at an exhibition

of an area in my constituency chosen for the Main Upgrading

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>

Programme.  Almost to the last resident, there were questions

and requests made for the upgrading of lifts to stop on every

floor.  Unfortunately, in the Main Upgrading Programme,  this

item is to be entertained only when there are funds left over

after  the  tender exercise for the MUP.  A small  number  of

residents even said that they were not in favour of  the  MUP

if the lifts were not upgraded.  One even asked why we do not

demolish  the flats altogether and do a SERS.  MUP  was  much

sought after at one time, but I do not know for how long.   I

hope  that this is not a sign of escalating expectations that

one day we cannot meet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the MUP, these flats, which were meant

for  main  upgrading,  were built 23 years ago.  The emphasis

then  was  on  the  speed of supply of public  housing.   The

population was also younger and more robust then.   This  has

changed, and my recent experience tells me that next  to  the

MUP,  a lift upgrading programme (LUP) will certainly be  not

only  popular  but, I believe, much needed.  I  am  confident

that  the area I spoke about is similar in character to  many

other  parts of Singapore.  Will the Minister heed  the  call

this time, Sir?

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, we must review the registration for

flat  policy  to  be more pro-family and to better  meet  the

needs of Singaporeans.  I would like to suggest the following

proposals for the Minister to consider:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Build on demand flats. HDB can adopt a similar

approach,  as  adopted by private developers to  build  flats

based  on demand of the population.  Selected sites of  about

500-700  units  can  be  chosen for development  at  specific

locations.  Singaporeans can then be invited to select  these

flats based on specific location.  If there is no demand  for

a   specific  location,  HDB  will  not  proceed   with   the

development,  and  an alternative site will  be  sought.   In

cases  where the take-up rate may not be 100%, the  remaining

flats  can  be  rented out to families who need  transitional

housing  such  as  bankrupts, widows, retirees,  singles  and

young married couples.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Reclassification of zones. Can HDB consider

reclassifying its zoning system?  Many flat applicants  would

like  to  choose flats by specific location such as  town  or

constituency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Master listing of available flats. Can HDB

consider   consolidating  a  master  listing  of  all   flats

available, so that flat applicants can have more choices  for

a flat?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I have a

specific  cut on lift upgrading, but I find that many  of  my

colleagues  have  already spoken on this.  And  following  in

their  wake,  I  would  like to join in  the  call  for  lift

upgrading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On lift upgrading, I want to emphasise that we are not

just  talking about installing new and faster lifts.  By lift

upgrading, I want to call for lifts on every floor.   As  the

population ages, we need lifts on every floor, even for  low-rise  buildings.  In the past, buildings below 4 storeys  did

not  have any lifts at all.  Many of our blocks of flats  are

built  in  columns,  in which there are only  two  flats  per

floor, and some blocks do not have common corridors.  And  if

we  need lifts on every floor, new corridors will have to  be

constructed.  This would cost a lot of money, and I think the

Government  would  best  be undertaking  this  and  giving  a

separate  lift  upgrading programme on  top  of  the  Interim

Upgrading Programme and Main Upgrading Programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like the Ministry to consider more

carefully  in  its planning and think of the handicapped  and

the  people  who  are  elderly.   In  terms  of  choosing  of

materials,  for  example, pavements could  have  non-slippery

materials, or material that is not uneven so that people with

walking sticks would not stumble against them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should also have ramps and other handicap-friendly community facilities, because as the population gets

older  and  there  are  more  disabilities,  these  would  be

important considerations.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the phenomenon of

an ageing population stands out very clearly in the older HDB

estates.  The issue of providing and enhancing facilities  in

the  estates for the convenience of the elderly is very  much

on  the  mind  of town councils, HDB and grassroots  leaders.

Among  the  various  amenities, the upgrading  of  lifts  has

become  more and more important.  For the past few  years,  I

have  been pestering the Ministry of National Development  to

upgrade  the lifts in the old estates.  So they called  me  a

friend of senior citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, there are nearly 1,000 blocks of flats which

do  not  have  common  corridors.   These  blocks  should  be

installed  with lifts to make it convenient for  the  elderly

citizens.   We  all know the importance of lift upgrading  in

these blocks, but the question is when to upgrade them.   MND

suggested  that  it  be  done during  the  Interim  Upgrading

Programme  or the Main Upgrading Programme, but I think  this

is not a good approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Interim Upgrading Programme is co-sponsored by the

town  council and the HDB, and the residents do not  have  to

pay  for the cost.  If the work of lift upgrading is included

in the IUP, residents will have to bear the extra cost.  This

will  have  the effect of discouraging residents from  voting

for  the IUP, thus impeding the progress of IUP.  If the work

is  included in the Main Upgrading Programme, it is not  very

ideal  either,  because the cost of MUP has to  be  partially

borne  by  the  residents.   With  the  added  cost  of  lift

upgrading, they will have to bear a greater financial burden.

Those  less  well  off  residents  would  opt  out  of   this

programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to suggest that lift upgrading be

treated  as  a  special programme by HDB  where  tenders  are

called  on  a collective basis, and carried out  in   stages.

Within  five years, all the 1,000 blocks of flats would  have

their  lifts upgraded.  Those blocks which do not have  lifts

would have lifts installed.  This will be more convenient  to

the  elderly citizens.   An overall tender system will  lower

the cost by 20% and will therefore

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>

benefit  both  MND and the residents who would have  less  to

pay.   May  I  also find out how much will each  resident  be

expected to pay?  Will the residents be allowed to use  their

CPF  savings to pay for the cost?   Can those who are  unable

to pay be allowed to defer payment until after they have sold

their flats?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Sir, the HDB has built

some studio apartments in my constituency in Bedok North,  as

part  of  a pilot project to enable senior citizens  to  sell

their existing HDB flats and downgrade to smaller apartments,

thereby  enjoying  additional income  and  maintaining  their

independence  and  privacy.  Completion of  these  blocks  of

flats in my constituency is scheduled for June this year, but

I  was  told  that the take-up rate has been  very  poor.   I

believe  the  poor take-up rate is because the scheme  is  no

longer  as attractive as when it was mooted some three  years

ago,  given  the  current state of the  property  market  and

because  the  rules governing eligibility to  purchase  these

flats are too stringent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I attribute this to the following reasons.

Firstly,  the  lease  for  these  flats  is  only  30  years.

Although  there  was popular request to  increase  it  to  50

years, the HDB had turned it down.  Secondly, these flats are

non-transferable upon the death of the owner.  In fact,  many

people  have  asked what would happen if the  elderly  lessee

dies prematurely.  Thirdly, the prices of between $60,000 and

$80,000 per unit for these flats appear high.  I believe  the

HDB  has recently revised its prices downwards by as much  as

20%, but not enough to make up for the drop in the prices  of

existing HDB flats that these elderly lessees currently  own.

Fourthly, eligible applicants must be existing owners of  HDB

flats.   My  question  is: why can't we open  the  scheme  to

owners  of  private apartments and properties as  well?   Or,

alternatively,  remove  this last  criterion  altogether,  as

there are Singaporeans who are willing to buy these flats for

their parents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in summary, I would like to ask the Minister to

review this scheme, make

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>

it  more attractive and ease the eligibility criteria for the

purchase of these apartments.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, presently, the

HDB's  rental programme is meant only for those who are  very

poor  and cannot afford to purchase flats, and also for those

waiting  in the queue to purchase flats and are eligible  for

transitional rental flats.  I would like to put up a case for

HDB  to  consider renting out flats to young married  couples

who  are  eligible  for the purchase of flats  but  have  not

decided whether to purchase one yet.  Their incomes, however,

are  not  low enough to qualify for a rental flat  under  the

existing  rules.   This group may want to rent  one  for  the

following  reasons.  Firstly, they may not  have  decided  in

which  location  to live in on a long term basis.   Secondly,

they  may  be preparing to work or study overseas for  a  few

years before returning home to Singapore.  Thirdly, they  may

need the money to start up and nurture their companies rather

than  spend it on purchasing a property.  Fourthly, they  may

just  be  waiting  to go straight into the  private  property

market  at the appropriate time, rather than be tied down  by

the 5-year time bar imposed by the HDB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, there is a social stigma attached to the

renting of HDB flats.  It is associated too much with poverty

and  low income.  If we liberalise the rental scheme and take

into consideration this group of young couples, we remove the

stigma  and meet the needs of many young people at  the  same

time.   To  prevent abuse, we can have some  rules  to  allow

couples  to rent up to a maximum of 3-5 years.  Older couples

can  also  use the scheme later in life for short periods  of

time,  such as when their flats are being renovated and  they

need  somewhere to live in temporarily, or when their  houses

are being rebuilt and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister will look into this proposal.

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I would like to

touch on the philosophy

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>

that Government adopts when determining affordability of  HDB

flats  and  therefore prices.  Government's stated commitment

is  to price new HDB flats such that 90% of Singaporeans will

be able to afford at least a 3-room flat and 70% at least a 4-room  flat.   This  affordability refers to  the  ability  to

service  their monthly mortgage repayments using  both  their

monthly    CPF   contribution   and   cumulative    balances.

Eligibility   is  capped  at  40%  of  gross  income.    This

philosophy  appears to be linked more to  income  levels  and

overall economic health than housing price levels in general.

In fact, it should theoretically be independent of HDB resale

prices,  executive condominium and private  property  prices.

However,  in  reality, I believe there are  expectations  not

met,  given the apparent disconnect between the new HDB  flat

prices  and the overall property market cycle.  Hence,  there

are  expectations that HDB prices must be adjusted downwards,

for  example,  during the current downturn in  both  the  HDB

resale  and private property markets.  Earlier on, an  upward

adjustment in new HDB flat prices was made on account of  the

design-and-build programme.  But it may have  coincided  with

the upward cycle.  Hence, the perception that new flat prices

are somehow tied to market trends.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to ask the Minister to clarify

whether  new HDB flat prices are independently set  based  on

income  levels  primarily.  This  is  critical  as  it  would

provide a lot of assurance to Singaporeans, especially first-timers  and upgraders, that HDB flats would always be  within

their reach and that there would  not be wild swings in these

prices.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Sir, first of all, let me address Members' comments about the

plight  of  HDB  shopkeepers.  I  believe  this  subject  has

received  considerable attention and airing, both inside  and

outside  the  House.   Yesterday and  today,  we  heard  many

Members  speak  up  about the intense  competition  that  HDB

shopkeepers  are facing and how Government must do  something

to help them.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share these sentiments. In fact, at the parliamentary

sitting on 22nd February, I assured the House that Government

will do something for this group of retailers.  But we should

not  forget that a HDB retail shop is, first and foremost,  a

business.  As with other businesses, HDB shopkeepers have  to

take the initiative to adapt to changing consumer demand  and

to  manage their business risks.  In the long run, whether  a

shop  survives  and  thrives is not how much  assistance  the

Government gives but whether the shop can attract and  retain

customers.  This is the point that Dr Tan Boon Wan made  just

now.   However, the Government will lend a hand to help  them

overcome some of these present difficulties that they face.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, Mr Lim Boon Heng, Chairman PSB, unveiled the

Retail  21  Plan.  This plan recommends that we reinvent  the

retail  sector  by  raising  retailing  standards,  enhancing

industry  efficiency  through upgrading and  retraining,  and

managing the restructuring of the HDB retail sub-sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am pleased to inform Members that MND and HDB,

together  with  other relevant agencies, have  formulated  an

assistance  programme for HDB retailers that  dovetails  with

the  Retail  21  Plan.   Our guiding principle  is  that  the

Government will do what it can to help HDB retailers who  are

willing to help themselves.  Hence, the programme focuses  on

enhancing  the  long-term viability of the HDB retail  sector

and  not  just on short-term quick fixes.  Specifically,  the

assistance   programme  consists  of  three  main   elements.

Firstly, we will provide assistance to both HDB shop  lessees

and  tenants who wish to upgrade their businesses.  Secondly,

we  will  review  HDB rules to grant both  shop  lessees  and

tenants  greater  flexibility to  adapt  to  changing  market

conditions.  Thirdly, we will facilitate the exit of HDB shop

tenants who wish to voluntarily retire from the business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, business upgrading. Business upgrading can be in

the form of software, for example, business skills, processes

and rules; or hardware, in other words,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>

the  physical environment.  The Government's assistance  will

be  in  both  areas.   I would first touch  on  the  software

aspect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSB's assistance programme. The Retail 21 Plan includes

two  programmes,  namely,  the  Retail  Essential  Assistance

Programme  and  the Franchise 21 Assistance  Programme,  both

under PSB.  These programmes can help HDB shopkeepers upgrade

their businesses.  I would like to encourage HDB retailers to

make  full use of them in order to compete with both the huge

malls as well as the convenience store chains, like 7-Eleven,

as   some  Members  have  brought  up  in  this  House.    Mr

Sinnakaruppan asked whether the programmes will be  available

in languages other than English.  The answer is yes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, flexibility in use of shops. Many Members,

including  Dr Lily Neo, Dr Ker Sin Tze, Prof. Toh  See  Kiat,

have  suggested  the  HDB grant greater  flexibility  to  HDB

shopkeepers for change of use.  However, at the same time,  I

hear Dr Teo Ho Pin, for example, say that the HDB should  not

be  too  free granting this flexibility, and that indeed  HDB

should  proactively determine the retail  mix,  so  that  the

residents' needs are met.  Of course, there are other Members

who  seem to suggest that HDB should somehow do both  at  the

same  time.  In other words, control the mix on the one hand,

and yet be more flexible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, HDB has got to weigh the pros and cons of

both  approaches  and  find the correct  balance,  guided  of

course  by the interests of both HDB retailers and residents.

This  is  not an easy balance to find.  If necessary,  I  may

have  to ask HDB to consult the advisers on what their  views

are   as   far   as   specific   approvals   are   concerned.

Nevertheless, HDB will be more flexible in granting  approval

for  change  of  use  and trade, such as shop  showrooms  and

offices, as suggested by Dr Ker, but we will continue  to  be

cautious with conversion to, say, eating houses or industrial

trades  as  these  are  likely to  cause  nuisance  to  their

residents - nuisance such as parking, noise, and so on.  I do

not  think  Members  would want to face the  wrath  of  their

residents when

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>

they find that their convenience store or shop downstairs  is

suddenly  turned into a shop selling spare parts for lorries,

for example.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So such a move will allow HDB lessees and tenants to

keep  up  with  the  changes  in  the  environment  and   the

residents' needs.  But, in the long run, it is the residents,

as well as the consumers, and not HDB, who will determine the

retail  mix for the area.  This new policy will apply to  HDB

shops  in  the traditional neighbourhood as well as shops  in

stand-alone  neighbourhood centres that are  at  least  three

years old.  The reason for this is because some of the stand-alone  centres have only recently been built and the shopping

mix  there  is not stabilised yet.  HDB feels that  it  needs

three  years  at least for the shopping mix to be stabilised.

Bearing the concerns of some Members in mind over such  trade

liberalisation, HDB will monitor closely the outcome of these

relaxation rules and, if necessary, make adjustments as we go

along.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Mr Peh Chin Hua mentioned that some

shopkeepers find that their shop areas are too big.  Dr  Lily

Neo,  in fact, suggested the idea of splitting the shops into

smaller  units.  I am pleased to inform them  that  HDB  will

allow  tenants  to  sublet  up to 50%  of  their  traditional

neighbourhood shops if the floor area is at least  50  square

metres.   This will allow them to maximise the use  of  their

space.   They  will  also be allowed to sublet  their  living

quarters  for residential use.  And for sold shops, HDB  will

allow  shopowners to use the living quarters  for  commercial

purposes, as recommended by Dr Ker.   But, as pointed out  by

Prof.  Toh  See Kiat, and correctly so, most living  quarters

are  structurally designed only for residential use.   So  if

the shopowners wish to conduct commercial activities in these

quarters, they would have to find some way to strengthen  the

floors  of  their  quarters.  They would  have  to  make  the

necessary application to HDB who will conduct some structural

analysis of the situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from software, upgrading the physical environment

will also help to improve the business of HDB shops.  Dr

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>

Lily  Neo  suggested sometime ago that HDB shops should  band

together   to   form  commercial  streets  with   distinctive

features.  This is a very workable idea.  In fact, there  are

many examples - Marine Parade, Chong Pang city, Tampines, Toa

Payoh  Town Centre, and so on.  All these examples show  that

such  projects  are successful when they originate  from  the

local  community.   I would therefore like to  encourage  HDB

shopkeepers to market their shops and their town  centres  in

conjunction with their town councils and grassroots  leaders.

I  will  ask  the  Community Improvement  Projects  Committee

(CIPC) to consider extending funding support for more of such

projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh Chin Hua yesterday expressed concern over the

cost  of the Main Upgrading Programme for the shopowners.   I

am  pleased to inform him that the Government will  make  MUP

more affordable to shop lessees.  Currently, HDB shop lessees

have  to  pay  full cost for the standard MUP package.   With

immediate  effect, all MUP precincts that have not  undergone

polling,  the  HDB  will subsidise 50% of  the  cost  of  the

standard package.  HDB will also give a 50% discount off  the

market  value of the space-adding item, up from today's  30%.

With  this  change,  shopkeepers can  save  some  $10,000  to

$15,000 per shop on the upgrading work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin, Mr Ong Kian Min and Mr Sinnakaruppan,

among  others, observed that there is an oversupply of  shops

in  older HDB estates.  This observation was borne out by the

findings of the Retail 21 Committee which has suggested  that

the HDB reduce the number of shops.  The question, of course,

is,  reduce by how much?  HDB does not have the answer.   The

market and the shopkeepers themselves must decide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government understands that some shopkeepers in

these   areas,   especially   the  elderly   first-generation

shopkeepers,  may  wish  to retire  from  the  business.   To

facilitate  this,  HDB  will  introduce  a  pilot   Voluntary

Retirement Scheme for HDB shop tenants this year.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>

The  pilot scheme will involve about 500 HDB rental shops  at

selected areas where business is weak.  Eligible shop tenants

who  wish  to retire can voluntarily give up their  tenancies

and receive an ex-gratia payment of $48,000.  If response  to

the scheme is favourable, it will be extended.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to emphasise that the scheme is entirely

voluntary.   This  should allay Mr Chay Wai  Chuen's  concern

expressed  yesterday about the implications on the livelihood

of  those  who depend on their shops for income.  Shopkeepers

who  wish  to seek a fresh career in another sector  will  be

able  to  seek help from the Ministry of Manpower which  will

advise  on  job  opportunities and suggest suitable  training

courses.   Those  who  choose to continue  operating  in  the

vicinity  will receive assistance to upgrade their  business.

Their  shops  will  be grouped together for greater  business

synergy  and each tenant will receive a removal allowance  of

$5,000.  They will also be encouraged to make use of the  two

new programmes under Retail 21 to upgrade and modernise their

operations.

<br>1.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me stress that the $48,000 ex-gratia payment is not

in  lieu  of running their shops.  It is an ex-gratia payment

from Government to help them to decide whether they have  the

stamina  and the strength to carry on.  If they do not,  they

have a sweetener from the Government.  And if they do want to

carry  on, there is a package to help them to upgrade and  to

compete.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min yesterday suggested that HDB should

advise  shopkeepers  on  how to set up  shops,  how  much  to

tender,  etc.   This is really not HDB's job, and  I  do  not

think  HDB  is  in the best position to do so  in  the  first

place.  I would advise anyone who wishes to set up shop to do

their sums and weigh their risks before taking the plunge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Voluntary Retirement Scheme is meant for shop

tenants.  A few Members asked whether HDB could also buy back

shops from owners who wish to exit.  Sir,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>

the  answer  is  no.   It would not be  appropriate  for  the

Government  to  do  so.  The  Government cannot  protect  HDB

shopowners  against fluctuations in consumer demand  and  the

property  market.  Those who decided to buy their shops  have

to  accept  this business risk.  If they wish to  sell  their

shops,  they  can do so on the resale market.  HDB  tells  me

that most of the first-hand owners will be able to sell their

shops  above  their original purchase prices.  Alternatively,

to lighten their mortgage repayment burden, owners of 99-year

lease shops can adopt Mr Peh Chin Hua's suggestion to request

HDB to convert their shops to shorter 30-year leases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members suggested that HDB should give ex-gratia

payment  to such shopowners.  I would like to highlight  that

the  shopkeepers who bought their shops from HDB have already

enjoyed very large upfront discounts: $96,000 for shops  that

were  sold  on the 99-year lease and $48,000 for  those  that

were sold with a 30-year lease.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have also asked for rental and property tax

rebates.  I would like to point out that, in addition to  the

new  assistance  programme, these measures, in  other  words,

property  tax  rebates  and rental rebates,  are  already  in

place.  The 25% property tax rebate has been extended to June

this  year after which it will be replaced by a reduction  in

the  property tax rate from 12% to 10%, as announced  by  the

Finance Minister.  The Government will also continue with the

current  rental rebate until the end of this  year  and  will

review the situation before that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen and Mr Chng Hee Kok enquired whether

HDB  will  again sell shops under the Sale of Tenanted  Shops

Scheme.   Based on what we have heard so far, the HDB  retail

sector is still very weak and my view is that it will not  be

prudent   for  the  HDB  to  sell  shops  at  this  juncture.

Nevertheless, if there are specific requests from advisors, I

will ask HDB to consider each case on its own merits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, there are fundamental changes

affecting the business

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>

environment  and  livelihood of HDB  retailers.   Shopkeepers

themselves  must understand and take active steps to  respond

to  these  changes.   They  have to assess  their  individual

situation and they have to decide whether they want to remain

in  this trade and, if so, how to revitalise their businesses

to  successfully ride the wave of change.  On its  part,  the

Government  will  support HDB retailers  in  ways  that  will

reinforce  what  they do for themselves.  I hope  that,  over

time, these measures will bring sustained benefits, not  only

to  the  retailers, but also to their customers who  are  HDB

residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for the Environment would be

announcing  similar assistance measures for  stallholders  in

markets  and hawker centres which are managed by HDB and  the

Ministry of the Environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to the comments made on the

upgrading programme.  First of all, I wish to address Dr Wang

Kai  Yuen's  point about a review of the MUP and  IUP.   Sir,

over  the  last  10  years, the Main  and  Interim  Upgrading

Programmes that are being carried out by the Government  have

transformed the landscape of many parts of Singapore.   Older

HDB  towns  and estates, like Toa Payoh and MacPherson,  have

been  spruced  up.  They have new facilities, like  walkways,

playgrounds,  and  parks.   The flats  themselves  have  seen

improvements to their homes, like new bathroom finishes, main

doors  and  front windows and, in some cases,  an  additional

utility room.  Flat owners have seen their flats increase  in

value.  When their friends and relatives come to visit  them,

the  transformation is immediately obvious.  They can see the

difference.  So I believe that the MUP and IUP programmes are

valued  by the residents and that they serve a very important

purpose in transforming our HDB estates and making sure  that

they  do  not deteriorate into the slums that we see in  many

other parts of the world when we talk about public housing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upgrading programmes fulfil the promise by the

Government  that  it  will share budget  surpluses  with  the

people,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>

especially the lower income.  And that is the reason why  the

upgrading programmes are heavily subsidised by the Government

and  skewed in favour of the smaller flats.  For example, the

1-  to 3-room flat lessees pay around $3,000 per flat for the

standard  package, and this represents only about 7%  of  the

total  cost  of  the  upgrading.  And if  they  opt  for  the

additional  room,  the  space adding item,  their  co-payment

amount is around $10,000.  Is this good value for money?   If

you  take the last 10 years, the number of precincts that had

been polled, so far, we had 98 precincts that had been polled

for  MUP, at least 90% of flat owners had voted in favour  of

the  standard  package.  So I believe  the  answer  is,  yes.

Residents do find them very good value for money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the upgrading programmes are possible only because

our   people   continue  to  support  the  Government   which

consistently generates budget surpluses through policies  and

programmes which generate growth and which prudently  manages

national expenditures.  That is why in the implementation  of

the  MUP and IUP, the Government has given priority to  those

who  have actively supported these programmes.  Without them,

it would not have been possible.  It is as simple as that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have asked specific questions about the

upgrading  programme for this year.  I am pleased  to  inform

them  that  my Ministry will be introducing three initiatives

that will allow more HDB residents to benefit from upgrading.

First of all, MND will revise the age criterion for the  Main

and Interim Upgrading Programmes to enable the programmes  to

cover  more  flats.  Secondly, we will step up the  upgrading

schedules this year.  And, thirdly, we will introduce  a  new

Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) to complement the MUP and  the

IUP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, MUP and IUP. The age of an HDB block is one of

the   considerations  when  MND  selects  precincts  for  the

upgrading.   Currently,  HDB blocks which  are  completed  in

1975, or earlier, can be considered for the MUP.  HDB

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>

blocks  that  were  completed  between  1976  and  1983   are

considered  for IUP.  Based on these existing  criteria,  the

Government  has announced MUP and IUP for more  than  230,000

HDB  flats.   To  increase the number of HDB flats  that  can

benefit  from upgrading, I wish to inform Dr Teo Ho Pin  that

the  new cut-off age for the MUP will be HDB blocks completed

by  1980,  while HDB blocks completed between 1981  and  1986

will  be considered for the IUP.  In other words, HDB  blocks

that  are  between 15 and 20 years today can look forward  to

the  IUP, those that are at least 21 years will be considered

for the MUP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This revision of the age criterion signifies the

Government's commitment to the upgrading programmes on a long-term  basis  so  long  as  our  financial  situation  allows.

Furthermore,  as  the IUP is intended as a precursor  to  the

MUP,  hence  the term  "interim", the revised  criteria  will

allow  some HDB blocks that have already undergone IUP to  be

eligible for MUP.  With the revised criteria, another 240,000

flats  can be considered for upgrading, making it a total  of

540,000  flats, almost two thirds of the total stock  of  HDB

flats which are now within the ambit of the IUP and MUP.  The

additional  Government  expenditure  is  estimated  at   $3.9

billion for the MUP and $760 million for the IUP in the  next

10 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MND will use the new age criterion to select MUP

and  IUP  precincts for the year 2001 this year.  In view  of

our  strong  budget  position in  financial  year  2000,  the

Government   will  increase  the  number  of  precincts   for

upgrading  this year.  And MND will select 18  precincts  for

the  MUP  and 22 precincts for the IUP.  The numbers will  be

sustained next year if we continue to enjoy budget surpluses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP). Several Members have

asked  about lift upgrading for those blocks whose  lifts  do

not  stop  on every floor.  There are about 4,000 such  high-rise  HDB  blocks and they were all built before 1990.   Many

Members, Dr Teo Ho Pin, Mr Chng Hee Kok, Mr Sinnakaruppan, Mr

Ang Mong Seng, among others, have spoken about the need for a

separate lift upgrading

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>

programme.  Last year, the Inter-Ministerial Committee on the

Ageing Population also recommended that the Government should

progressively retrofit HDB flats with lift landings on  every

floor   to  improve  accessibility  and  mobility   for   our

residents,  especially the elderly and the  disabled.   I  am

pleased  to  announce  that  MND will  introduce  a  new  and

separate lift upgrading programme for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new LUP will provide all flats in high-rise HDB

blocks  built  before 1990 direct access  to  a  lift,  where

technically  feasible of course.  The  scope  of  works  will

include  addition of new lift, lift shaft, lift  landing  and

refurbishing of lift lobbies.  The LUP can be carried out  on

its  own  or together with the MUP and IUP.  This is a  major

exercise.  The total estimated cost is about $4.8 billion, if

we  are  talking of all the flats before 1990.  We  certainly

cannot  afford to implement it overnight.  It  will  take  us

many years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As lift upgrading is very costly, HDB will require all

flat  owners  in an HDB block, except those who live  on  the

ground  floor, because they do not benefit from it,  to  poll

and  to  co-pay for the lift upgrading works.  The co-payment

arrangement is in keeping with the philosophy adopted for the

MUP, where the Government subsidises most but not 100% of the

cost.   It  will give residents a sense of ownership  of  the

project and ensure that they consider carefully the need  for

such works when they are asked whether they want it or not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the case of the MUP, the Lift Upgrading Programme

will proceed only if at least 75% of eligible owners vote  in

favour.  The exact co-payment ratio and amount will depend on

the  flat type as well as the type of HDB blocks.  Generally,

the  smaller  flat type will pay less, as in  the  MUP.   The

Government will bear the lion's share of the cost  to  ensure

that the programme is affordable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several town councils have also indicated that they

would  like  to help make lift upgrading more affordable  for

their  residents.  Hence, MND has included town  councils  in

the  co-payment arrangement to help flat lessees  defray  the

cost of lift

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>

upgrading.  The town council should be allowed to  use  their

sinking funds for this purpose.  With the contributions  from

Government and town councils, the co-payment amount will be a

few  hundred  dollars per flat for the majority  of  lessees,

where the provision of lifts is relatively straightforward, a

few hundred dollars.  But for the so-called segmented blocks,

which Prof Toh mentioned just now, where additional lifts and

lift  shafts are needed, it can be more expensive.   However,

the  Government  will set a cap of $3,000 per  flat  on  each

share by the lessee and the town council.  In addition,  flat

owners  who need help in paying their share of the costs  can

make  use  of  several assistance schemes that are  currently

available for MUP.  HDB will release further details on  this

soon.

<br>2.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as other elderly and handicapped-friendly

features are concerned, such as those suggested by Prof.  Toh

See  Kiat,  I  wish to assure him that HDB will  continue  to

incorporate  these features in the upgrading  programmes,  as

well  as in the design of new flats, and it will continue  to

be  mindful  of  the need to provide such facilities  in  HDB

estates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wan touched upon the issue of SERS. I think he asked

whether  we  should do SERS instead of MUP  and  IUP,  and  I

explained earlier why I feel that there is still a continuing

need  for  the upgrading programmes.  Yes, we will  do  SERS,

because  MUP,  IUP  and SERS all contribute  to  the  overall

rejuvenation  of  our HDB estates, but they  serve  different

purposes.  The MUP and IUP serve one purpose, and SERS serves

another   purpose.   SERS  is,  in  effect,  a  redevelopment

programme that helps to optimise land use, as he pointed out.

So  we will continue to do all three, and we will select SERS

sites as and when they are appropriate, and announce them  at

the appropriate time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to the issues of allocation, pricing and

financing  of HDB flats which some other Members brought  up.

First of all, on the question of allocation, I agree

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>

with  Dr Teo Ho Pin that HDB's flat allocation system can  be

reviewed  to provide more options for flat buyers.  In  fact,

several  MPs  earlier  alerted me that  flat  applicants  are

actually  getting  their flats faster than  they  want  them.

This  is certainly a turnaround from the time when MPs  would

approach the Ministry and HDB to ask for flats to be  brought

forward  because their residents were waiting a long time  to

get  their  flats.  But I realise that, in certain cases,  it

does present certain problems.  I have, therefore, asked  HDB

to  review  its  flat  allocation  system  to  make  it  more

responsive to applicants' needs.  I am pleased to inform  him

that  HDB  will  pilot a new system called the build-to-order

system  later  this year, which will give  flat  buyers  more

flexibility  in timing, as well as a greater say and  control

over the location of their new flats.  Again, I will ask  HDB

to release the details later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua wanted to know whether the pricing of

HDB flats is linked to the prices of resale flats and private

properties,  or  whether  they are  independently  set.   The

Government's  objective is to encourage  home  ownership,  so

that every Singaporean family can have a stake in the nation.

So, the primary consideration in the pricing of HDB flats  is

to  ensure that the vast majority of Singaporeans, especially

the  young couples and the lower-income families, can  become

homeowners.  So, HDB takes into account the prevailing prices

of HDB resale flats, when it reviews the selling price of its

flats  every quarter.  This is because resale flats represent

the  true market value of HDB flats at any point in time, and

they  give  an  indication of Singaporeans'  willingness  and

ability  to  pay for their HDB flats.  It is not  appropriate

for  HDB to peg the selling prices of HDB flats to, say,  the

private residential property prices because, obviously,  they

are  catering to different markets.  But I can assure Mrs Lim

that  affordability of HDB flats is a paramount consideration

in the pricing of our HDB flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew Syn Pau suggested that we should introduce a

rental scheme.  Again,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>

I  reiterate that our objective is home ownership, so it does

not  make  sense  for us to encourage or set  up  a  separate

rental scheme in parallel with the ownership programme.  Yes,

some  young couples or families may want to rent.  There  are

ample  opportunities for them to do so.  So, HDB has no  plan

to implement a rental scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo asked whether we can help young couples to

purchase  HDB  flats in older estates.  What this  means,  of

course,  is  that those young couples who wish to  move  into

older  estates would have to buy resale flats from  the  open

market.   To  help them to do so, the HDB has the  CPF  grant

scheme,  either $30,000 or $40,000, depending  on  where  the

flats are, which can be used to meet the 20% downpayment  for

the  resale  flat.   They  can also use  their  CPF  Ordinary

Account  contributions for the 20% downpayment, and  this,  I

must point out, is already a special concession for buyers of

HDB  flats.  So there are no other schemes that are available

for young couples to buy into older estates, apart from these

two.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two more quick points. Mr Chng suggested that HDB

should  leave  the building of flats to the  private  sector.

Over the years, HDB has in fact taken active steps to involve

the  private sector in the public housing programme,  through

the  design-and-build scheme and, in fact, even  through  the

upgrading schemes, ie, the MUP and IUP.  With the closure  of

the  Executive flat queue about four or five years  ago,  the

HDB  also  farmed  out  the development  of  ECs  to  private

developers.   So,  yes,  HDB is already  doing  so  and  will

continue  to look for ways to involve the private  sector  in

public housing projects.  But it is not yet in a position  of

saying that it is not going to build any more flats, or it is

not going to build any more of the bigger flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, Mr Chew Heng Ching's point about studio

apartments.  He asked for a review of the scheme  for  studio

apartments.  I wish to inform him that we will take  note  of

his  comments,  and  I  will ask HDB  to  review  the  studio

apartment scheme to make it more accessible to the elderly.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I remind hon. Members that we have fallen

very far behind schedule on this amendment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Can I obtain a

clarification, Sir?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think we allow the other Members who

have   spoken  earlier  to  make  their  clarifications  very

quickly.  Mr Sinnakaruppan.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, I would like to clarify that in

the  present IUP where there is a budget for upgrading of the

lifts, the residents do not have to co-pay.  Is that a change

in the policy, now that the Minister says there is a need for

co-payment?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, we will detach the Lift Upgrading

Programme from both the MUP and IUP.  In other words, it will

now become a stand-alone programme.  So, if there is any lift

upgrading  to be considered for any precinct, this  will  now

come under the Lift Upgrading Programme and, therefore, a co-payment will be necessary.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Tan. Very quick clarification,

please.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Sir, I just want to

seek  a  clarification  from the  Minister  about  this  lift

upgrading.  We need 75% to agree for this upgrading.  But  if

the  lift landing is on alternate floors, there will only  be

50% who is going to support it.  And, if it is on every third

floor,  it  is  very likely that the others,  who  have  lift

landings,  will not support it.  So I am not so sure  whether

we can get 75% of the residents to agree.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I think the general principle is

that  where there is benefit to the residents - the  benefits

may be more to certain residents because they happen to be on

the  floor  where there is no lift, and the  benefit  to  the

resident who already has a lift landing may be less - but  it

is  in the overall interest of the block - so they will  have

to  take the overall interest into account.  There is already

a  precedent in the sense that some residents, in blocks that

have already voted under the additional Lift

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>

Upgrading  Programme  that  was introduced  last  year,  have

demonstrated,  through the encouragement of their  Member  of

Parliament,  the  Adviser, that there are  benefits  accruing

even to those who already have the lift on their floor.  I am

confident  that  they will be able to get that  75%  approval

vote.   It really depends on how we sell the benefits of  the

lift  upgrading programme and, of course, ultimately, on  the

amounts  that they would have to pay.  So I am a little  more

confident than the Member.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chiam, can you make your clarification

quickly?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, can I ask the Minister what he

means  by  giving priority to those who actively support  the

Government?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I think it means exactly what I said,

Sir.   There are several criteria required to be met  by  the

precincts  or  blocks,  if they are  to  be  chosen  for  the

upgrading programme.  These criteria include the age  of  the

block,  the location of the block - because we want  to  make

sure  that there is a spread throughout the island -  and  an

indication of support for the programme.  So, if there is  no

indication of their support for the programme or if,  indeed,

the  residents  in that area do not want the programme,  then

that precinct will not be chosen for upgrading, or it will be

chosen   for  upgrading  at  a  lower  priority  than   other

precincts.   So, that is what I mean.  I think  it  does  not

make sense for us to select a precinct which does not ask for

upgrading.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ker, can you carry on?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I make a further clarification,

Sir?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am afraid we have run out of time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, as an Opposition Member, I felt ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chiam, I said we have run out of time,

and I have to ask Dr Ker to continue.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, HDB residents are

often troubled by two problems:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Spalling concrete from the ceiling, exposing the

rusty metal bars; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Leaks from the kitchen and bathroom ceilings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faced with such complaints, the HDB's reply is,

invariably,  that the residents concerned should  be  jointly

liable for the repairs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the problem of spalling concrete, the HDB would

normally  undertake  one  repair  job  free  of  charge  but,

thereafter,  if the same problem emerges again,  the  lessees

would  have  to  get their own contractors to carry  out  the

repairs,  at  their  own expense.   The problem  of  spalling

concrete occurs in the older flats.  It is said that, at that

time, the HDB was in a hurry to complete the construction  of

the  flats, and the sand imported from Indonesia and Malaysia

for use by the contractors had very high salt content.  After

some time, the metal bars became corroded because of the salt

in  the  concrete.  The rust formed on the metal bars  caused

them to expand, resulting in the spalling of the cement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of repair, if the rust on the metal bars is

not  properly treated and thoroughly removed, the  bars  will

become rusty again, and the cement will spall again.  Looking

at  the  exposed  metal  bars on the ceiling,  the  residents

cannot  help feeling uneasy and stressed.  When the HDB  asks

the residents to rectify the matter themselves, the residents

would  normally engage some small-time contractors to do  the

job.   Not  having  the relevant expertise,  the  contractors

would  just patch up, plaster and paint over the part of  the

ceiling.  Soon after, the spalling would appear again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaks from the kitchen and bathroom ceiling are another

nagging  problem. This may be due to the water-proof membrane

at  the flooring of the unit above being defective.  It could

have  been  damaged  by  the resident upstairs  when  he  was

repairing the floor tiles too.  The dirty water dripping down

from the ceiling

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>

would  certainly  affect the daily living  of  the  residents

downstairs.  What HDB does is to ask the residents  to  share

in  the  cost of repairs.  The resident downstairs is not  at

fault at all.  Apart from suffering the inconvenience of  the

dripping water, he has also to bear part of the repair  cost.

This  seems to be somewhat illogical and unfair.  It is  like

the stupid rulings made by the foolish mandarins who punished

both  the plaintiff and defendant irrespective of who was  at

fault  we  saw  in the Teochew wayangs in our  younger  days.

Sometimes,  even when the resident downstairs is  willing  to

pay  for his share of the repairs, the resident upstairs  may

not  be prepared to come up with the money.  This will result

in the matter being dragged on indefinitely and unsettled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope that the HDB will take some positive steps to

help  the  residents.  For the problem of  spalling  concrete

from the ceiling, the HDB should engage contractors with  the

relevant expertise to carry out the repairs.  Otherwise,  the

small-time  contractors engaged by the  residents  themselves

may  not  have  the  expertise and  they  may  just  do  some

perfunctory  job of patching up.  The same problem  will  re-surface again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for leaks from the ceiling, HDB should investigate

whether  the  water-proof membrane has been  damaged  by  the

resident  upstairs.  If so, the resident upstairs  should  be

solely  liable  for  the repair costs.  If  not,  HDB  should

arrange  for contractors with the expertise to carry out  the

repairs and, subsequently, ask the residents to jointly  bear

the  repair  costs.   In this way, the repair  work  will  be

carried  out  expeditiously and properly, and  the  pointless

quarrels between the affected residents can be avoided.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, for ceiling leakage,

I support what Dr Ker has said.  According to the current HDB

regulations, if there is a leakage in the ceiling of a  flat,

both  the  residents  above  and  below  would  have  to   be

responsible for the repair and pay for the costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon receiving complaints about the ceiling leakage, HDB

often  tells  the residents affected that the  ceiling  is  a

party

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>

structure,  separating the unit above from  the  unit  below.

Hence,  the  two families have to share the cost  of  repair.

HDB  would not be responsible.  The officials would tell  the

resident below to discuss with the resident above on  how  to

proceed with the repair and share the cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore is a multiracial society, there is

sometimes    some    difficulty    in    communication.    So

misunderstanding  could arise when they  try  to  communicate

with  each other and this may lead to a conflict.  It is  bad

for  our  social  cohesiveness.  When such a problem  is  not

resolved, the residents staying below will have to  carry  an

umbrella  whenever they use the toilet.   As  both  lack  the

knowledge  of  flat  maintenance, they could  have  different

views  when approaching the contractor to repair the leakage,

and on the question of cost sharing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that HDB, as the landlord, should come in to

help.   After ascertaining the cost of the leakage,  the  HDB

could  get  a  qualified contractor to undertake  the  repair

under a standard package, and at a reasonable cost.  The work

done should be checked by the HDB.  To alleviate the hardship

of  the residents, HDB should bear one-third or more of  such

repair cost.  I hope that HDB would accept my suggestions  so

as  to  render a better service for the bulk of the residents

in their estates.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, many of the flats in Potong

Pasir  estate, which were completed in a hurry in 1984 to  be

in  time for the election that year, were poorly built.   The

workmanship  was sloppy and the materials used were  of  poor

quality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gable end of the building has two walls. The

outside  wall comprises fence-faced red bricks and the  inner

wall  is  made of cement blocks.  What has happened  is  that

over the last ten years or so, rainwater has seeped into  the

gable  end  walls and the water gets collected in  the  space

between  the  two  walls. Due to bad workmanship,  the  water

trapped in the space between the two walls is unable to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>

escape.   The holes in the lower end of the outside wall  are

blocked by fallen cement during construction.  As a result of

poor  workmanship,  the water in the space  between  the  two

walls is unable to escape and got trapped in the space.   The

water  can rise to about five or six feet.  The trapped water

seeps  into  the wall in the inside of the rooms  and  causes

them  to be very damp.  The paint in the wall would peel off,

no  matter  how many times the residents repainted the  walls

over with a new coat of paint.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this kind of a problem, my town council at Potong

Pasir  has to break the inner wall, draw the water  out,  get

rid  of the fallen cement debris at the bottom of that space.

After that, we build the wall and give that wall a fresh coat

of  paint.  We have done this operation for many flats.   The

operations have taken up a lot of effort and finances on  the

part  of  my  town council.  These repair works need  not  be

necessary if the HDB had, in the first place, done  its  work

properly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only had such complaints of water seepage and

peeling walls been satisfactorily done up by my town council,

but  other  complaints  of spalling concrete,  choked  sewage

drains, uneven drains, sunken aprons and water seepage at the

ceiling  had  all been repaired by my town council  at  great

cost.   I  bring  these  matters up  to  highlight  the  poor

workmanship of the HDB and ask the Minister whether  the  HDB

is  willing to accept responsibility for the poor workmanship

in  those flats and whether it is willing to absorb the  cost

of  repairs.  After all, HDB is the landlord and it has  been

17  years since these flats were built.  It is time that  HDB

spent  some  money  to  make good  the  faults  due  to  poor

workmanship.  We, at Potong Pasir, do not receive CIPC  funds

and  the HDB should take this into consideration and be  more

generous on us.  Those repairs are necessary.  They  are  not

to  beautify the flats, but are required to make them livable

or tenanted condition.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I was chatting

recently to a young woman.  She was telling me about her

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>

family.  It is a very typical Singaporean family, a family of

five  - mum, dad, two children and grandma.  Mum and dad  are

both 50, "O" level holders, both working.  She is a graduate,

about  to get started to work.  Her youngest sister is  about

20  and is in university.  They live in a HDB apartment,  for

which  there  is a loan, still being paid over  the  next  10

years  or so.  The family income is about $4,000-plus.   They

are  a happy family and life has been very comfortable.   Dad

is your true-blue solid Singaporean, very appreciative of how

he has seen life improve over the years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It puts a human face to the recently published Census

2000  report.   The  family  sits  squarely  in  the  50-60th

percentile  of average household incomes.  Mum  and  dad  are

also your typically asset rich, cash poor Singaporean couple.

There is very little in their CPF balance and they would  not

be saving very much between now and retirement.  There is not

much left over monthly, with putting the younger daughter  to

university, plus some additional expenses for medication  for

dad   who   had  an  angioplasty  done  a  few  months   ago.

Presumably, the daughters would make some contribution to mum

and  dad  after  they started working, even  after  they  get

married and start families of their own.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this presumption, mum and dad's financial

planning  for  retirement rests entirely in converting  their

apartment  they live in into funds to see them through  their

retirement  years.   In  a recent sitting  of  Parliament  in

February, the Minister of State, Dr John Chen, shared with us

that  the  Ministry  had  explored  reverse  mortgages  as  a

possible source of additional income for elderly HDB  lessees

for  their  retirement needs, but had come to the  conclusion

that  it  was  not  a good idea as the monthly  returns  were

meagre and there was a risk of losing their homes at the  end

of  the  term.   Dr Chen also shared that other schemes  were

available to assist elderly lessees, for example, those  with

3-room  flats could sublet one or two or even the whole  flat

to derive

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>

some  income.  The last option, of course, is for the  senior

citizens to downgrade to a smaller apartment.  There was also

a  detailed  discussion  in  the Inter-Ministerial  Committee

Report  on  the  Ageing  Population of  many  good  ideas  of

building more smaller flats, integrated with housing  estates

for senior citizens.  In fact, HDB has already done very good

work in developing its studio apartment scheme which, by  all

accounts, has been very successful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this seems like a very good proposition right now,

might  there  be  concern that when the  aging  baby  boomers

double  and triple the numbers of over-65 a couple of decades

down  the  road, would there be too many downgraders  in  the

market at the same time, looking to sell, and in fact,  would

the  aging  properties be able to hold their value  by  then?

Perhaps,  the Minister could share with us his views  of  the

scenario at that future time and what else we would  have  to

be  paying  attention to or addressing to try and  make  sure

that that scenario is a happy one.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, it is in the

interest of the nation to promote family values.  It is right

to  encourage  people to get married and  to  have  children.

However, in our enthusiasm, we must also recognise the rights

of  individuals to choose their future.  There will  be  some

who choose to remain single.  There will be others who end up

being  single  after  the breakup of a  relationship.   These

would  include single parents.  Whilst we can and  should  do

more  to encourage people to form family units and to  remain

together, some marriages would just not work out.  There  are

a  myriad of reasons why people would choose to remain single

and why some marriages break up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a successful nation, we can and should cater for

those  who  by  choice, or by default,  are  singles.   Being

single  does  not prevent them from being active contributing

citizens.   Some  may  even  care  more  for  Singapore  than

families which care only for themselves.  The most

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>

important  possession for anyone must be the  roof  over  the

head.  Having a home provides the security and peace of mind.

It  is  the base from which one can function.  It is a  place

one  can  return to, after a hard day's work  and  enjoy  the

privacy and comfort invested in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not every single would wish to live alone. Some would

prefer  to  live  with  family  members  who  welcome   them.

However,  there should be provisions for such individuals  to

make a choice, especially if he or she matters.  I hasten  to

add  that when addressing this issue, the Ministry must avoid

the  convenience of clustering units to be made available for

singles.   They  are  not infirm and do not  require  special

services.  Clustering tends to stigmatise.  Singles are  also

Singaporeans  and  should  be  catered  for  like  any  other

Singaporeans.   Whilst it is essential that more  people  get

married  earlier and have children, we cannot  and  must  not

marginalise the singles.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Sir, I had intended to speak on the

problems  of ceiling leaks between neigbours.  But my  fellow

parliamentary colleagues have already spoken in depth on this

issue  and I would not repeat it.  I would, however, like  to

join  them  to  appeal  to  the HDB  to  use  its  influence,

resources and power as the landlord to expedite the solutions

to the problems wherever necessary and appropriate.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr John Chen Seow Phun):</b> Sir, I would first reply to Members on the

problems of spalling concrete and water leakage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, ceiling leakage usually is due to wear and tear

and  natural deterioration of the water proofing membrane  on

the  toilet floor over time.  Because the ceiling is a common

party  structure, under HDB's lease agreement, the  two  flat

owners, who share the structure, are jointly responsible  for

its  maintenance  and repairs.  I think  Members  have  noted

that.  I want to first make clear that the responsibility  is

on  the lessees.  However, I want to assure Members that  the

HDB will assist flat owners to resolve their problems. Flat

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>

owners who require assistance can approach HDB branch offices

and  HDB  will help to investigate the cause of the leak  and

suggest remedial action.  HDB will also help to bring the two

parties  together  and recommend suitable  contractors.   HDB

cannot  take over the responsibility of repairing  the  leaks

because  the lessees have to assume responsibility.  This  is

because the problem is due to normal wear and tear.   Let  me

inform  Members that HDB build flats according to  prevailing

standards  of building control. Therefore, if there  is  poor

workmanship, the HDB will usually ask the building contractor

to  make good.  But if it is due to wear and tear, then after

the  liability period of one year, the lessees would have  to

assume responsibility for repair.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For spalling concrete, let me correct Dr Ker that it is

not related to the salt content of the construction materials

used,  but  is  a  result of a natural deterioration  process

caused  by  carbonization.   When  the  surface  concrete  is

carbonated, corrosion of the steel bars within the slabs sets

in, causing the concrete surrounding the steel bars to crack.

Again, here, HDB flat owners will have to repair the spalling

concrete in their flats on their own.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to Mr Chiam's question about poor

workmanship,  as  I explained, HDB buildings  met  prevailing

building control standards and very likely, as the flats were

built  in 1984, I am sure, after so many years, deterioration

will  take place.  He mentioned about the specific cases.   I

would  ask  HDB to take another look if it is really  due  to

poor workmanship.

<br>2.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to Dr Jennifer Lee's points. Last year, the

Inter-Ministerial  Committee (IMC) on the  Ageing  Population

recommended  a  policy framework to deal with the  challenges

posed  by  a  greying society.  The IMC recommended  that  we

should  allow  residents to age in place.  So the  ageing  in

place  is  a  very important concept for the  future  housing

needs  of  our  elderly.   Also, the  IMC  recommended  other

housing options for the elderly and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>

ways  to  reinforce  financial security in  their  retirement

years.  So, to prepare for this greying population, HDB  will

continue  to  incorporate elderly-friendly  features  in  the

design  of  new  HDB  flats  and estates,  and  also  in  the

upgrading of older ones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee also mentioned about studio apartments that HDB

has  built.   The  studio apartment scheme  will  enable  the

elderly  to  sell their existing flats and move into  smaller

apartments  to  generate income for their  retirement  needs.

HDB  also grants the elderly who are in financial difficulty,

priority  allocation to its rental flats  on  a  case-by-case

basis.  And HDB will continue to monitor the demand for these

housing  options and adjust its supply accordingly.  It  will

also continue to explore other ways to meet the housing needs

of our elderly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, let me remind the Member that HDB's

responsibility  is to provide a roof over the  head  for  the

elderly.   What is important is that these elderly must  also

do  active  financial  planning  during  their  golden  years

because, if they do not, then they will have difficulties  in

later  years.   That  is why the IMC also  recommended  other

financial  security programmes, like increasing  the  Special

Account  contribution and also introducing the  Supplementary

Retirement Scheme.  Coupled with the housing options provided

by  the HDB, the ageing in place concept can be fulfilled  in

future years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to Mr Gerard Ee's question about

singles.   I  would  like  to  assure  the  House  that   the

Government recognises the contribution of singles.   However,

there  are  two important considerations when we address  the

housing  policies for singles.  First, our pro-family  social

framework  which  is  critical to our  social  stability  and

economic  survival  and, second, the need for  optimal  space

allocation  in  land  scarce  Singapore.   Based   on   these

considerations, we have decided to allow singles aged 35  and

above  to  buy 3-room resale flats in non-urban areas.   This

would give them a sufficiently large

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>

pool of flats throughout Singapore to choose from.  So it  is

not  clustering them into some areas.  All in all, there  are

160,000  HDB  3-room or smaller flats that are available  for

the singles under this scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two singles aged 35 or above may also apply to buy a

resale  flat  of  any flat type in any location.   To  assist

singles  in  their flat purchases, HDB provides each  single,

who is a first time flat buyer, a $11,000 CPF housing grant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On rental flats, HDB has a limited stock of such flats

that  are  let  out  at subsidised rents.   These  flats  are

available only to low income families who have a greater need

for housing than singles.  Singles who wish to live in rental

housing  may sublet from HDB lessees, or pair up with another

single to qualify for a HDB rental flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have answered all the questions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, in speaking on this topic, I

wish  to  declare  my  interest as a director  of  a  company

involved in the construction trade.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the construction industry is going through

difficult times.  The Government's efforts to pump  prime  it

by  stepping  up infrastructural projects and  public  sector

building  programmes  within the next  1-2  years  will  help

relieve   some  of  the  pressure  the  industry  is  facing.

Nevertheless,  there will be a shake up in the  industry  and

many smaller construction companies or contractors are likely

to fold up within the next 1-2 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our local construction industry is made up of numerous

relatively  small to medium sized contractors, mostly  family

run  and  controlled.  There are a number of larger  publicly

listed  construction companies but, generally, they are  also

controlled   and  run  by  families  and  a   few   principal

shareholders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the way forward is for the industry to

quickly  consolidate,  and  the  Government  could  force   a

marriage among the construction companies.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>

current phase of reform in the construction industry  is  too

slow.   This  is  understandable, given that  many  of  these

companies  are  owner run, and owners of different  companies

have  their  own pride and cultural differences.  This  makes

their marriage difficult, if not impossible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Construction 21 Report, which was released in

October 1999, calls for a revamp of the contractors' registry

with  the  aim  of  introducing more  rigorous  criteria  for

contractors'  turnover,  financial resources,  track  record,

professional  management and so on.  These will differentiate

the   better   contractors  from  the   rest,   quicken   the

consolidation  of  the  industry, encourage  the  mergers  of

contractors  and help build a core of able local contractors,

which  could  compete competitively for the bigger  projects,

both  locally and abroad.  I therefore urge the  Minister  to

ask the Building Control Authority to speed up the revamp  of

the contractors' registry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the longer term forward is for us to consciously

develop  and  strengthen our promising local  contractors  in

order  that  they could compete offshore for  projects.   Our

banks  have  expanded overseas.  Our manufacturing  companies

are  penetrating overseas markets and investing abroad.   Our

service companies are also regionalising.  There is no reason

why our construction companies cannot do the same.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of our medium to bigger and more established

construction  companies have good track  records.   They  are

good  in their respective fields or expertise.  Collectively,

they  can  be a force to be reckoned with, and could  compete

competitively for projects abroad.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to propose that we look into forming a

consortium of construction companies, which could include one

or  two  GLCs,  with  the aim of exporting  our  construction

expertise  overseas  by  tapping  on  the  huge  market   for

infrastructural  projects available in our ASEAN  neighbours,

India,  Bangladesh, Middle East and China.  Over  time,  this

consortium   of  companies  can  expand  to  be   world-class

companies.  I would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>

suggest  that  the  Government, through the Building  Control

Authority or the Trade Development Board, conduct a study  on

the  viability  of  this  proposal in consultation  with  the

industry players, and perhaps initiate the formation of  this

consortium.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, players in

the construction industry range from entrepreneurs, builders,

suppliers,  professionals to home buyers.  I wish to  declare

that I am an architect in private practice.  My colleagues in

the  construction  industry said that  I  must  convince  the

Minister that the SMEs and the construction industry continue

to  suffer,  and have still not recovered.  More importantly,

there are no signs on the ground that indicate the likelihood

of  recovery soon.  The four years of decline since 1997  had

hurt the industry and its sustainability.  They are trying to

cope.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to reduce the cost of business without

affecting quality is a continuing struggle.  The reduction of

tax  in  the  Budget  will help, but tax  rebates  will  only

benefit those who have made profits.  The industry is not  in

this happy state.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Government agencies streamline and rationalise

their  operations  to be more productive,  too  often,  their

unproductive  works are simply passed to the private  sector.

I  ask the Minister to look into operational procedures which

have  an  impact down stream.  In a downturn,  public  sector

work  is  critical to the private sector.  Of the $12 billion

works  in  the public sector, a disproportionate  volume  was

undertaken  by  a Government-linked consultancy  corporation,

leaving very few to private consultants.  Contracts,  on  the

other hand, are being tendered and awarded at unrealistically

low prices.  This situation cannot go on without detriment to

the whole industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Construction 21 blueprint is a historical milestone

for  the  industry, as it adopts a total system  approach  to

deal  with  the  problems of the industry.  The  consultative

approach  involving  all  players in the  construction  value

chain is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>

especially   significant.   Following  the  Construction   21

blueprint,   the   construction  industry  joint   committee,

comprising the presidents of the various professional  bodies

and   trade  associations,  was  formed  to  respond  to  the

Construction  21 initiatives.  They identified the  need  for

the  present  exploitative attitudes to be discarded,  and  a

common  code  of conduct to be drawn up.  It  is  clear  that

every  player  has  to  act fairly, equitably  and  ethically

towards  one  another, serving the public and  their  clients

with honesty and impartiality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is becoming increasingly obvious that for the

advancement of the construction industry as a whole, and  for

the  achievement of a level of professionalism, it  is  vital

that  the  role  of  each  player in  the  industry  must  be

sustainable.  I ask the Minister to support the  industry  in

its endeavours and to license all parties in the construction

industry, so that a code of conduct can be enforced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consultants and contractors undertaking public sector

projects  face a procurement procedure called  the  IM.   All

Government  agencies follow it faithfully, but  its  contents

are  shrouded  in  mystery to the private sector.   Will  the

Minister  make the IM transparent to players in the industry?

It  seems  that  the selection of consultancy  services  must

follow  a tender process, similar to buying pencils.   Surely

procuring  professional  services  cannot  follow  this  same

route.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Law, last week, confirmed that the

Government will respect intellectual property rights, and yet

we  see  conditions in the procurement process requiring  all

design  submissions to be surrendered to Government agencies.

The  design  and  build  (D&B) tender  system,  while  it  is

supported, is only one procurement method with the  intention

of  bringing about an integration in the industry.  In  fact,

application  in Singapore is less than perfect  with  diverse

versions  with the sole intention to passing all  risks.   In

Japan,  it  has been successful because D&B tenders generally

involve a more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>

social  conscious mindset, and only a very small  handful  of

contractors  are  invited  to participate  per  project.   In

addition,  they are often negotiated contracts,  rather  than

contracts by tender.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industry wants to be more productive, but how can it

if for some Government projects, it is not unusual to have 30

teams  of  consultants  and builders  preparing  designs  and

details  sufficiently  for pricing.  The  manpower  cost  and

wastage of resources is debilitating.  As an example, in  the

current  D&B  tender for the Defence Science  and  Technology

Agency, for an expansion of a single building block, together

with some alterations and additions, 48 teams have signed  up

to participate, giving an extremely conservative cost for the

preparation  of  the tender at $50,000 per  team.   The  cost

expended  would be $2.4 million, when the contract  of  $3-$4

million is 10-12 times the value of the eventual professional

fees  for  the  project.  There must be  a  more  intelligent

system  to  reduce  the  amount of wastage  of  manpower  and

resources.   Perhaps  the HDB's system of pre-qualifying  not

more  than  five  teams and inviting  them  to  tender  on  a

rotational  basis  could  be adopted.   Alternatively,  there

could  be  two  stages, where the first  stage  is  based  on

pricing of the rough order of merit where the extremely  high

and   extremely  low  tenders  are  discarded,  and  only   a

reasonable range of tenders in relation to the budget goes on

to the next stage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the Government, through its champion agency, the

BCA,  to  review the various D&B tender processes devised  by

the  various  agencies to optimise the use  of  valuable  and

limited  human  resources.  Otherwise, the D&B  process  will

bleed  the  consultants and, eventually, it will  come  to  a

point where less effort will be invested and the country will

suffer  the poor work due to the unproductive misuse  of  D&B

tenders.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>

all  solution,  and  we must not forget  the  perfectly  good

conventional design and build.

<br>2.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we must not forget the many young Singaporeans

who  are aspiring to buy private property for the first  time

and  for their own use, especially at present when the prices

of  property  have dropped dramatically due to  the  economic

crisis.   The  Government's anti-speculative  measures  which

have  been  successful  in  dampening  speculation  are   now

preventing  these  young Singaporeans  from  achieving  their

dreams.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Government consider reducing the downpayment

from 20% to 10% of the cost of the property or stipulating  a

cash  downpayment of 10%, with the balance 10% paid from CPF?

As  these  buyers  tend to live in the  property,  the  anti-speculation tax could remain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the original anti-speculation rules are not modified,

these  young people would miss their one chance in a lifetime

to buy their own private homes now when there is a surplus of

units and the prices have bottomed out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister tells us that spring has arrived and maybe

there  are  even  some  blossoms in the  flower  beds.   But,

please, Sir, there are still patches of snow on the ground.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, on world-class construction

companies, I would like to ask the Minister some questions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What are the measures taken by BCA to nurture world-class construction firms?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) How do we benchmark local construction firms

against global construction players?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) How is BCA acting as a regulator or authority to

upgrade  the  construction industry?  How do we  measure  the

performance  of  BCA?   What are  the  targets  set  for  the

construction industry to upgrade?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next cut, Sir, on building defects, my questions are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What are the measures adopted by BCA to reduce the

occurrence  of building defects in newly completed buildings?

What   are  the  yardsticks  used  by  BCA  to  monitor   the

effectiveness of such measures?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Is there a set of national building quality

standards  made available to consumers as a layman  guide  on

building defects?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Can BCA allocate funds to conduct regular consumer

education programmes on building defects?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my questions on tender award system are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Can BCA review the tender award criteria and

provide guidelines on how tenders can be awarded according to

track  record and performance for both the public and private

sectors?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Can BCA set up a web-based database with

information on the quality of work of completed projects such

as on time completion, CONQUAS score, buildable score, etc?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On licensing of contractors:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Why is BCA refusing to license contractors and sub-contractors to ensure that construction works are done

professionally   with  high  quality  and   safety,   despite

widespread bad practices in the industry?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What further measures can BCA do to promote good

construction practices?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What teeth does BCA have against contractors who

adopt unscrupulous practices at the expense of consumers?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> With so many questions, I think, Prof.

Koo,  you  better  respond now, otherwise there  may  not  be

enough time for you.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee):</b> Sir, on

behalf

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>

of  my  Minister, I want to thank all Members who have spoken

on behalf of the industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MND and BCA are both very concerned about the issues

raised   and,  indeed,  we  have  been  applying  our   minds

religiously and diligently to these problems.  Mr Chew and Mr

Goh  painted a rather pessimistic picture of the state of the

industry.   To  be  sure, the boom times of  the  1990s  were

temporarily over.  But the industry is consolidating and  the

worse,  I think, may be over.  I have distributed a table  on

the state of the construction industry to all of you, and you

will  see from the table that the construction demand in  the

year  2000  actually grew by 42% over 1999 to $18.6  billion.

So  this  is the first sign that the worse has turned around.

The  second  indicator  is that the building  and  the  civil

engineering  components  of  the  construction  demand   have

actually  gone up.  Building demand, $3.8 billion last  year;

$5.5  billion  forecast this year.  Civil  engineering,  $1.1

billion  last  year; $2.8 billion this year.   Insiders  will

know  that  most of the jobs generated for local  contractors

and workers lie in the building and civil engineering works.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew asked how fast can BCA speed up the revamp of

the  contractors' registry system.  We are working on a  fast

track.   We  have spoken to SCAL.  We have formed a committee

together  and we intend to firm up the register  sometime  in

the  middle  of  this year.  The register  will  tighten  the

requirements for some grades of contractors, and the idea  is

to  make sure that these contractors who qualify for the best

grades are of certain size and competence.  Size is important

because  competence is the function of size.  As Mr Chew  has

rightly pointed out, banks need to merge to become bigger  to

go abroad, and so do contractors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo asked many questions. I am afraid I may not have

time to answer him.  But he asked several relevant ones.  One

is  why  do  we  not license contractors now?   Licensing  of

contractors would be a long-term agenda.  In the short and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>

medium-term,   we  would  like  to  revamp  the  contractors'

registry  system  to  make sure that our contractors  are  of

certain  size and with certain competence.  As it is now,  it

is  impossible  to enforce licensing requirements  because  a

licensed contractor can always sub-contract his or her job to

unlicensed contractors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we judge BCA's performance? BCA is both a

regulator  as well as a promoter.  As a regulator, you  judge

BCA's  performance by the buildings in Singapore.   Are  they

safe  or  not?  The answer must be a "yes".  BCA  is  also  a

promoter.   So  BCA promotes the industry.  It is  trying  to

revamp the industry.  It also tries to educate consumers.  It

is  working  with  CASE  to raise awareness  on  the  quality

consciousness.  It has implemented over the years the CONQUAS

score,  which is the national benchmark on quality, and  this

CONQUAS score is available on BCA's website.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is the Government helping contractors? There are

many schemes.  Government is providing a $10 million R&D Fund

and  a $10 million Industry Productivity Fund.  There is  the

existing Local Enterprises Technical Assistance Scheme  which

contractors  are already tapping into.  There  are  also  the

existing   Trade  Development  Board  Scheme  and  Investment

Allowance Scheme.  All these schemes are being tapped by  the

contractors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tender prices - this is a perennial complaint. Dr Teo

and Mr Goh Chong Chia have raised it.  Government tenders are

not  awarded solely on price.  Price is one of the  criteria.

It  is an important criterion.  It is not the only criterion.

Many   contracts  over  the  years  have  been   awarded   to

contractors  who  did not submit the lowest tender.   Because

many  contracting  jobs  are  prequalified,  contractors  who

submit their tenders are judged on a level playing field, and

price  becomes an important selection criterion.  On  Mr  Goh

Chong Chia's question on whether the IM procedure can be made

public,  I  will  raise  this concern with  the  Ministry  of

Finance, which is in charge of IM procedures.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1051</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the questions which I do not have time to answer, I

will ask my staff to reply to Members directly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, the question I really have is

this.   While  it  is  very  encouraging  to  see  that   the

Government  has started this scheme late last year,  I  would

like  to  ask whether, in addition to looking at the priority

for  older  estates,  there are wards where  there  are  more

private  estates than public estates.  Can there  be  greater

priority given to the many residents who have been supporting

the Government?  The two MPs, who are raising this topic, are

from Kreta Ayer-Tanglin GRC, and we know that there are a lot

more  private estates there.  I hope that the Government  can

consider upgrading the flats in this GRC.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Sir, I would like to add my call again

for  more funds to be set aside for the upgrading of  private

housing estates and for this programme to be expedited.  Last

year, only five lucky estates were selected.  There are  many

more  old  estates  that could do with  a  comprehensive  and

systematic upgrading programme.  As the construction industry

has  been  in  a  slump for a number of  years  now,  perhaps

bringing  forward  some of these upgrading  programmes  would

also help to boost the construction sector and save money for

the Government, as the cost will be lower too.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, I thank both speakers

who have spoken on behalf of their residents.  This time last

year,  the  Ministry announced the Estate Upgrading Programme

(EUP).   I am pleased to announce that this year we  will  be

calling  for nominations from the advisers again,  after  the

COS  debate, and we will do a selection towards  the  end  of

this  year  and,  hopefully, we will be able  to  announce  a

second  batch  of EUP candidates at the end of this  year  or

early next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has set aside an EUP budget of $40

million,  up  to the year 2005, and this includes  the  $18.4

million  set aside for batch one EUP.  As to whether priority

will  be  given  to  estates which have predominantly  landed

property in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>

character, I will ask my staff to consider the criteria.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the fish farms that I would

like to speak on are ornamental fish farms and not fish farms

that rear fish for the table.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans have a talent for breeding ornamental fish.

The  rearing of ornamental fish for export has become  a  big

home-grown industry.  Singapore has made a name for itself as

the ornamental fish capital of the world with a 30% share  of

the  international market.  Singapore is the largest exporter

of  ornamental fish.  The total export value of such fish  is

about $76 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, therefore, I was a bit surprised that in the

Straits  Times, there was a report of the Government clearing

up  many of these fish farms which are in the outlying areas.

The  report concerns 36 fish farms in Fish Farm Road 1, 2 and

3  of  Old Tampines Road.  My fear is that with resettlement,

these ornamental fish farms may be bogged down by heavy costs

when they are resettled in agrotechnology parks and they  may

not  be  able to survive.  My concern is whether or  not  the

Government  should  slow down on this resettlement  and  give

them a chance to survive.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, Mr Chiam is right that we

want  to  promote  the  export of ornamental  fish.   In  our

agrotechnology park in Lim Chu Kang, we have set aside  farms

for  such  activity.  The farms that he mentioned were  being

relocated  from  Tampines because  the  land  there  will  be

required  for industrial development.  The tenants have  been

informed  about this long ago, and they are also compensated.

On  top  of  that,  to  enable them to  continue  with  their

business,  AVA  has made over-30 blocks of  farmland  in  our

agrotechnology  park available to them for tender.   Four  of

them  have successfully tendered for such land and  the  rest

did  not participate in the tenders for reasons of their own.

AVA will help those relocating to the agrotechnology park  to

complete  the  development of their  new  farms  as  soon  as

possible.   AVA  will  also continue  to  provide  them  with

technical support and training, to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>

enable  them  to upgrade their farming operations  to  export

higher value-added fish.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Teo, I think we have time to let you

ask your question.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, may I ask the Ministry whether they

will  allocate  agricultural land for  high-rise  farming  in

Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, the answer is that the

farmers  are  allowed to do so, if they find it  economically

viable.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, can I ask the

Minister  whether he will set standards, foster  and  certify

organic  farming  in  Singapore and supplying  countries  for

vegetables?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, AVA allows the use of any

farming methods, as long as the produce is safe to eat.   For

those  who  are  interested  in organic  farming,  there  are

already available international standards to follow.  If they

find it economically viable to do so, they are welcome to  do

so.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Since we have one last person, we might

as well allow Dr Lee to finish her topic.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, may I ask for a clarification?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right, very quickly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> I said to "set standards, foster and

certify   organic  farming".   He  only  answers  the   first

question.   Does  he  mean he will not foster  and  will  not

certify?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, there is no need to do

that.   As  I said, there are already existing standards  and

the  farmers can use those standards.  AVA will look at  them

and will support those standards.

<br>3.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Thank you, Sir. I guess I should cut

everything down and just ask a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>

question  as  well.   We  were  talking  about  golf  courses

yesterday  and  parks  as  well have a  tremendous  feel-good

feeling for all our residents if we want to make this  little

city  state of ours a really good place to live in, both  for

our  own  citizens as well as to attract talents from abroad.

Could  we  also please allocate more land for our  parks  and

actually speed up developments?  If you just take a  look  at

utilisation  these  days, there is  a  tremendous  number  of

people  out there trying to get some fresh air. It is respite

from  day-to-day work and it is a haven of greenery  for  our

people.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, my answer to her is that,

in  the  next  three to four years, NParks plans to  complete

some  $40 million worth of park development and redevelopment

projects.  So those parks, like the Pasir Ris Park  and  East

Coast  Park,  where there is congestion during peak  periods,

would be upgraded and special areas would be created for high

activity uses.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, I would like to thank you for

accommodating all the cuts for this amendment.  I would  also

like  to  thank the Minister,  the Minister of State and  the

Senior  Parliamentary  Secretary for  their  high  speed  and

positive  responses  to  all the  questions  put  forward  by

Members.  I am confident that many Singaporeans will  benefit

from  the initiatives announced by the Ministry.  I beg leave

to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (2), Dr Wan Soon Bee.

Please take your two cuts together.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wan Soon Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wan Soon Bee (West Coast):</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code UA 1200.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the HDB studio apartments are built

for  all  elderly Singaporeans, and not just for elderly  HDB

lessees.  I have two suggestions

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>

which will make this housing scheme more accessible and  more

equitable for all elderly Singaporeans.  Removal of  some  of

the  conditions will also help HDB to improve the success  of

the scheme which I understand has not been great.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an ageing population, the HDB's studio apartment

scheme is an appropriate measure to alleviate the need of the

elderly  for  suitable  housing.   However,  some  of   HDB's

existing  rules  and  regulations are,  in  my  opinion,  too

restrictive  and  unfair, and therefore  defeat  the  desired

objectives of the scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my mind, the two objectives of the scheme should be

as follows:  First, to build appropriate housing with special

amenities for the elderly.  Second, to enable the elderly  to

live  independently  while remaining in  close  proximity  to

other family members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these objectives in mind, the HDB should reconsider

the condition of sale that only existing HDB lessees who have

lived  in their flats for at least 10 years are eligible  for

studio  apartments under the scheme.  This regulation assumes

that  all  elderly  Singaporeans, who are not  currently  HDB

lessees, will always have the financial means to afford  non-governmental housing.  This is incorrect.  Circumstances  can

change  for  anyone.   Even  if  the  issue  of  finances  is

discounted,  let us not forget that some elderly persons  may

choose to live among other elderly persons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know of many elderly Singaporeans who, because of

changing  circumstances,  are  in  need  of  more  economical

housing.   For example, one can imagine the situation  of  an

elderly  couple that has lived with their children in private

property.   They themselves are not rich.  Such a couple  may

be  forced to look for alternative accommodation as a  result

of  problems within the family or relocation of the  children

overseas, whether for work or through immigration.   The  HDB

studio  apartment  could  be  the only  financially  feasible

option for the couple - but the existing HDB regulation makes

them  ineligible.  Or an elderly couple may need to downgrade

to a smaller,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>

more  economical  property as a result of  a  change  in  its

financial situation.  Let us also not forget that the elderly

generally require more amenities - amenities which the studio

apartments  are especially designed to cater  for.   Finally,

living among other elderly persons can enhance the quality of

life for many elderly citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to emphasise again that an important objective of

the   scheme   is   to  provide  housing  for   all   elderly

Singaporeans, and not just elderly HDB lessees.  For all  the

reasons  I mentioned above, elderly Singaporeans who are  not

existing HDB lessees should not be excluded from the  scheme.

I therefore strongly urge the HDB to reconsider the condition

that  makes only existing HDB lessees who have lived in their

flats  for  at least 10 years eligible for this scheme.   All

elderly Singaporeans should be eligible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second suggestion to improve the scheme relates to

the  conditions that the owner is prohibited from selling the

studio  apartment  in the resale market.  I  am  recommending

that this condition be reviewed for the following reasons:

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Wan, "guillotine" time on this

amendment is 3.12 pm.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wan Soon Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wan Soon Bee:</b> Yes, Sir. This condition restricts

the  mobility  of  owners  and  consequently  undermines  the

objective  of  the  HDB elderly housing scheme  to  encourage

elderly  Singaporeans  to  live near  their  families,  while

allowing  them  to  maintain a degree of  independence.   For

example, what happens when an elderly couple's children  move

to  a different location?  While it would make sense for  the

elderly  couple to sell their present unit and to buy another

to  be  closer to the family, the current HDB condition  only

allows owners to sell apartments back to the HDB.  This  will

totally  deter people from selling and therefore  limits  the

mobility and flexibility of the elderly owners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing the sale of the studio apartments in the resale

market will provide an alternative to potential buyers in the

queue, similar to the circumstances

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>

existing in the general HDB flats resale market.  I certainly

appreciate that precautionary measures are needed to  prevent

speculative  purchases.  But since the  scheme  is  available

only  to those aged 55 and above, it is highly unlikely  that

those  who  apply for these studio apartments are  purchasing

the  flats for profit.  Furthermore, there are already  other

restrictions for purchase, such as non-ownership  of  private

property  and  a  household income ceiling  of  $8,000  which

provide sufficient protection against speculative buying.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the other HDB restrictions governing eligibility

for  housing under the scheme and the fact that  there  is  a

limited  pool  of potential buyers, the danger of  widespread

speculation in these studio apartments is, I believe,  highly

exaggerated.   The studio apartments scheme is  an  excellent

housing  scheme  for the elderly.  All of  our  elderly  have

contributed  to  the  success  of  our  nation,  let  us  not

discriminate amongst them, but instead ensure that  each  and

every  elderly  Singaporean can enjoy the  benefits  of  this

scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I proceed to the next cut?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I will ask Dr John Chen to respond to you

and if there is time, you can then move on.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, my response will be

shorter than his.  As my Minister mentioned earlier, he  will

ask  HDB  to  review  the  eligibility  criteria  for  studio

apartments.  The review would take into account the  Member's

suggestion to allow other categories of the elderly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on his second point, I would like to point out that

the  studio apartments are sold on a 30-year lease.  HDB will

give  studio apartment residents who wish to move out  before

the  end  of  the  lease  period a pro-rated  refund  of  the

purchase  price.   However,  they cannot  sell  their  studio

apartments  on  the  open  market.   This  restriction  is  a

necessary  condition for the discounted land rate  of  studio

apartment  sites.   If this restriction is removed,  the  HDB

would have to pay a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>

much  higher land rate for the studio apartment sites,  which

will translate into more expensive studio apartments for  the

elderly.  So, to answer Dr Wan, the elderly can return  their

flats  to  HDB and they will get a pro-rated refund and  they

can move to elsewhere if they like to.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Wan, there are three minutes left.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wan Soon Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wan Soon Bee:</b> Sir, one of the conditions for the

purchase  of  new  HDB  flats is that the  household  monthly

income must not exceed $8,000.  This condition does not apply

to the purchase of HDB flats in the resale market.  I suggest

that  HDB  review this condition in the light of the changing

expectations of the citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With rising affluence, Singaporeans are demanding better

quality  housing and, indeed, HDB has also changed  its  role

from one that provides subsidised housing to the lower income

group  to  one  that  provides affordable  yet  high  quality

housing to Singaporeans in general.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rationale of restricting the purchase of new flats

to  households with a certain level of income is outdated and

needs  to  be re-examined.  Some Singaporeans whose household

incomes  exceed  the  ceiling  may  nevertheless  prefer   to

purchase   HDB  flat  instead  of  private  property.    Such

Singaporeans should not be penalised by being forced to buy a

private  property,  where  prices  are  prohibitive  and  the

quality may even be inferior to that of an HDB flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that, generally, Singaporeans who can

comfortably  afford  a good private property  would  tend  to

prefer  a private property.  Therefore, I believe that  there

is  relatively little danger that people with higher  incomes

would queue to acquire an HDB flat unless they have some good

reasons  to  do  so.   Further,  if  we  believe  that  every

Singaporean   matters,  then  even  though  HDB   flats   are

subsidised, we should not discriminate between citizens  with

different  household  incomes.  If HDB  strongly  feels  that

there  should still be an income ceiling, then  at  least  it

should review it periodically as the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>

profile of household incomes changes over time.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, HDB imposes an income

ceiling  because HDB flats are heavily subsidised.  It  is  a

means to allow Singaporeans who cannot afford private housing

to  also become home owners.  The household income ceiling of

$8,000  per  month  for the purchase  of  new  HDB  flats  is

equivalent  to  the  88th  household  income  percentile   of

Singaporeans.   In  other words, nine out of  10  Singaporean

households  are eligible to buy a subsidised flat  from  HDB.

The  top  10% of Singaporeans who can afford private  housing

and  wish to live in public housing can buy resale HDB flats.

In any case, if they start young, they probably would qualify

for  HDB  flats  because their salaries would be  lower  and,

later  on,  they can upgrade.  So, in practice, almost  every

Singaporean can buy a HDB flat if they know how.   Also,  the

last review was in 1996, just before the crisis.  And we have

not  even  gone  back to the pre-crisis level,  in  terms  of

property  prices.   Nevertheless,  HDB  reviews  the   income

ceiling  to purchase subsidised flats from time to time.   At

the moment, HDB has no plan to raise the income ceiling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U of the Main

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, URA has designated the use of each plot of land and

enforced  it strictly.  As a result, we have built  Singapore

into a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>

cosmopolitan  city  with  vibrant activities  in  an  orderly

manner.   With the emergence of the electronic age, the  time

has  come to take a review of the existing planning rules and

regulations  to  see  whether some  of  these  rules  can  be

modified  to suit the needs of the new era.  It is heartening

to  note  that URA has now designated more white sites  which

allow  flexibility  in the land use.  URA  has  also  allowed

residences  to  be used as home offices for specific  trades,

such as electronic and Internet-related business.  There  are

however some other areas which warrant our attention.  I note

from  the recent trend that the vacancy ratio of office space

in  the  town  area  has declined and the office  rental  has

risen.   It is difficult for small and medium-sized companies

to  pay high rentals, and there are not many office buildings

in  the  fringe  areas.   Many have,  therefore,  moved  into

industrial buildings in various industrial estates.  However,

there  are  restrictions  on  the  maximum  area  within   an

industrial  building which can be used as  an  office.   Even

within  each  unit  in  an industrial building,  there  is  a

restriction  that  the area used as an office  cannot  exceed

40%.   These  restrictions make it difficult  for  small  and

medium-sized companies to be housed in industrial buildings.

<br>3.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same spirit that URA allows home offices to be

set  up in residence, I would like to appeal to URA to  relax

its  restrictions  and allow industrial  space,  particularly

light  industrial  space, to be used  as  offices.   In  this

connection,  I  would like to declare my interest  that  some

companies, within the group which I am associated  with,  are

involved  in  the  development of industrial  properties.   I

would  still  appeal to URA to consider allowing  more  space

within each industrial unit to be used as offices.  It should

also  consider allowing certain floors within existing  light

industrial  buildings to be used as offices.  The  reason  is

that  some of the activities, which are classified  as  light

industry,  such as research and training, are fairly  similar

to  office activities.  In fact, the inclusion of offices  in

light industrial buildings will not cause inconvenience

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>

to  the  existing  industrial users.  It will  alleviate  the

pressure on the demand for office space in the town area, and

enable  small  and  medium-sized companies  to  reduce  their

business costs.  This is essential for their survival in  the

years of economic uncertainty ahead.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ker, would you like to allow time for

the others?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze:</b> All right, Sir. As a fine tuning to

satisfy the long-term need, the Minister may wish to consider

replacing the existing category of light industry  use  by  a

new category of a combined light industry and office use.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wan Soon Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wan Soon Bee:</b> Sir, arising from the case of polluted

drinking water at Bukit Timah Plaza, I would like to ask  the

relevant authorities if there are plans to set standards  for

property  management, apart from looking into the  issues  of

the responsibilities of the parties, as spelt out in the Land

Titles Strata Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As buildings age, problems resulting from poor

maintenance and management will increase.  Although there are

statutory  regulations that building owners  must  abide  by,

there is currently no legislation to ensure that the managers

looking   after  the  buildings  need  minimum   professional

standards.   Just as there are controls on the  professionals

involved in the construction of a building, there is  also  a

need  to ensure that there are controls on professionals  who

manage  buildings.   I  would  therefore  urge  the  relevant

authorities  to  look  into  the control  and  regulation  of

property managers, to whom we entrust the safety and security

of our buildings.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, the planning guidelines

for  industry, warehouse and business park zones have already

been  relaxed in June 2000 to allow e-businesses and  dot-com

companies to start offices within these zones.  URA  is  also

looking into the feasibility of freeing up the airspace above

low-density industries for other land uses.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>

We  will  take note of Dr Ker's recommendations and  see  how

they  could  be  implemented  in  further  liberalising   our

guidelines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to inform Dr Wan that the Productivity and

Standards Board (PSB) has formed a working group to develop a

code  on  the roles and responsibilities of managing  agents.

The   working  group  comprises  members  from   REDAS,   the

Association of Property and Facility Managers, and a sizeable

MC,  apart from a managing agent.  The working group  intends

to  come  up  with a technical reference for  performance  of

property managing agents by April this year, and this will be

a reference for all management corporations (MCs).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every time I drive past the Padang, I cannot help

but wonder whether we can replicate such a setting in our HDB

new  towns,  ie,  an open field, with the CC  as  the  anchor

building  at  one end of this field, just like the  Singapore

Recreation Club.  The CC is an important institution  in  the

constituency.   It  allows  different  races  with  different

religious  beliefs  to interact and socialise.   The  CC  is,

thus, the common ground for all.  A big field fronting a  CC,

I believe, is the best setting.  In the evening, children and

families can enjoy the open space and, more rewarding,  I  am

sure the CC activities will attract more residents to attend.

National  Day  can be celebrated on a grander  scale  at  our

constituency  level.  Can I, therefore, ask the  Ministry  to

plan the constituency parks, allowing a big field for the CC,

in future new towns?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, I fully agree with the

Member.  It is indeed a good idea as it will provide a  wider

range   of  community  and  recreational  opportunities   for

residents at our parks, and also bring about better land use.

I  am  pleased to inform him that NParks has been proactively

working  with  URA and the relevant authorities to  co-locate

compatible facilities with parks, where feasible,  and  these

include  not just CCs, but also other facilities like  child-care   and  so  on.   The  examples  include  the  child-care

facilities  at  Katong  Park,  Telok  Ayer-Hong   Lim   Green

Community Club at Hong Lim Park, Tanglin Community Centre  at

Malcolm  Park,  and Tanjong Pagar Community  Club  at  Duxton

Plain  Park,  and they will continue to look  for  places  to

implement the idea.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore aspires to be a regional sports hub and

among  the top 10 sporting nations in Asia by 2010.  We  also

want  to  achieve  50% sports participation  rate  among  our

population by 2005.  Judging from the current state of sports

in Singapore, it is obvious that we have still some way to go

before we even come close to achieving these objectives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think that there is lack of political will

to  give  sports  a  higher profile  and  more  attention  in

Singapore.  MCD was re-designated as MCDS in April last  year

and  the  Committee  on Sporting Singapore,  chaired  by  the

Minister for Community Development and Sports, was formed  in

September   last  year  to  review  sporting   policies   and

programmes, and to chart the future of sports in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Committee, comprising several Ministers, released

its  wide  ranging interim recommendations in  February  this

year  at  a  public forum.  Many suggestions  were  also  put

forward  at the forum by the sporting fraternity and  members

of the public. The recommendations and suggestions, excellent

as  they  are, cannot really succeed if there is  no  mindset

change  among  our  population,  especially  parents  towards

sports.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sports School, for example, is a marvellous

recommendation  to nurture our young, the sporting  potential

to  become regional, if not, world-class athletes.   However,

this  facility will become a white elephant if there were  no

mindset  change of parents towards their children's education

and the mere obsession for academic achievement.  In order to

facilitate  this  mindset  change among  parents  and  school

children  towards  sports, I would like to  request  MCDS  to

consider introducing sports excellence, sports merit and good

progress awards, similar to the Edusave Scholarship Merit and

GPA   Awards,  given  to  citizens  each  year  for  academic

performance.  The proposed

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>

sports  awards may convince students and parents  that  equal

recognition  can be achieved for performance  in  sports,  as

well  as  in their studies.  MOE should also be persuaded  to

make  it  easier  for promising athletes  to  cope  with  the

demands of their sports and their studies by committing  them

a  longer timeframe to complete their studies and also  time-off   to  prepare  for  major  competitions.   Students  with

outstanding achievements in sports could perhaps be permitted

to  combine their "O" or "A" grades obtained at more than one

sitting for advancement into institutions of higher learning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sporting excellence in many sports also requires

athletes' involvement in regular and sustained training, even

after  they  leave  school  and  join  the  workforce.   Many

employers  must  also  change  their  attitudes  towards  the

employees  who are sportsmen.  In order to help  bring  about

this  change,  could MCDS consider including  a  make-up  pay

system for our best and most promising athletes whenever they

are  required  to  be  away from work  for  sports  training,

similar  to  the  NS  make-up pay  that  MINDEF  provides  to

employers with NSmen employees?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our promising sportsmen also experience

disruptions  in  their  training  schedules  when  they   are

enlisted for National Service.  While national security is of

vital  importance  and  must take precedence,  MINDEF  should

exercise flexibility, wherever possible, to release sportsmen

who are non-key appointment holders for sports training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to urge MCDS and the Committee on

Sporting  Singapore, when formulating our sports  policy,  to

introduce  measures and concentrate its efforts to facilitate

these  mindset changes in order that sports would finally  be

recognised as the main stream pursued by Singaporeans.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in the

debate.  Sir, have we run out of steam in producing sportsmen

and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>

sportswomen to increase our medal tally in the SEA and  Asian

games?  I hope not, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on records, we have not produced respectable

numbers  of  champions in the last 10 years.   Gone  are  the

heydays  when we hear of household names such as  C  Kunalan,

Jayamani, Ang Peng Siong, Patricia Chan and others.   We  are

so lean now that we also have to import sporting talents.  Is

the Ministry actively scouting for talents from outside? What

would be the outcomes of the sports schools that we have  set

up  which are supposed to nurture local talents?  Are  public

funds for promotion of sports effectively used?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have another point. In order that we can bring

more   innovations  to  promote  sports,  what   new   policy

directions and targets are being set by the Ministry?  May  I

suggest, for a start, that we invite various capable sporting

associations   and  country  clubs  to  manage   our   sports

complexes,  obviously with grants from  the  Ministry?   This

will  bring more innovations and competition in the promotion

of sports.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, many countries in the

world know the value of sporting champions to bond the nation

together,  to bring glory to the nation.  In many  countries,

there   are  sports  ministries  which  actively   fund   the

development  of  sports.  Until recently, Singapore  did  not

have such.  And now that we have a Sports Minister, we can re-look at some of the policies that we have.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of sports in drawing people together

cannot  be  too little emphasised.  The policy that Singapore

had  in the past has been Sports for All, let everybody enjoy

the  sports, and it is a rather lukewarm programme.  It is  a

programme  like  a  bus  going up  Fraser's  Hill.   It  goes

puttering on slowly.  We know that it will get somewhere,  we

just do not know when.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is important for us now to look at some of the

ways  of  grooming champions so that we can inspire  a  whole

generation  of youths to bond together to say,  "This  is  my

nation.  I am proud of it."  Sports, of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>

course, is just one of those many things that we can do to do

this.    For  example,  we  have  got  some  very  attractive

programmes  to encourage champions to be involved in  sports.

We  give  a million dollars, for example, if we can  have  an

Olympic  champion.  Unfortunately, we are  doing  it  wrongly

because we are giving a million dollars' reward to the person

after  he wins an Olympic medal. The correct approach  should

be   to  take  that  one  million  dollars  and  develop  the

potentials that we spot until they become champions.  Perhaps

after  that, if we still want to reward them, that is another

story.  If we do not develop these champions over a number of

years  and  we leave them to struggle until they accidentally

become champions, this is not the correct approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most focused ways of doing something will be

to set up a national school for sports.  My daughter has been

selected  to run track and field in her school. She does  not

do  it for a profession.  It is just a co-curricular activity

but  she  has to spend four days a week running and training,

because nationals are coming up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, we have to realise that people, like my

daughter, do not need to do this as a profession.  They do it

in  a less intensive way.  But for those who are spotted, and

are  real  talents, they should then be put  into  a  special

school where they can do both their studies and sports  in  a

balanced way.  Otherwise, they would end up like my daughter,

too tired to do her studies when national training is on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing is to draw people together. We can have

a  new national stadium that people can be proud of, that  is

not  something that we are ashamed to boast about because  it

is  grey,  and  greying even more.  When  we  have  a  status

symbol, an icon that all can aim for, we can then both do the

sports  for all programme; and a programme for those who  are

inspired and have great dreams to be the Michael Jordans  and

be  the  great stars of track and field that we want them  to

aspire to be.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than importing talent, we should also be

developing  our  local  talent.  I do, however,  support  the

programme  to  import talents and I hope  that  the  Ministry

could  do it more proactively by going out into the world  to

look  for  the talents and bringing them or their parents  to

Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, both the press and

MCDS  reports have highlighted the fact that we are committed

to  the  effort  of  building up Singapore  as  a  nation  of

excellence  in  sports.  MCDS has also laid down  a  goal  to

build  up Singapore as one of the sporting hubs in Singapore.

This  is  a  very  challenging objective, but  with  concrete

measures, we can achieve this goal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, there is room for enhancing and developing many

sports  events in Singapore, be it individual or group event.

I  myself am the President of the Volleyball Association  and

the Wushu Association. I would like to touch on three points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, manpower and finance. Before formulating a

national  goal in sports, the Government should discuss  with

the  various sports organisations to formulate plans to train

our  national  team.   Presently, all the  officials  in  the

National Sports Associations are volunteers and they spend  a

lot of  time in fund-raising activities rather than promoting

sports.    All  these  sportsmen  are  voluntary  and   these

organisations  have  spent a lot of time  in  raising  funds.

Therefore,  at  the  same  time, the Government  should  also

provide them with financial assistance.  The funding could be

in the ratio of 1:1 or 1:2.  We should give them enough funds

if  we want them to perform well.  With enough funding,  they

would perform better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, MCDS intends to set up a sports institute in

2003.   This is a good idea but before embarking on this,  we

should  provide  a  site  of software  for  the  training  of

sportsmen  and sportswomen so that their potential  could  be

developed to their fullest.  Is the Singapore Sports  Council

in  a  position to select people with potential for  training

and award the scholarships for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>

training  in foreign countries?  Our local training  has  not

been  able to achieve this purpose because our sportsmen have

to  go  to school at the same time when they go for training.

They  should  be  awarded  the scholarship  for  training  in

foreign  countries, for example, PM hopes that by  2008, our

football team will be able to go into the World Cup.

Promising players should be sent to Brazil and other

countries for training.  I believe when they come back in two

years' time, we will be able to achieve such a purpose.   For

example,  Japan  accepts  full-time training  for  volleyball

players.   I have seen their training in Japan.  It is  full-time  training.   If our volleyball players  could  be  given

opportunities to train in Japan, they will perform better and

win honour for our country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, on career prospects of professional sportsmen

and women.  Most parents would like their children to take up

a  lucrative profession. Hence, we should change the  mindset

of  parents that sports is not a perishing profession.  As  a

matter  of  fact, in US, Australia and other  countries,  the

sports  profession is a very lucrative one.  What a sportsman

earns  is  not  inferior to that of any other profession.   I

would like to urge the Government to assure the parents  that

the  sports  profession  has a future  and  that  sportsmen's

career is taken care of.  Therefore, we have to change  their

mindsets.   MCDS  can also plan for this to ensure  that  our

sportsmen,  especially our national team players, after  they

have contributed to the nation, could carry on as instructors

in  schools  or in training up our national teams.   We  will

better develop  our sport programmes.

<br>4.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia:</b> Sir, our talent pool needs to be

educated  and trained in order to sustain a sound  workforce,

to support the growth we have experienced over the past three

decades.  We understand from the Budget Speech 2001 that  the

Government is investing significantly in education, training,

investment schemes,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>

endowment  funds,  etc.  The flipside of  this  must  be  the

development  of  a physically sound and a healthy  workforce,

because  the workforce is only as productive as its state  of

health.   It  is  scientifically established  that  the  only

mechanism  to  ensure healthy and good quality  life  in  the

labour  force is through life-long physical exercise regimes.

The  setting up of the Health Promotion Board is timely.  The

MCDS'  policy  to  promote the development  of  the  physical

health  of the school children will ensure that people  carry

on a healthy lifestyle throughout their work life and even in

their later years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sports could be developed at several levels. (1)

Sports   as  a  lifestyle  to  ensure  a  healthy  population

throughout  life.  In schools, sports must  be  developed  as

part  of  curriculum activities in parallel with the critical

academic curriculum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Sports as a recreation and means of community

development to ensure social bonding, allegiance and loyalty.

Mr  Minister, you encourage us each time we see you  in  your

running shorts and shoes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Sports with the aim of allowing individuals to set

their  own challenges and goals.  We remember the folk heroes

like Wong Peng Soon of Thomas Cup fame,  Khoo Swee Chiow  who

reached  the summit of Mount Everest and Singapore's plan  to

attain  a position in the World Cup.   However, we have  also

failed  to  honour  Tan Howe Liang, our only  Olympic  silver

medallist.   Ronald Soo got to the All-England quarter finals

recently.   No Singaporean had achieved this in two  decades.

Will we forget him now that he is not in the semi finals?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read in the newspaper recently on a question put to a

foreign  Olympics  medallist.  He was asked  whether  he  was

rewarded  a  million dollars after he won the  Olympics  gold

medal.   He was puzzled but after some explanation,  he  said

that  he  would have preferred to have the financial  support

before he won, and not after.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Sports as a career path. We must encourage people

with  sporting skills to excel.  A career path in sports must

be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>

treated  as equal to academic skills.  I would like  to  know

what  is  the  Minister's  policy  towards  a  holistic   and

comprehensive  approach  to  health  and  sports.   Will  the

Minister  set  up  one  or  more  focus  groups  to   collect

information,  analyse  data and come up  with  plans  on  two

levels?   First,  the software plans for the  development  of

human  capital,  education, health and sports.   Second,  the

hardware  plans,  inclusive  of feasibility  studies,  design

briefs,  master  plans  and plans for the  development  of  a

sports   hub.   We  need  better  and  world-class   sporting

facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as an architect in private practice, I cannot

help  but  want to ask the Minister whether he will agree  to

organise a national design competition to tap the best  ideas

for the new stadium and sports hub.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I mentioned earlier the

need  for both a Sports for Champions programme and a  Sports

for  All  programme.   I mentioned that our  Sports  for  All

programme is rather lukewarm at the moment.  The reason I say

this is that we are not doing enough to provide facilities in

every community.  One of the reasons that American kids,  for

example,  grow up aspiring to be Michael Jordan is that  they

can  find  in schools and in their communities, even  outside

schools, facilities to play their games.  Sometimes  even  on

the streets, because they are so keen to play games that they

form  their own three against three teams and play  games  in

the streets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now doing this, Sir. Increasingly, we are

building street soccer and street basketball pitches,  and  I

think  we  should do more of this.  Because,  ultimately,  if

people are aspiring to be Michael Jordans, Shaquille O'Neals,

Fandis and Peles, we must give them facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the national development debate that has just

terminated, there was this indication that schools and  other

facilities  could be open to the youths of the community.   I

know the Ministry of Education, in fact, has asked principals

to  encourage this.  But not every principal is able to do it

because sometimes they are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>

concerned about the security of the schools, and the ultimate

decision  of  opening up the school field is  really  at  the

discretion of the principal.  In the end, it is too much of a

trouble  sometimes for people to use the school  field.   And

yet  we  have  got patches of land all over which  are  being

reserved  for future use, and the land sits there  for  years

and  years and nobody is using them.  And when the grassroots

organisations  ask for these fields, they are charged  market

rent.  If a grassroots organisation applies for it, they only

pay  30%  of  the market price.  And I am asking whether  the

MCDS  could consider either helping to pay for this or  fully

subsidise  the  rental, so that the grassroots  organisations

can  indeed build facilities for the community.  Just looking

at  the  fields  near my place, levelling  them,  putting  up

fences, it could be hundreds of thousands of dollars - not to

mention  the  TOL fees that we have to pay  later.   I  would

therefore  urge  the Minister to consider ways  of  releasing

funds  to  help  the  communities build more  facilities  for

sports.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I

have  a very simple request and appeal to the Minister.  When

we  think  about  sports, let us not  just  think  about  the

structured  facilities  and  the  stadiums.   They  are  very

important.   But  sports  is enjoyed and  played  by  people,

amongst friends and neighbours, in a very casual way,  before

they  get into something more serious.  And this is  where  I

think facilities must be accessible, and close as possible to

our  people.  Therefore, I think the HDB is  important.   The

parks  and  recreation  areas are important.   While  we  are

trying to promote sports,  I feel, as a soccer player, as  if

there  is a war against soccer players.  When you look  at  a

piece of very nice ground which looks very inviting, you just

want  to put on your boots and kick a ball around.  There  is

always  a  suspicious looking mound or some trees  somewhere.

What  could be a goal post, they put two trees and some other

obstacles.  And sometimes more blatant, they put a  signboard

which says "No Ball Games".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we have to be very consistent about this,

because we really want to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>

encourage  sports  at  the casual level,  at  the  grassroots

level.  People just want to run around.  If we go to the  NIE

and  Chinese  High  School  -  these are two  very  excellent

examples   -  on a weekend, there is a whole sports community

that is being developed here, simply because the institutions

allow  people from the neighbourhood to come and play  at  no

charge.   At  other  places, it is  more  difficult.   And  I

sympathise with the principals of schools where on  weekends,

boys will climb over the school fence or break into the fence

just to get into a piece of ground where they can play soccer

together.  While we think about all the big things, there are

many  small  things that we can do in our neighbourhood  that

can  make  individuals,  young boys and  children,  to  enjoy

sports in a more casual manner.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, as

we progress in the 21st century, Singapore has begun to place

more importance on the other aspects of life.  We begin to be

more  concerned with the lighter parts of our life,  such  as

the   arts,  sports,  etc.   All  the  time,  we  have   high

expectations  of ourselves, and whatever we do,  we  must  do

well.    In  sports,  I  think  we  should  also  have   some

achievements,  because sports is a very important  aspect  of

our nation building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singaporeans are now better educated and they are

more mature.   Now they would want to have better quality  of

life  in order to balance off the stressful city state  life,

because  sports  is  a good way to help Singaporeans  digress

from their stressful life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The promotion of sports is gradually falling into place,

particularly with the formation of the Ministry of  Community

Development  and  Sports.   Now,  all  the  national   sports

associations come under the purview of the MCDS.  Already, we

have seen many great sporting events being held in Singapore,

such  as  the Singapore Golf Masters, and we have the  Soccer

<br><br>2010&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision,  etc.   Of course, we need to  improve  on  the

facilities for all these sporting activities.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, a conference was organised by the Committee on

Sporting  Singapore to review and present the  findings  from

its  various sporting committees.  We need to build a culture

among Singaporeans to appreciate and accept sports as another

worthwhile   endeavour  and  achievement.    In   all   these

presentations,   there   were  many   creative   and   useful

recommendations that could raise the awareness  and  standard

of sports in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this year's budget, the Singapore Sports Council

is  only allocated $45.59 million.  This is only 4.1% or just

$1.8 million more than last year.  If we compare it with  the

tasks that the Singapore Sports Council needs to undertake to

meet  the increased demands, I think this is very negligible.

This increase in budget is mainly provided for the subvention

of  land  cost,  provision for the operating of  Jurong  East

swimming complex, salary revision and CPF adjustments of  the

staff.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the national sports associations, they were

totally  neglected in this year's budget provision.   Are  we

saying  that the national sports associations have to survive

on  their  own?  Under such circumstances, how can we  expect

these   national  sports  associations  to  carry  out  their

mission,  not  to mention the promotion of sports  activities

and the advancement of sports?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, many of the national sports associations are

struggling  in their fund raising efforts.  Willing  sponsors

are  increasingly  difficult to come by, as  national  sports

associations need to compete with so many other activities to

fight for a slice of the sponsorship pie.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that not all the sports associations can be

as  lucky as the Football Association of Singapore, which has

a  very  huge  sponsorship.  Many associations  need  to  get

grants  from  the Singapore Sports Council to  promote  their

cause.   So  I  strongly call upon the Minister  to  consider

increasing  the budget in line with the increased  tasks  and

responsibilities that are expected from the Singapore  Sports

Council.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, I would urge the Government to increase the

subsidy to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>

national sports associations.  I hope that the Minister  will

consider  giving   an off-budget subsidy  to  these  national

sports   associations.   Then,  with  all  the  support   and

infrastructure in place, this will be the right time  for  us

to  correct the negative perception and enhance the image and

status of sports in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, my topic is on the community sports

clinic.   The  sports  for life programme,  launched  by  the

Singapore  Sports Council, has been successful  in  promoting

healthy  lifestyle among Singaporeans, especially the elderly

and   housewives.    Many  Singaporeans  are   beginning   to

participate in the sports for life programme, such  as  brisk

walking  and  many  other games.  As we have  a  fast  ageing

population, we should continue our efforts to keep our people

healthy.   But  the  push  for a  healthy  lifestyle  by  the

community  must  also  be supported by the  necessary  sports

clinics and medicine infrastructure.  Presently, we have only

one  sports  clinic at the Sports Council serving mainly  our

national  and school athletes.   The centre has basic  sports

medical facilities but lacks the modern equipment for  sports

injury  diagnosis  and  therapy such  as  magnetic  resonance

imaging (MRI) equipment.   The limited resources also do  not

permit  the  centre to conduct sports medicine research,  and

education to the general public.

<br>4.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we become more active in mobilising the masses into

sporting  activities, we need to provide adequate, accessible

and  convenient sports clinics at the community level.  These

clinics   can   provide  consultations  for  sports   injury,

physiotherapy  and  rehabilitation  services  at   affordable

costs.   It  is  a  form  of primary  healthcare  for  sports

injuries at the community level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to seek the following clarifications

from the Ministry:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) What are the plans the Ministry has in providing

sports medicine infrastructure in Singapore?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) What are the resources committed to train sports

doctors and physiotherapists?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) What is the appropriate ratio between the

population  and sports doctor as compared to other  developed

countries?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Will the Ministry build more sports clinics at the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;community level?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Wang Kai Yuen is not here. Mr Chiam

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Tong.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, if Singapore wants to promote

sports, then I think the Government and the people in general

must  show respect for our sportsmen and sportswomen who have

brought  honour  to  Singapore by  winning  in  international

competitions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to highlight the case of two brothers who

represented  Singapore  in  water  polo.   The  two  brothers

altogether  won  11  medals for Singapore,  comprising  seven

golds,  three  silvers and one bronze at the  Asian  and  SEA

Games.   They  are  both  Singaporeans.   They  are  born  in

Singapore and are blue-blooded Singaporeans and not  imported

ones.   They  are Mr Gan Eng Guan and his brother.   Although

they  have contributed so much to Singapore, they are shunned

and  ignored by our sports officials.  In 1998, there  was  a

much  publicised social function called "Reunion (Water Polo)

1998",   organised   by   the  Singapore   Amateur   Swimming

Association,  where other prominent past  and  present  water

polo players were invited, including some from overseas.  But

the two prominent brothers who are genuine Singapore products

were  not  invited.  They were really outstanding water  polo

players  in the 50s and 60s, and there was no excuse for  the

officials  of the Singapore Amateur Swimming Association  not

to know them in 1998.  Yet, they were not the ones invited as

guests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that is the attitude of our sports officials towards

our  better known sportsmen, we can then understand  why  the

sports scene in Singapore is in such a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>

sorry state.  I can also understand why a female official  in

the Netball Association said that 95% of the Singapore sports

officials  should be sacked.  Our sportsmen spend  many  long

hours to achieve international standards and bring honour  to

Singapore.  Yet, when they retired, they were thrown into the

dust heap and forgotten.  Can we then wonder why the standard

of sports in Singapore is so low?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister can look into this problem of the

two  brothers.   They have brought honour to  Singapore,  yet

ignored  by  the  Singapore Amateur Swimming Association.   I

hope  the  Minister can investigate and get to the bottom  of

the matter.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Minister for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Community Development and Sports (Mr Abdullah Tarmugi):</b> Sir, I would like to thank Members for

their views and questions on sports.  This is something close

to  my  heart  and close to the hearts of many  officials  in

MCDS.   Let me address the issues and questions Members  have

brought up.  What I would do is to sketch the broad plans  of

what  the  Ministry has on sports, and along the way  address

Members' concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry was renamed the Ministry of Community

Development  and  Sports in April last year,  to  signal  the

greater  priority the Government intends to give  to  sports.

And we are ready to do more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong, Dr Vasoo and Prof. Toh See Kiat are

keen  to  know what our plans are.  Sir, over the past  year,

the  Committee on Sporting Singapore (CoSS), which  I  chair,

has  been discussing the various ways in which sports can  be

further  developed in Singapore.  Our vision  is  that  of  a

Sporting  Singapore based on three pillars: sports  for  all,

sports excellence and the building of a sports industry.   We

shared  some of the key recommendations of CoSS at  a  public

seminar about three weeks ago.   I would like to repeat them.

These are to:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Promote a sporting culture in Singapore;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Strengthen the National Sports Associations;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Establish a Sports School;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Enhance sports science and sports medicine;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) Develop the sports industry; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) Build a sports hub.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am indeed very pleased to announce that the Government

has  accepted  in  principle the interim  recommendations  of

CoSS.  Let me talk about these in detail.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our sports participation rate was about 34%, according

to  a  survey in 1997, an increase of 10% from 24%  in  1992.

Beyond  improving  the participation rates,  we  aim  to  get

people  excited about sports by nurturing a sporting culture.

Because when we talk about sports, we are talking of passion,

commitment and discipline.  When people play sports together,

they  develop  bonds  which help build  a  cohesive  society.

During  those Malaysian Cup days when the Singapore team  was

playing,  you  would  notice  how  the  audience  rooted  for

Singapore,  how everyone became one.  When our  table  tennis

player  Jing Junhong played at the semi-finals in the  recent

Olympics, everyone in Singapore - even those who did not know

the difference between a golf ball and a tennis ball - rooted

for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Mr Chiam for his support for

sports  and  assure him that the Government has  always  been

supportive  of  sports.   We  want  to  continue  our  sports

promotion  efforts and do more to raise the status of  sports

here.   The  Singapore Sports Council (SSC) and the Singapore

National  Olympic  Council  (SNOC)  are  already  giving  out

several  awards.  This is in answer to some of  the  Members'

questions on whether we are giving out sports awards  to  our

athletes.    We   do.   SSC,  for  example,   awards   sports

scholarships.  Nevertheless, we will see how we  can  further

improve on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sports clubs and associations also have important roles

to play in building a sports

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>

culture in Singapore and providing sports programmes  to  the

public.   Mr  Goh Chong Chia mentioned having to develop  our

young  in  sports.  We agree.    In particular,  we  need  to

actively promote sports among our youth.  We will see how  we

can  help  the clubs improve the quality of their  programmes

and  services  so that more Singaporeans can play  and  enjoy

sports.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo asked if we should allow sports clubs and

associations to manage sports complexes.  There are strategic

reasons  for  retaining the management  of  these  facilities

under  the SSC.  It would be in a better position to  promote

sports  to  the  general  public and help  build  a  sporting

culture  in  Singapore.  For example,  the  Sports  Council's

Regional Sports and Fitness Centres are housed within  sports

complexes, and they have comprehensive programmes to increase

the  sports participation rate of Singaporeans.  Perhaps over

time,  when the sports clubs and associations have  developed

further, we can consider privatising the management of sports

complexes in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note the concerns of Prof. Toh See Kiat and Mr

Zulkifli  Baharudin  regarding  the  availability  of  sports

facilities  in Singapore.  I take Mr Zulkifli's  point  about

the  importance  of  informal sports  activities,  like  just

kicking  a ball around or just playing catching, as it  were,

with  your  kids.   Having  adequate  sports  facilities  for

Singaporeans is a prerequisite for building a sports  culture

here.   In  FY  2000, the Singapore Sports Council  committed

about $37 million on sports facilities for the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In land-scarce Singapore, there are limits on how much

land  we  can  set aside for sports.  However,  we  can  find

innovative ways to maximise the use of land in Singapore  for

sports.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do this, my Ministry and Singapore Sports Council are

considering three strategies: Firstly, we can explore the use

of temporarily vacant state land for sports.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, existing facilities such as school fields and

open spaces, as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>

mentioned by Mr Zulkifli, are indeed important resources that

could be tapped.  As a pilot project, SSC is negotiating with

a  few  schools  to  manage and maintain the  school  fields.

Under  SSC's  management, these fields can be made  available

for  public use outside school hours.  This, hopefully, would

avoid  the  problem  which Mr Zulkifli  has  mentioned  about

schools' property and premises being damaged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we can make use of technology to maximise the

use  of facilities.  For example, as an alternative to  grass

fields,  artificial surfaces which are not  affected  by  wet

weather  and  can  withstand heavier  continuous  usage  with

minimal damage, will be introduced.  The utilisation rate can

be  increased  three-fold.   SSC has  in  fact  installed  an

artificial  field  at St Wilfrid Sports Complex  as  a  pilot

project.  If this is successful, we will try to see  how  the

use of such artificial surfaces can be extended.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would agree with Mr Ang Mong Seng that much can be

done  to raise the standard of sports in Singapore.  I  think

we  all  agree  to  that.  The National  Sports  Associations

(NSAs)  must take the lead in developing and promoting  their

respective sports.  They are in the best position to  do  so.

They  know the athletes, they know the sports, and they  have

the  expertise.   Our  proposals to  develop  sports  can  be

successful only if the NSAs have the expertise and  resources

to support the implementation of the recommendations of CoSS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to Prof. Toh's remark, we already have quite a

number  of  schemes  in  place to  develop  athletes,  either

through  the NSAs, or directly.  For example, since 1993,  $8

million  has  been set aside for sports excellence  annually.

Besides  the  $3.5  million for schemes to  support  athletes

directly,  NSAs  are also given assistance to  develop  their

administration,  coaching  expertise  and  youth  development

programmes,  and we will definitely see how we could  further

improve to help develop athletes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further strengthen the NSAs, we intend to work with

the NSAs to establish

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>

long  term plans for developing their sports.  More resources

will  be  given - we have thought about this - to  help  them

achieve their goals, so long as their performance targets are

met.  In other words, we are willing and will be working into

providing them more financial support, provided they are more

accountable.   They  would  be held accountable  towards  the

development and promotion of their sports.

<br>4.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year I mentioned the possibility of setting up

a  Sports  School  in Singapore.  This institution  has  been

mentioned by several Members.  Some call it sports institute,

some  call  it sports school.  And I am pleased  to  announce

that the Government has approved this initiative.  The sports

school  will  give  students  with  talent  for  sports   the

opportunity to hone their skills while ensuring their studies

are  well  taken  care of.   The time is  right  for  such  a

concept, albeit a new one, in Singapore to be tried out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is vital that we get the concept right and put in

place  a  strong team to establish and run the sports school.

The  principal would be key to ensuring the success.  He must

have good standing in both sports and education and have  the

ability to build up an organisation from scratch.  We are  in

the process of searching for such a principal for the school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important the sports school provides the best

sports  training available for students, while maintaining  a

robust  and  rigorous academic curriculum.  Parents,  as  you

know, must feel confident that their children's sporting  and

educational  needs  are  well taken care  of  in  the  sports

school,  and  this  addresses some of the Members'  concerns.

And  a clear pathway must also be available for graduates  of

the  sports school.  In this regard, the sports school  needs

to  forge strategic alliances with tertiary institutions  and

sports organisations.  Definitely, a lot of ground work needs

to be done to set up

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>

the school, and we schedule one to be ready in 2003 or 2004.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin has asked about our efforts in building up

sports  medicine and sports science expertise.  Sir,  we  are

now  in  an  era  where raw talent is no  longer  enough  for

sporting  excellence.   At that level  of  competition  where

physical prowess and talent are almost equal, technology  can

give  you that edge, a milli-second, that extra inch, to  win

your  event.  The last Olympics, for example, we saw swimmers

wearing  ribbed swim suits where it helps them glide  through

the  water.  You see how runners wear spectacles, instead  of

having them over the ears, go over their heads, and they have

to  have  a  bald  head  to wear such spectacles.   So  elite

athletes will increasingly require sports science and  sports

medicine   support  to  give  them  the  extra  edge   during

competitions at international level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fourth CoSS interim recommendation is to

develop  Singapore as a centre for sports science and  sports

medicine.  The Sports Council will continue to take the  lead

in providing sports medicine services, especially to national

athletes  and to the National Sports Associations.  The  NSAs

will also be encouraged to develop sports medicine and sports

science   committees  with  the  Singapore  Sports  Council's

assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the general public, SSC intends to improve sports

injury  management  among doctors and  physiotherapists.   It

will  do  this  through organising seminars and sourcing  for

appropriate sports medicine courses here and abroad.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But rather than the Government setting up sports clinics

at  the community level, we feel that it would be more viable

to leave this to market forces.  Because already there are  a

few  private sector clinics, which practise sports  medicine.

And   I  believe  this  market  will  continue  to  grow   as

Singaporeans become more aware of the importance of leading a

healthy lifestyle.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides these traditional areas of sports for all and

sports  excellence,  we also see a need  to  build  a  sports

industry  to  provide  viable careers  for  athletes  and  to

sustain  the sports delivery system in Singapore.  This  will

address  Mr  Ang  Mong Seng's and Mr Goh Chong  Chia's  point

about providing a career development path for athletes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to sports awards and full-time training

scholarships  overseas, there is already such a scheme  under

SPEX 21.  Several athletes, including thrower James Wong  and

swimmers  Joscelin  Yeo and Sng Ju Wei, have  benefited  from

this  scheme.  We have also signed Memoranda of Understanding

with Korea and with China which facilitate full-time training

stints overseas for all the athletes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SSC also talks to athletes and counsels them when

they  embark  on  full-time training, to help them  formulate

their  long-term plans for sports, for their career  and  for

their  individual development.  So indeed, there  is  already

some counselling and guidance by the Sports Council.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SSC has also provided employment to many national

athletes  for a number of years, so long as they  fulfil  the

entry  requirements for such job vacancies.  But in the  long

term,  the  solution must be to grow the sports  industry  in

Singapore to provide wider career opportunities in sports.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore plan to institute a sports industry

development programme to cultivate a vibrant sports sector in

Singapore.   We  will  set  up a marketing  team  to  promote

Singapore  as  a  venue  of choice for  world-class  sporting

events,    sports   service   providers   and   international

federations.   Such  events will help  create  that  buzz  in

Singapore,  and make Singapore an even more attractive  place

to live.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh Chong Chia mentioned about building a new

stadium; several others too.  This is precisely what we  have

mind.  To complement the development of a sports industry, we

intend  to  redevelop the National Stadium into an integrated

sports hub.  Our Kallang Stadium has served us very well.  It

is  decades  old now and is becoming outdated.  A sports  hub

will  provide Singaporeans with a world-class venue to  watch

top level sports, as well as provide excellent facilities for

sports participation.  My Ministry will conduct a feasibility

study  on  what form this sports hub would take  and  confirm

where it should be located.   And I take the suggestion by Mr

Goh Chong Chia about organising a national design competition

for the stadium, which we can consider.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the initiatives I have outlined will require

additional resources.  To build up the momentum, Members, and

especially  Mr  Ong Ah Heng and Mr Chiam See  Tong,  will  be

pleased  to know that the Government, together with Singapore

Pools,  will be committing $500 million to sports  over  five

years to implement these initiatives.  And this excludes  the

redevelopment  of  the National Stadium, which  will  take  a

little  longer to study in detail.   In reply to  Mr  Ong  Ah

Heng's comment about the $45.59 million, this is actually the

budget  allocated to the Sports Council and is only  for  the

annual  operating  grant  for  operation  of  programmes  and

maintenance of sports facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, on Mr Chiam's point about recognising our past

sports heroes, I take his point.  This is something we should

be  looking  into  and,  certainly,  we  will  accord  proper

recognition to our sporting heroes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank the many MPs who have spoken in

support  of  sports. Singapore sports seem set  for  exciting

times  ahead.  The initiatives recommended by CoSS  will  set

the  scene for a paradigm shift in the way we view sports  in

Singapore.   The CoSS will finalise its report by  June  this

year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, a lot has already been said

about the widening income gap by many Members during the past

few years.  I shall try my best not to repeat the arguments.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.40 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we may not be able to do much as a small economy

to  influence  this global trend, we can and we should  start

working on measures that would ameliorate the consequences of

this  widening income gap.  However, attempting to do  so  by

slowing down the most able from accelerating ahead, squeezing

the  rich  or  artifically boosting wages of  non-competitive

jobs  would  be  disastrous.  There are countries  that  have

tried  some,  or  all of these measures, and  invariably  the

results  were not quite they expected.  Yes, it is true  that

we  are a meritocracy, that every Singaporean, regardless  of

how humble his or her family background, can succeed.  And we

read  with admiration from time to time of cases of  students

from humble families doing brilliantly in their studies.  But

are  all our children, including those with disabilities  and

those  who  fall  or choose to remain outside the  mainstream

education  system, given an equal opportunity to  succeed  in

life  when  they  grow  up?  Or are these  people  likely  to

contribute  to  the widening income gap when  they  join  the

workforce?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, working with the community, should

carefully  monitor and fine-tune our systems to  ensure  that

every  child is given the best chance to achieve his  or  her

full potential and equipped with the relevant skills to get a

decent  job  when they join the workforce.  It is  also  true

that  low  skilled  workers can get ahead  if  they  were  to

upgrade  their  skills and to attend retraining.   But  those

that  could  should upgrade their skills to stay relevant  in

the  new economy.  However, we must be aware that there  will

be  a small number who would, if only they could.  Our policy

makers  must  realise that there will always  be  those  who,

despite their best efforts, will not be able to keep up  with

the  best,  or the rest.  Some may not have the literacy  and

numeracy  skills,  or  the intellectual ability,  to  upgrade

themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are to bond as a cohesive society, the low

income,  the less able and the disabled should never be  made

to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>

feel  disenfranchised and neglected.  As the Finance Minister

so  aptly  put across in his Budget Statement when he  stated

that,  at  the end of the day, we have to ensure  that  every

Singaporean  has  a  place  in  the  Singapore  of  the   new

millennium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the number of public assistance cases, although

comparatively  small, is beginning to show a  gradual  upward

trend over the last two years.  Even though the criteria that

qualify  for  public assistance have not been made  any  less

stringent, are more Singaporeans falling into poverty  amidst

our  apparent  prosperity?  Could the  Minister  explain  the

cause of this disturbing trend?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also find ways to create adequate social safety

nets for these people, but in a manner that would not destroy

the  sense of self-worth, or the incentive for them  to  give

out  their  best  however  humble that  may  be.   Could  the

Minister tell the House what measures and strategies MCDS has

adopted to assist low income families to cope with the  rapid

changes  taking  place  in the economy  and  to  improve  the

situation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, children from low income households who do not have

a  strong  family support home environment benefit  the  most

from  attending  good  childcare and  before-and-after-school

care  centres.  Unfortunately, many low income  families  may

not be able to afford to send their children to childcare  or

before-and-after-school  care centres.   Would  the  Minister

therefore  consider  introducing  schemes  to  make  it  more

affordable for these families to send their children to  good

childcare and before-and-after-school centres?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also institute measures that will make it

easier  for the more successful to assist the less  fortunate

in  order to enhance social cohesion.  For example,  the  CPF

top-ups are automatically credited into the accounts  of  the

eligible  Singaporeans, regardless of whether  they  need  or

want  the  money.  I therefore support the suggestion  by  Dr

Jennifer  Lee that eligible recipients of CPF top-ups  should

be  required  to submit applications for their  entitlements.

Those who are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>

better off and who want to help the less fortunate should  be

permitted to have their entitlements channelled to  the  CDCs

in  order  to  help  the  poor in the community.   Would  the

Minister  support such a measure to make it easier  for  more

able Singaporeans to assist the less able?

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, I share the viewpoints expressed by Mr

Charles  Chong.  With the restructuring of the economy,  low-income  families with semi-skilled and unskilled  backgrounds

are  more  likely  to  be affected and they  will  also  face

economic setbacks.  The unemployment rate has increased, more

older-person households have been affected and they  are  the

ones who are likely to face various difficulties.  It can  be

seen  that  low-income families with dependent children  are,

particularly,  the  ones  having  low  skills  and  unskilled

backgrounds, and are most vulnerable to problems.

<br>4.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of this situation, it is important that the

Ministry   takes  a  more  pro-active  step   by   taking   a

comprehensive  review of various issues that  are  likely  to

affect  the  low-income families.  By doing so, the  Ministry

would  be able to come up with a more comprehensive  plan  to

deal  with the problems of these vulnerable families, in  the

light of various economic restructuring and changes that  are

likely to take place.  I would like to ask the Minister  what

new  plans and programmes the Ministry will put in  place  to

particularly help low-income families.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Sir, even as we find many positive

things  to note in our economic progress and achievements  in

Singapore, we are also very aware that the bottom 10%-20%  of

our  households has seen the average income stagnate even  as

the  cost of living continues to rise.  I would like to touch

on two issues in extending a helping hand to such families in

need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, while we know that we have good social safety

nets  and  many assistance schemes in place, it is often  the

case that those people who are most in need of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>

help  are  the  ones who least know how to access  it.   Last

Saturday,  Dr Tan Cheng Bock spoke of the need for people  to

be   aware   of   how   to  access  the   healthcare   system

appropriately, so that they can have maximum benefit  of  the

available subsidised services.  I would, therefore,  like  to

propose  to MCDS that it conduct an educational programme  to

provide   comprehensive  but  easy-to-understand  information

targeted  at  the  lower-income households,  to  inform  this

target  group of the various subsidised services provided  by

the  Government  and  how to access these  services,  through

channels  that  will  allow them  the  best  benefit  of  the

available subsidies, and of the variety of assistance schemes

available and how to go about applying for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reaching out to needy families on a case-by-case

basis, especially the lesser educated and the isolated, it is

obviously  very difficult to be sure that no  one  who  needs

help  is  missed.  In this context, the passing over  of  the

disbursement  of  subsidies, fees and other  assistance,  and

community-based facilities from MCDS to the CDCs, is  a  good

move,  as  the  latter should be able to be more  focused  on

residents in their jurisdiction who need a hand, and be  able

to  reach  out  more extensively to them.  This  is  a  heavy

responsibility for the CDCs, and it is imperative  that  they

gear up to discharge it well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is flexibility in implementing

assistance  schemes.   We  understand  that  regulations  and

guidelines for various assistance schemes may have been drawn

in  ways to attempt to control or minimise the possibility of

abuse.   However, there are often people in need who may  not

fit  into pre-determined criteria, or may be genuinely  hard-luck  cases.   It  is therefore important  that  officers  in

charge   of   implementing  assistance   schemes   have   the

flexibility  to exercise judgement in cases of genuine  need.

Only  in  this way can we truly say that any one who needs  a

helping hand in Singapore can be assured of getting it.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, recent data from

Census 2000 indicated

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1089</b></font><br><br>

that  8.7%  of  the total resident households are  households

with  no  income earners, up from 7.5%.  But translated  into

absolute numbers, that is a total of 80,000 households, which

is  not  a  small number.  The statistics also show that  the

average  monthly  household income  for  the  lowest  10%  of

families  was a startling $61 per month.  Sir, these  figures

do  not represent the true picture, as the Chief Statistician

himself  admitted that the figures were misleading.  Firstly,

it  is  actually  impossible for the lowest 10%  to  have  an

income  of only $61, unless they are not aware of the  public

assistance scheme or, for various reasons, do not qualify for

public  assistance.  Anyone with such low income  would  have

qualified  for public assistance, which gives  a  minimum  of

$230  per  month.  Secondly, also as indicated by  the  Chief

Statistician, the figures, for those without income,  include

retirees  with savings, stocks, working children who  support

them, and some who own landed properties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, could MCDS help to normalise these data, using the

retiree  factor, so that we can have a more accurate picture?

What  I would like to know is the actual number of the really

poor  no-income families.  For those families,  how  do  they

survive?   Is public assistance able to help them?  How  does

MCDS  tackle the income inequality of these households?   How

do  we  make sure that children from these no-income families

can get a decent education?

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, I note that the amount

of  money  we give to needy families is a subject  of  review

from  time  to time.  However, with the changing demands  and

requirements of the people, the categories, by which  we  use

to  assess  what is adequate for families, may well  have  to

change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether in the light of

the  changing  needs of Singaporeans today, and  taking  into

account  the higher cost of living, the assistance  given  to

needy families properly reflects these changes.  Secondly,  I

would also like to know whether our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>

means test should be reviewed, in the light of the fact  that

the cost of living is now higher in Singapore and the general

wage  level  has  gone up.  Thirdly, is the Ministry  working

closely with the Ministry of Manpower to work on the prospect

of employability for those who are on public assistance?

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, the increase in the number of dual-career families would pose problems for the care of the

elderly  who are frail, because this will become a tremendous

burden  in terms of care by such families.  About 82% of  our

households are one-family nuclear families.  It is  therefore

expected   that  many  of  these  families  will  be   facing

tremendous stress in having to care for the elderly  who  are

frail.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a need to review what comprehensive

support network will be available to these families.   It  is

very  important that we develop as quickly as  possible  some

support system within the neighbourhood or the locality where

there are more elderly persons living, to provide support for

such  families.   I  would  like to  ask  the  Minister  what

comprehensive  plans are there to provide programmes  at  the

neighbourhood  level  to support families  which  have  frail

elderly.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin:</b> Sir, with a rapidly aging population,

there  is  a  need  for  a comprehensive  infrastructure  for

eldercare.   Currently, most of the eldercare facilities  and

programmes are operated by VWOs.  My questions are:  Are  the

current eldercare facilities sufficient?  What measures  will

be taken to improve the quantity and quality of elderly care?

What  role  can  the private sector play in  caring  for  the

senior  citizens?   What incentives do we  put  in  place  to

encourage the involvement of the private sector in developing

an  eldercare service industry?  Eldercare, by nature of  its

work,  is very labour intensive.  Currently, there is a great

dependency on volunteers and befrienders.  But many of  these

volunteers  and  befrienders are themselves  aging.   Efforts

will  need  to  be  made  to develop a sufficient  number  of

suitable  care-givers for the aged.  What  measures  will  be

taken to ensure that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1091</b></font><br><br>

there will be sufficient human resources to take care of  the

aged?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the majority of our elderly population is healthy

and is a valuable resource to our nation.  There should be as

many opportunities as possible for them to remain engaged  in

society,  and  to  continue their contribution  to  it.   One

problem,  Sir, is the mindset of employers.  While retraining

will  help  to  a certain extent, however, not all  jobs  are

suitable  for the elderly.  Many jobs would need  to  be  re-engineered to make them suitable for the elderly to  perform.

What   measures   will  be  taken  to  encourage   and   help

organisations re-engineer some of their jobs,  to  make  them

suitable for the older people in our community?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, I thank Members for speaking

up  for  our low-income families, as this is another  subject

which  is  actually very close to my Ministry's heart.   Many

Members,  including Mr Charles Chong, Dr Vasoo,  Dr  Jennifer

Lee,  Dr  Ho  Tat  Kin  and Mr Sin Boon Ann,  have  expressed

concern about the growing income divide and the needs of  the

low-income families in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, at MCDS, empathise with this concern. Our approach

has   always   been   to   facilitate   self-reliance   among

Singaporeans, including the lower-income, by helping them  to

develop skills and the capability to help themselves because,

usually,  this  is  the  best  way  to  help  the  low-income

families.   As  the saying goes, if we give someone  fish  to

eat,  it would only make him full for a day, but if we  teach

him  to fish, he would have food for a lifetime.  At the same

time we promote the "Many Helping Hands" approach, where  the

more  successful help those who are less fortunate,  a  point

mentioned by some Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the transition to the new economy has brought the

issue of helping low-income families into sharper focus.   We

hear that there are more and more families not being able  to

cope,  and  that there is a bigger gap between the haves  and

the  have-nots.  But I agree with Dr Ho Tat Kin when he  says

that the data, which we have, do not really show the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>

actual  extent  of  the  problem  among  the  low-income   in

Singapore.   My  officers  will  certainly  work   with   the

Department  of Statistics to refine the data on  retiree  and

low-income  households, so that we get accurate  data.   With

accurate  data, we will be able to assist low-income families

more effectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recognises that the less educated

workers,  especially older employees, are very vulnerable  to

retrenchment  and slower re-employment.  The recent  economic

downturn  shows this very starkly.  Dr Vasoo spoke at  length

about  this problem.  These people need to keep their  skills

relevant  through  continuous  learning  and  upgrading,  and

helping  them  to  remain employable  is  a  priority  of  my

Ministry.  The Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund will help the

lower skilled by subsidising relevant skills programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will complement these efforts by enhancing

the social safety net for families in difficulty.  Indeed,  a

range  of  resources for social assistance has been built  up

over  the  years  and, together with the private  and  people

sectors,  we  will  do  more.  Those  in  need  of  long-term

financial assistance can turn to Public Assistance (PA).   PA

recipients  not only get financial assistance, but  they  get

other  assistance too.  This is, I think, something  which  a

lot  of  people do not know.  For example, PA recipients  get

free medical attention at the polyclinics, and many charities

also,  over and above the PA amounts, regularly provide  them

with  assistance,  either in cash or in  kind.   My  Ministry

regularly reviews the various schemes to align them with  the

needs  of the recipients.  In January this year, we increased

the PA rates by between 15% and 32%, and we will continue  to

review this according to the cost and standard of living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the churn and uncertainties of the new economy

mean   that  there  is  an  increasing  need  for  short-term

financial  assistance, to help families tide  over  difficult

periods,  either due to retrenchment, illness or  slower  re-employment.  To meet this need, we will merge two  charitable

funds that we have now, ie, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>

25th  Anniversary  Endowment  Fund  and  the  Silver  Jubilee

(Singapore)  Fund,  into  a  new endowment  fund  called  the

Community Assistance Fund (CAF).  The Government will  inject

a  further $200 million into the Community Assistance Fund on

1st  April  this year.  The interest from the CAF  will  fund

various short-term assistance schemes, such as the Rental and

Utilities   Assistance   Scheme  (RUAS),   the   Centre-based

Financial Assistance for Childcare and Back-to-Work Childcare

Schemes,  and  the Short-term (Interim) Financial  Assistance

Scheme.   These  schemes would provide short  term  financial

assistance in the community.

<br>5.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from financial assistance, social workers from

family service centres will work with needy families to  help

them  address related social problems and acquire  the  life-skills needed for them to stand on their own feet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Providing educational and developmental opportunities to

children   from  low  income  families  is  another  critical

strategy   in   breaking  the  poverty  cycle.   School-going

children already receive various forms of assistance from the

Ministry of Education.  There is also a range of free tuition

programmes  run  by  self-help groups  and  other  charitable

organisations.  No child in Singapore, I repeat, no child  in

Singapore,  is  deprived  of  an  education  for  reasons  of

poverty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many studies show that quality childhood programmes can

help  improve the development and functional achievements  of

children,   especially  those  from  disadvantaged  families.

Therefore, my Ministry will help ensure affordable  childcare

services  for  low income families.  At the same  time,  this

allows their mothers to work, and therefore, also boost their

family income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We currently have two specific financial assistance

schemes to help children from disadvantaged backgrounds.  One

is the Centre-based Financial Assistance for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>

Childcare  (CFAC).  The second is the Back-to-Work  Childcare

Scheme.   The CFAC helps subsidise childcare fees of children

from  low-income families by between $50-$200 a month,  while

the Back-to-Work scheme gives a one-time grant to pay for the

costs   of   entering  childcare,  such  as   fee   deposits,

registration fees and uniforms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1st April this year, MCDS will step up the subsidy

levels of the CFAC to between $150-$230 a month for the first

two  children  of  low income families.   Together  with  the

universal  childcare  subsidy of  $150  and  funds  from  the

Children Development Co-savings (or Baby Bonus) Scheme, which

will be having the Second and Third readings soon, low-income

families  will not need to pay more than 5%-25% of  childcare

fees for the first two children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jennifer Lee has pointed out that part of the

effective  delivery  of social services  is  to  ensure  that

people  know where to get help when they need it.  We  agree.

Often  enough, our experience has been that the  very  people

who  need the help are the most difficult people to reach and

certainly  we will look at ways to try to reach them  better.

The  pilot scheme to delegate the administration of financial

assistance  schemes  from MCDS and the  National  Council  of

Social  Services  to  the  Marine Parade  and  Tanjong  Pagar

Community   Development  Councils  (CDCs)  has  proven   very

beneficial.  CDCs, as you know, are closer to the ground  and

they  are  able  to exercise more flexibility  and  speed  in

advising  and  responding to the needs of their  constituents

because they know what their constituents want, they know the

situation and the conditions of those living in the district.

From  1st  April  this year, we will delegate  all  financial

assistance schemes to the remaining CDCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me thank Dr Vasoo and Dr Ho Tat Kin for their

interest  on  eldercare issues.  I would like  to  provide  a

consolidated reply to both of them.  But allow  me  first  to

report generally on the implementation of the recommendations

of  the  Inter-Ministerial Committee on the Ageing Population

(IMC for the Aged).  Progress

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>

made on the implementation of the 78 IMC recommendations  has

been  good.   Overall, about 75% of the recommendations  have

seen significant progress in implementation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of providing community-based services, MCDS

recently  announced  its  new $93  million  5-year  Eldercare

Masterplan for FY2001-FY2005. The formulation of the plan was

guided  by two key policy considerations.  One, the  emphasis

on  the  social  integration of our senior  citizens.   Older

people  should age gracefully in the community, and  continue

to  be  valued as contributing members of society, and  there

are programmes under the plan to engage our healthy elderly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the family will continue to be the first line of

support in the care of our aged.  My Ministry, together  with

the  Ministry of Health, will ensure that more attention  and

support  will  be  given  to  care-givers,  in  the  form  of

services, information and training.  We will seek to  provide

integrated, accessible and affordable services to the elderly

and their care-givers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the care of our aged requires a coordinated and

concerted effort of the Government, as well as all sectors of

our  society  - the people and private sectors,  the  elderly

themselves and their families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will continue to help the VWOs set up

eldercare facilities through acquiring suitable premises  and

providing  capital  funding for new facilities.   We  provide

clear  guidelines to VWOs on the provision of these services.

More  significantly, from 1st April 2001, we will revise  the

funding  framework  to  lighten  the  VWOs'  burden  of  fund

raising.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is currently studying two key measures to

encourage and facilitate the entry of private operators  into

the  eldercare sector.  First, we will be  building  purpose-built   facilities   for  subsidised  rental   to   eldercare

providers, or to private operators, at market rates.  Second,

we will fund the majority of eldercare services on per capita

basis.  We envisage moving eventually to a means-tested user-subsidy system where an elderly can receive a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>

subsidy, regardless of which service provider he or she  goes

to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will ensure that the number of facilities planned is

sufficient  to  meet the demand.  The needs  of  the  various

groups  of  elderly will be assessed regularly  and  we  will

adjust  the supply of services accordingly.  Where  possible,

the  facilities for eldercare services will be co-located  in

multi-service centres, together with services for  other  age

groups  such as childcare centres.  This will promote  inter-generational interaction and convenience for the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry, together with NCSS, has developed a

programme  evaluation  system  to  evaluate  programmes   and

services  based  on  a set of output and outcome  indicators.

This, we hope, will help raise the standards in the eldercare

sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ho pointed out that it is important to make available

adequately-trained manpower. We will work with NCSS  and  the

service  providers  to  identify the training  needs  of  the

eldercare  industry.   We plan to work with  the  educational

institutions  such as the polytechnics and  ITEs  to  develop

suitable training modules for new entrants to this field.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important human resource is our elderly volunteers

themselves.   Over the next five years, we  will  expand  the

avenues  available for our seniors to contribute their  time,

energy and experience.  Resources will be given to promote an

active  volunteer movement and mutual help among our seniors.

My Ministry will also work with NCSS to look into measures to

better support and sustain the interests of these volunteers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ho Tat Kin mentioned the issue of employment for

older  people.  Sir, the continual employment of  our  senior

workers  remains a key challenge to the Government.  We  will

continue to work with the Ministry of Manpower to help  older

workers.   I  am pleased to inform the House that  the  first

Golden  Manpower  Centre  is being  piloted  at  the  Central

Singapore   CDC.    The   Centre   sources   for   employment

opportunities for those more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>

than  55  years old at the community level, and works towards

changing mindsets of employers, vis-a-vis, the employment  of

older  people.  It also links up with training facilities  to

source for appropriate training opportunities for people  who

register with them.  If the GMC pilot is successful, we  will

certainly look into the feasibility of extending the  concept

more widely in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will continue to monitor the need for community-based services for the elderly. My Ministry will also

continue to follow-up with the implementing agencies  on  the

recommendations  of the Inter-Ministerial Committee  for  the

Aged.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, point of clarification. I had

earlier  asked the Minister on the criteria in  which  Public

Assistance  is  given  to  needy  families.   The  underlying

principle in respect of extending Public Assistance to  needy

families  is one of basic necessity.  I have made  the  point

earlier  that  the definition of basic necessity  may  change

over  time.  Is the acquisition of IT equipment, IT  lessons,

music lessons or dance lessons a luxury or a basic necessity?

Parents  these  days  would want to enrich  their  children's

lives  as much as possible.  Is it unreasonable for a  family

from a lower income group to want to extend these benefits to

their  children?  Can they rely on Public Assistance to  help

their children attain these skill sets?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, it is reasonable for us not

to  include activities like music lessons, ballet lessons  or

IT  lessons  to recipients of Public Assistance.  After  all,

the  very  concept of the assistance itself is  to  help  the

destitute,  ie, those who are unable to get  an  income.   It

would  not be right for us to go into supporting or financing

activities  like IT lessons, dance lessons or  music  lessons

for  such  families.   If children of  such  families  go  to

school,  and if these are provided in the school, the  school

will definitely be helping the children from such families to

attend these lessons and activities.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1098</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, I recall asking the Minister to

comment  on  the rising trend of PA cases.  I do  not  recall

hearing a response.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Mr Charles Chong did ask that

question.   I  will  give him some statistics  on  the  cases

approved.   In  1998, we approved 2,246 cases;  in  1999,  we

approved  2,295,  and  last year,  we  approved  2,603.   The

possible  cause of this is the economic recession  when  more

members  supporting the aged dependants find it difficult  to

do  so, especially during this period.  The ageing population

is  also  a  factor in explaining this rise in the number  of

people who have asked for PA and we will monitor the numbers.

As  I mentioned earlier, we review the amounts we give to our

PA  recipients and we adjust them according to  the  cost  of

living as appropriate at the moment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, MCDS is currently

actively  encouraging Singaporeans to have more babies.   The

Prime  Minister  also announced the baby bonus  to  encourage

young  couples  to  have  second and  third  babies.   In  my

dialogue  with the people, I found out why they did not  want

to have babies. One of the questions asked was, "Who is going

to  look  after my baby?"  Apart from help from the  extended

family  or hiring a maid, the provision of childcare services

is the best solution.  I would like to ask the Minister three

questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, what is the projected number of childcare centres

which  will be needed in the next three years?  Is there  any

plan  to  build  new  childcare centres?   Second,  will  the

Ministry set up childcare centres in community centres in the

constituency?   In  my  constituency, childcare  centres  are

sited  in  the  community centres.  This will  make  it  more

convenient  to the young couples.  Third, will  the  Ministry

consider  setting  up infant centres for babies  between  the

ages of 18 months and two years?  If not, why not?

<br>5.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the traditional style of weddings seems to be out

of fashion among the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1099</b></font><br><br>

young couples nowadays.  Instead, we have various packages to

attract  the  young people.  Young people think that  getting

married entails a lot of trouble and expenses.  They have  to

give dinners in a big ballroom in a hotel.  Friends have told

me  that  young people nowadays do not want to  get  married,

because of the high expenses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, there was an English friend who came to

Singapore.  He told me that there are many single persons and

unmarried  mothers in England today.  I hope  this  will  not

happen  in  Singapore.   Therefore, I would  urge  our  young

people to get married before they have babies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to make the following suggestions in

order  to encourage young couples to get married.  They  need

not spend a lot of money in planning for their weddings.    I

hope  MCDS will conduct mass weddings for the young  couples.

This  is  quite popular in Taiwan and China.  We can  conduct

mass  weddings during Valentine's Day, June and  August,  and

also  arrange  for  honeymoon cruise tours  for  these  young

couples, with MCDS footing part of the bill.  After they  are

married, and if they have babies during the first two  years,

the  Government should give them a special ang pow  of  $888.

In  this  way,  this will encourage them to have  second  and

third babies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also encourage Government departments and the

private  sector to grant one week's paid leave to the husband

in  order  to  keep  the wife company during  her  post-natal

confinement.  HDB could also hasten the process of allocating

the   flats they applied for.  Newly-wed couples normally  do

not  have  much  money.   Therefore, HDB  should  reduce  the

quantum  of  deposit  to  10%,  and  payable  in  two   equal

instalments of 5% each, and the rest can be repayable in  25-30  years.   Therefore,  encouraging  young  couples  to  get

married  should not be the responsibility of MCDS alone.   It

should  be  the  joint responsibility of  the  Ministries  of

National  Development, Manpower, Education  and  so  on.   We

should have an Inter-Ministerial committee to work on how  to

encourage young people to get married.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1100</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem is this. I have not been to the

Registry of Marriages (ROM) for the last 20 years.  Recently,

MCDS  arranged for members of the GPC to visit  the  ROM.   I

found the building to be very old and very crowded, and there

is a lack of romantic atmosphere in the building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our HDB flats have been upgraded and many Government

buildings have been upgraded.  Our Parliament House has  also

been rebuilt.  I would like to ask the Minister whether there

is  a  plan to build a new Registry of Marriages, to  provide

more  space,  more romantic surroundings, so that  our  young

couples can invite their friends and relatives there to share

the most memorable moment in their lives with them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I feel

that  if we were to give a wedding ang pow, it should not  be

just  $888  but  $999.  In Chinese, the  figure  "9"  depicts

eternity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New technology and the widespread use of IT has changed

the  way we work, and has tremendously increased the pace  of

work.   At  the same time, intense competition has  compelled

companies  to reduce cost, by maintaining a leaner  workforce

and  thus  increasing the workload of the existing employees.

The  worst  is that, with all these changes taking  place  at

work  and because of our ageing population, all these  people

who  work very hard in their office will have to take on  the

additional  responsibility of taking care  of  their  elderly

folks  and  raising young children as well.  In other  words,

all  our  working people will have to acquire  the  necessary

knowledge and skills to cope with all these changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, there must be more willingness on the

part of the employers to explore initiatives such as flexible

work  arrangements and adopt pro-family work practices.   For

example,  there  is a necessity for our employers  to  extend

childcare  sick  leave to the male employees  to  look  after

their children who are sick.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, on its part, should consider innovative

ways to provide incentives and motivate companies to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1101</b></font><br><br>

adopt such pro-family practices.  While we should not try  to

legislate  for  pro-family practices  at  the  workplace,  we

should examine the existing laws to see whether there is  any

provision  therein  that  would encourage  our  companies  to

provide  such pro-family practices.  I hope that  MCDS  would

encourage the media to support and give more publicity on pro-family   practices,  to  create  better  awareness  of   such

practices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister, besides the

Family  Friendly Firm Award, what measures would the Ministry

consider  to  effectively encourage  more  companies  in  the

private  sector  to  implement work  options  and  pro-family

practices.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Sir, it is great to hear Mr Ang and Mr

Yeo  speak in support of the family.  For today, I would like

to focus just on one subject, one that is of great concern to

families  with young children, which is childcare  or  child-minding arrangements.  Dr Vasoo also earlier spoke of helping

to  facilitate young couples live close to their  parents  in

HDB  estates,  and  that is one aspect  of  it,  because  the

assistance  of grandparents in supervising childcare  is  one

possible solution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On childcare centres, many families are already sending

their  kids  to  childcare centres.  I think  the  acceptance

level has increased a lot over the years.  And, increasingly,

there is also an added demand for infant care cases, and this

is  a  need that should be addressed.  But number of  centres

and places aside, the fees that you have to pay for child and

infant  care  can take a significant bite out of the  average

family's  income,  particularly if you  have  more  than  one

child.  So the ability to use baby bonus dollars towards fees

will certainly be most helpful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from institutional care, however, there are also

less  structured  child  minding  arrangements  that  already

exist,  to  some  extent,  in the community.   Some  families

foster out the kids during the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>

weekdays  to  bring  them  home on  weekends.   In  addition,

suggestions have been raised on developing neighbourhood baby

sitting  networks,  which  can do child-minding  on  a  daily

basis.   If  these  can be organised, it  will  not  only  be

helpful for working parents, it would also bring income to  a

group of women who would otherwise be unemployed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment for these services would also surely be a

legitimate use of the baby bonus account.  If we can put  all

of  these things together and help with the fees that parents

will  have to bear, they will surely give families the  wider

range  of  childcare and child-minding options  possible,  so

that  they can come to arrangements that will best suit their

circumstances.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Community Development and Sports (Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon):</b> Sir,

I  would  like to thank Members for their concern  on  family

issues.   We  all  know that strong and stable  families  are

important for social cohesion and nation building.   To  help

nurture  such  families, the Government,  together  with  the

people sector, had been providing resources, promoting family

values,  sharing  knowledge and skills for family  life,  and

giving support services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me explain, first, providing resources. Many

families struggle with the lack of two critical resources   - time  and  money.  Many parents say that they face the  "time

bind".   This  is  very true in a new economy  where  we  are

expected to work longer and faster, and upgrade continuously.

To  help  such families, my Ministry has set up the Work-Life

Unit  last September to promote family-friendly practices  in

the workplace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has asked about the measures that my

Ministry  is  considering  to  promote  family-friendly  work

practices.   We  have made quite substantial progress.   MCDS

and  the  Ministry  of  Manpower, the National  Trades  Union

Congress  and  the  Singapore National Employers'  Federation

have formed a Tripartite Committee on Work-Life Strategy.  It

sets  directions  and promotes  pro-family  practice  at  the

workplace.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Manpower is reviewing the Employment Act

which,  among  other things, will also examine  the  existing

legislation   to   ensure  that  it  will  not   impede   the

implementation  of family-friendly practices  that  would  be

adopted for family-friendly practices in the company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, MCDS has conducted 17 sharing and training

sessions on work-life strategies to more than 2,000 employers

and  human  resource practitioners.  We will continue  to  do

this.  We have also leveraged on family-friendly champions to

help  persuade  employers  that  it  is  in  their  business'

interest  to  help their employees find ways  to  manage  the

"time bind".  For instance, the Nominated Member, Dr Jennifer

Lee,  is  also a champion in this area.  If employees  cannot

manage their work and family commitments well, they cannot be

productive at the workplace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry and the Public Education Committee on the

Family, which I am chairing, are already working closely with

the  community and the media to generate publicity  on  work-life  issues.  We will continue to work with the media.   For

example,  we  have an excellent partnership with the  Straits

Times on a regular 24 x 7 Life column every Tuesday.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the multi-pronged approach that we are taking,

employers will progressively buy the need to create a family-friendly  work culture.  So far, NTUC has been supportive  in

promoting family life.  I urge Mr Yeo Guat Kwang to  join  us

in this call to create family-friendly workplaces.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me explain what my Ministry is doing to

inculcate  values.  We seek to work in partnership  with  the

people  and  community to promote family  values,  especially

amongst  our  young.  The Public Education Committee  on  the

Family  (PEC) has a special focus on getting our young people

to  marry  and have more children.  We are very pleased  that

the  people sector has stepped forward to help address common

concerns.   We thank the Workgroup Chairman and  members  for

working  so  hard, as well as the media and  members  of  the

public for their enthusiastic support.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me emphasise that decisions on marriage, procreation

and  the  family  are  private  matters  of  the  individual.

Ultimately,  we  must want to marry and have children  simply

because  we  want  to.   We must also  be  realistic  and  be

prepared for the responsibilities and the commitment involved

in keeping a marriage fulfilling and in raising a child well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last six months, the PEC has been actively

reviewing  how  we can strengthen the Singapore  family.   We

will finalise our recommendations by July this year.

<br>5.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to my third point, that is, sharing knowledge

and  skills  of family life.  Public education  is  not  just

about  influencing values and attitudes.  It  is  also  about

sharing tips on how to live our roles as couples and parents.

We  will  explore  innovative ways to  reach  various  target

groups,  for  example, developing an interactive family  life

website,  developing more real life stories on TV, radio  and

media, bringing mobile kits to workplaces, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October last year, MCDS launched the Family Life

Ambassador  (FLA)  programme  to  build  resources   in   the

community.    The   FLA  programme  is   a   partnership   of

individuals,  civic  groups, schools, businesses,  Government

and  private  organisations to promote and  implement  family

life  education  programme.  It  aims  to  make  family  life

education more accessible and convenient to everyone.   Since

October  last  year,  we  have  appointed  227  family   life

ambassadors.  These FLAs have been organising events,  talks,

seminars  as  well  as  distributing  family  life  education

materials.   We  will  be appointing another  batch  of  FLAs

during the National Family Week in May this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me come to my fourth point - giving support

services.  Sir, as I have mentioned earlier, building a total

social  environment  conducive to  raising  a  family  is  an

important  goal of my Ministry.  A key programme is  to  have

good quality childcare centres which are accessible.  Mr  Ang

Mong Seng asked about the demand

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>

and  supply  of  childcare places.   Enrolment  in  childcare

centres  has  increased from 33,000 to 35,200 over  the  last

three years.  With the trend towards dual income families and

the  injection  of fund from the baby bonus  into  the  early

childhood industry, MCDS forecasts that the demand for places

in  childcare centres will increase.  My Ministry pledged  in

August  last year to increase the number of childcare  places

by  25%, from 46,000 to 58,000 over the next three years.  We

have  already seen an increase of 28 new centres in the  last

six months providing nearly 2,400 more places.  We expect  to

see 60 new centres by end of FY2001.  For FY2002 and 2003, we

expect  to  develop another 50 centres a year.   This  should

increase the number of childcare centre places to our  58,000

target by FY2003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has delegated social service functions to

the Community Development Councils or CDCs.  Mr Ang mentioned

about setting up childcare centres in community clubs.   CDCs

are  in  the  best  position to decide  on  the  location  of

childcare centres and how these centres best serve the  needs

of the local community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure Members that the increase in the

number  of  childcare places would not be at the  expense  of

quality.   MCDS  has  also  put  in  place  a  new  licensing

instrument  for  childcare centres to improve their  quality.

The  criteria  of  assessment  of  centres  are  transparent,

holistic and comprehensive.  Centres find it useful in  their

preparation  for  licence renewal and in maintaining  quality

childcare programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the new Joint Teacher and Accreditation Framework

introduced   together  with  MOE  recently,  all   pre-school

teachers  and supervisors will be required to be  trained  in

the  Certificate in Pre-School Teaching and  the  Diploma  in

Leadership respectively.  Currently, 82% of the teachers meet

the  training  requirement.  By the year 2004, MCDS  requires

all  supervisors and at least one teacher in a centre  to  be

Diploma trained.  I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>

am  happy  to report that reception by the childcare industry

has  been  positive.  This will further raise the quality  of

pre-school education in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang, as well as Dr Jennifer Lee, has asked about the

setting  up  of  infant care centres.  We have  reviewed  the

licensing requirements to facilitate the setting up  of  such

centres.  There are currently seven centres providing  infant

care  service.  Although it is generally believed  that  home

care  is  best  for infants for bonding between  parents  and

child, MCDS will facilitate the provision of this service  if

suitable operators wish to set up infant care centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jennifer Lee asked about the promotion of a formal

care arrangement.  Family-based care for infants is an option

once  used  by  parents  who  prefer  closer  attention   and

supervision  of  their children.  CDCs are already  providing

such  a  service for their residents.  We can help to promote

this  further through registration and matching of users  and

caregivers  at  the  local level.  We are looking  into  some

basic  training  for caregivers.  But we  should  allow  this

informal service to grow without too much regulation.  As for

subsidy,  they  should go to the end-user and  not  the  care

provider.   Part of the baby bonus scheme will  be  given  as

direct cash grant and may be used to cover such expenses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng has made a number of proposals to

promote marriages and procreation.  With regard to organising

a  group wedding package, Mr Ang may be pleased to know  that

MCDS  and  People's Association are supporting an  effort  by

Times  Periodicals of Singapore Press Holdings to organise  a

Mass  Wedding  2001 in September this year.  I  hope  he  can

encourage more couples to join in this wedding.  There is  no

necessity  for  the Government to organise  mass  wedding  or

honeymoon packages.  The private sector and community will be

in  a  better position to promote such programmes.   As  some

wedding  expenses are optional, we will continue to encourage

couples, through public education, to spend on what is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1107</b></font><br><br>

necessary  to go for the marriage of their lifetime  and  not

wedding of the year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang also suggested that we should look into the

development  of a new ROM.  Mr Ang would be pleased  to  know

that  we  are  actively  looking into new  premises  for  the

Registry  of Marriages and the Registry of Muslim  Marriages.

Apart  from  a  conducive garden setting  befitting  such  an

important occasion, we also make sure that we will try to  be

romantic  as  possible.  Our concept is also to  co-locate  a

resource  centre for the family.  As for couples who  want  a

flat early so that their wedding plans could proceed earlier,

Mr Ang is requested to refer such couples to HDB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang has proposed lowering the downpayment for new

flats.   MAS has set the mortgage financing limit at  80%  of

the purchase price or valuation of the property, whichever is

lower.    This  limit  is  for  financial  prudence  and   to

discourage couples from buying a flat bigger than their needs

or  means.  To further assist young couples, HDB has  allowed

those buying a new 4-room flat to pay the downpayment through

staggered downpayment scheme.  The couple need only pay a 10%

downpayment  upon  signing  the  agreement  for  lease.   The

remaining 10% will have to be paid only when they are  called

to collect the keys to the flat which may be one to two years

later.   Thus, there is no need to lower the downpayment  for

now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang has also suggested giving incentives to couples

having  their  first  child within the  first  two  years  of

marriage.  According to feedback, we learn that generally our

young  couples  can manage financially for the  first  child.

After  their second or third child, they may have  a  bit  of

problem.   The  baby bonus however would help  these  couples

with  their  second and third child.  Mr Ang has  recommended

giving  one week's paternity leave to fathers.  He  would  be

pleased  to know that since last October, male civil servants

are  eligible for three days' paternity leave.  Many  private

sector companies already provide paternity leave or even sick

leave  for the parents to help their children.  We  hope  the

rest would follow suit.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the future for the family in Singapore is both

challenging   and  exciting.   Challenging  because   tension

brought about by modern living could place a strain on family

life.   Exciting  because  my Ministry  has  built  a  strong

partnership  with  both the private and people  sectors,  and

together we are putting in place many services and programmes

that  will make Singapore one of the best places to  raise  a

family.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia:</b> Sir, the disabled and the elderly

are  an  integral part of our society.  They do not need  our

sympathy.     They   only   need   our   understanding    and

consideration.  I have four suggestions for the Minister:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) For many disabled people and the elderly,

especially  those  who  have  severe  physical  disabilities,

engaging  a  foreign  maid is something  they  could  not  do

without.   The maids help in the activities of daily  living,

such  as  bathing, toileting, cooking, feeding and  movement.

Most  of  these severely disabled are usually unemployed  and

are  dependent on their family members for financial support.

However, the cost of employing and maintaining a maid is very

high and is unaffordable to many deserving cases.  Therefore,

I  hope MCDS will coordinate with the Ministry of Manpower to

consider  waiving  or reducing the foreign  worker  levy  for

maids  employed by this group of people.  It may  not  be  an

across-the-board waiver or reduction, but on  a  case-by-case

basis.  To minimise any abuses and that only deserving  cases

enjoy  such privileges, a certified assessment by a qualified

medical practitioner or a therapist must be made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Disabled citizens spend a substantial amount of

their  income  on medical fees, transport expenses,  mobility

aids,   like  wheelchair,  calipers,  etc.   Currently,   the

handicapped  earned income relief for a disabled taxpayer  of

below  55 years is $2,000.  I propose for consideration  that

the  earned income relief be increased to $4,000 for disabled

taxpayers below 55 years.  Similarly, I would like to propose

for consideration that the handicapped

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1109</b></font><br><br>

dependent   spouse  relief,  handicapped  child  relief   and

handicapped  brother  and  sister relief  be  increased  from

$3,500  to  $5,000.  This is on the same  rate  as  the  aged

parent relief.  Financially, there is not much difference  in

supporting   a   handicapped  person  or  an   aged   parent.

Therefore,  it makes sense to adopt a uniform rate applicable

to both reliefs.  I would like to ask MCDS to study the above

suggestion with the Ministry of Finance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) With the recent announcement by the Government to

upgrade  all food centres and markets throughout the  island,

may  I  suggest  that provision be made to  ensure  that  all

upgraded facilities be made family-friendly and accessible to

the  disabled,  the  elderly and babies  in  prams.   Besides

providing toilets with facilities for the handicapped,  there

should  be  gentle ramps and gradients for  the  less  mobile

patrons.   The  spaces between the fixed  tables  and  stools

should  be  wide  enough  to  allow  children  in  prams  and

wheelchair users to sit closer to the table.  Currently,  the

fixed  tables and stools of many food centres are located  so

close  to one another that it is impossible or difficult  for

children  in prams and wheelchair users to manoeuvre through.

I  request MCDS to study this suggestion with MND to make the

upgraded food centres more user-friendly to the disabled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) I have seen disabled people in wheelchairs playing

a form of football, mountain climbing, and I have even seen a

one-legged  skier.  With the current emphasis on  Sports  for

Life for all Singaporeans, it is imperative that the needs of

the  disabled and the elderly for sporting activities are not

marginalised.    I  think  it  is  important  that   adequate

accessibility  provisions must be made in all  public  sports

facilities, so that people with disabilities and the  elderly

can  participate  and/or patronise these areas.   This  would

enable  them  to  keep themselves fit  and  healthy.   If  we

incorporate such features during the planning stage, it would

certainly be less costlier than to revamp or renovate them at

a later stage.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, I am speaking to the

Minister  in  his  capacity as Minister  in-charge-of  Muslim

Affairs.   It is a bit odd to be speaking just after  Mr  Goh

Chong Chia who spoke about the disabled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, let me compliment the Minister and the Malay-Muslim MPs for taking this initiative to want to lead the

Malay-Muslim community to face new challenges in the KBE era.

My  view  is that the Malay-Muslims now face a challenge  far

larger than they have ever faced before.  This requires three

very important things.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) It requires enormous financial resources which as a

minority community we are very short of;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A major change of mindset, one that focuses on the

future, one that focuses on new challenges and opportunities;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) We need structural and organisational changes within

the  Malay-Muslim community.  This is where I want  to  focus

some of my thoughts today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen how, through the mosque building fund, the

Malay  community  has been able to raise huge  mosques  which

resulted  in all kinds of activities, not only religious  but

social and educational activities in mosques.  It has brought

about   a  wealth  of  infrastructure  for  the  Malay-Muslim

community  that  we should all be proud of.   But  this  came

about because of the resources that are behind it.  Secondly,

we  have  seen how the establishment of the AMP  and  Mendaki

resulted   in   an  entire  upliftment  of  the   educational

achievement  of  the Malay-Muslim community.   And  something

else that is far more important is that the Malay-Muslims now

realise  education is the primary and most  important  factor

that will bring them forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when we look at the challenges in the future, like I

said, this is a far larger challenge that we have seen,  even

far  larger than mosque building fund, or setting up  Mendaki

and AMP.  This is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>

where I hope the Minister will consider looking into ways  in

which the entire Malay-Muslim community could be restructured

in  a way so that they provide some organisational capability

to  make  sure that whatever programmes and schemes that  you

are  going to introduce can be better executed.  By  this,  I

mean two things.  One, perhaps as much as possible, a lot  of

programmes  should be done in tandem and in association  with

the national programmes which have already infrastructure and

organisational capability.  It is also part of, what we  have

talked  about the last few days - integration.  I  hope  this

must be the main thrust in the way we go forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is also a problem of duplication and

competition amongst the Malay-Muslim organisations.   Already

we  are  short  of resources and if we carry on to  duplicate

having different people competing with the kind of programmes

that they have, we are not going to achieve our objectives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than these two things, I hope the Minister could

also  enlighten  me and the House, ever since the  convention

and  the publication of the report, what other resources  and

support   is  the  Government  prepared  to  help  in   these

initiatives.    I  certainly  look  forward   to   a   better

enlightened  response from the Government to make  sure  that

the  Malay-Muslim  community is  prepared  to  take  on  this

enormous challenge.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, the

Singapore 21 Report acts as a very important pillar, the idea

of  active  citizenry.   To this end, last  year,  the  Prime

Minister  in July opened the National Volunteer Centre.   And

in  his  opening speech, he mentioned that 74% of  those  who

have not volunteered for community work cited work and family

commitments as their main reason for not volunteering.   Also

mentioned   in  the  speech  was  that  less  than   10%   of

Singaporeans are volunteers, as compared to 25% in Japan  and

over 50% in the United States.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this problem has to be tackled quite seriously if

active citizenry is going to be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>

an  important  concept in Singapore 21.   And  we  should  be

targeting the  young working population - and if we do  that,

then  obviously the key is in the companies they are  working

for.   And  the  question  is how  public  spirited  are  the

companies or the corporate sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of corporate social responsibility has at least

three  elements.  The  first is, of  course,  straightforward

philanthropy,  that  is for financial support  for  community

projects.   Many  companies  do  support  this.   The  second

element is to allow their workers, employees to have time off

to  do  charitable or community work, to be involved  in  the

community.  But the third element, the element that I do  not

see much of, is to take into account the social work that  is

done  by employees in actually assessing the quality of their

employees  for  the  purposes of promotion  or  upgrading  in

salaries, and so on.  These are very important concepts  that

have to be taken into account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask whether MCDS has actually taken

steps  to involve the corporate sector to increase the social

responsibility of the corporate  sector in the building up of

an  active  citizenry.  Has there been  an  improvement,  for

example,  in  the  number  of volunteers  in  Singapore  and,

particularly, has there been an improvement in the number  of

young workers in the volunteer movement in Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, I would like to thank Members

for  their contributions.  Let me first address Mr Goh  Chong

Chia's  question on the help that he thinks the disabled  and

the  elderly will need.  Sir, I would agree with him that the

disabled  and  the  elderly  are  integral  members  of   the

community.  We should not make it difficult for them to  live

within the community because that is what we want them to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has called for more help for families with disabled

dependants.  Sir, my Ministry works with the various VWOs  to

set  up  social services and programmes to help persons  with

disabilities to integrate with the community and support

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>

families  in their care responsibilities.  MCDS and  NCSS  in

fact heavily subsidise the services which range from day care

activity centres to residential homes providing both  respite

and  long-term  care.  A family with elderly  dependants  can

also turn to equivalent facilities, such as day care centres,

respite care services and home care services, also funded  by

MCDS  and  the National Council of Social Service.  From  1st

April this year, lower income families using elderly day care

centres will enjoy sliding scale subsidies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, families maintaining their parents or disabled

dependants  are being helped with tax reliefs  already.   The

savings  from the tax reliefs, for example, $5,000  for  each

elderly dependant, $3,500 for each disabled dependant  living

with  them  and $3,500 for each elderly dependant not  living

with  them,  could  partially offset the  cost  of  employing

foreign  domestic  maids or workers to be  used  to  purchase

other care services of professional care givers.  With regard

to  whether tax reliefs could be increased or not, this would

have to depend on the Ministry of Finance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh has also asked that maids be made more accessible

to encourage marriage and procreation.  Sir, engaging foreign

domestic  maids, whether to look after children  or  to  look

after  the  disabled or the elderly, has been an issue  which

has  been  recurring.   But it is just one  of  several  care

giving options for family relief.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to barrier-free accessibility, I understand

that  the  Ministry  of  National  Development  is  currently

updating the code on barrier-free accessibility in buildings.

This   we   feel  will  ensure  that  buildings  and   public

facilities, such as hawker centres mentioned by Mr Goh, would

be  accessible not only to physically disabled, but  also  to

the  elderly, to mothers with wheelchairs, pregnant  mothers,

etc. MND will continue to look further into this area and see

whether  it  could  make this area more accessible  to  these

members of the community.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with Mr Goh that sports should also be for

the disabled, just as it is for the able.  There is already a

separate organisation, I am not too sure whether Mr Goh knows

about  it, but there is the Singapore Sports Council for  the

Disabled  (SSCD)  which looks precisely  after  the  sporting

activities and interests of persons with disabilities.  In FY

2000,  for  example,  the SSCD received  $95,000  as  funding

support from the Singapore Sports Council.  We will certainly

be  looking  into more ways to help the disabled  with  their

sporting  activities and also to help them to  go  into  more

sports.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the code for barrier-free access, it is also now a

standard  equipment  or  requirement  that  all  new   sports

facilities be accessible to persons with disabilities.  These

facilities  include Bishan, Jurong East  and  Chua  Chu  Kang

Stadiums.   And over and above what is required by the  code,

these   facilities   have  reserved   spaces   for   disabled

spectators, and these spaces are near the designated  parking

lots  for  the disabled to make access easier for them.   The

older sports facilities that do not have such features as yet

will be made disabled-friendly when they are upgraded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli Baharudin asked how we could prepare the

Malay-Muslim community better for the new economy.   I  agree

with  Mr  Zulkifli about the seriousness of the challenge  of

the new economy to the community.  This is precisely what the

Malay-Muslim MPs are worried about; which keeps us  awake  at

night.   We  feel  that the Malay community must  be  single-minded  and  serious  in  facing the challenges  of  the  new

economy.   The  Malay-Muslim  organisations  must  coordinate

their  efforts as well as leverage on the national programmes

and  resources because it is no point re-inventing the  wheel

and  set  up new organisations or new initiatives, when  they

are available nationally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member may wish to know that the KBE Facilitation

Committee  (FC), which is chaired by Dr Yaacob  Ibrahim,  has

been  working closely, in fact several months now,  with  key

Malay-Muslim organisations to identify critical programmes

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>

which  meet the needs of the Malay community.  The  committee

took   into   account  the  existing  programmes   to   avoid

duplication  of  efforts and it has proposed  at  the  moment

three  programmes.  One is a parent centre to be  managed  by

the Young Muslim Women Association (PPIS), and the other is a

worker  mentoring scheme to be managed by Mendaki, and three,

the  IT  Student Development Programme to be managed  by  the

Malay Youth Literary Society, or more popularly known as 4PM.

In fact, this programme has started already.  This initiative

has been incorporated into the Malay MPs' blueprint to uplift

the  Malay  community for which Government funding  is  being

sought.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FC also launched the Technopreneurship Club, called

Mind  2000,  and  it also formed the Malay Internet  Steering

Committee.   These  two  bodies,  we  hope,  will  help   the

community better understand the challenges of the new economy

and  what they have to do to face the challenges in  the  new

economy.

<br>6.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the project partners of this project are fully

committed  to achieving the objectives of the programmes  and

clear  lines of accountability have been established  between

the  Facilitation Committee and the project partners that  we

are  working  with.  Also co-funding by the project  partners

will   enhance  accountability.   Therefore,  I   am   rather

reluctant  at the moment to create new organisations  or  new

structures  which,  I  feel,  would  add  another  layer   of

bureaucracy.  What is needed, really, is effective management

in  the  implementation of the programmes and this, we  feel,

could  be  achieved by having a committee which  is  directly

responsible   to  me,  with  enough  resources   to   attract

participation  from  the community.   Nevertheless,  we  will

monitor the situation to see whether restructuring is  really

necessary,  because  restructuring of  the  whole  organising

capability  of the community is a big job in itself.   We  do

not want to be distracted in our pursuit of trying to prepare

the community

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>

for  the  KBE,  and  instead  concentrate  our  resources  on

restructuring the community's organisational structure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin Tet Yung asked about volunteers and corporate

responsibility.   He has highlighted the need  for  the  more

able  in society to help the less able, and for the corporate

sector   to   engage  in  community  involvement,   and   for

volunteerism  to  strengthen these social bonds.   We  cannot

agree more with this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, my Ministry, together with the National

Volunteers  Centre (NVC) and the National Council  of  Social

Service (NCSS), is actively encouraging community involvement

in volunteerism, from the young to even the elderly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NVC, which was set up in July last year, promotes

volunteerism as a way of life, to all levels of society.  The

response, I must say, has been most encouraging.  Some  3,000

individuals  have  signed  up for volunteering  opportunities

through  the NVC's website, while some 60 organisations  have

in fact expressed interest in doing community work.  NVC also

administers an annual grant of some $600,000 to provide  seed

capital  for  new  volunteer initiatives.  It  also  provides

training   and   research,  and  work  with  volunteer   host

organisations to develop good volunteer management practices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to companies, many companies and public

sector  organisations are, in fact, already giving donations.

They  help raise funds, and involve staff in volunteer  work.

Both  NVC  and  NCSS work closely with companies  to  set  up

Community  Involvement Programmes for their staff and,  since

July  1999,  the NCSS has signed up about 110 companies  from

both the private and public sectors in the programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Community Chest Awards are presented to outstanding

corporate   donors  and  fund-raisers  to   recognise   their

contributions.  The NCSS-organised "Tribute to Volunteers" is

yet  another  occasion to acknowledge outstanding  individual

and corporate volunteers, and a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1117</b></font><br><br>

new  category of awards will be introduced in September  this

year, in conjunction with the President's Challenge for 2001,

to  recognise  outstanding individuals and  corporations  for

their  contributions to the social service sector.  This,  we

hope,   would   further  incentivise  people   to   go   into

volunteerism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public sector is yet another key partner that can

mobilise many people to do their part for the community.   My

Ministry  is  working with the PS21 Committee on Staff  Well-Being  to  launch  a  movement called the "Public  Sector  in

Action for the Community" (PSAC) in April this year.  It will

highlight what public service organisations are doing for the

community and encourage even greater involvement by them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading organisations have, in fact, deliberate policies

to encourage their staff to volunteer, eg, Keppel Corporation

and  DBS  Bank grant their employees two days off a year  for

volunteer  work,  and  the staff of Jurong  Town  Corporation

spend  Friday mornings helping out at the Spastic  Children's

Association.   My  Ministry, NCSS and NVC  see  our  role  as

promoting, sharing and recognising such practices, but it  is

really  for the employer to decide how to encourage staff  in

their  volunteer efforts.  But, certainly,  we  will  try  to

motivate  them  and enthuse them into getting more  of  their

staff  to get into volunteer work and, I think, the trend  is

moving upwards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year is the International Year of Volunteers. I

hope many more companies will seize this opportunity to bring

out the volunteers in their people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, besides childcare centres, Before-and-After-School-Care centres (BASCs) are another important facility to help

the  working  parents  and reduce our dependence  on  foreign

domestic workers.  For parents who have no relatives to  help

look  after their children, they wish to know if there  is  a

plan  to  ensure that the need for BASCs in all  the  housing

estates,  particularly  in  a  newly  developed  estate  like

Sengkang, is met.  Does the Ministry conduct any study on the

demand  and  supply  of  such facilities,  and  what  is  the

projection for the next 3-5 years?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, would the Government consider

extending the same level or amount of subsidies, granted  for

childcare, to parents sending their children to BASCs?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Charles Chong.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, the Minister has already

answered my question.

Abdullah Tarmugi.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked about

Before-and-After-School-Care.  By the way,  Before-and-After-School-Care has now been renamed Student Care Centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SCCs provide a useful service in the care of

children.  However, current overall demand is still  low  for

these  student care centres.  For example, a survey conducted

by  the Ministry in 1998 shows that only about 3% of children

between seven and 14 years old need student care services, as

most parents have alternative care arrangements at home, with

relatives  or foster families.  The number may have  gone  up

since, but we do not think it would have increased much.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our data for the 136 student care centres operated by

non-profit organisations show an average enrolment rate of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>

about 70%.  There are another 70 student care centres run  by

commercial  operators, but I do not have the  information  on

their enrolment, as we do not license these centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when planning for the SCCs, we work closely with

non-profit   organisations,  schools  and  local   grassroots

advisers,  to assess the demand and to site them at locations

where  both usage and demand are highest.  For the  next  3-5

years, our projection is for 20 SCCs to be set up each  year.

Twenty  new centres will indeed be set up by the end of  this

year.  Sengkang, a new estate with one centre currently, will

have  six  new  ones  over the next two years,  and  we  will

continue to monitor the demand closely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, instead of having a general subsidy for all, as in

childcare, our preference is for the subsidies for  the  SCCs

to be targeted at low-income families.  For children enrolled

in  centres  operated  by non-profit organisations,  the  fee

assistance  is  up  to  75%, which is  extended  to  families

earning  below  $2,500  per  month.   Anyway,  we  are  still

monitoring  the  situation and will try to improve  the  help

that we can give to such families and centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Singaporeans, we often take pride in the fact

that  we  always  strive  to reach world-class  standards  in

everything  we  do.  We regularly collect accolades  for  our

achievements  in  education, and economic and infrastructural

development.  It is therefore timely to review our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1120</b></font><br><br>

sports  facilities, to ensure that they keep abreast  of  the

latest, if we hope to produce world-class sports talent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the apex of our sports infrastructure is the National

Stadium, which is, by now, a rather middle-aged facility.   I

was therefore delighted to hear the Minister inform the House

that a new stadium would be built.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without doubt, it will require a substantial investment

to build a stadium of international standards.  Therefore, it

is crucial that we do not develop a facility that buzzes only

once  a  year,  on  National Day, or  during  the  occasional

football  match.  We should have an integrated stadium,  with

sufficient   commercial  facilities  and  at   a   convenient

location, to ensure high usage and pedestrian traffic, making

it therefore a viable enterprise.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin:</b> Sir, we aspire to be a sporting nation,

where  sports excellence will strengthen national pride.   We

hope  to  be  a  society where sports binds our  multi-racial

community.   We  want  to encourage our  people  to  exercise

regularly and enjoy sports for a healthy lifestyle.  And,  if

we  can  increase the size of our sports industry, that  will

create and add value to the country, offering many new career

opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve all these ideals, we will need not just a new

building for the National Stadium, but a whole new sports and

recreation  complex,  which will be a  focal  point  for  all

things  related  to sports and healthy recreation.   The  new

sports  complex  must have transportation  convenience,  with

easy  access from a nearby MRT or light rail station, to  cut

down  traffic build-up and car park congestion.  To encourage

Singaporeans to be a sporting nation, our new sports  complex

should be one of the best in this region, comparable to  some

of  the best in the world.  After all, we are now a developed

nation, a First World economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be commercially viable, the new sports complex must

have sufficient commercial abilities to ensure viability

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1121</b></font><br><br>

and  that  it  will  not  be a dead  town  in  between  major

competitions.  It should be located where people could go  to

on  an  average evening in a normal day, for workouts,  games

and recreation, and therefore it should not be tucked away in

some outlying location with difficult access.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to quote an example of such a sporting

complex  that  has  been  built in  Wales,  at  Cardiff,  the

Millennium Stadium, right inside the city.  This new  stadium

was  rebuilt with a seating capacity of 72,500, with  a  roof

that  can  be  fully opened and closed within 20 minutes,  to

enable events of all kinds to be held under all weather.  The

only  other stadium with a retractable roof in Europe is  the

Amsterdam Arena, which has a capacity of 50,000.  The stadium

has  an  adjoining retail, leisure and pleasure  development,

including  shops, restaurants, pubs and hotels.  There  is  a

full   year-round  programme  of  international   and   local

activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To promote arts, we are spending a sum of $594.8 million

for the building of the Esplanade Concert Hall, which will be

completed next year.  For the promotion of sports, we  should

spend  no  less for a first-class all-weather sports  stadium

which  would  be  the  centrepiece in  our  efforts  to  make

Singapore  a  sports  hub.  This sports  hub  would  help  to

increase  our  capabilities  in  sports  science  and  sports

medicine.  May I have the Minister's views on this?

<br>6.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, I cannot but agree more with

the MP for Bishan-Toa Payoh and the MP for Pasir Ris that our

National Stadium is outdated and should be redeveloped.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I mentioned the need to develop a sports industry

in Singapore.  To do this and to attract world-class sporting

events in Singapore, we need world-class venues to host these

events.  Our intention is to go

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1122</b></font><br><br>

beyond simply redeveloping the National Stadium. Instead,  we

have planned to build an integrated multi-purpose sports hub,

with entertainment, convention, commercial and other revenue-generating  facilities. It is important that the place  would

have  to  be  a viable one.  As Dr Ho has aptly pointed  out,

this  is  increasingly  the trend  world-wide  and  this  new

concept  will  help ensure that the sports hub is  viable  by

keeping the place active all the time outside of match  days.

He  also  mentioned the stadium would have to be conveniently

located  so  that  people can go to the place  easily,  which

means  you  need  to have good communications  and  transport

facilities.  This certainly will have to be  looked into.  We

will  do  a detailed feasibility study to ascertain what  the

commercially viable model for the sports hub would be.   This

would  include  ascertaining where the sports hub  should  be

located, what sort of activities should be included, and  how

it  should be run.  If need be, we will go to other countries

to see what their experiences are with such facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MUIS is managing many wakaf properties. These

properties  include  mosques, lands, houses,  apartments  and

commercial premises.  Some of these wakaf properties have the

potential  for  redevelopment and thus would generate  better

income  for the beneficiaries. At present, the management  of

these  wakaf  properties is under a small  department  within

MUIS.   I wish to ask the Minister whether MUIS has any plans

to  privatise  this  department so that  they  could  perform

better, especially in the process of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>

redeveloping  their wakaf properties so  that  they  can  get

better  returns  because some of these wakaf properties  have

the potential to get better returns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also made to understand that an established

management  company  was  awarded a  three-year  contract  to

manage  MUIS properties.  Perhaps, MUIS could also get advice

from this company on how to privatise this department.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I wish to seek some clarification with regard to

the  Mosque Building Programme. We are now in the third phase

of the Mosque Building Programme.  I wish to ask the Minister

to  give  an  update  on  Phase III of  the  Mosque  Building

Programme. At the same time, I also wish to ask the  Minister

whether MUIS has decided on the number of mosques to be built

under  Phase  IV.   Apart from the number of  mosques  to  be

built, where will the locations of these mosques be?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Mr Ibrahim Othman has asked about

the  mosque  development programme.  I would like  to  report

that  there  are six mosques under Phase III  of  the  Mosque

Building  Programme  under MUIS.  The  first  mosque,  Masjid

Khair  at  Choa  Chu  Kang  was completed  in  1997.   Masjid

Istiqamah at Serangoon and Masjid Istiqhfar at Pasir Ris were

completed  in  1999.  MUIS is now building three  mosques  in

Bukit  Panjang,  Sembawang and Bishan.  The mosque  in  Bukit

Panjang  will  be scheduled to be completed  in  2002,  while

those  in  Sembawang  and  Bishan  will  be  expected  to  be

completed in 2003.       MUIS has started planning for  Phase

IV  of  the Mosque Building Programme and it will submit  its

proposal to the Government soon before it is being announced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to corporatisation, Mr Ibrahim Othman has

also  asked about MUIS' plans on corporatisation.  Under  the

Administration  of  Muslim  Law  Act,  MUIS  undertakes   the

development, maintenance and management of mosque  and  wakaf

properties,   amongst   other   functions.    Such   property

development

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>

and management functions are more efficiently and effectively

carried out, we think, on a commercial basis.  Hence, MUIS is

now   embarking  on  the  corporatisation  of  its   property

development  and management activities.  This is expected  to

take place sometime in July this year.  MUIS will continue to

be  responsible for policy and regulatory matters in  respect

of  mosques and wakaf properties. With the corporatisation of

the property department, MUIS, we feel, could better focus on

its  core  functions  of  legal,  administrative  and  social

development  and,  at  the  same  time,  develop  the   wakaf

properties more efficiently and effectively.

<br><br><!-- Encik Ibrahim Bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Ibrahim Bin Othman:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister for

his explanation and beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (7), Mr Charles Chong.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head J of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code JM 1500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are children with varying forms of

disabilities and handicaps.  Some of these disabilities, such

as  physical,  sight  and hearing impairment  can  easily  be

identified.    However,  there  are  dysfunctions   such   as

attention  deficiency, mild intellectual and  other  learning

disabilities that may not be so easily diagnosed.   How  many

of  our  children suffer from such disabilities?  We may  not

know  for certain as I am not aware of any population  survey

done to ascertain this figure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we do know that such children have special

needs.   Many  will  be  capable  of  achieving  their   full

potential  with early diagnosis and professional help.   Some

would need special facilities with specialist teachers.  Some

can  be  integrated into the mainstream schools, while others

may benefit from a combination of both special and mainstream

schools. Are we doing enough for this group of children?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was told that there is currently a two-year waiting

list  for  admission into some special schools.  I  think  we

can, and should be able to, do better in this area.  Although

SPED  schools  come  under the purview  of  the  Ministry  of

Education,  and I am told that MOE is working  vigorously  to

address this situation within the next few months, I  do  not

think  that  we should leave the responsibility  of  children

with  special disabilities solely with MOE. I would  like  to

urge  MCDS, working with strategic partners, including  VWOs,

to  try and fill the gaps in order to ensure that every child

with  a  disability  also receives an  equal  opportunity  to

attend special childcare centre or a special school, in order

to receive an education and, wherever possible, be integrated

into  the mainstream education system in order to pick  up  a

skill like any other normal child.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be timely for MCDS to initiate a committee

involving  the relevant Ministries, NCSS, CDCs  and  VWOs  to

review the services to the disabled, especially for the young

so  that they too can have an opportunity to develop and live

meaningful lives when they grow up.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, my Ministry will continue to

work  with  our partners from the public, private and  people

sectors  to  help  children with disabilities  achieve  their

potential  and  to live as independently as possible  in  the

community.   There is already a wide range  of  services  for

children  with  disabilities in Singapore.  The comprehensive

services  for  the diagnosis and management of children  with

developmental  problems are already  provided  by  the  Child

Development Unit in KKH and the Child Development  Centre  in

NUH.  Outside the hospital system, children with disabilities

are  referred  to  organisations that  can  best  meet  their

special needs, for example, autistic children are referred to

the Autistic Association of Singapore. These are associations

which  have  the  expertise and the people are  committed  to

working with these kids.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1126</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-date, there are six VWOs and three special schools

that  have  set up what we call EIPIC, or Early  Intervention

Programme for Infants and Children below five years old  with

various   disabilities.  The  EIPIC  programmes  help   these

children acquire the necessary learning and life skills.   In

terms of formal education, children with certain disabilities

who  can  attend mainstream schools are already  assisted  by

specially  trained resource teachers in the  schools.   MOE's

programme  for  rebuilding  and  improving  existing  schools

(PRIME)  will,  in five years' time, provide  one  school  in

every  cluster  of  8-9  fully-equipped  schools  which   are

accessible to children with disabilities.  At present,  there

are  16  such  primary schools and 14 such secondary  schools

over  the island.  Other children with disabilities, such  as

intellectual or visual or cerebral palsy, for example,  whose

needs  cannot  be met in mainstream schools,  attend  special

education or SPED schools. To-date, there are 18 such schools

with  a  total  of 3,978 pupils.  The Ministry  of  Education

chairs  a  Coordinating Committee for Special Education  with

representatives from my Ministry, NCSS, NIE and the ITE.   My

Ministry  recognises that more could be done in the areas  of

early  detection  and intervention, as well as  in  providing

childcare  and  other  resources to  help  parents  who  have

children  with  disabilities.  My Ministry will  continue  to

work  closely with Ministry of Health, Ministry of  Education

and  NCSS and other partners in the community to improve  the

network of services for such children.
