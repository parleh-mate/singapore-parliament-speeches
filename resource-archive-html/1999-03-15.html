<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>ORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>PROHIBITION ORDER AGAINST MR CHAN KIAN HIN</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Reasons behind revocation)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs

if  he  will state the reasons behind the revocation within  one

month of the Prohibition Order against Mr Chan Kian Hin who  was

arrested along with Mr Abdul Razak bin Ahmad.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho</b>

<b>Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

Chan  Kian  Hin and Abdul Razak bin Ahmad were both served  with

Expulsion Orders on 18th November 1966 for their involvement  in

Communist front activities. The Government decided to revoke the

order of expulsion against Chan on 10th December 1966 in view of

Chan's clear



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>

repentance  for  his past actions, and the appeals  from  Chan's

father.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> As I

understood  from the Minister when I last raised  the  question,

their crime was agitation for greater academic freedom and I was

told  that  they  were also creating fights.   If  that  is  the

reason, why was it found possible to revoke the Order against Mr

Chan  just  because he made an appeal and showed his  repentance

when the others have not had the Orders revoked?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, in our exchange in the last

debate,  I  made it very clear that it was not just  a  case  of

students  agitating  just  for academic  freedom.   They  played

leading roles in the organisation of demonstrations, processions

and  even  a  violent clash.  This is part  of  the  same  story

because, as I have mentioned just now, the communists were using

the students.  There was a plan to exploit the student unrest by

uniting  the  various  protest movements,  intensifying  illegal

street  processions and demonstrations and provoking a situation

that  would undermine law and order.  These led to the formation

of  the  students' national action front - which the  Government

saw, at that time, to be a dangerous development because it  was

dominated  by  left  wing and pro-communist  elements  from  the

Nanyang  University and the Chinese Middle Schools.  Hence,  the

Government  had to nip the situation in the bud, act  decisively

and four foreign students were expelled.  Again, as I have said,

every  case must be decided on its own merits and facts.   Here,

Chan Kian Hin had made an individual appeal, where he had stated

very clearly his repentance for his past actions and his father,

who was a Singaporean, also appealed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Mr Jeyaretnam is still championing the cause of Chan

Kian  Hin, who is now dead, and in his question, he also  talked

about  Abdul Razak, I think we should know what interest he  has

got  in  the  matter.   As  I said the  last  time,  why  is  he

championing the cause of a foreigner who has shown himself to be

anti-Singapore?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I, again, remind the Minister that I am

not  here to answer questions.  I have said this before.  It  is

simply a matter of justice as between person and person.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, what is your question?

Please proceed to your question.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> He has asked me what is my interest. It is

a matter of justice.  I am answering him.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Do you have any question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Yes, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Ask your question, please.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I know from the Minister, he keeps

saying  about riots and fights, whether there were any riots  at

all during that period?  Was anyone prosecuted for rioting?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, on Mr Jeyaretnam's earlier

point, parliamentary time is precious.  As Mr Jeyaretnam  is  an

NCMP, he is accountable to this House and indeed to Singaporeans

for  the  questions  that he asks.  He has  asked  very  pointed

questions about foreigners who had been expelled.  It  is  right

for me to ask that question.  The record is very clear, Sir.  If

you  go  back to the record, you will see that those were  heady

days   when   there   were  student  protests,   demonstrations,

processions   involving   students  from   the   four   tertiary

institutions  at  that time.  There was indeed a  violent  clash

with the police at the City Hall.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with

your  leave, may I ask the Minister of State whether  any  other

student leader has been arrested for the last 10 years?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Not that I can recall.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister again whether anyone

else  has had the Order revoked?  There were about five  or  six

persons  who  had Prohibition Orders made against them  and  was

Chan Kian

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>

Hin  also  not  a  Malaysian  at  that  time?   He  was  not   a

Singaporean.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, before I answer the

question,  perhaps Mr Jeyaretnam should also answer this  point.

What  is his interest in the matter?  Is he beholden to anybody?

He  has asked about the other foreigners who were also expelled.

Yes,  there  were four of them, all foreigners,  including  Chan

Kian  Hin.   But unlike Chan Kian Hin, the other three  did  not

have families who were Singaporeans.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister keeps asking

me  and you say that I should not answer.  May I say, again,  it

is a question of justice and fairness as between persons who are

concerned.  Why is this man singled out?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, you keep repeating the

same  points and you are asking the same questions.  Do you have

any  other  fresh  questions?  If not, I  propose  to  end  this

Question for Oral Answer unless you have new questions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with respect, he has asked

me a question and I am trying to answer, and you tell me that  I

should  not  answer it.  Then you should tell him,  Mr  Speaker,

with respect, not to ask me any questions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am asking you whether you have any fresh

questions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask him to answer my question

whether there were any riots and whether anyone was prosecuted?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> As I said, Sir, it is all in the

record, the processions, demonstrations and ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Could you tell us?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Yes. If Mr Jeyaretnam were to

look  up  the press reports during that time, those indeed  were

heady  days.   And as I have said, yes, there were  processions,

demonstrations and there was a violent clash.  There were  other

people who were also expelled.  But

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>

the   fact  that  Mr  Jeyaretnam  keeps  taking  up  this  case,

particularly  Abdul  Razak,  that  is  why  I  have  asked  that

question.  Why not the other people who had been expelled?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I am asking for them as well.

<div align="center"><b>1ST APRIL, 1999 TO 31ST MARCH, 2000</b></div>

<div align="center"><b></b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for consideration in Committee of Supply [4th

Allotted Day].



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head T -



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head T - Ministry of Manpower. Amendment

No. (1), Mdm Foo.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Bukit Timah) :</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head T of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1st April 1998, the Ministry of Labour was revamped and

renamed the Ministry of Manpower (MOM).  This was done to  allow

MOM   to  take  on  a  more  integrated  approach  in  planning,

developing and managing human resources and to ensure that these

functions are well coordinated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the years ahead, competition will intensify as the

global economy becomes increasingly interlinked.  In a knowledge

economy, the most important resource will not be merely  capital

or machinery but human beings.  The strategy for us to thrive in

the  knowledge era must be to convert our manpower  into  a  key

engine of growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the first point I wish to raise is on this aspect of

manpower  planning.  Could the Minister enlighten this House  on

(1)  the overall manpower plans that MOM has in mind; (2)  MOM's

strategy  for balancing supply and demand of manpower;  (3)  how

MOM  determines  manpower  demand; and  (4)  what  policies  and

programmes  will  be  formulated to  synchronise  the  needs  of

industries for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>

skilled manpower and the needs of Singaporeans for good jobs  in

the growth sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister also tell the House how the above

information  will be released to the public to  raise  awareness

about  job  growing areas and the skills needed?  We would  also

like to know the progress of the Manpower 21 study effort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, for the first time in many years, we suffered a

net job loss of 17,000.  In the good years, the net job gain was

120,000.  What would be the projections for this year?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last few days, we heard a lot from our colleagues

about  the  mismatch  between employers  and  employees  in  job

expectation  and  skills.  What effort is  being  taken  by  the

Employment Service Department to improve this situation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the low rate of population growth and the rapid

aging  process  of our society, we have had to rely  on  foreign

workers.   We also lack skills or knowledge in certain  critical

areas needed by industries and therefore the infusion of foreign

talent  is necessary.  Otherwise, we will not be able to attract

these high-tech industries.  This means that fewer jobs will  be

created for Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in a time of job loss and fewer job openings

available,  could  the Minister elaborate on what  measures  are

being  taken to balance and manage the supply side of local  and

foreign workforce?  During the recession, there are problems  of

missing   foreign   workers  and  increasing  disputes   between

employers  and foreign workers.  What measures is MOM taking  to

tackle this problem?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I note that the

Ministry  has set up a special unit called the Manpower Planning

Division  and  the  Minister knows my  view  on  this  so-called

manpower approach which I have expressed in the House.  I  think

developing human resource is a far more important area of  focus

for his Ministry than just manpower planning.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The significant experience of most of the manpower planning

agencies in the US  and UK historically is that they are usually

wrong  in their projections.  Even in our case, for decades,  we

have  seen  how  regular  the  universities  have  been  out  in

projecting within a four-year period the output of graduates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other day, I was talking to a young officer from the

Community  Development Council and she told me that  she  was  a

graduate from the Estate Management Faculty.  She told  me  that

only  one  third of her cohort from that Faculty probably  found

jobs   in   the  estate  management,  real  estate  or  property

development sector where they have been trained.  The rest  have

to  look  for jobs elsewhere in other sectors.  There  are  many

other examples of civil engineers, accountants, lawyers, doctors

which output from the university does not quite match the demand

often times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trouble with manpower planning is that at the high

level,  planning for manpower based on the growth of the economy

is  tautological.  You need so many people in this area  because

we expect the economy to grow by so much in this sector.  At the

detailed  level, where you try to project jobs at the industrial

sector  level,  you can often be way out because  of  definition

boundaries.  This will be particularly so when the new knowledge

economy  will keep everyone guessing as to which are the sunrise

and  sunset  sectors.   In this game, the  bureaucrats  are  not

particularly  the best participants.  Even in the  much  vaunted

stock  and flow concept of skill/job retention and attrition,  I

urge  caution.   For  example, I see in the  information  slides

presented to Members of Parliament and resource persons,  yearly

inflow  of 300,000 foreign labour and outflow of 260,000  for  a

fresh  local cohort of 40,000.  This seems to me to  be  a  very

large inflow and outflow figure in a year with a local cohort of

40,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For years, we have been known to be the training ground for a

lot of foreign workers - from maids, shipyard workers

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>

or  engineering sector to executives, coming here  to  work  and

then  going  to other countries.  We should bear  in  mind  that

experience and training opportunities go with the job.   When  a

job  is  denied  to a Singaporean, the training  and  experience

opportunities to them are also no more available.

<br>12.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The danger is that when the Government machinery gets set

in, the plan will be to get in the foreign supply to satisfy the

equation  forecast, while our own people who could  be  trained,

cross-trained or upgraded are in the forgotten loop  or  out  of

the  loop.  Finding new ways and means to train and develop  our

people  is  a  more valuable effort than just bringing  in  from

outside the members to satisfy the equation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to add that I am not against foreign talent. My

concern and experience in the private sector is that many of the

so-called  foreign talents here are quite foreign but not  quite

talent.   Bringing  in  the  numbers will  deny  many  deserving

Singaporeans the opportunity of training that goes with the job,

and the numbers may well be wrong.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, the exchange between

Dr  Tan  Cheng  Bock, Member for Ayer Rajah and BG  George  Yeo,

Second  Minister for Trade and Industry shows that the topic  of

foreign  talent can indeed be laden with emotion.  And  earlier,

my  colleague, Mr Chay Wai Chuen, has also pointed out the  same

issue.   But  the  fact  is, by and large, Singaporeans  welcome

immigrants  to our land, especially those who can contribute  to

Singapore and are prepared to sink their roots here.  After all,

most Singaporeans are descendants of immigrants ourselves.  But,

as  Mr  Chay  pointed  out, this is a question  that  should  be

brought  out to the open, and that is, does induction of foreign

talent  introduce competition to our sons and daughters?   To  a

certain   extent,  I  believe  it  does.   A  fair   number   of

Singaporeans  find  that  they  do  have  to  compete  with  new

immigrants for jobs and housing.  In certain cases, they see

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>

foreign  talents  as taking away plum jobs  as  in  banking  and

financial services, but of course, those are in small number and

those people affected can take care of themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other cases, they see foreign professionals holding

down  wages  in  growth areas like information technology.   So,

obviously those affected would prefer them to be the king of the

hill even though it is a small molehill.  So, the affected would

usually  ask  what is meant by the term "foreign talent".   They

would  prefer the dictionary definition of the word "talent"  as

referring  to  people that Singapore, by itself, cannot  produce

and not just cannot produce in sufficient number, but cannot  be

produced  at all.  Whereas, I think the Government's  definition

is  more  like  anyone who can contribute to  Singapore  in  the

designated areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me state upfront that I support our existing foreign

talent  policies.  In many areas where there is  a  shortage  of

people,  foreign talents help in our economy. For  instance,  in

the area of information technology, the industry is already very

vibrant  and the turnover too is high as it is.  And in  today's

newspaper, we read about the story of IT professionals earning a

very high income, and a lady professional who made dough in hard

times  would  be able to buy diamonds as and when  she  prefers.

So,  even  today, there are many cases of professionals changing

jobs  for a 20% jump in salary and after holding the job at  the

current salary for less than three months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if we just depend on local manpower, I believe

that  the  salary will escalate even faster and we  would  price

ourselves  out of the global market.  And this is not a  problem

unique  to  Singapore.   Even  in  the  United  States,  with  a

population  of  220 million, it is also unable  to  meet  market

demands  by  just  depending on domestic  supply  alone.   As  a

result, the United States is opening its market, and absorbing a

high  number of foreign IT professionals through increasing  the

quota  of H1 visa in 1999. H1 is a US immigrant visa for skilled

professionals.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>

I  think  we  could say that, in the short-term, some individual

Singaporeans   would  face  greater  competition  from   foreign

immigrants.  In the long-term, foreign immigrants bring  greater

prosperity and diversity to our country.  On balance, we  should

welcome foreign immigrants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to some of the policies implemented by the

Ministry of Manpower that would affect the induction of  foreign

talents.  I am referring to the issuance of employment  pass  by

the  Ministry  of Manpower when it took over that function  from

the  Ministry  of Home Affairs.  In so doing, it introduces  the

new  classification of employment pass and I am referring to the

P,  Q1  and  Q2.  Perhaps, the Ministry believes  that  the  new

classification  solves  some problems in  the  old  system  but,

unfortunately, it also introduces some undesirable effects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, many highly educated foreigners are grouped

together,  with  skilled  and semi-skilled  workers  in  the  Q2

category, primarily because their current income is not as  high

as  they  would like to have, especially in the current economic

downturn. By bringing these new immigrants to our country,  they

have  to adapt to our culture and, as such, it is not surprising

that their income level tends to be lower than Singaporeans  and

PRs  with  comparable backgrounds.  Some of these  professionals

take  it  as  an  affront  to them to be  lumped  together  with

immigrants of lower educational levels.  Furthermore, Q2 holders

cannot bring their families to Singapore and that would make  it

very  difficult  for these foreigners to accept  job  offers  in

Singapore.   As  a  result, some of them would  ask  for  higher

salary,  just to be classified as Q1.  To avoid this problem,  I

suggest  that we go back to the principle that we determine  the

desirability of these foreign talents based on their educational

background  and  their ability to contribute to Singapore  on  a

long-term, and place less emphasis on their current income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second item that I would like to bring up is that all

immigrants to Singapore would like to receive their PR status as

soon  as  possible.   There are many  advantages.   Being  a  PR

changes

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>

the whole orientation for them.  For example, they would be able

to  buy  HDB flats in the resale market. PR status gives them  a

peace of mind to settle down in Singapore.  On the other hand, I

detect  a  recent,  but  a  discernible  trend  of  PRs  leaving

Singapore for greener pastures overseas.  I believe one  of  the

reasons  they left Singapore is that they discovered that  their

income  has  shrunk, as a result of our CPF cut, wage  restraint

policy  and the weakening Singapore dollar.  In comparing  their

income  on  a global scale, these professionals found that  they

are  losing  out  to  their friends who have settled  elsewhere.

While their behaviour is entirely understandable, but from those

Singaporeans  who have interacted with them, what I  would  call

"fair-weather PRs", they lamented that Singapore is  being  used

as  a  stepping stone.  They believe that perhaps we should only

issue  PRs  to  those who are really committed to Singapore.   I

understand  that it is a very fine balance between  meeting  the

aspirations of new immigrants through issuing them PRs and  also

the  need to inculcate a sense of belonging to Singapore.  There

is  no  easy answer.  May I seek the Minister's comment  on  the

issues I have brought up?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, in times of high

economic growth and full employment, I think it is fair for  the

Government not to impose a limit on foreign talent.  In fact, in

1989,  the  Government formed the Immigration Affairs  Committee

(IMAC)  with  the  view  to bring in professionals  and  skilled

workers  from Hong Kong.  The first batch of 25,000  Hongkongers

were  invited to work in Singapore.  Can the Government  let  us

know  how  many Hongkongers accepted the offer and  applied  for

Singapore PR under that exercise?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 1991, BG George Yeo, the Chairman of IMAC, in an

interview, informed the Berita Harian that there was no  cap  on

foreign  talent,  including Malay/Muslims who wish  to  come  to

Singapore,  as long as they can contribute to the  country.   He

said that a ceiling is only appropriate if the number turns  out

to be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>

too  large.  I would add that a ceiling should be introduced  in

times  of high unemployment like the present time.  In the past,

Singapore  has  used  the Singapore Malay Chamber  of  Commerce,

Mendaki  and  the  two task forces formed  by  IMAC  to  attract

Malay/Muslims and Indian talents from abroad.  In  the  case  of

India,  advertisements for several jobs in Singapore  were  made

from  time  to time, and sometimes, like Singapore Airlines,  it

issued their own advertisements inviting job applications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether IMAC or other

Government agencies are still actively recruiting foreign talent

to  Singapore.   I wish to quote BG George Yeo.   He  said,  "We

cannot invite someone here and find him a job.  This is not  the

way  we work.  In any case, it is not sustainable."  My feedback

is  that  foreign  professionals who  come  here  to  find  work

sometimes  are  selected in preference to local applicants.   It

happens  like  this.  Many foreign Caucasians  are  employed  as

managers  in  our  local  firms  or  positions  where  they  are

responsible  for recruitment of new staff.  They  interview  the

applicants.   If  in a group of applicants that are  interviewed

happens  to  have Caucasians or ang mohs among them, often  than

not  the  Caucasian  applications get selected.   The  Caucasian

managers  that  do the selection often feel that they  have  the

same  background and culture as another Caucasian, and  probably

he can work better with another Caucasian than with a local.  In

this  way,  local  applications for jobs  can  be  discriminated

against.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have known of one case where a Singaporean with an

Australian  mathematics degree was not selected for  a  teaching

post  in  a  private  institution.   He  informed  me  that  the

interviewer  was an Australian.  The Australian selected  a  New

Zealand  applicant  in preference to him.  This  Singaporean  is

very  sore  and wants this case to be brought up in  Parliament.

Perhaps, this may be the type of case that Dr Tan Cheng Bock had

in mind when he warned against foreigners taking over jobs which

rightly belong to Singaporeans.  I support Dr Tan in his call to

the  Government  to think of Singaporeans first  in  these  hard

times.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>

He does not want Singaporeans to lose out to foreigners in their

applications for jobs.  I do not think that Dr Tan  intended  to

do  Singapore  a  disservice when  he  made  that  call  to  the

Government the other day in Parliament.  I think Dr Tan realises

that  Singapore also needs plenty of foreign investments and  he

did not mean to give any wrong signals to foreigners.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, when Dr Tan Cheng Bock spoke last

week  during the debate on the Prime Minister's Office,  he  was

misunderstood,  so  much so that the New Paper  columnist  Raoul

Patek made a very reasoned argument that we should not close our

door  to  foreign talent.  Singapore has always welcomed foreign

talents and, in fact, it was a Dutch economist who brought us to

where  we are today.  There are many areas which Singapore  does

not  have the expertise and I do not think that we will have  it

in the near future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand Mr Chiam See Tong's plea for looking after

Singapore.  But we can look after Singapore better if we look at

the  broader  economic  perspective because  these  are  people,

whether  in  the  IT  sector  or financial  sector,  who  create

economic  prosperity, jobs and wealth for us.  And  I  think  we

should  not be shortsighted that in times of crisis,  we  should

forget  them.   To  do so would be suicidal.   Let  me  give  an

example.   When  I was in law school, most of my  teachers  were

foreigners.  Things have changed.  Now, the Law Faculty has more

local  lecturers  than foreigners.  Similarly, some  years  back

when  the  Government wanted to bring foreign legal firms  here,

some  lawyers felt that the Government was not being fair.   But

we  have  to  look at it objectively.  If we do not allow  these

foreign  legal firms to be based here, the work will go to  Hong

Kong and elsewhere.

<br>1.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge the Minister not to be shortsighted, but

look   at   the  broader  perspective  of  Singapore's  economic

framework.   After  all,  we  are a  creature  of  an  immigrant

society.   Many  of our forefathers came from China,  India  and

other

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>

places,  and  the  process must continue. And  if  we  want  the

process to continue, then we must send the right message to  the

people, because foreign capital and foreign talent are in  short

supply.   Even America, with its huge population, is in need  of

talent.  That is why they go to Silicon Valley from India, China

and  Taiwan.  And if we want to create a Silicon Valley, we must

have  these foreign talents here.  Sir, what is required is  for

the Ministry of Manpower to lay down a broad policy and send the

message to the world at large.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I do not forget my Singaporeans,

because Singapore citizens and permanent residents who have been

here  have  a  stake  in this country.  But we  should  give  an

assurance  in  this  House that their interests  will  never  be

sacrificed.   We  are  bringing in these  people  to  serve  the

country  better.  I hope when Raoul Patek reads today's  debate,

he will change his mind.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in the

world  today  where competition is very keen, the  progress  and

development  of  nations are determined more  and  more  by  the

quality of its people.  Therefore, the Government has taken  the

correct  approach  in emphasising on continuous  and  life  long

training  and  retraining for our people.  We  have  managed  to

deservingly  earn  a reputation for having a  first-rate  and  a

world-class workforce.  The challenge therefore is  how  we  can

maintain and even improve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the military strategy of Sun Tze, he said the strength

of  an  army does not depend on large forces.  Rather, one  must

concentrate the forces.  And this was taken from Sun  Tze's  Art

of  War.    In my view, besides helping Singaporeans to  upgrade

and  compete more effectively in the marketplace, we must reduce

our  dependence  on foreign workers.  While I am not  belittling

the  contributions  of foreign workers, their  presence  is  not

without  any cost.  I strongly urge the Ministry of Manpower  to

tighten  its criteria and selection on the admission of  foreign

workers, so that not any Tom, Dick and Harry can gain employment

in Singapore

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>

at  the  expense  of  Singaporeans.    If there  are  jobs  that

Singaporeans  do  not  want or cannot  do,  then  by  all  means

foreign  workers  can be considered for employment.   Today,  in

Singapore,  we  have more than 400,000 foreign  workers  and  at

least half of them are employed in the construction sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would like to know if the Ministry has any

plans in the pipeline to encourage the development of automation

and  buildable designs in the construction industry.  I  believe

this will help to reduce our dependence on foreign workers,  and

also  we  can  improve  our  productivity  in  the  construction

industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Ministry introduced a new work permit

allocation system for the construction sector.  I would like  to

know  how effective this has been and whether there are any more

control measures being planned to promote self-regulation in the

construction industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the years, there were reports in the newspapers

about  social  problems we face with the vast  increase  in  the

number  of  foreign workers.  MOM should help our  employers  to

build  proper  outside dormitories and develop  a  comprehensive

management  system to address the issue of housing  for  foreign

workers.   This  is something which is of great concern  to  our

people,  because if too many foreign workers live in our housing

estates,  it  would  create  some  social  problems.   With  the

economic  downturn,  many contractors  have  been  hit  by  poor

business,  and hence face cash flow problems.  Is  the  Ministry

considering  granting  some  flexibility  with  regard  to  late

payment of levy and levy bond for genuine cases?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, with the measures taken by the Government so far in

boosting  business competitiveness and cutting costs to preserve

jobs for our workers, would the Ministry be able to provide some

indicators on how successful we have been, and how effective  is

the cost cutting package that was introduced?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has touched on

the  social problems of our foreign workers.  He says that there

is  a  need to give better housing to foreign workers.  I  would

like  to  touch  on  the  recreational  activities  for  foreign

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreign workers are now a common sight in Singapore.

We see them in all construction sites, whether public or private

ones.   We  see them in all our shipyards.  We see them  in  our

factories and in our homes.  Singapore would not have been  able

to  make  such great economic progress if it were  not  for  the

labour  contributed  by foreign workers.   We  can  see  foreign

workers   on  weekends  congregating  at  different   parts   of

Singapore,  depending on where they came from.  On  Sundays,  we

see  the  Indian foreign workers gathering at the Tek Kah  area.

The  Thai workers congregate at Beach Road Golden Mile area, and

the Filipino maids gathering at Lucky Plaza at Orchard Road.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, there are no sporting, recreational or

cultural programmes organised for them.  They just loiter around

in  those places.  Some sit at whatever places they can find  on

the roadside, on railings or public chairs, if there are any  in

the  vicinity.  They have nowhere to go.  Their wages  are  low.

They  do not have any spare money to spend.  Whatever spare cash

they  have is probably sent home to their impoverished  families

in their own countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is estimated to collect about $21.6 million

on   fees  and  charges  in  FY99.   Much  of  this  money   are

contributions by the employers of foreign workers.  I  think  it

is  equitable or fair that some of these funds, say,  about  2%,

should  be ploughed back to the foreign workers in the  form  of

organised,   recreational,   sporting,   social   or    cultural

activities.   As  it  is, nothing is done  for  foreign  workers

outside their working hours, except for the efforts of the  hon.

Member,  Mr Loh Meng See, who was reported in the press to  have

organised   sports  and  games  for  foreign  workers   in   his

constituency  at Kampong Glam.  I congratulate Mr  Loh  for  his

concern for the foreign workers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is reported that crime is on the rise in Singapore and

many  instances of crimes are committed by foreign  workers.  If

something could be done to keep them occupied, the incidence  of

crime involving foreign workers may drop.  I urge the Government

to  put  some funds aside from the levies collected to  organise

extra-curricular  activities  for  foreign  workers.   The   ECA

outside  their working hours shall not only keep foreign workers

away  from  doing  mischief but also probably make  them  better

workers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I share the sentiments of Mr Chiam

and Mr Yeo who spoke earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the foreign workers are helping in the economic life

of Singapore.  Just imagine if these foreign workers were not to

work  for  one week, I think our housing estates will be  dirty.

Construction  sites  will  come  to  a  standstill.    We   must

appreciate the contribution made by these foreign workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two areas which I would like to touch - recreation and employment. Sir, there are certain games and

sports which are not very expensive, for example, Kabadi for the

Indian and Bangladeshi workers.  All they require is a field. No

other  equipment is required.  Could we help them  by  providing

them grounds where these activities could be taken?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will go one step further. The employers should be

encouraged  to have small recreational areas at the construction

sites.  I pleaded with the Minister for Information and the Arts

for  programmes in Thai and Bangla.  Unfortunately, he said that

it  was  not possible.  We must think of these poor workers  who

are  away  from their homes.  They are lonely.  They work  hard.

They must be given some opportunity to relax.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturdays and Sundays, they gather at the various

places, as has been told to this House, but what about the other

working  days?  Can we do something?  I would urge the  Manpower

Ministry to work closely with the employers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another area on which I have spoken earlier, but I

am  going to repeat my plea and I hope that it will not fall  on

deaf  ears.  This is on foreign workers who have been  exploited

by   some unscrupulous agents in Singapore.  These workers  come

here and they work for one or two months and then they find  the

companies are closed and they have no jobs.  The next thing that

follows is that they have to pack and be sent to their countries

of origin.  Could we allow these workers a slightly  longer stay

in  Singapore,  so  that they could look for  other  employment?

They  have  paid huge sums of money, often selling or mortgaging

their land.  $4,000 may not be a big figure  for us.   But  when

we  convert this into Indian Rupees or Bangladeshi currency,  it

is  much  higher.   I  will  go one step  further  and  ask  the

Ministry: can we have a job placement body in the Ministry which

could  help  these foreign workers?  They are  helping  us.   We

should help them.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Sir, may I

respond  to  Mrs  Yu-Foo  Yee Shoon, Chairman  of  the  GPC  for

Manpower,  and the other Members who have spoken on the  subject

of manpower planning, foreign talent and foreign workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On manpower planning, the first point that I want to make

is that we have a small workforce of about 2 million.  The local

workforce grows at around 45,000, maybe 50,000, a year,  as  the

new  entrants  join the labour force.  Between  1987  and  1997,

total  employment creation in Singapore grew rapidly from  about

70,000  in 1987 to a high of 120,000 in 1997.  This resulted  in

persistent  shortage of workers and explained the chronic  tight

labour  market situation in Singapore.  Of course,  the  current

situation  is  a  complete  reversal.   Owing  to  the  regional

economic crisis and its impact on Singapore, we have seen rising

unemployment  and  a record high number of retrenchments.   Last

year,  1998,  we  suffered a net job loss of  23,400  jobs,  and

unemployment rose to 4.3% in December last year.  For this year,

the  employment situation is likely to continue to remain  weak,

with employment growth either flat or possibly negative.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, manpower planning is about managing and balancing the

supply  and  demand  of manpower for the  economy.   We  aim  to

balance  at  the national level manpower demand from  industries

and  manpower supply from both local and foreign sources, so  as

to  sustain  economic  growth and to optimise  the  use  of  our

available manpower resource.

<br>1.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Manpower Planning Division is new to my Ministry.

MOM   is  now  the  central  coordinating  manpower  agency  for

Singapore.   We  have  adopted a holistic approach  to  manpower

planning  needs.   This is done in close partnership  with  many

other   Government  Ministries  and  agencies.   MOM  has   also

appointed  academics  from NUS and NTU to  help  us  to  develop

relevant models to guide policy decisions.  I note what Mr  Chay

mentioned  earlier on about the fact that many other  countries'

experience  in manpower planning has always turned up  short  of

expectation, and they have in many cases gone wrong.   Even  our

own  university, according to Mr Chay, has not come up with good

long term projections for manpower demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task of manpower planning is not easy. It is going to

be a very difficult task.  To hit the target right every time is

not  going to be easy.  But that does not mean we should not  do

anything.  That does not mean we should just leave it on its own

to  muddle through.  We, of course, are also studying how  other

countries  are  tackling their manpower  planning  issues.   For

instance, in the US, the US Bureau of Labour and Statistics  has

a  long  experience  and long history of carrying  out  manpower

planning.  They have well-established methodologies as  well  as

manpower research and training programmes. We will seek to learn

from  these  more  established  manpower  planning  agencies  in

overseas countries and to tap on their experience.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this effort by my Ministry to develop a manpower

planning  model for Singapore is still at an early stage,  I  am

afraid I will not be able to provide Members with details.   But

I  would like to assure Members that our objective is to  gather

as  much  information as possible to provide timely and relevant

information on manpower and skills demand and supply for  better

management  of our workforce.  We will release this  information

to  the  public in our regular employment outlook reports  which

will  touch on the industry's specific trends.  However, Sir,  I

must  point  out that manpower planning in itself cannot  ensure

that  there will be sufficient jobs for all Singaporeans.  These

will  have to depend on the performance of the economy  and  the

resulting  job creation.  Manpower planning can help  us  to  be

more responsive to changes and to deploy workers to growth areas

where  jobs  are  still being created.  This  includes  a  clear

identification  and projection of areas of employment  creation,

analysis of areas of supply shortages and surpluses, and also  a

wide ranging skills upgrading and workers' retraining programmes

to bridge the skills gap.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon has also asked for an update on

the  Manpower  21 Committee's effort.  This was  the  initiative

launched by my Ministry in June last year.  The objective is  to

formulate a strategy for the development of Singapore's manpower

capability to forge a globally competitive workforce.  The study

team  includes some 100 top businessmen, captains of  industries

and  civil  servants who have held many in-depth discussions  on

manpower  issues confronting us today.  Some Members  have  even

made study tours overseas to learn about how other countries are

going  about  in  their  human resource development  and  skills

upgrading for their own workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, their findings and recommendations are being

rigorously debated within the Committee itself and refined.   At

this  juncture, I would just like to provide Members  with  some

indication  of  some of the key ideas which have come  out  from

these discussions.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the concept of a school of life-long learning.

This is part of a national framework to enable every Singaporean

to  pick up new skills in order to enjoy lifelong employability.

There  are altogether six key features of the school of lifelong

learning.  First, recognition.  Life-long learning must lead  to

recognition for the skills gained. There must be incentives  and

this should be employer and also individual-based incentives  to

encourage  employers and workers to pool their  effort  to  send

their workers for skills upgrading and retraining.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to develop a network of learning or training

providers,  both  public institutions and also private  learning

institutions,  so  that any worker who wants to  go  for  skills

upgrading  will be able to have the opportunity.  We  must  make

use  of  technology. We must tap technology to  make  sure  that

training  or  skills upgrading opportunities can  be  made  more

accessible  to workers.  For instance, we should tap  electronic

learning  (e-learning) through the Internet so that workers  can

perhaps study either at home or even at community centres  where

such equipment can be provided.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should facilitate workers' access to career development,

to  job  opportunities and to training available, and  also  the

kind of funding that Government can give to support such workers

training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, but not least, we must have a sustained strategic

marketing plan to continually encourage and motivate workers  to

go for such skills upgrading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next idea that has been developed is this concept of

developing  a  manpower  industry in  Singapore.   The  manpower

industry  is defined as a cluster of companies involved  in  the

total development of Singapore's manpower and talent capability.

This  includes  both public institutions and  private  companies

such as management schools and human resource consultancies.  We

intend  to  work  closely  with  this  cluster  and  to  develop

organisations and institutions and companies so that they  would

be able to contribute more to Singapore's manpower

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>

development.  The manpower industry has the potential to  become

a new growth industry serving both domestic and regional needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third idea that has cropped up from the discussion by

the Manpower 21 Committee is to prepare for the workplace of the

future and the need to strengthen tripartite relationship.  Sir,

as the concept of work is changing on a global scale, we need to

build  new infrastructure that will enable more people  to  work

from  home or within their communities.  Welfare structures such

as safety at work, industrial health, workmen's compensation and

employment  coverage  would have to be reviewed  to  respond  to

these  changes.   At the same time, this would be  an  excellent

opportunity for us to strengthen tripartite relationship at both

the national and enterprise level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, besides these key ideas here, there are still many

others being discussed and refined by the Manpower 21 Committee.

The Committee expects to complete its work by June this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon has also raised the point about

missing foreign workers and the disputes between foreign workers

and their employers.  Yes, there has been an increasing trend of

missing  foreign  workers, particularly  from  the  Indian  sub-Continent.   Most  of  these  workers,  in  fact,  are  here  in

Singapore working in the construction industry.  Apart from more

enforcement  actions  to  round  up  such  missing  workers  and

overstayers, we will also try to introduce new deterrents.  Part

of the problem of missing workers is, in fact, as pointed out by

Mr Rai, because some employers exploit and take advantage of the

foreign  workers.  So they run away.  What we want to do  is  to

try  and  minimise this possibility of employers exploiting  the

foreign  workers.  So with effect from 1st April this  year,  we

are going to introduce a measure whereby employers who have more

than  two missing non-traditional source workers within the same

calendar  year will not be allowed to employ new non-traditional

source  workers for a certain period of time.  This is to compel

employers to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>

better manage and better look after their non-traditional source

workers  so  that they do not run away or abscond and  therefore

put  the  employer in a corner whereby he can no longer  recruit

any new non-traditional source workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has also been a sharp increase in the number of

foreign  workers  making claims against the employers  over  the

last  few  years.   In  fact, in 1998, close  to  7,000  foreign

workers  made claims against their employers, mostly  on  salary

arrears.  Almost all the claims that we investigated turned  out

to  be  valid.   In other words, the contractors have,  in  most

cases,  attempted to cheat or deprive these foreign  workers  of

some  salaries.   These  are the ones who  regularly  flout  the

Employment  Act.  We take a very serious view of  employers  who

try to cheat their foreign workers or to take advantage of them.

So  employers who blatantly disregard or violate the  Employment

Act  will not be allowed to apply for new work permits or  renew

existing work permits for their foreign workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I come to Dr Wang Kai Yuen, Member for Bukit Timah

GRC.   He  asked  whether in our streamlining of the  employment

pass   system   into   a  PQR  system,  we  have   inadvertently

disadvantaged  a  group  of  skilled or  talented  workers  from

overseas who are now granted Q2 employment pass.   My answer  to

him is no.  Although we do have salary criteria or guidelines, I

believe  I  had,  in a previous sitting in this House,  informed

Members  that  the salary yardsticks are just guidelines.   They

are not rigid criteria which we use to exclude people who do not

meet our salary guidelines.  In fact, what is more important  is

the  foreigner's education, work experience and  the  nature  of

jobs  that he or she will be doing in Singapore.  We do not just

grant  employment  pass  purely on  the  basis  of  the  current

earnings  of  an  applicant.  We will look into  the  real  work

experience and the qualification.  So let me assure him that the

new   PQR   system  does  not  intentionally  or   inadvertently

discriminate against this group.  In fact, for those who

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>

are  well  qualified, they will be granted either a P employment

pass  or a Q1 employment pass, which allows them the benefit  of

bringing in their dependants. Those who are presently granted Q2

are  not  because  they are earning a lower income  but  because

their  skill  criteria and qualifications lie in the  borderline

region,  and we want to let them work here for a period of  time

for  a proper assessment.  So they can subsequently re-apply for

a  higher category of employment pass if their employer supports

their application.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang said he supports our foreign talents policy, but he

cautioned  against granting PR too readily.   Let  me  say  that

foreign  talents  come to Singapore for a variety  of  purposes.

Some come here to experience our culture and to work in an Asian

environment for a period of time.  Others come clearly with  the

hope of sinking roots in Singapore.  Whether they are here for a

short stay or a long stay, I think, is not that important.  What

is important is that while they are here, they are making a real

contribution to our economy.  They are really helping us  to  be

more competitive and to grow the economic pie.  I think that  is

more  important.  So what matters is, during the period of  stay

they  contribute to Singapore's economic well being.  Those  who

want to stay in Singapore and to sink roots here, and those whom

we feel that we need and welcome, we should consider them for PR

because  they  will  add  to  the  richness  and  strength   and

capabilities of our workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the eligibility for PR of foreigners, whether they are

here  working  first  on employment pass or  they  are  applying

directly  for PR, is thus determined to a large extent by  their

ability to contribute to Singapore's economic capability,  their

assimilability  and  their commitment to  our  national  effort.

Over  time,  such  migrants will also become true  Singaporeans,

like  many  of our forefathers.  They can help us to compete  in

the  economic  arena and contribute to social cohesion.   So  we

should not deny ourselves of this source of talents, this source

of new migrants, by slowing down the issue of PR unnecessarily.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to Mr Chiam who said that he supports that

in  the  period of high growth, Government should not limit  the

entry  of  foreign  talents to Singapore.  He  asked  about  the

Hongkongers who have been granted approval in principle to  come

to  Singapore.   I  do  not have the specific  figures  with  me

because PR is actually a Ministry of Home Affairs' matter.   And

if  he  wants the specific numbers, he should raise the question

with  the Minister for Home Affairs.  But I understand  that  we

have   offered  25,000  approvals  in  principle  for   PR   for

Hongkongers.   Quite  a  large number of applications  had  been

received since it was offered in 1989.  But as to the number  of

families  who  have  relocated here, it  has  only  been  a  few

thousand families.  It is not such a large number.  And the fact

that  soon  after the hand-over, Hong Kong was very  stable  and

developing  very  well, there was very little justification  for

Hongkongers  to want to uproot themselves, which makes  it  even

more difficult for us to attract them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the point he made was quite similar to the point made

by  Dr  Tan Cheng Bock last week, that we should not be  talking

about  attracting foreign talent at this stage while the economy

is  down  and unemployment is high.  Basically he supported  the

point  made  last  Monday by Dr Tan that the  Government  should

think Singaporeans first.  Sir, let me explain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is fully aware of the difficulties faced by

the  people during this economic recession.  We understand  that

individuals  may  have  difficulty understanding  the  need  for

foreign talent when they are jobless or they are without job for

some  months  after graduation.  It is only very tempting  under

such  circumstances to press the Government to turn off,  or  at

least  reduce, efforts to attract foreign talent,  in  order  to

protect our citizens and to give them a better chance.   Let  me

explain  why I believe this would hurt us in the long  term  and

will not solve our immediate problems.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic crisis is the manifestation of the inescapable

fact  that the world is changing, and changing rapidly.  We  are

now  seeing the removal of geographical and regulatory  barriers

to the movement of people and capital.  This changing world will

not  stop for us to catch our breath.  We cannot bury our  heads

in  the sand and wish away reality.  And the reality is that  in

the 21st century, nations which succeed are those which are able

to  capitalise  on  their intellectual and human  capital.   The

basis  of  competition will be a country's collective knowledge,

expertise, creativity and entrepreneurialship.  With a workforce

of  less than 2 million people, compared to the teeming millions

in  the  other cities in the world or in the region, and we  are

not  talking about countries, we are just comparing cities  with

cities,  it is very difficult for us, with less than  2  million

workers,  to outdo our competitors, based solely on the  efforts

of  Singaporeans alone.  We will not have the critical mass  nor

the  resources  to succeed on our own.  We have to  build  up  a

critical mass by supplementing our local talent with a  flow  of

international talent to enable Singapore to compete successfully

in  the  global market.  We must position ourselves as a  talent

capital where Singaporeans and foreign talent work side by  side

to create wealth for all to share.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, foreign talent is thus a critical element in our

strategy for future success.  And, indeed, it becomes even  more

critical   and  more  crucial  during  this  economic  downturn.

Recently,  two  of  our largest banks (DBS and  OCBC)  recruited

foreigners  for their CEOs.  This was a strategic move  by  both

banks  to  bring  in  the  best  men  in  preparation  for   new

competition when our banking and financial sector will be thrown

open  to  international competition.  Such foreign talents,  and

many  more like them, are helping Singapore companies to weather

the   recession,  reorganise  their  operations  and  reposition

themselves for new competition and opportunities.  In doing  so,

they will create more jobs for Singaporeans.  Attracting foreign

talent   can   enhance   our  workforce's  competitiveness   and

capabilities in many new areas.  It is about bringing in  people

who

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>

can make the difference and hence we need them all the more in a

period of economic decline or downturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who have been here helping us to compete all

these  years,  we  should not chase them  away.   While  overall

employment  may  be  shrinking, limiting the  entry  of  foreign

talent  or  asking those who are here to leave will not  protect

Singaporeans nor solve our employment problems.  Indeed, if  you

prevent company from hiring foreign talent, it may result in its

relocation elsewhere.  Many MNCs operating in Singapore also run

other  operations  in the region in our neighbouring  countries,

for  instance.   If  we restrict the access to foreign  workers,

they can easily relocate to other countries where labour is more

readily available and at a much lower cost.  This will result in

more Singaporeans being retrenched.  For one local job protected

in  the short term, many more local jobs will be at risk in  the

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, Caltex announced the shift of their global

headquarters  to Singapore.  Suppose Caltex had been  told  they

could  only  recruit  Singaporeans, which must  be  the  logical

extension of the "Think Singaporeans First" policy, do you think

Caltex  would  have made the decision to relocate to  Singapore?

Is  it  better  for  Singapore  to have  Caltex  operating  from

Singapore with foreign talent or to have Caltex located in  some

other  cities,  perhaps  in the region,  competing  against  our

effort to build up global oil trading business from Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are in a race for talent, and losing the race will

not  help  our  citizens.  It will hamper economic recovery  and

future  growth  prospects.  If we do  not  accumulate  the  best

talent  we  can find from around the world, they will simply  be

drawn elsewhere to compete against us.  Instead of stopping  the

flow  of foreign talent, therefore, we need, in fact, to try  to

position  Singapore as an attractive place for them to work  and

live  in.   The fact remains that even in the midst of  economic

crisis, there are still areas which

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>

are  critically  short  of talent and  need  to  supplement  our

inadequate local supply with a flow of foreign talent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One area is the IT industry, which today's newspaper

happens  to  highlight by coincidence.  We  are  well  ahead  of

others  in this region in the IT industry because we have always

welcomed  foreign  talent.  Out of the current  stock  of  about

30,000  practising  IT professionals, more  than  30%  are  non-Singaporeans.  Without these foreign talents, we will not be  an

IT  leader  in  the region.  Every year, out of the  demand  for

about  3,000  new  IT professionals, our local universities  and

polytechnics can only supply about 2,000, leaving a shortfall of

1,000.   That  is why they are being paid so much.   Competition

for IT talent is global and intense.  Every country in the world

today  faces a shortage of IT professionals, as Mr Rai correctly

pointed out.  Even the United States is short of IT talent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area is the telecommunications and media where it

is  inconceivable that global broadcasters and media  companies,

such  as  CNBC  and ABN, would want to base their operations  in

Singapore  if  they  are  not  allowed  to  bring  in   talented

broadcasters and media specialists from around the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the advertising and the PR industry, Singapore has again

benefited tremendously from the infusion of foreign talent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R&D is yet another example. A good example which shows

that  opening our doors to talent from abroad also means  making

it  more attractive for our own Singaporeans and ex-Singaporeans

overseas who have distinguished themselves in other countries to

return  and to lend their considerable experience and  expertise

to  our  cause.   I  give you an example  of  our  Institute  of

Molecular and Cell Biology (IMCB) which would not be what it  is

today  without Prof. Chris Tan, then an ex-Singaporean  whom  we

attracted back from the US.  And not only did he establish  IMCB

as  a world-class institution, he created exciting R&D jobs  for

many  other  Singaporeans  and  foreign  talent  also.   Another

example is Dr Chua

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>

Nam Hai of the Institute of Molecular Agrobiology (IMA).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the efforts and leadership of these two people and

many others like them, we have been able to attract more talent.

In  fact,  the  IMCB and IMA had succeeded to make  breakthrough

findings  in cancer research and also in agrobiology.  IMA,  for

instance,  had filed patents on at least 13 areas which  are  of

commercial value.  So these people not only contributed in their

own  work  areas  but they also created more  opportunities  for

other Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge facing Singapore in the next millennium is to

reinvent   ourselves  into  a  country  where  there  are   many

opportunities  for  Singaporeans to  develop  to  their  fullest

potential.   We  can  become  a globally  competitive  knowledge

economy  with a world-class workforce.  But to do  so,  we  must

develop  our  people  to their fullest potential  and  add  that

little  extra boost which can come from bringing in  a  flow  of

foreign  talent, who bring with them new ideas,  new  experience

and  new  network connections.  If we fail in this  undertaking,

not  only  will  foreign talent not come to Singapore,  our  own

talented  Singaporeans  may  well  look  elsewhere  for  greener

pastures,  and  I  think  that  would  be  a  greater  loss  for

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government will ensure that our own citizens are

provided  with every means to compete with foreign talent  on  a

level playing field.  We will invest in manpower development  to

upgrade  our  workers'  capability  to  compete.   For  example,

information  technology is an area where there  are  still  many

jobs  available.  It is likely to be one of the few sectors that

will have a positive job creation this year.  MOM will implement

a Strategic Manpower Conversion Programme to train professionals

from other disciplines in IT skills and to prepare them for jobs

in  the IT sector.  The EDB also has a programme called Training

and   Attachment  Programme  to  train  young  local   engineers

overseas, so that they can acquire new capabilities in order  to

meet the needs of the economy when it recovers.  But we must  be

prepared to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>

subject  ourselves  to  the  discipline  of  the  market   where

employers are free to choose the best man for the job, be  it  a

Singaporean  or a foreign talent.  Only then can  the  Singapore

workforce  be truly competitive on a global basis.   Ultimately,

foreign talent attraction and the development of our own  people

are  not  competing alternatives.  It is not a  zero  sum  game.

Both  are  complementary strategies in our drive to survive  and

prosper  in a very competitive global market.  This will  become

more  apparent  when  through  the  hard  work  and  efforts  of

Singaporeans  and foreign talent, the economy turns  around  and

there is a larger pie to share.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also thank Mr Rai for his strong support on our

effort to attract foreign talent.  Let me assure him, as I  have

just  explained,  that the development of our own  local  talent

will  certainly not be sacrificed.  We will continue to put more

efforts  into developing our own talent so that they can compete

with the foreign talent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to Mr Yeo Guat Kwang who spoke of the need to

control  our dependency on foreign workers.  I think Mr Yeo,  in

particular,  was concerned with the construction industry  where

we  have nearly 200,000 foreign construction workers  here.  And

he  asked whether we will take steps to regulate their entry and

to  encourage the industry to improve its productivity.  I think

he  has  touched  on  a real problem, because  the  construction

industry  is,  in  fact, one of the least  productive  industry.

Over  the  years,  from 1995 to 1998, the  industry  saw  steady

decline   in   productivity.   Between  1995   and   1998,   the

productivity declined by 20%.  So there is really an urgent need

to  get  the industry to turn around its approach in the way  it

works and operates, in order to raise its productivity.  That is

why  we established a Construction 21 Committee to study how  we

can  help the industry to raise its productivity.  Some  of  the

ideas  that  are  being discussed by the Committee  include  the

promotion    of   design-and-build   concept,   standardisation,

modularisation  of  components as well as the  use  of  off-site

prefabricated components.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>

Also the Ministry of National Development will introduce minimum

buildability requirement for construction projects in  order  to

enhance their buildability and productivity.

<br>1.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the Construction 21 studies, we have also taken

other  measures to address over reliance and over dependence  on

foreign construction workers.  We have in fact lowered the  levy

for  the skilled construction workers while we maintain the levy

for the unskilled construction workers.  That means there is now

a  wider  differential, in fact, almost $440  for  each  foreign

construction worker.  This has in fact given incentives  to  the

contractors  to bring in more skilled construction  workers  and

the  proportion  of skilled construction workers  has  increased

from 12% in April 1998 to 23% in December 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also introduced basic skills certification

requirement  for  contractors who want to bring  in  their  non-traditional source construction workers.  As of August 1998,  we

have required contractors to bring in at least 20% of their  NTS

workers  with basic skills certificate, and we intend  to  raise

this  requirement.  By April 1999, it will  go  up  to  50%  and

eventually  100%.  In other words, every NTS worker coming  into

Singapore  should have a basic skill certificate.   They  should

have  some basic construction skills.  We are also looking  into

enhancing  the  level of this basic skill certificate  or  skill

level  so that they are better construction workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo asked whether our new work permit allocation system

for   the  construction  sector  has  worked  or  achieved  this

objective.   Yes, the answer is that the new man-year allocation

system  has introduced more discipline in the demand for foreign

construction  workers, particularly, the NTS workers.   The  new

system  helps  to  ensure  that the  main  contractors  exercise

prudence  and discipline in assigning their man-year  allocation

or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>

entitlement for NTS workers to their sub-contractors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its introduction early last year, there has been a

40% drop in the applications for work permit for non-traditional

source workers.  We cannot say it is all entirely due to the new

man-year entitlement system because the industry has also slowed

down  during  this  period.   But the new  man-year  entitlement

system  had  a large part to do with it because we  notice  that

only  about  1/3 of the man-year entitlement handed out  to  the

main  contractors  were  subsequently allocated  to  their  sub-contractors.    In  other  words,  the  main  contractors   have

exercised  a  great deal of prudence and care in awarding  their

allocations  to their sub-contractors.  This has resulted  in  a

lower demand or fewer applications for work permit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo also queried on the housing of foreign construction

workers.   This  is a problem only for the construction  sector,

while  in  the  other sectors like manufacturing  and  services,

housing is not a problem.  In the construction sector, about 70%

to  80% of the construction workers can be accommodated on site,

but   that  still  leaves  another  20%  to  30%  for  whom  the

contractors  have  to  find  off-site  accommodation.   We   are

encouraging contractors to develop proper dormitory housing  for

their  foreign  workers.   Some companies  have  taken  up  this

proposal.   My  Ministry  will  continue  to  work  with   other

Government agencies to set aside more land which can be used for

developing  dormitory housing to meet the needs of  the  foreign

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo also asked whether contractors are facing

difficulties  as a result of our implementing a  levy  bond  and

also  our collection in the arrears of foreign worker  levy.   I

understand  the  problems faced by contractors  now,  especially

when  the  economy is slowing down.  They may have  problems  in

payment  or  delays so they may not be able to  meet  all  these

requirements,  particularly the foreign worker  levy.   We  will

implement all these measures with flexibility and understanding.

Companies that are required

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>

to  furnish  the  levy  bond are usually those  that  have  been

habitually late in making the levy payment or the other new  and

small companies without a proper track record.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will exercise flexibility to help genuine contractors to

tide  over this difficult period.  We have made adjustments  and

refinements  to the implementation of the levy bond  so  that  a

contractor can be allowed to defer posting the bond, if  he  can

show  proof  that  he has ongoing projects and  that  there  are

payments that are due to him which should overcome his cash-flow

problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also been fairly flexible in collecting the arrears

of  foreign worker levy from contractors who are in arrears  for

some  time, up to a couple of months.  As long as they can  show

proof to us that they in fact have incoming payment, we can help

them to resolve the problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I turn to Mr Chiam who asked for more recreational

facilities  to  be  provided to foreign workers.   Mr  Rai  also

joined  in  that  call.   Sir,  the  provision  of  leisure  and

recreational  facilities  to  foreign  workers   is   partly   a

responsibility  of  the  employers  and  partly  of   course   a

responsibility  for  us  to  ensure that  there  are  sufficient

amenities  for  the foreign workers to enjoy.  I would  like  to

point  out  that in fact all social amenities in  Singapore  are

open  and  available to foreign workers as well as Singaporeans.

It  must be so.  We do not prevent any foreign worker from using

any  of the public facilities.  So to ask that some of the money

collected  from the foreign worker levy be set aside to  develop

amenities  or  recreational  facilities  specifically  for   the

foreign  workers is simply not justified because the  collection

of  the  levy is for a totally different purpose.  The  levy  is

collected  in  order to bridge the wage gap and to moderate  the

demand  for  such  foreign workers and  not  to  provide  social

amenities  for  them.   The money that  is  collected  from  the

foreign worker levy in fact goes into the consolidated fund  and

it  is used to develop public infrastructure and amenities which

eventually will benefit not just Singaporeans but foreigners who

are also working here.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam, in particular, has pointed out that every

weekend,  foreign  workers  loiter at  places  such  as  Botanic

Gardens,  Little India, Orchard Mall, Crawford Park  and  Rochor

Centre.   But I think "loiter" is not the right word.   This  is

their  day off.  They gather at these public areas with all  the

amenities  that  are available there, to gossip,  exchange  news

with each other about what is happening at home and to catch  up

with friends who are also working in Singapore.  Where there  is

over  congestion, I agree that we have to find alternatives  for

them,  and  that  is what we have done.  For instance,  we  have

recently  opened  up  a Sunday bazaar at Weld  Road.   This  was

jointly  organised  by  the Police, the  Singapore  Contractors'

Association and the Hindu Endowments Board.  The weekend  bazaar

has  been  held since November last year.  Activities  that  are

held  there  include screening of free movies by  the  Singapore

Contractors'   Association  and  also  setting  up   stalls   by

volunteers from the Hindu Endowments Board.  The scheme  had  in

fact  attracted quite a large number of foreign workers who used

to  congregate in Little India to come over to Weld Road and  to

reduce the congestion in places like Little India.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from public amenities, where feasible, employers

should  also  provide  recreational and welfare  facilities  for

their  local and foreign workers.  I entirely agree with Mr  Rai

that  employers  cannot  just neglect their  responsibility  for

their workers.  If the contractor provides accommodation for 70%

to  80% of his workers on site, then he should also provide some

recreational facilities there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have covered the areas that have been raised so

far.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon:</b> Sir, the current economic downturn

has once again demonstrated the importance of having good labour-management  relations.  This has been made possible  because  of

the  strong emphasis on tripartism and the efforts made  by  all

three parties - the Government, employers and unions to work out

problems   peacefully   and  not  adopt   positions   that   are

confrontational or would lead to disharmony.  However, it is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>

important  to  nurture and further develop this partnership  and

not  take it for granted.  One positive way of doing so  is  for

MOM to support initiatives where the three parties can learn and

share  experiences together.  I would therefore like to  suggest

that  MOM  consider  getting the Singapore Institute  of  Labour

Studies  to  organise more courses and training  for  employers,

Government  and  union  officials  together  to  give  them  the

opportunity  to  learn and to share their  experiences.   And  I

would  therefore  also like to encourage  MOM  to  consider  its

funding  to support the SILS effort.  The Government  has  given

the  Institute  a once-off grant but I would like  to  urge  the

Minister   to   consider  the  possibility  of  reviewing   this

arrangement and provide grants once in three years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workforce profile continues to improve with better

education.  At present, 60% of new entrants to the workforce are

tertiary-educated.  This means that the pool available for union

membership and leadership will shrink as traditionally only  the

bargainable  employees join the unions.  This will have  serious

repercussions   on   tripartism  which  will   clearly   weaken.

Therefore, there is a need to review the current restrictions on

executives  joining  unions.  For a start,  MOM  could  consider

allowing   rank  and  file  unions  partial  representation   of

executives  on  issues  such  as retrenchments  and  grievances.

Japan  is  a  good example of sound labour-management relations,

which had survived the turmoil faced by workers and employers in

the  prolonged  recession  that  the  country  is  facing.   One

relevant  feature  of  Japanese industrial  relations  that  has

contributed  significantly to this stability is the practice  of

allowing  union leaders who are promoted to management ranks  to

continue  to  remain in office.  This fusion  of  the  role  has

allowed   both   management  and  labour  to   have   a   better

understanding  of each other's role and has clearly  contributed

to  the  peaceful labour-management relations in Japan.   Hence,

could  MOM look into this issue again and, if necessary, form  a

tripartite

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>

committee representing all the three parties to study the  issue

carefully and make the necessary recommendations?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that at present, there is a committee to study

the  guidelines on this area.  But according to feedback, it  is

not  very satisfactory.  So we would like to urge MOM to  relook

at  this  issue  urgently and hope that the  three  parties  can

actively  participate in this area to come out  with  guidelines

which are workable.

<br>2.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, the subject of

tripartite  partnership was discussed at length last  year  when

the  Nominated  Member, Mr Cyrille Tan, moved a motion  in  this

House  for  the  Government to recognise  tripartism  as  a  key

competitive advantage for Singapore.  The Minister for Manpower,

Dr Lee Boon Yang, has also just touched on it a moment ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our unique tripartite setting is indeed the envy of many

countries and has worked marvellously for us.  However,  in  the

wake of constant change and an increasingly competitive business

environment, new situations will evolve which will  continue  to

test  the bond of the tripartite partners.  One that has  to  be

borne  in mind is that businesses today, large and small  alike,

are constantly challenged to deal with the flood of information,

knowledge  and technology in all forms.  Unlike traditional  raw

materials, knowledge usually is not coded, audited or stacked in

storerooms or warehouses for workers to use as needed.  It comes

in  various  formats, scattered and is easy to  lose.   To  make

knowledge  manageable  like  raw materials,  companies  need  to

capture and share knowledge that is in their workers' heads  and

residing  in their computers. Competitive advantage  is  derived

when  companies are able to effectively turn these  into  assets

that  can be leveraged and into profitable products or services.

In  an  information and knowledge-based economy, this is  a  key

ingredient of business success.  Companies that manage knowledge

must have the ability not only to attract the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>

young  and the new breed of knowledge workers, but must also  be

able  to retain them.  Such workers have the competency to  help

them  strategise, analyse markets and, more importantly, provide

training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers who fail to recognise the importance of this

imminent  business landscape risk losing their best and valuable

employees.   This  could contribute to a  stifling  of  business

growth  which,  in  turn, could translate into  slower  economic

growth.   This  is  where I believe that the tripartite  parties

could work together through regular meetings and interactions to

anticipate  future trends and devise strategies to stablise  the

employment  of  knowledge  workers.   I  am  glad  to  note  the

announcement  made by the Minister for Manpower yesterday  about

the  consideration of an annual national Manpower  Summit  as  a

potential  platform for the tripartite partners to get  together

and  jointly  focus  on  strategic issues relating  to  manpower

development and training needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from life-long learning, life-long partnership

between workers and caring employers who invest heavily  in  the

education and training of their workers should also be seriously

explored.   At  the opposite end of this, it is also  my  belief

that  structural  unemployment  will  be  one  of  our  greatest

challenges in our pursuit of a knowledge-based economy.  It will

be  a  short and long-term problem for us.  An annual forum will

also  be  useful  in enabling us to regularly re-visit  and  re-strategise what needs to be done to minimise its impact.  Hence,

I would urge the Minister to seriously consider the strong merit

of  staging an annual forum to regularly review manpower  issues

facing Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Cyrille Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cyrille Tan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I will focus on

the  extension of the scope of union representation.   With  the

decline  of  the  manufacturing sector,  the  expansion  of  the

service  sector  and  the spread of IT,  more  white-collar  and

professional  jobs are created.  This change in the  profile  of

our  workforce  will  continue unabated and  this  will  mean  a

shrinking bargainable base for the labour movement.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Ministry of Manpower has expressed that there was

nothing  to  prevent companies from voluntarily  allowing  their

executives  to  be  unionised, NTUC has adopted  the  persuasive

approach  to  encourage employers to widen the  scope  of  union

representation.  To date, only 23 companies have initiated  such

union  representation extension.  However, it has not been  easy

for employers to adopt a magnanimous approach to allow executive

staff to join unions with open arms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we achieve such extension of union representation?

A  Tripartite Committee can be formed at the national  level  to

review section 16(3) of the Industrial Relations Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, amend section 16(3) of the Industrial Relations

Act  to  allow  partial representation rights  over  executives.

Here,  we accord union partial representation rights in  respect

of  executives.  The latter will not enjoy the benefits  of  the

collective  agreements obtained for its rank and file colleagues

but  unions can represent them in grievances and other  specific

problems    such   as   dismissals,   unfair   treatments    and

retrenchments.   This will help achieve some welfare  protection

for executives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, amend section 16(3) of the Industrial Relations

Act  to  admit  executives as ordinary members.   This  proposal

would  mean  that  executives could enjoy the  benefits  of  the

collective agreement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two above proposals can also have the right for

executives  to vote and hold office in the Union.  This  can  be

seen as a two-stage transition working towards full union rights

for executives while pursuing issues like conflict of interests.

The  proposals  can  be first adopted on a pilot  basis  at  the

public  sector.   Unions  and management can  differentiate  the

extent  of  representation for different groups of workers.   It

may   reserve   the  right  to  take  up  issues  of   grievance

representation, retrenchment, etc. for some, while the  majority

can be covered by a more comprehensive collective agreement.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the ability to extend the scope of union

representation  to  executives  is  important  to   the   labour

movement.  As each cohort of the population will be 60% tertiary

trained  (20%  university trained and 40% polytechnic  trained),

our union membership can only be drawn from the remaining 40% of

the workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Union membership is what the labour movement is all about.

To  reiterate, we need to arrest the shrinking bargainable  base

by  extending our scope of representation in order to  make  our

labour movement a strong and relevant one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the Singapore model of the trade union movement

will  benefit  the workers, the companies and the country  as  a

whole.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Encik Othman bin Haron</b>

<b>Eusofe):</b> Sir, the synergic relationships between the

Government, employers and unions have worked well in  Singapore.

This  tripartite alliance is the cornerstone of industrial peace

for  three decades.  It has also brought an environment that  is

conducive to foreign investment and sustained economic growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree with the Members for Bukit Timah GRC and

Pasir Ris GRC that good industrial relations cannot be taken for

granted.   Tripartite cooperation will become even more  crucial

in  the  present economic difficulties as companies  restructure

their  organisation to become more cost-effective and to  remain

more  competitive,  and when workers face  wage  and  CPF  cuts.

Tripartism  has served us well in good times.  It is  even  more

important  in  times  of economic adversities.   A  strong  bond

between  the Government, employers and unions will  help  us  to

weather the economic storm.  I agree with the Members that in  a

rapidly changing and competitive business environment, the three

partners   should   continue   to   strengthen   their   working

relationship   and   to   jointly  tackle  difficulties   ahead,

particularly the emerging

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>

problems   of   structural  unemployment.   Through   tripartite

cooperation,  we  can  also  prepare our  workforce  to  upgrade

themselves  and  be globally competitive in the  knowledge-based

era.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tripartism has worked in many areas. For example, through

the  support of the employers and the NTUC, we have  raised  the

compulsory retirement age from 60 to 62 years from January  this

year.   The  NWC  has  been able to reach  consensus  among  the

tripartite  partners on the recommendation to reduce wage  costs

by  between 5% and 8%, in addition to the cut in employers'  CPF

contribution  by 10 percentage points. It is not easy  to  reach

consensus  on such a difficult measure.  Our unions and  workers

should be commended for giving their unequivocal support to help

companies  reduce  business costs so  that  we  can  regain  our

competitiveness in the global market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of funding the Singapore Institute of

Labour  Studies (SILS) as raised by the Member for  Bukit  Timah

GRC,  my  Ministry  is  aware  that SILS  has  made  significant

contributions  to the labour movement by providing  training  to

union leaders and members. To support SILS' work and programmes,

the  Government had in the past given annual grants to  SILS  on

the basis of deficit funding.  However, to provide the necessary

incentive  for  SILS  to  raise its own  funds,  the  Government

decided  to  give SILS a one-time matching grant of  $2  million

into  the  SILS  Endowment  Fund  as  from  FY96  based  on  the

Institute's  own  contribution  of  $2  million  to  this  fund.

Through  this  funding arrangement, it is hoped that  SILS  will

operate  on  the basis of cost recovery in running its  training

programmes.   This  practice  of annual  funding  was  therefore

discontinued.   Nevertheless,  we  will  monitor   the   funding

arrangement and carry out a review if the need arises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the issue of union representation which

has been raised by Mrs Yu-Foo and Mr Cyrille Tan, in particular,

the question of allowing executives to join rank and file unions

to enlarge the talent pool for union leaders.  While

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>

we  appreciate  the  efforts  of  the  unions  to  expand  their

membership,   the   concerns   of   the   employers   on   union

representation  of  the  executives  must  not  be   overlooked.

Employers have expressed concerns that allowing their executives

to  join  rank  and file unions would result in  a  conflict  of

interests.   Executives  who have to  make  critical  decisions,

which  may  affect  their  fellow union  members,  may  find  it

difficult to effectively carry out their roles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Cyrille Tan and Mrs Yu-Foo have also raised the concern

that the current restriction of executives joining rank and file

unions  under section 16(3) of the Industrial Relations Act  has

deprived  the  labour  movement of the ability  to  draw  future

leaders from among a growing number of employees who are in  the

executive positions.  This is particularly so when our workforce

is  becoming better educated and most of the new entrants in the

labour movement join as junior and middle management personnel.

We agree that this issue of allowing executives to join rank and

file  unions  should  be  studied by an  appropriate  tripartite

forum.   This is in line with our tripartite approach in dealing

with  the  important labour relations issues,  with  a  view  to

arriving at a solution that can best serve the interests of  the

economy,  employers  and workers.  I think  with  the  proposals

which  we  are  considering, like having  an  annual  tripartite

summit  or  conference, these are issues which the  forum  could

discuss.

<br>2.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, the average unemployment

rate  in Singapore has risen from 1.8% in 1997 to 3.2% in  1998.

I  understand  that the seasonally adjusted figure for  December

1998  has  already  reached  4.3%.  In  absolute  numbers,  this

translates  to  about 89,000 being out of work.  However,  there

are   more   than  450,000  foreign  workers  in  Singapore   in

occupations   across   the   skills   spectrum,   from    80,000

professionals and highly skilled workers to about  100,000  less

skilled domestic workers.  Theoretically, there should be little

reason  why unemployed Singaporeans should not be able  to  find

employment if they are willing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>

to  moderate their expectations, or upgrade their skills to take

on  jobs  that  currently  have to be done  by  foreigners.  The

figures and projections also indicate that there will always  be

a  need  for foreign talent and less skilled foreign workers  to

supplement the local workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to note the formation of the Manpower

Planning  Committee by the Ministry of Manpower.  But could  the

Minister explain his Ministry's current policy, specifically  on

the   issue  of  work  permits versus the need  to  ensure  that

unemployed Singaporeans are able to find jobs?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much has also been said and done about skills

upgrading  and retraining of lower skilled workers in order  for

them  to take on higher skilled jobs.  While I fully agree  with

my  GRC  colleague  that we should not aim to  be  a  nation  of

tuckshop  girls  and  taxi drivers, I  think  we  must  also  be

realistic  in  our  expectations.    There  will  always  be   a

proportion  of Singaporeans, especially older and less  educated

workers  who, despite their best efforts, will not  be  able  to

make  the grade into highly skilled professions due to  lack  of

literacy  skills or ability.  Decent jobs will also have  to  be

found  for them.  Is the Minister satisfied that enough is being

done  for this category of Singaporeans who may not be  able  to

take advantage of the skills upgrading programmes such as SRP?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In areas where lower skilled foreign workers are being used

extensively, such as commercial cleaning and domestic  services,

what  measures  are being taken by the Ministry of  Manpower  to

encourage employers to enhance professionalism in these areas in

order  to  make  these  occupations more productive  and  better

paying   and,   consequently,  more  viable  for  less   skilled

unemployed Singaporeans?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, to

soften the impact of the regional economic crisis on us, our key

strategy  is to focus on minimising unemployment and  maximising

employability.  Last year, the Government,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>

together  with various economic and social agencies, stepped  up

its  programme  to  help our workers who were  affected  by  the

crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore very important that these agencies keep

abreast  of  the latest development in our labour situation,  in

order  that they may tackle the issues at the earliest  possible

opportunity.   Hence, I would like to request the  Minister  for

Manpower  to  provide  monthly  reports  on  job  creation   and

opportunities in the various industries, so that NTUC can  match

our workers with the vacancies in these industries concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand that skilled workers are urgently

required  in  the  new high-tech industries,  and  some  of  our

workers still do not possess the relevant skills to take on  the

new  technologies  involved.  However, there is  still  a  large

number  of workers who seem to be unaware of the seriousness  of

this  crisis.   Many workers also do not realise that  the  jobs

they  have  lost today may not come back even when  the  economy

picks up later on.  Therefore, we should do more to upgrade  the

skills of our workers and to shift their mindset towards one  of

continuous learning to move into the knowledge economy  that  we

are  moving  towards.  Sir, may I know if the Manpower  Minister

has any innovative plans to overcome these challenges?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to request the Minister to enlighten us

on the following matters:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The proportion of new entrants into our workforce who

are  gainfully  employed,  and the  proportion  that  is  under-employed.  Does the Ministry have any scheme in place to  assist

them  so  that they can be gainfully employed when  the  economy

picks up?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) How many graduates from our tertiary institutions have

decided  to  further their education in view of the lull  labour

market?   Is their delayed entry into the job market actually  a

postponement of our employment problem?  With so many

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>

advanced learning institutions around, are they being trained in

the  required  skills, so that the under-unemployment  situation

will  not  be  aggravated after they have acquired their  higher

qualifications?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Is the Minister satisfied with the success of MOM's "job

matching"  efforts?  Has the Ministry any proactive action  plan

to  improve the success rate?  Can the Minister tell us how many

workers  have refused jobs offered to them despite being  placed

several  times, and the number of companies which  rejected  the

job- applicants recommended by the Ministry?  While looking  for

jobs,  are the workers' concern about inequitable pay  and  long

hours  of  standing valid?  Is there any discrimination  against

older workers in the recruitment exercises?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Government's action to attract foreign

talents  who  could  add value to our economy  as  part  of  our

strategy  to  move towards a knowledge-based economy.   However,

may  I  ask  the Minister for Manpower what measures  have  been

taken  by his Ministry to attract local workers to these  higher

value-added jobs, since these jobs will provide higher income?

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, in the past year and

possibly  this year, we expect to see record numbers  of  people

being  retrenched  from work.  While many  people  are  able  to

support  themselves  through their  savings  or  through  family

support  until they find alternative employment, however,  there

are  still a substantial number of Singaporeans who may  not  be

able  to do so for a number of reasons.  I would like to propose

to  the Minister that such families in trouble be allowed to use

their  CPF savings during this time of difficulty.  My  proposal

is  to allow retrenched workers to borrow from their CPF Special

Account  to  pay  for essential expenses like school  fees,  S&C

charges,  house  rentals and for purchase of basic  food  items.

While  I agree that we should not change the fundamental purpose

of the CPF, which is a saving for us after retirement, I do feel

that we need to put in place a system that allows us to ease the

burden of the workers who are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>

in financial difficulties, especially during this time.  What  I

am suggesting is not a permanent draw down from the CPF account,

but  to  treat  the transaction as a loan.  The mechanism  could

work as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the Ministry can set criteria which allow

workers, who were retrenched and who have been out of a job  for

a minimum period of time, to borrow from their account.  Second,

the  money  borrowed  can be used only for certain  pre-approved

type  of  expenses.  Third, to set a limit for a maximum quantum

to be borrowed and for a maximum of, say, six months so that the

worker seriously looks for alternative employment.  Fourth, once

the  worker finds a new job, he has to repay the money  back  to

his  CPF account, which should include the amount borrowed  plus

interest  on the borrowed amount.  The payment can  be  made  in

instalments  to  ease  the burden on the worker,  and  repayment

could  be made through higher employee's CPF contribution  until

the amount borrowed is fully paid up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to emphasise that I am not advocating a

permanent  withdrawal from the Fund, but a loan from  one's  own

account to be paid back with interest.  In this way, the  impact

on old-age savings will be almost none and, at the same time, we

will reduce the burden on the Government and the various welfare

organisations  since  the worker now finds help  himself  first,

eliminating the need for welfarism.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, last year, about 28,000

workers  lost their jobs and indeed we had just learnt from  the

Minister  for  Manpower that there were  23,000  jobs  net  loss

experienced by December last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Manpower has initiated a job assistance

scheme  to  help  retrenched  workers  secure  alternative  jobs

quickly.   Sir,  I  would like to know how  successful  has  the

scheme  been, how many people have sought assistance  from  MOM,

either  directly  on  their  own or  through  their  Members  of

Parliament, and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>

what  is  the  proportion who managed to get  jobs  through  the

scheme,  and how successful have the job fairs which  have  been

organised at the CDC level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is important for MOM to conduct a study on

the  retrenched workers, so that we know which types of  workers

face  greater problems in getting alternative jobs.  In the past

year,  Members  of  Parliament  have  been  approached  by  more

residents to ask for help to get jobs.  Such cases are  referred

to  MOM.   But from the replies given by MOM to these residents,

it  appears  to me that some of the retrenched workers  did  not

take up the jobs offered to them.  Some did not even turn up for

the interviews to which they were invited.  The question is: how

many  have actually got jobs on their own by the time they  were

offered  jobs  by  MOM?  Because many of these workers  are  low

skilled  and  low  income and if they remain  unemployed  for  a

longer  period  of  time, their families  will  suffer.   It  is

therefore important for us to know why they did not take up  the

jobs  offered by  MOM, when, in the first place, they  were  the

ones  who sought assistance from  MOM through their MPs.  It  is

important  to  understand  this as  we  will  continue  to  face

unemployment and retrenchment problems even when the economy  is

doing well in future.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, this whole discussion on workers'

and  skills  training in Singapore hinges on a set of  important

criteria  which, unless we address them, I am afraid the  effort

may  not  be  complete.   I  refer  to  the  importance  of  the

transferability  of  skills  and  certification,   through   the

portability  of  the  skills  and  the  certification  and   the

visibility of the skills experienced and the certification.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the transferability of skills and certification refers

to  the recognition and credits we accord to various courses  or

the modules of training.  The different pathways should be given

recognition.  The portability of skills and certification refers

to the equivalences that we establish to accept and compare with

other  skills  certification from other places.   So,  different

pathways must be accepted

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>

and  be recognised.   For higher education, training is not just

for  the  elite.  Of course, every country has its own education

and ranking system.  I am not suggesting that we dismantle them,

but  the important step is to establish the equivalences  across

skills   training  and  certification,  perhaps  in  a   modular

structured way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have our NTCs and we are working towards the certificate

of  competencies (COC) for our lower level workers  without  the

NTC.   I believe this is the correct way to go.  We should  even

extend   the   transferability   and   portability   of   skills

certification  across  the different pathways  of  training  and

education  in  Singapore.   In order  for  a  skill  set  to  be

transferable, portable or visible, we need to, firstly, identify

the  skill set.  The skill set may be made up of several modular

skills  at  various  levels.  Such a modular  scheme  should  be

determined as soon as possible, and the most basic of these  is,

of  course,  our  certificate  of competencies.   Many  of  such

workers  at this level may not be literate in English,  but  may

have  many  years of working experience in technical  jobs,  and

many  of  them are well versed only in the Chinese language.   I

believe  we  should  not deny them.  I  hope  such  COC  can  be

determined soonest to form the basis of our skills certification

scheme.   And our NTC pathways to diploma and university degrees

should also be established.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a year ago, I had appealed for a constituent who was a

top  student  at  the ITE and at the Polytechnic,  but  was  not

admitted   to   the  University  here.   Only  the   enlightened

intervention of the Senior Minister of State for Education  gave

this determined young man the chance to be admitted to study.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister will consider this.

that   the   workers   can   contribute   towards   productivity

improvements  in  the company.  However, it is my  understanding

that workers who are retrenched and who have lost their jobs are

not  covered  by  this programme.  The Government,  through  the

Ministry  of  Manpower, should consider extending the  surrogate

employer's programme to accommodate workers in this category  so

that  they could be retrained to learn new skills and find their

relevance in an increasingly sophisticated economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make training programmes more accessible, could I

suggest to the Minister for Manpower to consider the setting  up

of  neighbourhood information centres in the HDB heartlands  for

workers,  especially  unemployed ones, to have  easy  access  to

training  and  retraining information and how they  can  benefit

from it, if this is not already being planned or done.  Wherever

feasible, the Ministry of Manpower should also consider  setting

up  training  facilities in HDB neighbourhoods to make  training

more easily accessible, especially for the unemployed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, I share the concerns of

Members  in this House that our workers will be in for  a  tough

time  with employment, and especially employment that will yield

good  economic returns.  I am also worried that with  the  rapid

restructuring  of our economy, our workers could  be  caught  by

long  term  unemployment  due  to the  change  in  the  economic

structure  where there would be mismatch of skills.  Right  now,

there  are  workers who were previously enjoying  good  economic

returns in jobs, such as welders, metal fabricators, plasterers,

bricklayers,  etc.   The metal and construction  industries  are

already  facing  strong competition from cheaper foreign  labour

from  Malaysia, China and India.  Cleaners and odd-job labourers

are  also  facing the same problem.  Many of these workers  have

little education and are in their middle

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>

age, with families to support.  Most of them are from the middle

lower  or  lower  income groups.  If they  are  unable  to  move

upwards  in  tandem  with  the  economy  and  eventually  become

unemployed,  we  would see this segment of the society  becoming

adversely affected, and this would hurt the cohesiveness of  our

society in the long run.  Although they know they are now facing

strong  competition and may even lose their jobs in the  future,

they do not know what other jobs they can switch to and what are

the avenues open to them to acquire the necessary new skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has announced various schemes in the

retraining  of workers. The schemes seem to favour workers  with

at  least secondary education.  For example, the Report  of  the

Skills  Development Fund for 1997/98 shows  that  in  1997  $5.5

million of grants were committed to the training of workers with

PSLE  qualifications or below, whereas a total  of  $54  million

were  committed to train workers with secondary or GCE "O" level

qualifications.  In terms of training places, 54,180 places were

committed for those with PSLE qualifications and below  compared

to  286,434  places for higher educated workers.   Even  workers

with  university degrees were given higher allocation of  grants

and  more  training places than workers with PSLE qualifications

or  below.   I  urge the Government to refocus its  priority  in

workers'  training to ensure that those who are older  and  have

little  education  remain employable  in  the  future.   Greater

efforts must be made to reach out to these workers to offer them

training  and  an  alternative career in  their  job  before  it

becomes too late when they will face long term unemployment  and

hence financial hardship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no good just pleading with employers to give them a

chance,  as  what  the  Prime Minister did,  not  so  long  ago.

Although  these  workers may not know what is a  knowledge-based

economy  and may not be able to operate sophisticated  machines,

they  are part of our society and are prepared to do tough  jobs

that many others shun.  The Government should help them to avoid

financial hardship due to economic restructuring.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also wish to point out another weakness in the

training  programmes being offered, ie, the programmes rely  too

much  on  employers  to decide whether they  should  send  their

workers  for training.  For example, the Back-to-Work programme,

depends  on  whether the workers are selected by  the  potential

employers  for training, and the Skills Redevelopment  Programme

depends  on  the employers to send their existing workforce  for

upgrading.   Many workers also see the BEST and WISE  programmes

will lead them to nowhere or too far to somewhere, as these  are

not  specific skills redevelopment programmes that will  enhance

their skills to become more employable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest the Ministry of Manpower make a projection of the

manpower needs of the various job sectors and provide grants and

offer  training places to workers who are currently  working  in

those  less  promising industries who wish to change their  jobs

and to build a new career.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, the Government should realise that

there  are  workers  who  are working  in  some  less  promising

industries, who are older and it is too late for them to  obtain

a  basic  general education.  They face the prospect  of  losing

their   job.   They  need  retraining  badly  so  as  to  remain

employable in the future.  The Government should also note  that

these  workers  may not be working in multi-national  companies.

They  are  also not unionised.  I urge the Government to  target

this  specific group of workers and design programmes  that  are

tailor-made to their needs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, I am pleased to note that the

Ministry  of Manpower has already come up with the key  features

of the national life-long learning system in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more than half a million workers who are above 35

years  or  so, who have low educational qualifications  and  low

level of skills, a comprehensive training system is much needed.

The  Ministry  has  said  that  incentives  would  be  given  to

employers and individual workers so that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>

skills  training can be provided and taken up by  the  employers

and  workers  respectively.  Currently, workers whose  companies

have  signed  up  under the Skills Redevelopment Programme  have

better  chances  for training for higher skills  than  those  in

companies  which  have not signed up.  Union  members  can  take

advantage of the NTUC's Education and Training Fund, but workers

in  the non-unionised sectors would have less opportunities  for

skills training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed national life-long training system must take

into  consideration the needs of this group of  workers.   There

are  also  those workers, especially the sole breadwinners,  who

fear  a  loss in income if they take up training courses.   They

should  be sufficiently enticed to take up courses so that  they

can improve themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side of the coin, Sir, are companies which may

be  reluctant  to send their workers for higher skills  training

other  than  those  provided by the companies themselves.   Such

companies  may  fear that their workers may job hop  after  they

have  got  better  training and better skills.    How  will  the

Ministry  encourage  such companies to send  their  workers  for

skills  upgrading?  Sir, the task to help our workers to transit

to  a knowledge-based economy is a huge one.  I do not think  it

can  be  done  by just the Government.  It must  be  a  national

effort which involves all sectors in our economy.  I would  like

to  ask  the Minister for Manpower about the role that would  be

given  to  the  trade union movement, Chambers of  Commerce  and

Industry  and  self-help organisations so that our  workers  who

need training to transit into a knowledge-based economy can  get

all  the training facilities and opportunities they can  get  in

future.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

during  the  budget  debates last year, I spoke  in  support  of

NTUC's  proposal to increase the amount allocated to the  Skills

Redevelopment Programme (SRP)  so that some 700,000 people  with

education below the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>

secondary  level can upgrade their skills to catch up  with  the

economic development of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I know, in the past 12 months, tens of thousands

of  people  have  signed up for the SRP.  The response  is  very

positive  and  very encouraging.  However, during this  economic

recession,  in  order  to cut cost to improve   competitiveness,

some  companies have retrenched their unskilled or  semi-skilled

local  workers and replaced them with foreign workers.  Many  of

these workers were recruited during the boom time but some  were

just recruited quite recently.  As our population is small,   we

lack  human  resources  and  foreign  workers  are  imported  to

supplement  our local recruits.  When we were having  7%  to  8%

annual  economic growth in Singapore, import of foreign  workers

was acceptable.  But during a recession like the present one, we

have  to  adjust this policy to prevent our local  workers  from

being squeezed out.  Foreign workers are willing to accept lower

pay,   some  as low as 50% of what our local workers  are  paid.

How  could they survive?  It is simple.  Their families are  not

in  Singapore.  Their families are living in countries where the

standard  of living is much lower than ours.  Unlike  our  local

workers  who  have to pay for their  flats, taxes, medical  fees

and  children's  education, look after their families  and  even

their  aged  parents and in-laws, these foreign workers  do  not

have much financial commitments over here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our workers have the aspiration that one day they

will  reach  the Swiss standard of living.  Not all  Singaporean

workers  can  be retrained at the same time, but the  market  is

relentless.   Whoever  is prepared to accept  the  cheapest  pay

gets  the job.  So if our foreign workers policy is not adjusted

immediately, then the local workers who are trained will  become

unemployed  after training. As some people have remarked,  these

people will be trained to become unemployed.  Even those who are

trained  and retrained, their jobs are not completely secure  in

the  face  of challenges by the foreign workers.  They face  the

danger of a declining standard of living.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past 20 years, our economy has prospered, and we

have been going for the high wage policy. That is to improve the

income  of  our people.  At the same time, it has also increased

the cost of doing business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, the Government and the private sector have

been  spending  a lot of money on the training of these  foreign

workers.   After  working  for two or three  years,  and  having

accumulated  enough savings, they would pack up  and  return  to

their hometown, and their skills will also go home with them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lucky ones, who are given permanent residence here,

are  not only asking for equal pay as our citizens, but are also

starting  to  job-hop.   In this way, we  do  not  have  a  core

workforce.   I  hope the Minister can issue some  guidelines  so

that  we  can understand in what circumstances our local workers

can compete with the foreign talents.  I agree with the views of

Mr  Low Thia Khiang and some other MPs that without having clear

guidelines  on  how  our workers can compete  with  the  foreign

workers,   we  will be going backwards.  It will be against  our

national interest.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

as  we  all know, the only way for Singapore to survive  in  the

21st  century  is  to  build  up a world  class  knowledge-based

economy.   In order to attain this objective, we need  to  build

our  knowledge-based infrastructure.  To do this, the key is  to

build up a high quality workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a Chinese saying, "It takes 10 years to grow a

tree  but it takes 100 years to develop a man."  If we  want  to

build up a knowledge-based workforce, we have first of all to go

by  education.   That  is the reason why our Government  leaders

have been emphasising again and again the importance of lifelong

learning and lifelong education. Therefore, I would suggest that

the  Government use actual financial assistance or  liberal  tax

incentives to encourage workers of all grades, young or old,  to

take part in all kinds of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>

educational  and  training  courses  for  self-enhancement,   to

attain the state of lifelong learning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the Government allows the use of CPF savings

to  invest  in properties and shares under the Asset Enhancement

Scheme.  Enhancement of human resources is very important,  even

more  important  than  asset enhancement. Serious  consideration

should  therefore  be  given to some "human  assets  enhancement

scheme" to add value to our human assets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to speak on the

Skills  Development Fund (SDF).  Under the present scheme,  only

workers whose income is below $1,000 and whose educational level

is  below  `A' level can benefit from the scheme.  This standard

was fixed quite sometime ago. Now, our Singapore workers' income

and  educational level have been raised significantly  over  the

years.   The  scheme  should be adjusted accordingly.   I  would

suggest  that the income ceiling be raised so that workers  with

income  of between $1,000 and $2,000 can also benefit  from  the

scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the traditional distinction of workers in terms of

blue-collar work and white-collar work is already obsolete  now.

In  future,  the distinction between brain work and  brawn  work

will  be very blurred.  The nature of work in the new knowledge-based  economy  is  such  that one can hardly  tell  whether  it

involves  brain  or  brawn.  Any worker from the  administrative

staff  to  the operators at the production line are all valuable

assets  to the company. They are all part of our precious  human

resources,  and  they  should be given equal  opportunities  for

skills upgrading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would suggest that the Ministry of Manpower

revise,   amend  and  expand  the  regulations  of  the   Skills

Development Fund, so that junior and middle management staff can

also   benefit  from  this  training  scheme  to  enhance  their

professional capability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MOM is a Government agency coordinating labour-management relations.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>

While  looking after the labour side, it must not  overlook  the

management  side  as  well.   I would  suggest  that  while  the

Government  is giving more money to NTUC for skills development,

they  should  also  help  to  finance  the  business  community,

agencies or associations in the conduct of  training courses for

their  staff.   This  will  go a long way  to  enhancing  better

cooperative   relations  among  labour,   management   and   the

Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, while I understand that our

economy is experiencing a slowdown and jobs are in short supply,

nonetheless,  I would like to address the issue of  job  hopping

which  I  believe will become a problem for us once  we  recover

from the crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a past report by the Political and Economic Risk

Consultancy (PERC), Singapore was ranked 10 out of 12  countries

surveyed in the category of employee loyalty and job hopping was

cited as a serious problem for our country.  This was 10 out of 12 Asian countries surveyed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manufacturing sub-committee of the Committee on

Singapore's  Competitiveness recommended the use  of  CPF  as  a

measure of controlling staff turnover.  I, however, do not agree

with  the  approach  they  suggested because  it  results  in  a

permanent  disadvantage  for the  employee.   I  would  like  to

suggest an alternative approach that does not penalise a  worker

in  the initial years if he or she remains with the company  for

at least one year.  The suggestions I have are as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) For the first one year of employment, the employer

contributes  only  half  of  the  prevailing  CPF  rate  to  the

employee's account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) If the employee stays for at least one year, then the

employer  reimburses the employee's CPF account  with  the  full

amount  of the remaining half of the employer's CPF contribution

not paid for the past one year.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) If the employee leaves within the first year of

employment,  then  he  or  she  will  not  be  entitled  to  the

employer's portion of the CPF retained by the employer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this way, no one loses while the burden on the

employer is greatly reduced because the cost of hiring, training

and  re-hiring can be quite substantial.  The employer  can  use

the  retained money to defray the cost involved in the re-hiring

process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite the difficult environment and the record

number of retrenchments, we are still seeing a disturbing  trend

among Singaporean workers.  I spoke to a number of the employers

who experienced staff turnover of new employees within the first

six  months of employment.  Some even leave just one  day  after

starting their new job.  This happens even today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my own personal experience, I have seen this to be a

problem.   Within the first three months of this  year,  I  have

seen  a  21.4% staff turnover for reasons like unwillingness  to

work  in  clean  room environment, disliking  the  job  and  the

unwillingness to do shift work.  This is despite they being told

of  all  of  these during the interview process.   And  this  is

despite  the  gloomy employment environment.  Some Members  also

talk  about potential employees not accepting job offers.   From

my  own experience this year, we actually interviewed a total of

58 candidates and we looked at the candidates that were referred

to us by NTUC.  These were people who were retrenched from their

work.   Of  the  58  that we interviewed, some  of  course  were

rejected.  26 of those we offered did not accept the job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would say that this problem of job hopping and

attitude  of  employees still exist.  In my personal  case,  the

compensation  package was designed to match those  of  MNCs,  in

fact,  even better than MNCs, but workers are still not  willing

to stay around.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Minister will seriously consider this

approach to prevent job hopping.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can I draw hon. Members' attention to the

fact  that  we  are running out of time on this  amendment.   We

still have got quite a number of speeches to be heard.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Last year in June, I was

here  to express my concern that unemployment could reach 4%  by

the end of last year, and 5% to 7% by the end of this year.   At

the  end  of  the  day,  I was not too far wrong.   Unemployment

reached 4.3% as at the end of last year and could possibly reach

5% to 7% this year with rising unemployment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today I am here to express another concern. Many

people  feel that our economy is likely to recover by the second

half of this year and with that, unemployment will drop and  all

the problems we have with unemployment will disappear.  I do not

think  so.  My view is that unemployment is likely to be  sticky

this  time round.  In fact, I believe that unemployment rate  is

not  likely to drop significantly over the next few years.   Why

is  it so?  Because I firmly believe that cyclical recovery will

not  solve the unemployment problem.  If we were to look at  the

experience  of the other more advanced economies -  US,  Europe,

and  so  on  -  most  of  them went from  unemployment  to  full

employment,  from  full  employment to structural  unemployment,

from structural unemployment to jobless growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Singapore, I believe that we may face the

same problem of jobless growth for the next few years.  Because,

firstly,  as  the  Minister has mentioned,  some  employers  are

adopting  a  wait-and-see attitude, so they are  not  likely  to

recruit people over the next few months.  But, more importantly,

because new operations which we are creating in the economy  are

going to require fewer people, and at the same time the pace  of

restructuring  is  likely to continue  to  remain  fast.   As  a

result,  we are likely to see a very marginal increase in  terms

of  net  job creation over the next few years.  So my  worry  is

that  if  we  do  end up with a prolonged period  of  structural

unemployment,  how  would that affect social cohesion,  national

unity, and so on?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have to find a way to prevent jobless growth. We

cannot  do  so by trying to slow down the pace of restructuring.

But we can do so by focusing on structural recovery.  Structural

recovery means different things to different economies.  In  the

case of Singapore, our structural weakness is a mismatch between

jobs  and  skills of workers.  Therefore, the key to  structural

recovery  in  the case of Singapore really is to  focus  on  the

training  and  development of knowledge  workers.   We  need  to

enlarge the pool.  We need to upgrade the capabilities, so that,

hopefully,  in  the near future we can get out of  this  jobless

growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may argue: are knowledge workers so important? I

remember,  in  my days at the EDB, in the past,  when  investors

decided  on  investment  locations, there  were  four  criteria.

Firstly, physical infrastructure.  Do we have the facilities  to

support  the  operation?  Secondly, cost of operation;  thirdly,

availability of manpower; and lastly, availability  of  capital.

Today, it has changed.  The first criterion is manpower.  Do  we

have  the knowledge workers to support the operation?  Secondly,

do  we  have the knowledge and global infrastructure to  support

globalisation of operation?  Thirdly, availability  of  capital,

because  all these operations are capital-intensive; and lastly,

cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given this situation, I believe that we have done enough in

the  areas  of  nurturing a capital market  in  Singapore,  cost

cutting  through off-Budget measures, and so on.   We  are  also

working  very hard on knowledge and global infrastructure,  like

Singapore  One,  the Boston of the East, the  wafer  fab  parks,

Jurong  Island,  and  so  on.  But in the  areas  of  capability

development, I feel that we are still not doing fast enough  and

going  far  enough.   I  hope we will give greater  urgency  and

greater  push  on  the  training and  development  of  knowledge

workers so that we can speed up the creation of jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my question to the Minister is: will the Ministry

consider  setting up a $1.2 billion fund known as  the  Manpower

Development Assistance Scheme?  I have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>

faxed my proposal to the Ministry.  I think the Minister has the

details.   I  will circulate it to the media in  case  they  are

interested  in  the  contents.  But let  me  just  mention  very

briefly that my proposal is, firstly, to use the fund to support

the  formulation  of  new curriculum in  all  economic  sectors;

secondly,  expand  the training capacity in all  major  sectors;

thirdly,  upgrade  the  training  capabilities  in  new   growth

sectors;  fourthly,  extend the scope of support  to  all  major

categories of employees and professions; fifthly, focus  SDF  on

rank-and-file   workers  with  co-funding   support   from   the

Government, and then support skills certification, and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the same time, in this proposal I have added two

ideas  that  I  think are important.  In addition to  developing

knowledge workers among the local workforce, I support the  idea

that  we have to continue to attract foreign talents.  I do  not

think  the issue is one of toning-up or toning-down this message

on  attracting  foreign talent.  Rather it  is  to  re-tone  our

message,  ie,  let us be more selective, let us go  for  foreign

talent who really can make a difference in helping us to upgrade

the  capability of our pool of knowledge workers.   As  for  our

young  Singaporeans, I am very concerned that  one  out  of  six

young  graduates last year is still jobless today.  Sir, I think

it  is  something that we should be concerned about, and I  hope

that the MDAS will do something to help the younger workers too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, let me just say that we are going to go into

a  period  of jobless growth.  I do not know whether I  am  100%

right  in my assessment, but I am very sure I am not 100% wrong.

So please do something.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I would like to speak on improving

the culture of workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1917, the communists in Russia rose up in revolution

against  the  Czar.  They were successful.  They  overthrew  the

Czar  and took over power.  Among the first social reforms  they

carried out was to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>

improve  the  cultural level of the workers.  The  workers  were

taught  how  to behave properly.  They were told not  to  behave

like  country bumpkins.  When they attended a ballet performance

at  the  Bolshoi  Theatre, they were  told  not  to  wear  their

overcoats  into the theatre but to leave them outside  with  the

attendants,  especially when their overcoats were  covered  with

snow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stalin was the second communist ruler in Russia. He built

the  military  might of Russia which defeated  Nazi  Germany  in

World  War II.  Stalin once was asked what he thought  were  the

top  three  priorities  for  Russia.   He  said  the  top  three

priorities were, firstly, military matters; secondly,  cultural;

and thirdly, economic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite surprising to us in Singapore that Stalin

should give more importance to culture than to the economy.   He

was  probably of the view that once people became more cultured,

they  are  more disciplined, and would make better soldiers  and

also would be more responsible and make better citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World War II had shown that both the Russians and the

Germans  were equally good soldiers.  Both were very disciplined

and  they  fought bravely, possibly due to their  high  cultural

level.   The  average German soldier in World War II was  highly

cultured.   He  listened  to  the  music  of  Wagner,  Bach  and

Beethoven.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in Singapore have no educational programmes to raise the

cultural  level of the workers, except when there  is  a  social

necessity  to  do so.  The Government then passes laws  to  curb

workers'  bad  habits, like forcing them to  flush  the  toilets

after  their  use, or not to spit in public places,  or  not  to

jaywalk.  These penal provisions, although mandatory in  nature,

do have an educative effect and they do raise the cultural level

of  the workers.  Those laws do make people behave more civilly.

In Singapore, I think the Government, and perhaps the NTUC, must

have  a  lot to do in raising the cultural level of the workers.

There  is  still  a lot of work to be done to  get  the  workers

interested  in some sports and games or in the theatre  and  the

arts.  It is observed that the average

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>

worker, other than his work, has no other interests.  He is  not

even  interested in his own family.  He spends most of his spare

time  drinking beer at coffeeshops after his working hours.   He

goes  home late, smelling heavily of liquor to the annoyance  of

course  to  his  wife and children.  This type of workers  seems

completely lost.  They have nowhere to go and do not  know  what

to  do with their leisure hours.  On weekends, they are probably

found  in  the  race-course gambling on horses.  The  Government

condones  such  a  situation as both liquor and  gambling  bring

revenue to the coffers of the Government.

<br>3.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think the present state of the workers in Singapore

does not augur well for the country.  Something must be done for

the  present workers to raise their cultural level.  As for  the

future  workers, our education system needs to  be  revamped  to

teach   our   children   how  to  occupy  their   leisure   time

meaningfully.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I will first address the points

raised  by  Mr  Charles  Chong  who  is  concerned  with  rising

unemployment and asked what is our policy on balancing the  need

to  attract foreign talent and local workers.  In fact,  I  have

explained  that earlier on.  The point I want to  make  here  is

that  we  are  well  aware of the need to balance  the  flow  of

foreign workers with the drop in job creation.  That is  why  in

the  November 1998 cost reduction package, we have  reduced  the

foreign  worker levy for the skilled workers, but  we  have  not

changed the dependency ratio.  There is still a dependency ratio

which  will  govern  how many foreign workers  an  employer  can

employ.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also not reduced the levy on the unskilled workers,

particularly those in the construction sector, because  that  is

where the bulk of the foreign workers come from.  What I want to

add  here  is that the mere tightening of the inflow of  foreign

workers, particularly those in the work permit category, may not

result  in more jobs for the local workers.  Because if we  deny

access to these work permit

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>

holders, we may in fact hamper the efforts of many employers who

are trying to regain competitiveness and their market share.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the lower skills level, many foreign workers are still

needed  by  employers, particularly in industries  such  as  the

construction  sector,  where many locals  are  just  simply  not

prepared to take up these jobs although there are many  jobs  in

the  construction sector which are in fact well within the means

and  capabilities  of Singaporeans.  Even in  the  manufacturing

industry, foreign workers are employed because they fill a  need

which Singaporeans in many instances are not willing to take up.

For instance, as described by Mr Inderjit Singh a moment ago, he

has  experienced  a high turnover rate because Singaporeans  are

not prepared to do some of this work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are still reluctant to do some of the

difficult  jobs in the manufacturing sector or those jobs  which

require  rotating shift work.  And this is where foreign workers

are still needed to help these companies to remain viable and to

compete  successfully.  So we should not be too quick,  at  this

juncture,  to  deny  companies access to even  the  work  permit

holders,  unless  we  are sure that the  locals,  including  the

unemployed  locals,  are ready to take on  these  jobs.   If  we

prematurely make adjustments or turn off the flow of work permit

holders  to the employers, we may actually hasten their loss  of

competitiveness,  their  inability to regain  market  share  and

expedite  their  exit from Singapore.  If that happens,  we  are

going  to  lose  50%  more jobs because, as I  said,  under  the

present rules, the manufacturing sector has a maximum dependency

ratio  of 50%.  In fact, by having foreign workers here, we  are

also preserving jobs for other Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked what we are doing about re-engineering

and  revamping some of the jobs at the lower end of  the  skills

level  which,  perhaps, some Singaporeans may have  to  consider

taking  up  because they may not have the ability or  the  basic

education for further skills upgrading.  I agree with him that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>

there  is  a group of Singaporeans who lack the basic  education

for  them to benefit from any skills upgrading effort.  For this

group,  we  have  to help them to be redeployed to  a  different

sector.   They still have to be trained. But they can be trained

to  work  in  a  different sector.  So my Ministry  is  in  fact

working  on  specific programmes to see how some  of  the  lower

skilled  jobs can be re-engineered to be upgraded  in  terms  of

skill  content  and  professionalism so  that  Singaporeans  who

cannot  do work in the high-tech industries in the manufacturing

sector  can now take on these jobs, particularly in the  service

sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One industry that we are interested in looking at is the

cleaning  industry.  Traditionally, this cleaning  industry  had

been  very dependent on foreign workers.  We are in fact working

with  the  cleaning  industry to see  how  we  can  enhance  the

productivity  of  the cleaning workers.  If we can  enhance  the

productivity  of  the cleaning workers, then they  can  be  paid

more.   If  they  can be paid more, the jobs  will  become  more

attractive to Singaporeans who do not have the skills to do  the

other  manufacturing  sector jobs.   We  are  working  with  the

cleaning   association,   ie,   the   Environmental   Management

Association of Singapore, and also the PSB's Standards  Division

to  design a set of cleaning industry quality standards.  We are

also  developing  training  programmes  and  certification   for

cleaning skills.  This is not unusual as one would have thought.

In  countries  like  Denmark, they have an established  cleaning

industry,  in  fact,  a multinational in the cleaning  industry.

They  have  very  clear-cut and objectively  developed  cleaning

industry standards which help the industry to reach a very  high

level of professionalism and service quality.  Their workers are

very  well-paid and well-rewarded and they are not dependent  on

foreign  workers  to  do those jobs.  So we  should  aspire  and

strive  towards  that  direction  where  an  industry  like  the

cleaning  industry can be made more attractive for some  of  our

lower skilled Singaporeans.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, retraining and re-engineering jobs alone will not

solve  all  the problems.  Workers must also have more realistic

expectations and change their mindsets with regard to wages  and

the  nature  of  their jobs, especially during  this  recession.

Recently,  we  organised a two-day job fair to enhance  workers'

understanding of clean room jobs.  Nine firms with  a  total  of

500 vacancies came along to participate in the fair.  At the end

of  the  two-day fair, we succeeded to fill 100-plus  vacancies.

This  is already an improvement.  The other recruitment exercise

that we had mounted for the clean room sector had an even poorer

response.   The  100-plus  workers  recruited  are  already   an

improvement.   But  we have to ask ourselves why  the  employers

have  such  difficulty filling vacancies for these  well  paying

jobs.  Why is it so during this period of high unemployment  and

recession?  If it is a lack of skills, then our workers must  be

more  willing  to  undergo training and  skills  upgrading.   If

workers  have unrealistic expectations about what they ought  to

be paid for such jobs, then they must be moderated because it is

a  question  of how we can remain competitive.  We are  not  the

only  country  with wafer fabrication plant or other  electronic

industries operating clean rooms.  Others are doing so  at  much

lower wages.  We have to be competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Ah Heng raised quite a number of questions. I will

try to deal with them in the order that he has raised them.   He

asked whether we can provide monthly updates on job creation and

job  opportunities in the various economic sectors.  My Ministry

releases  a  quarterly  Labour  Market  publication  to  provide

workers and employers with a comprehensive and up-to-date labour

market  information.   The  quarterly  release  supplements  the

annual Labour Market Survey and also occasional papers on labour

market  to help job seekers, workers and employers make informed

decisions.  Currently, we have already conducted a total  of  15

regular  surveys a year to gather information from  the  private

sector  establishments  and households.   In  addition,  ad  hoc

surveys are also conducted by the Ministry on various employment

issues.  We have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>

received  feedback  from the employers that  this  frequency  of

surveys  is  already posing a burden on some  of  them.   It  is

perhaps  not  practical at this juncture to  conduct  a  monthly

survey,  as suggested by Mr Ong, because too frequent  a  survey

would just increase the burden on the employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong also asked what is the number of new entrants into

the  labour  market who are gainfully employed and what  is  the

scale  of  under employment in Singapore.  Sir,  the  June  1998

Labour Force Survey indicated that there were about 53,000 local

new  entrants to the workforce.  Of this, 86% of the  local  new

entrants  were  gainfully  employed.   Among  the  employed  new

entrants,  93% were working full time and only 7%  were  working

part-time.  Under employment commonly refers to persons who  are

in the employment but have to work part-time because they cannot

find  a  full-time job.  The findings of the same  Labour  Force

Survey revealed that only a small percentage of our workers  are

involuntary part-timers.  In 1998, only 0.4% of the new entrants

who were employed were working part-time involuntarily, in other

words,  they  cannot find a full-time job.  Among  all  employed

persons, the proportion of part-timers is only 0.3%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong has also asked how many of the graduates in the

tertiary  institutions have decided to extend their studies  and

go  on  to  higher  studies  in view  of  the  poor  job  market

situation.   According  to  a recent employment  survey  by  the

National  University of Singapore and the Nanyang  Technological

University,  83.4% of the students who graduated last  year  had

found jobs within the year, ie, by end of December, compared  to

95% in 1997.  So we saw a 12% drop.  The same survey also showed

that  the  number of post-graduate students at NUS went  up  27%

last  year and 20% at NTU.  The sharp increase in the intake  of

post-graduate  students could be attributed  to  this  group  of

students who have decided to continue with their studies instead

of coming out into a very poor job market.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong asked whether this would just defer the unemployment

problem.   My answer is no.  When the economy recovers and  when

these students have completed their post-graduate studies,  they

would  in  fact  be in a better position to make  more  valuable

contribution to the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked what is our success rate in trying to

find work for the unemployed Singaporeans.  Mr Hawazi Daipi  has

also  raised the same point on our effort to find work  for  the

unemployed  Singaporeans.  Sir, we have expanded the  Employment

Service  Department in my Ministry to cope with  the  increasing

demand for job assistance.  The number of registrants more  than

quadrupled from 5,000 in 1997 to about 20,000 in 1998.   Despite

the  higher  demand  and  also  due  to  the  shrinkage  in  job

opportunities,  the Employment Service Department  was  able  to

provide job referrals to about 78% of all job seekers.  A  total

of 4,200 job offers resulted from these referrals.  However, not

all job seekers took up the offer.  Eventually, about 1,000,  or

5%  of the total registrants, were successfully placed.  We have

also tried to persuade low skilled retrenched workers to undergo

training through the SRP so that they can take the new jobs that

are  being  created.  So if you were to ask me  whether  we  are

satisfied with the outcome of 5% placement, my answer is no.  We

want to do better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are we doing? What we are doing is that we have

incorporated  various  new mechanisms.   We  have  introduced  a

broadcast   mechanism  to  provide  information   to   potential

employers of the availability of whole groups of workers who are

about  to  be retrenched, or have been retrenched,  so  that  an

employer who is still looking for more workers can consider  all

these whole groups of retrenched workers.

<br>3.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also set up an employment facilitation team to

actually go out to establish contacts with companies to find out

what  are  their labour requirements, what are their recruitment

plans and to persuade them to pass their job vacancies

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>

to us to be incorporated into our job bank, so that we are in  a

better position to offer more referrals to those who come to  us

for job placement assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier on, I mentioned organising a clean room fair. We

have worked with Community Development Councils to organise  job

fairs  where  employers or companies that are  still  recruiting

workers  are  persuaded  to come along, and  we  advertise  this

function held at various community facilities and bring the job-seekers and employers together to help them to meet their needs.

The  placement  rate  at  some of these fairs  was  much  better

because  they  were  far more focused.  We achieve  much  better

placement rate of 18-20% at the job fairs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure Members that we are committed to

assisting  all  unemployed Singaporeans to look for  alternative

employment.   We will step up our efforts to find the  jobs  for

them.   We will also be looking into improving further our  job-matching service as well as introducing new initiatives to  help

out-of-job Singaporeans to look for work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh suggested that we allow a retrenched

worker  and  out-of-work  Singaporean to  borrow  from  his  CPF

Special  Account to meet the daily expenses.  I  understand  the

difficulties faced by some retrenched workers, but we  must  not

just  be  over  engrossed  with the  immediate  problem  and  to

overlook  the long-term impact if we introduce any new measures.

We  should avoid solving one problem only to create a  new  one.

The CPF savings are primarily meant for old age requirement,  as

well  as  to  meet basic housing needs and also  medical  needs.

Many  CPF  members  have, in fact, used  their  CPF  savings  to

purchase properties, including HDB flats and private residential

properties.  The 10 percentage point reduction in employers' CPF

contribution rate to help employers to cut costs and  to  regain

competitiveness has already caused quite a number of CPF members

to  face  shortfalls  in their monthly mortgage  repayment.   In

order to help this group, we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>

have  in  fact  allowed  them to draw on their  Special  Account

savings to make up for the shortfall in CPF contribution.  If we

now  also allow retrenched workers to borrow from their  Special

Account  to meet their living expenses, it would further  affect

the  ability  of  many  Singaporeans to  service  their  housing

mortgage.   So, the best way to help retrenched workers  is,  in

fact, to help them seek re-employment expeditiously so that they

can  earn  a  regular  income to support  themselves  and  their

families.   Faced  with a crunch, retrenched workers  should  be

prepared to take on any job.  Having a job is better than no job

at all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have explained earlier, we will do everything possible

at  the Employment Service Department to help retrenched workers

seek  alternative  employment.   For  those  whose  savings  are

running  out and who lack family support, they can turn  to  the

many   community  assistance  programmes  administered  by   the

Ministry  of  Community  Development, the Community  Development

Councils,  the  National Council for Social Services,  self-help

groups  and  the  various voluntary welfare organisations.   The

community-operated safety nets are there to help those  who  are

in  serious difficulties.  To ensure families with school  going

children  do  not  suffer from this downturn,  the  Ministry  of

Education  also  offers  such  families  assistance  for   their

educational expenses.  These include partial or full  waiver  of

school fees, miscellaneous fees, as well as textbook grants  for

needy  students.   For students studying in  the  institutes  of

higher learning, they could apply for the CCC university or  CCC

polytechnic bursaries, tuition fee loans and study loans as well

as bursary and loan schemes administered by the universities and

the polytechnics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health also has a Medifund which is

available  to  help  those  who have difficulties  paying  their

medical  bills incurred at the public hospitals.   The  Minister

for Finance has also announced generous and wide-ranging rebates

on  HDB  rentals, service and conservancy charges and  utilities

charges.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, releasing the Special Account savings of a

retrenched  worker is an option that should be  reserved  for  a

worse case scenario of a very deep and prolonged recession.   We

are  only  just  at the start and we should not rush  into  such

drastic  measures  immediately.  Otherwise it  will  reduce  our

options for reaction if the situation does get worse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay Wai Chuen spoke on the transferability and

portability of skills certification.  I agree with him.  I think

this  is  a  very  important aspect of our school  of  life-long

learning.  The present skills training and certification  system

for   the   workforce   is  based  on  the  National   Technical

Certification  (NTC) system.  It is a good,  broad-based,  well-established  system that provides the school-going cohorts  with

all  rounded  technical and vocational education.  However,  the

skills training of our workforce is more specific and job based.

Hence, I agree with Mr Chay that we also need the modular system

of  skills  training  when workers and employers  can  pick  the

skills that are relevant to their operation.  The modular system

will  help  our workers to continuously acquire new  skills  and

keep  pace  with  the  changing  requirement  to  enhance  their

employability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is working together with PSB to develop a

National Skills Recognition system which has been recommended by

the  Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness.  The system  will

define  skills  standards for job-based  competencies  that  are

directly relevant to industries and nationally recognised.   The

National  Skills  Recognition system  will  complement  the  NTC

system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Magad has raised the question of whether

retrenched  workers  are  covered by  the  Skills  Redevelopment

Programme   (SRP).   He  noted  that  the  Skills  Redevelopment

Programme  has  addressed the needs of workers who  need  skills

upgrading,  but what about those who have lost their  jobs,  the

retrenched   workers.   At  present,  the  unemployed   or   the

retrenched workers can seek sponsorship for participation in the

Skills Redevelopment Programme by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>

approaching the NTUC or self-help groups such as CDAC,  Mendaki,

AMP   and   Sinda.   These  self-help  groups  have  volunteered

themselves as SRP facilitators.  They act as surrogate employers

for  unemployed workers.  Unemployed workers who  register  with

the  community self-help groups will also receive the same level

of  funding support as any workers who have been sponsored by an

employer.   A retrenched worker who is willing to go for  skills

upgrading  under the SRP will not be worse off than one  who  is

presently  employed.   In  fact, the self-help  groups  offer  a

training  allowance of up to $500 per month when training  on  a

full-time basis, and the full cost of the training will be borne

by  the  self-help  group  and the SRP.   So,  as  I  said,  the

retrenched  workers receive the same incentive  as  one  who  is

still at work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang was concerned with Singaporean skilled

workers  who  may have to face competition with similar  foreign

skilled workers.  He mentioned welders, plasterers, etc, and  if

I  understand  him correctly, he asked whether they  are  facing

competition  from foreign workers, particularly  from  Malaysia.

The  answer  is yes.  There is some competition.   But  are  our

Singaporeans completely vulnerable?  The answer is  no,  because

we  have a foreign worker policy which requires the employer  to

pay  a  certain levy for the work permit holders and the purpose

of  the  levy is, to a certain extent, to bridge the gap between

those  who  come from lower-wage countries and Singaporeans  who

expect a higher level of wages.  So, there is some protection of

Singaporean  workers  at that level from unfettered  competition

from foreign workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also mentioned that the training opportunities provided

by  SDF  seem  to  be  skewed, favouring  too  much  those  with

secondary  education,  and those with lower  education  are  not

getting  their fair share of training.  I think it is not  quite

correct  because what we have done is that we have  embarked  on

programmes which now deliberately focus on the needs of the less

educated  or lower-skilled workers.  The SRP is an example.   It

is a $120 million

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>

programme  to  specifically look at the mid-career  workers  who

have  lower  than  secondary education and  who  have  very  low

skills,  and  to equip them with new skills or to upgrade  their

skills  so that they could take on the new jobs.  We are talking

about extending their employability through skills upgrading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also pointed out that the weakness of the current

programmes for skills upgrading for the workers is that too much

emphasis is placed on the employers and he quoted examples  like

the  SRP.  Perhaps, he may not be aware of what I have just said

in  response  to  Mr Ahmad Magad that, in fact, even  unemployed

workers can participate in the SRP, provided they go to the self-help  groups or to NTUC.  And NTUC would even help workers  from

the  non-unionised sector.  All workers are covered  under  SRP.

It  is  not  just for those who are presently employed  or  just

unionised workers but every worker who wants to upgrade  himself

and benefit from the opportunities available under the SRP would

be  able to do so.  They can go to NTUC or the self-help  groups

to seek assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned that some of our educational upgrading

projects seem to lead to nowhere.  He cited the examples of BEST

and  WISE.  I think that is also not correct, because  BEST  and

WISE  are  programmes to improve the basic literacy of  workers,

ie,  language command and basic numeracy, so that they can later

on  undergo further skills upgrading.  Because without the basic

language  and numeracy command, you cannot further upgrade  your

skills.   BEST and WISE are just preparatory courses  which  the

lower  educated workers have to go through to prepare  them  for

the skills upgrading that would come later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi also asked whether we must consider the needs of

the  non-unionised workers and whether other  employers  may  be

more  willing  to  provide higher skills  training,  because  he

observes that some of the employers may be reluctant to  provide

skills training for their higher

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>

skilled employees for fear of job hopping, and what is the  role

of  NTUC in workers' upgrading.  As I explained earlier on, non-unionised  sector workers can also benefit from SRP.  NTUC  will

also  serve  the needs of this group and I think initially,  the

non-unionised companies were quite reluctant to come forward  to

participate in the SRP, as they thought it was for the unionised

workers  only  or  by  participating  in  SRP,  they  would   be

encouraging  their employees to become unionised.  But  I  think

this perception has largely been corrected because more and more

non-unionised  companies are willing to  come  forward  to  work

together with NTUC, and to send their workers for training under

the  SRP.  In fact, this shows the benefit of having NTUC  as  a

major  promoter  and  supporter of the  SRP  programme.   As  to

employers  who  are  reluctant to  train  their  higher  skilled

workers  or  executives,  I  think it  is  a  very  shortsighted

employer  who  does not train his executives  or higher  skilled

workers just because of fear of job hopping.  Then he is forever

limiting  the  capabilities of his  employees.   He  is  forever

living  with a lower level of potential.  So employers  have  to

open  up,  and  they have to be more willing to  support  skills

training at all levels of the company's establishment.  That  is

the  only way to maximise their human resource potential.   That

is  the  only way that he can really compete, by giving all  his

employees the best training necessary for them to do a good job.

<br>3.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chuang spoke on the same point about whether we should

not  review the foreign worker policy, so as not to disadvantage

the  local  workers and we need to build up  a  corps  of  local

skilled workers.  Particularly, he mentioned the point that many

of  the  foreign workers come from countries with  lower  wages.

The  answer to that is that we adopted a policy of imposing  the

foreign worker levy in order to bridge the wage gap, and to make

it  very  fair for Singaporeans who cannot compete just on  wage

alone.   That  is  why the foreign workers attract  the  foreign

worker levy, depending on the skills level.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked how will Singaporeans get the training to compete

and  to  upgrade  against the inflow of  foreign  workers.   The

answer  is what we have been doing all along.   We will  provide

more  opportunities  for  skills  training.   SRP  is  just  the

beginning.  When we implement the recommendations that are being

put  forward by the Manpower 21 studies, we will have a national

framework for a school of lifelong learning.  We should  provide

all workers with opportunities to upgrade themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay Beng Chuan made several points. He asked whether we

could  revise  the $1,000 wage limit on the  Skills  Development

Fund.  The answer is yes.  In fact, in principle, this is agreed

to.  But the question is, when do we do it?  If we do it now, we

will  be adding to the cost for the employer, because the Skills

Development  levy  is in fact a tax on the  payroll.   While  we

agree,  in principle, to do so, we will do it at a time when  it

will have least effect on the competitiveness of the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also said that the SDF should widen its scope to include

training  for  mid  and  high level  skilled  workers  within  a

company.  The answer is yes.  SDF does support training  courses

for  managerial and executive staff.  While the focus up to  now

has  been  on upgrading the skills of workers, as they form  the

majority   of   the  workforce  and  are  most  susceptible   to

retrenchment and structural unemployment, SDF is also willing to

support training initiatives for executives and management.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the total company training programme, companies are

encouraged  to take a total approach to training and development

that  covers workers, executives and management, and  all  these

will  be supported by SDF.  Currently, approximately 20% of  the

total  training places supported by SDF in a year  are  actually

taken  up  by  managers  and executives.   I  think  this  is  a

reasonable proportion for managers and executives who, in  fact,

form the minority in the workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with his point that managers and even professionals

should also constantly upgrade and be kept abreast of new

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>

knowledge  in order to stay relevant.  While the Government  can

support  to  some extent, particularly for small  companies  and

businesses, employers should also be prepared to bear a  greater

share  of  the  responsibility for training and upgrading  their

managers  and  professionals.   Ultimately,  the  business  will

benefit  when  the skills of their executives and  managers  are

upgraded.   Being the main beneficiary, they should also put  in

their  fair  share  of  supporting such training  and  upgrading

efforts.   Likewise,  managers  and  executives,  being  already

highly  educated,  should also bear part of  the  share  in  the

responsibility   for   upgrading.   There   is   an   individual

responsibility  for  upgrading which they  should  also  accept.

Nevertheless, I would consider the Nominated Member's suggestion

for  Government to work with business and industry groups, apart

from  NTUC,  to form partnerships to promote and support  skills

upgrading for their members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh spoke on job hopping. He felt that it is

still  a  problem  that  we  must address.   I  have,  in  fact,

previously  replied  on  another  occasion  that  forfeiting   a

worker's  CPF  contribution to deter job hopping  would  detract

from the basic CPF objectives of building up savings for old age

as  soon  as a person starts working.  Let me add that it  would

not  be  effective  in curbing job hopping.  Job  hopping  is  a

complex  and multi-faceted problem.  Workers may leave a company

for various reasons, some frivolous, but others may be perfectly

valid  and beyond the control of the workers themselves.   While

excessive  job  hopping  is undesirable,  a  certain  amount  of

mobility  in  the labour market is normal, and it will  help  to

ensure an optimal distribution of labour through the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, reducing the employer's share of contribution in the

first year or two of service to deter job hopping is unlikely to

be effective in curbing job hopping.  It is also tantamount to a

wage cut for these workers who have to leave their jobs for good

reason after a year or less.  That could be quite unfair to  the

workers.   Employers  should not just  pass  the  blame  of  job

hopping to the workers.  What

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>

happens in the case where a bad employer fails to provide a  new

employee  with the necessary training or career development?  Is

it  wrong  for  the  employee to look for greener  pastures?   I

believe  that  every  employer also has some  responsibility  to

forge a bond with his workers and to establish company loyalty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of changing the CPF system to penalise early

resignations, employers must also devise their own  remuneration

system  to discourage job hopping.  For instance, employers  can

pay  their workers lower starting salary in the first two years,

and then reward them with a more attractive remuneration package

subsequently if they stay beyond, say, the 2-year period.   Such

loyalty pay rises are well within every employer's means  to  do

so  now  and do not require a change in our CPF system.  I  hope

the  Member could advise employers to exercise their initiative,

manage  their  workers with long-term perspective and  not  just

shift  the blame to the workers or resort to schemes such  as  a

CPF cut.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now address the point raised by Mr Lim Swee Say. He

said  that  we  should focus on the training and development  of

knowledge  workers,  and  he suggested establishing  a  Manpower

Development  Assistance Scheme or Fund to promote this  training

of  our workers.  I agree with the Member for Tanjong Pagar that

we should have as many workers as possible trained and competent

to support the knowledge-based economy.  As Singapore moves into

the  knowledge age, the rapid change of technology today and the

structural  shifts from labour and capital intensive  industries

to  knowledge intensive industries mean that our workforce  must

be engaged in continuous learning and upgrading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since last Monday, in fact, many Members have spoken on

the  move into a knowledge-based economy.  Some have asked  what

does  all  this  mean.   What is the need to  develop  knowledge

workers?  I want to emphasise at this juncture that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>

when we talk about a knowledge-based economy, when we talk about

knowledge  workers,  we  are talking about  all  levels  of  the

workforce.    We   are   talking  about  workers,   supervisors,

executives, managers and professionals.  We are not only talking

about  the  managers, executives, engineers  and  the  high-tech

people,  we  are talking about every single worker in Singapore.

We are talking about any worker who tries to learn new skills or

pick up new ideas to enable him or her to do the job better, and

more productively.  When we talk about knowledge workers, we are

referring to people who approach whatever they do with curiosity

and creativity, always trying to do a better job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give Members an example which I happen to come

across some months ago in the Straits Times.  I read this report

about a Chinese chef, Sam Leong, at the Four Seasons Hotel.   Mr

Leong was the man who created a new dish  -  pork ribs in coffee

sauce.  It was unusual to offer  pork ribs in coffee sauce,  and

who  would  have  thought that pork ribs go  well  with  coffee?

Well,  Mr  Leong  did  it.  He thought that  it  would  make  an

interesting  combination.  He took great pains.  Through   trial

and  error,  he arrived at a recipe that was properly  balanced,

tasty  and  attractive.  He went on to create this  dish  at  an

international  culinary competition and won a prize  for  it,  I

believe, in Los Angeles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chef Leong is a knowledge worker. He came up with a new

idea.   He experimented on his own.  He failed.  He tried  again

and  finally he succeeded in striking a balance and  created  an

award winning dish.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what I am saying is that you do not have to have a PhD.

You do not have to have an MBA.  You do not even have to have  a

degree  to  be  a  knowledge  worker.   Singapore  needs   every

Singaporean to make that effort.  We need many more workers like

Mr  Leong who is prepared to make an effort, who comes  up  with

innovative  ideas, experiment on his own, and comes out  with  a

new  concoction  that  works  better.   And  in  this  case,  an

interesting and unusual dish.  As long as each and every one  of

us makes an effort,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>

comes up with innovative ideas that can boost the quality of our

work,  the  productivity of whatever we do, then, in fact,  that

worker is a knowledge worker.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim asked whether we would establish a substantial

programme  to  support training and skills development  for  our

workers  to  prepare  them for this work in the  knowledge-based

economy.   I  agree with him that this will be  done.   Because,

presently,  we  have  quite a number of programmes  targeted  at

skills upgrading.  The Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP)  is,

of  course,  very well known.  There is also the Initiatives  in

New Technology (INTECH) which is administered by the EDB.  It is

a   $800  million  programme  to  provide  grants  for  manpower

development  in  leading-edge technology.  The EDB  also  has  a

programme  to  post young engineers for overseas assignment,  so

that  they  can pick up skills and experience that will  benefit

the economy when it turns around.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this financial year, my Ministry has set aside $50

million as provision for new manpower capability projects.  This

includes  establishing  a national skills certification  system,

developing and upgrading Continuous Education and Training (CET)

providers, and also the Strategic Manpower Conversion Programme,

which  I  described  earlier  on  to  train  people  from  other

disciplines, to prepare them for jobs in the IT industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in the process of finalising the Manpower 21 plan.

A  key  outcome  will be the development of a lifelong  learning

system,  under  the concept of the School of Lifelong  Learning.

The  proposal for a Manpower Development Assistance Scheme  will

be  considered together with the need to fund the implementation

of the other Manpower 21 recommendations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam asked about meeting the cultural needs of workers.

I agree with him that culture is not just for the highly skilled

or  the well educated.  Culture is for everybody.  We should all

take an active interest in culture.  But he seems to present the

idea that our ordinary workers

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>

are  bereft of culture.  I think it is wrong.  It is fallacious.

I  think  Mr Chiam does not mix with the right group of  people.

He  only has to come to my community centre  -  I will extend an

invitation to Mr Chiam to visit my community centre,  and  I  am

sure many Backbenchers will also extend an invitation to him   - to  see  the  amount of cultural activities that go  on  in  the

community  centre, and to see and meet the people who  come  and

participate in these activities, whether it is arts and  crafts,

Chinese painting, social dancing, music.  I have children from 1-room  flats  coming to my CC to learn music,  whether  it  is  a

Chinese  instrument or even the piano.  So, what is  he  talking

about that workers in Singapore are deprived of participating in

cultural   pursuits?    Hundreds  of   thousands   of   ordinary

Singaporeans participate in cultural activities at the community

centre.

<br>3.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to have conveniently forgotten that each year we

mount  the  Arts  Festival.  The Arts Festival is  available  to

everybody.  Every Singaporean can come and enjoy the events  and

activities during the Arts Festival.  In fact, during  the  Arts

Festival  there are as many fringe events as there  are  in  the

main events where you have to pay to enter. So the fringe events

that are held in Suntec City, Westin, Takashimaya, are all free.

Anybody  can  come  along and watch an interesting  performance,

whether it is by a local group or by an international group.  So

I  do  not  see why he should give us a lecture on the communist

approach  to promoting culture for the proletariat.  I think  he

is  out of touch with what is happening in Singapore.  I am very

disappointed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I am aware of

the  time.  I would be grateful for as detailed a reply, perhaps

in  written form, as the Minister has given to the other Members

who have spoken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My idea is really the fact that when we move to a knowledge-based economy, I think we also require a fundamental

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>

change  in the way in which we work, from one whereby the office

hours   are  fixed  to  one  where  we  have  flexible   working

arrangements.   Precisely because in a knowledge-based  economy,

creativity does not merely just come in the office, it can  come

anywhere.   Also, because of the fact that we do  have  advanced

means  of  communication and IT, we can also work  anywhere  and

still  be  in  communication with our office colleagues.   So  I

would urge the Government, in particular, to start this move  of

changing  to flexible working arrangements.  Some companies have

already  done  so and perhaps the Government could further  give

impetus  to  this move by allowing flexible working arrangements

for those whose work has a high component of creativity.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, Dr Lee Tsao Yuan has

painted  a scenario of a knowledge-based economy where work  can

be   carried   out  or  performed  away  from  the   traditional

centralised office and this is indeed facilitated by  high-speed

computer and telecommunications technology.  This transformation

involves moving the work to where people are, rather than people

to where the work is. However, I must add a word of caution that

not every sector of the economy can be operational off-site.  In

the  manufacturing industry, for example, most of its activities

can only be carried out in the factory premises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a global trend for companies to adopt new work

processes  to  enhance their competitiveness  and  enable  their

employees to perform work outside the office or to take up flexi-time  and  part-time jobs.  My Ministry recognises this  growing

trend, which will also change the way we work in Singapore.  The

knowledge-based  economy will require a paradigm  shift  on  the

part  of  the  employers  and the workers.   Employers  must  be

prepared to invest in technological infrastructure to support an

IT-based work place.   They must also invest in the training  of

their workers to prepare them for the change.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a Manpower 21 Sub-Committee on the Workplace

Environment is studying how flexible work arrangement  could  be

promoted.    Flexible   work  arrangement   will   enable   some

Singaporeans to move away from the traditional office or factory

floor  in  a knowledge-based economy where individuals can  also

work  productively  and creatively and make their  contribution.

The  recommendations of the Manpower 21 Sub-Committee  would  be

released in the middle of this year.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the past year had turned out to be a watershed year

for  the Asia-Pacific region.  It was indeed a horrible year  of

unprecedented upheavels and unmitigated turmoil.  The region has

not seen anything like this before in the post-war era.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaders are helpless and hapless. People are at a loss.

People  are angry and frustrated.  Nations are in search of  new

destinies.  Almost the whole region is at sea, so to speak, in a

sea of troubles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strategic situation in the region has changed. The

balance  of power has shifted.  There are new paradigms  in  the

strategic  situation.   How  can  then  a  small  country,  like

Singapore,  position itself in this sea change, and  be  nimble,

not only to survive, but also to succeed and prosper?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask the Minister for an analysis of the strategic

situation in the region.  What would be the interests, roles and

impact  of  big  powers  like the United  States,  the  People's

Republic of China, Japan, and the European Community as a whole,

on  our region?  What meaningful roles can Singapore, as a small

country,  play  to  help promote stability  and  growth  in  the

region?

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, in the ASEAN region, the past year

had   been  dominated  by  important  changes  in  the  domestic

political  situation.  Succession issues, reform  movements  and

changes  of  governments  in  ASEAN  countries  seemed  to  have

conspired to bring a situation of political instability to  some

of  our neighbouring countries.  These issues have worsened  the

economic problems that these countries are already facing  as  a

result  of the recession.  Governments which already have  their

hands  full dealing with the fragile economies now have also  to

carefully manage domestic political problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pushed, so to speak, to a corner by the turn of events,

some  of  these  governments have responded by falling  back  on

domestic  issues as their number one priority.  Foreign  affairs

now appear to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>

have  taken a back seat.  In cases where foreign affairs matters

were raised, these have been used to advance domestic agendas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The downgrading of the foreign policy agenda by certain

ASEAN  governments  may  lead to questions  over  the  state  of

regional   security.   For  instance,  the  collective   defence

arrangement,   the   Five-Power  Defence   Arrangements   (FPDA)

exercise,  had  to be postponed last year.  The  Spratlys  issue

remains  unresolved and a potential flash  point.   On  a  wider

plane,  regional  instability can arise  over  China's  negative

reactions  to  the US-Japan cooperation on the  Theatre  Missile

Defence system.  An ASEAN less focused on external security  and

fragmented by bilateral squabbles would not be able  to  give  a

firm  collective  response to security challenges.   This  could

lead to a lowering of stability and security in our region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this backdrop, I would like to ask the Minister for

Foreign  Affairs  what  the Government  views  as  the  regional

security challenges in the next few years, and what steps  would

be taken to secure Singapore's interests in this context.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, very often, regional stability is contributed by a

good  network of bilateral relations.  Singapore wishes to have,

and must maintain, good relations with its neighbours.  Of late,

or  rather  from time to time, these relations are put  to  test

when we face bilateral hiccups, for example, with Indonesia  and

Malaysia.  We have been called names and accused of insincerity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia, in particular, has called on us not to be just a

"fair-weather  friend".   This  remark  has  arisen   over   its

perception that our offer of bilateral trade financing and other

economic  assistance had not been forthcoming.  We must maintain

a   bilateral   relation  that  is  based  on  mutual   respect,

irrespective of size, and mutual support.  However, even  if  we

see  strains in our relations, we should always maintain an open

communication  channel.  Could the Minister tell  us  about  the

progress in our relations with Indonesia, including the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>

current  status  of our offer of the bilateral  trade  financing

scheme?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to relations with Malaysia, what is the

prospect  of  us  settling bilateral issues in  a  comprehensive

manner?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (In Mandarin) :</b> Sir, some years ago,

when  I  visited Washington DC, I was staying at  a  hotel  near

Chinatown.   It  was  about  two  or  three  streets  away  from

Chinatown.   I was warned by the Hotel's front desk receptionist

not  to walk around in this capital city by myself as it was not

quite  safe  to  do so.  Even if I were to go to  Chinatown,  it

would  be  dangerous.  So I heeded his advice and  took  a  taxi

instead.   While  I was in the taxi, I struck up a  conversation

with  the taxi driver.  When he heard that I was from Singapore,

he  immediately  praised the Singapore Government  for  imposing

caning  on an American youth for vandalism.  He felt that  there

should  be  similar laws in the United States to keep the  crime

rate down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, when I went to New York, I visited a friend

who  was  working at the UN.  There, my American friend and  his

colleagues  held the same view as that of the taxi  driver,  ie,

they  felt that the Government has many good policies.  But when

the   international  media reported the matter,  they  described

Singapore as being run by a dictatorial government which had  no

respect  for human rights and which was in the habit of imposing

heavy  penalties at random.  Eventually they had to trouble  the

American President to plea for a reduction in the penalty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On other occasions, I have also come across businessmen,

journalists, and friends from other countries who told  me  that

life  in  Singapore was not as restricted as  reflected  in  the

negative reports of the media in their countries.  They remarked

that  in  Singapore, whenever they needed any  information  they

could get it almost instantaneously, and one could walk out into

the streets at night safely without fear of being mobbed, unlike

in other major

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>

cities in the world where you go out at your own risk.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, I feel that there is room for improvement in the

way  Singapore handles its international public relations  work.

Whenever the international media criticise our policies, we  can

request  our friendly foreign media to carry some honest reports

on  the  truth  of  the matter.  Back home, of  course,  we  can

publish  articles  to clarify the matter, but  we  should  avoid

blowing  our own trumpet.  Let other people say the good  things

about us.  The effect will be better, and it can hit the nail on

its  head. For example, we can interview the taxi driver I  have

mentioned earlier, or these people working in UN, and report  on

their views.  Publicity wise, this can  be more convincing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our missions overseas should do some public relations work

from time to time.  As a matter of fact, this is part and parcel

of   their  job.  However,  we  must  step  up  our  efforts  in

cultivating  relationship with the foreign  media,  particularly

the  influential ones.  It is said that personal  contact  gives

you  a  headstart in building up relationship.  We  should  make

every  effort to get to know them better.  We may want to engage

PR consultants to teach us how to improve our image, or to place

some advertisements on these media.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this high-tech era, billions of people surf the Internet

every  day.  We can post more information and statistics on  the

Net  in  some  interesting format for people from all  over  the

world to access.  For example, we can show our crime rate vis-a-vis  that of other major cities in the world.  We can also  give

some  information on the ratio of prison inmates  to  our  total

population  as  compared to other countries, the  percentage  of

citizens owning their own homes, and in our schools what is  the

ratio  between  students  and computers,  etc.   We  could  also

emphasise the significant deterrent effects of death penalty  on

drug trafficking, and that more and more countries are beginning

to  emulate  us  in this aspect.  We can put all  these  on  the

Internet.   So  anyone who is educated and  who  is  intelligent

enough will be able to form his or her own

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>

judgement  on whether Singapore's way of governing is the  right

way,  and  whether there is any infringement of human rights  in

any of our policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not mean to say that the international

perception  of Singapore is poor.  However, Singapore  is  after

all,  a tiny little nation. People from time to time would  like

to find fault with us,  particularly when the media have to play

up  some news to win readership and make more money.  So long as

we  do not sing praises of ourselves every day, resulting in our

having  to  defend ourselves vigorously at critical moments  and

cause  people from all quarters to lose confidence in us,  there

is  no  harm  in  doing some public relations  work  to  further

improve our image internationally.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, Singapore and Malaysia are close

neighbours,  with  a long history of relationship,  having  been

subject  to the same British colonial rule.  And the  two  close

neighbours  have a fair share of ups and downs in  this  complex

web of relationship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask the Minister for an update on the recent

developments  in  our  bilateral  relationships  with  Malaysia,

especially  in view of the MFA press statement of 19th  February

1999,  stating that the Malaysian Government had met Singapore's

concerns  over the sovereignty and other legal issues pertaining

to the Malaysian CIQ presence in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singaporean and Malaysian teams have met, I understand,

on  the  package of outstanding issues.  May I ask what are  the

issues  in this "package"?  When would the two teams meet again?

What is the Minister's assessment of the discussion, and can  we

expect  a  speedy  and successful resolution to  these  on-going

negotiations?

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, in the last two years, Singapore-Malaysia relations have been through many rough patches. And it

takes  no  small effort to keep track of the bewildering  swings

and turns that add confusion to critical issues such as the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>

Points  of  Agreement  (POA) and Malaysia's  CIQ  facilities  in

Tanjong Pagar.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the POA, it would be helpful if the Minister for Foreign

Affairs could update the House on its latest status.  What would

happen  to the POA and the provisions contained in the  original

document,  after the new once-and-for-all package settlement  of

all  outstanding  bilateral  issues mooted  by  Malaysian  Prime

Minister  Dr Mahathir and concurred by Prime Minister  Goh  Chok

Tong last December?  Will there be a new package agreement drawn

up  between  the two governments?  And how can Singapore  ensure

that  any new agreement drawn up will not again be subjected  to

the kind of contentions and disputes that afflict the POA, which

is  an  official  document  signed  between  Singapore  and  the

Malaysian government?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Prime Ministers have not attached a deadline or

timeframe  on the conclusion of the package deal.  While  we  do

realise  that  a package deal of such magnitude  should  not  be

rushed, it would not serve in the interest of either country  to

do  a  marathon  with the package.  Would MFA  consider  putting

forward  to  its Malaysian counterparts a reasonable  time-table

that  maps out in phases the discussions and settlements of  the

respective  issues, so that both sides can arrive at  a  package

deal in good time?

<br>4.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, the operation of a CIQ

facility  at Tanjong Pagar by the Malaysian authorities  has  in

the  last  year been a thorn in the bilateral relations  between

Singapore  and  Malaysia.  If you recall,  Sir,  our  Government

moved  our  CIQ facility to Woodlands last year.   The  move  to

Woodlands  has created an anomaly for the Malaysian  authorities

as  the  Malaysian officers at the Tanjong Pagar Railway Station

would  be operating as a result of our move to Woodlands without

the  presence  of  Singapore officers to lend  it  authority  or

power, including the powers of arrest, search and seizure.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we wanted the Malaysians to co-locate with us, the

Malaysian authorities decided to remain at Tanjong Pagar Railway

Station  and  had claimed a legal right to do so.   In  view  of

their  claim, we have asked the Malaysian authorities to  submit

their legal arguments to support their position.  Deadlines were

agreed upon.  However, the Malaysian government was not able  to

keep to the deadline and had repeatedly requested for extensions

of  time  to  which  Singapore responded positively.   The  last

deadline  was  in  February  this  year  wherein  the  Malaysian

government gave a reply to the Singapore Government and from the

reports  in the papers, our Government seems satisfied with  the

reply given.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we note that Dr Mahathir on 18th December 1998 had

indicated that he wanted to resolve all outstanding issues  with

Singapore in a package deal.  These deals include not  only  the

CIQ facility at Tanjong Pagar Railway Station but also the other

issues, which include the withdrawal of CPF funds by Malaysians,

the  use of airspace and of course our water supply.  As far  as

the  CIQ  issue is concerned, we were at a point where  we  were

awaiting the Malaysian government to revert with legal arguments

to  back  their claim of a right to remain at the Tanjong  Pagar

Railway Station.  So when the Malaysian Foreign Ministry gave  a

reply  and  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced  that  the

reply  has met with their concern and are now prepared  to  move

forward  and  negotiate  with  the  Malaysian  government  on  a

comprehensive package to deal with all outstanding  issues,  our

people were naturally curious about the nature of the reply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like my colleagues before me, could the Minister

please elaborate in what way has the reply met with our concerns

on the sovereignty and other legal issues?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chiam is not here. Dr Wang Kai Yuen.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, I too would like to ask the

Minister what is the status of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>

the  package  approach proposed by the Malaysian  government  to

resolve the issues between Singapore and Malaysia.  Furthermore,

I  would be interested to find out Singapore's position  on  the

Malaysian proposal to build a bridge to replace the Causeway.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the press reports, Sir, one gets the impression that

Singapore is neutral towards this proposal.  We neither  propose

nor  do  we endorse this idea.  Our position seems to be waiting

for  more  information.   I  think  Singaporeans  will  be  very

interested  to find out the pros and cons of a bridge  over  the

Causeway.  In other words, conceptually, would the bridge  serve

Singapore's interest better?  One positive effect in my mind  is

that  pollutants in the Straits of Johor could be  flushed  away

and  the Singapore shore front facing the Straits of Johor  will

become  a  more desirable place to live.  So this  is  only  one

aspect  of  the issues.  Perhaps, the Minister could give  us  a

more detailed evaluation of this proposal.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, Malaysia is our closest neighbour,

both  geographically and historically.  We were part of the same

family  but because of differences, we parted company.   We  are

now both independent and sovereign.  I was a little puzzled last

year  when  I  was  in  Malaysia.   One  leader  suggested  that

Singapore  should treat Malaysia as a big brother.  I  think  in

any  international relationship, it is very important to get our

bearings correct.  As a Malay saying goes sak sama, we  must  be

at the same level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is an independent sovereign country. We have our

own  policies.  They have their own policies.  We do not believe

in   interfering  with  their  relationship.   They  should  not

interfere with our relationship.  It is in the interest of  both

countries  to cooperate with each other.  Singapore  has  always

offered  its hand of friendship to Malaysia.  I believe that  we

should  not  score  points  through either  media  or  political

organisation.   Let  us not debate openly our  differences.   We

should  talk  to  each  other  regularly.   Our  Ministers  meet

regularly.  A pet topic of Mr Chiam See Tong, who is  not  here,

has been an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>

economic  union.  In his absence, may I say that I am in  favour

of  close economic cooperation although I do not know whether it

is feasible for us to have an economic union now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the Minister to clarify what is the

position about the water situation.  Where are we now?  On  CIQ,

other  Members have spoken and the House is interested  to  know

where  we have reached the negotiation at this stage.  I believe

that  the  question  of CIQ should not be  delayed  unduly.   We

should come to terms with our differences, and I would urge  the

Minister  to  impress  upon his Malaysian  counterpart  that  we

should have a fruitful conclusion as early as possible.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,

Singapore-Malaysia relations have always been described  as  one

of  "close  neighbours" but I think sometimes this  may  not  be

appropriate  because even if you have irreconcilable differences

with  your close neighbours, you can always sell your house  and

move  elsewhere.  Some have described our relations  as  husband

and wife, but here, again, you can always get a divorce, move on

and lead separate lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our relationship with Malaysia goes beyond that. We cannot

change the geography of our region.  We will always be together,

bound  by  common history and an interdependent economy,  strong

social  and  family  ties.  Yet, political relationship  remains

stressful  and continues to be so.  It has been very  unsettling

to  many  Singaporeans to observe how quickly and easily  issues

like CIQ can be linked to unrelated political points, especially

on the sale of water by Malaysia to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The practice of linking different issues when conducting

bilateral issues is well known for dragging out disputes.  ASEAN

has  always stood for non-linkage.  Malaysia has frequently told

the  West  not  to  link  rights  with  environment,  trade   or

investments.  Thus when Singapore expects water or land or other

issues not to be dragged to discussions on CIQ, it is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>

not  out  of  some unique Singaporean tendency but  based  on  a

principle that Malaysia too recognises very well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that this principle of non-linkage should extend

to players as well as to issues; the present dispute between the

two  governments is no reason why the rest of the society should

turn  unfriendly towards each other.  This, after all, is  very,

very far from the state of war.  On the scale of bilateral ties,

it is but a disagreement over a small number of complex issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ties between Singapore and Malaysia have always been, and

will  always  consist  of  more than  just  political  relations

between two governments.  Inter-governmental relations are  just

one  of  the many deep and abiding links between the peoples  of

our  countries.  Those links extend from the realm  of  business

and  economics to the private and domestic with families  having

members on both sides of the border.  Culturally, no country  is

more similar to Singapore than Malaysia is and the commonalities

of  language,  food, values and lifestyles continue  to  persist

even  after  three decades of separate development.  Today,  the

two  countries' identities are distinct enough for their peoples

to feel a strong sense of nationhood but also similar enough for

there  to  be a high level of comfort in day-to-day,  people-to-people relations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that civic groups and non-governmental

organisations on either side of the border have a  special  role

to  play  in  re-emphasising the broader  nature  of  Singapore-Malaysia  relations.  It is only when both people  have  a  deep

awareness  of the values of their close relationship  that  both

sides  will  have  the  necessary commitment  to  resolve  their

disputes calmly and rationally, with due consideration given  to

each other's feelings.  Once those disputes are settled, it will

again  be  this  broader relationship that helps both  countries

achieve our hopes and dreams together.  This would mean the need

for  Singaporeans  to  be  mindful  of  Malaysia's  feelings  in

negotiations.   Similarly, it is naturally for  Singaporeans  to

expect their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>

own feelings to be weighed when Malaysia chooses their words and

actions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans should be well aware of the vibrant political

climate in Malaysia where political rhetoric is part and  parcel

of political life.  This understanding helps Singaporeans to put

comments  in  their place and not to over-react  to  them  in  a

paranoid manner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Singapore cannot be totally immune to such

provocation.  Even if rhetoric is mainly for domestic  Malaysian

consumption, the speakers must know that their words  are  heard

in Singapore, as much as ours will be heard in Malaysia and must

know  how  critical a resource, water, for example, is  for  our

survival, and ensure that statements on the sale of water do not

cause any insensitive or unfriendly attitude.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was noticeable during the negotiations on CIQ that the

Singapore  Government,  perhaps  tired  of  the  ever   changing

position,  hardened its stand on the issue which leads  to  many

Singaporeans  to say that we should have been more flexible  and

less rigid and less legalistic in our negotiations and that  the

complex  issues  could be resolved if younger political  leaders

had good relations with their Malaysian political leaders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view that our style of government is

essentially  different.  It may be the cause of  some  political

problems  but  it  is far better to be consistent  and  let  the

Malaysians understand that we have a style, system and political

culture of our own, certainly different and sometimes perhaps at

odds with the Malaysians.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domestic issues in Malaysia will continue to be a major

factor  in  our  bilateral relations.   While  good  and  strong

political  relationship  is useful, I sometimes  doubt  if  this

could alter the course of the complex bilateral issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must still continue to pursue and develop strong

relations at all levels and this is why I call on the Government

to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>

re-establish sports, cultural, social and civic ties  that  were

frozen  earlier.  Prior to that, these ties have for  very  long

been  very  much a feature of our relationship and has  provided

for  deeper,  meaningful, lasting and more  stable  relationship

between  these  two friendly countries that  we  so  aspire  and

deserve.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chong is not speaking. Dr Ong.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, Singapore's relationship with

Indonesia  has  undergone many changes since  President  Suharto

stepped  down from office.  We want to be a friend of Indonesia.

Singapore  and  Indonesia  can  work  together  in  a   mutually

beneficial relationship, in a win-win situation in the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, over the last few months, we have heard

accusations,  one  kind or the other, hurled at  us  by  various

Indonesian  leaders and officials, including President  Habibie,

his  adviser,  Dr Dewi Fortuna Anwar, and Cooperatives  Minister

Adi  Sasono.  These accusations have ranged from Singapore being

"too  business-minded", according to Mr Adi Sasono, to  being  a

"fair  weather friend", according to Dr Dewi Fortuna  Anwar,  to

being "racist", as alleged by President Habibie.  What does  the

Minister have to say about the state of bilateral relations  and

how  does  he see the future development of bilateral  relations

between   the  two  countries  in  the  context  of  all   these

accusations?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to comment on the role that the Ministry

of  Foreign Affairs played in assisting the departure  of  large

numbers of Singaporeans from Indonesia during the height of  the

May  riots in Indonesia last year.  We had then read on a  daily

basis  about  the  deteriorating situation in various  parts  of

Indonesia  and how our MFA officials helped various Singaporeans

to get out in time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must commend and thank the MFA officials and diplomats

for  extending  such timely and much appreciated  assistance  to

Singaporeans.  Many Singaporeans

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>

with  families  and friends there, I am sure, will  join  us  in

thanking MFA and the diplomats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of our regionalisation efforts to set up a second

wing, many Singaporeans have no choice but are still working  in

Indonesia.   I would therefore like to ask the Minister  whether

any  steps  or  plans  have been put  in  place  to  ensure  the

protection  and safety of our own Singaporeans in  Indonesia  in

any new unexpected turn of event in the country.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, we have seen that the economic

crisis  has  had its terrible toll on the people in the  region.

The  full impact of the crisis is now beginning to show in  some

places  and is expressly more pronounced in countries which  are

more severely affected by it.  I believe that Indonesia is worst

hit  by  the  crisis and the tremendous social  cost  is  biting

deeper into the society.  On a regular basis, we hear stories of

families  in Indonesia having to stop sending their children  to

school  because of a lack of money or having to cut down on  the

level  of  food consumption because there is not  enough  to  go

around.   Sickness is often tolerated than cured because  people

are  without  the  means to seek medical  treatment  or  to  buy

medicine.  As a result of the crisis, many people have  suffered

and  are  suffering.   The suffering is beginning  to  feed  the

irrational   sentiments  that  are  often  based  on  primordial

instincts of race and religion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, in Singapore, are very concerned for the welfare of our

Indonesian   friends  and  would  like  to   provide   as   much

humanitarian aid as we can to relieve their suffering.   It  was

therefore, with great gratitude and relief, that the  Red  Cross

Society  in  Singapore and some other civic  organisations  have

initiated  humanitarian aid for the needy people  in  Indonesia.

Providing  the assistance for Indonesian friends at this  moment

would  also  send a positive signal that we are more  than  just

fair-weather friends.  Within our resources, we hope  that  such

efforts will continue to seal the friendship which was forged in

the decades after we became independent.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I would like to ask the Minister for

Foreign  Affairs whether the Ministry will consider  encouraging

initiating  further  humanitarian aid  to  Indonesians  who  are

severely affected by the present crisis in their country.  As  a

country,  we  want to extend our sincere feelings of  friendship

and  concern and we would like to help offer humanitarian relief

in  any  way  we can.  We may be a small red dot in the  sea  of

green.  However, we want to be a dot that is a beacon that shows

the  way  for  humanitarian  relief for  our  fellow  South-east

Asians.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, Indonesia is our close neighbour

whom  we  have strong historical ties.  Indonesia has  been  our

important  trading  partner and I hope that it  will  still  be.

What has been happening in Indonesia is saddening.  The economic

crisis  she  is  going  through, we hope,  will  be  over  soon.

Indonesia's  founding  father has been a firm  believer  in  the

principle of Pancasila.  Both Singapore and Indonesia are in the

forefront  of  the non-aligned movement.  Singapore  has  always

been  mindful  of Indonesia's situation, and has  done  whatever

help,  both at the people and Government level, to the  country.

Singapore  has  conducted her relationship with Indonesia  in  a

very  courteous  and  considerate manner.   Singapore  does  not

believe in interfering in other countries' affairs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is saddening to note recently that some

Indonesian  leaders have started making reference to  Singapore,

and  what is more sad to see is that a very important fabric  of

our   Government   structure  is  being  questioned,   ie,   our

meritocracy  policies.   I  hope and pray  that  the  Indonesian

leaders will stop making future comments on this because it will

affect   our  relationship  with  them.   Singapore  has  always

believed  in  meritocracy and it is because of this policy  that

our civil service and armed forces have been a model for others.

I  hope  the Minister will convey to his counterpart in  a  very

polite manner that we should keep each other's relationship at a

level  as is required in an international  relationship and  not

to  interfere with each other's affairs.  Finally, Sir, I  think

Members of this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>

House  will agree with me that we hope that Indonesia's economic

crisis will be over soon because it is in our interest to have a

prosperous Indonesia.  A prosperous Indonesia means a prosperous

Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, Singapore-Indonesia

relations,  which were once described as strong and solid,  have

now become unpredictable.  Despite years of friendly cooperation

and  mutual help, we now learn that past deeds and even goodwill

are no guarantee to future relationships.  Indonesia will remain

turbulent for some time.  Our relationship will continue  to  be

uncertain,  sometimes potentially volatile.  Many  in  Indonesia

felt  that Singapore can do more to help them ease the  pain  of

the   economic  crisis.   We  have  made  offers  of   financial

assistance in terms of trade financing and humanitarian aid  but

considering  the scale of the problem, our help  will  never  be

enough.  But that is where our problem will be.  So long  as  we

are  seen  to  be  more  prosperous than  our  neighbours,  less

affected than others in the region, and yet heavily dependent on

the  countries  around us, we will always  have  to  manage  the

expectations of having to do more to help our neighbours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, we must try very hard to continue giving

humanitarian aid as conditions in Indonesia continue  to  remain

difficult.   We  must do as much as we can to support  the  good

work done by the Singapore Red Cross Society.  Defence relations

with  Indonesia will remain the key to a more stable  friendship

and  must be maintained at the highest level.  I am prompted  to

bring  the  example  of General Winston Choo,  who  through  his

personal   and  long  relationship  with  military  leaders   in

Indonesia,  has  been effective in dealing with the  potentially

difficult  issues of humanitarian aid especially when  political

relationship with Indonesia was somewhat fractured by  the  fall

of  Soeharto.  In this instance, strong defence relationship has

managed  to  fill the vacuum and gap of political  relationship.

There is also another reason for strong defence relationship

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>

with  Indonesia.  The economic crisis has made it difficult  for

many countries in the region to continue with the rapid military

expansion  plans  which  were very much  noticeable  during  the

period   of  strong  economic  growth.   Singapore's  consistent

defence  expenditure policy, compared to the  feast  and  famine

situation  of our neighbours, can be problematic.  Some  may  be

misunderstood into thinking that Singapore is engaged or  taking

the  opportunity to be engaged in an arms race.  To  avoid  this

perception, we must enhance defence cooperation through  regular

military  exercises and exchange.  We should increase visits  of

Indonesian politicians and military leaders so that they have  a

good  view  of our position in Singapore. Creating  goodwill  by

better understanding, knowing and helping our neighbours must be

made  part  and parcel of this renewed commitment to  be  better

friends of Indonesia.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b>

Sir, I wish to  first reply to the colleagues who have spoken on

the  strategic  situation in Asia, then I will  comment  on  the

relations with Malaysia and Indonesia, respond to comments  made

on international perception by Mr Chuang.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, two Members asked about the strategic situation in

our  region.  I will start off first by saying that there is  no

doubt   that  the  economic  crisis  has  altered  the  regional

strategic  landscape.   Many  economies  have  been  devastated,

triggering  off political instability in several countries.   In

this  situation,  we in Singapore have to be alert  to  possible

instability  in  the  region  and  be  prepared  for   political

upheaval.   In  Indonesia, the political  and  social  situation

continues to be uncertain.  What happens there undoubtedly  will

have  a  significant  impact on regional stability,  as  several

Members  mentioned.  Having said that, let me also say that  the

prognosis  is  not entirely gloomy.  And I think there  is  some

basis  for  cautious  optimism when we  look  at  the  strategic

picture  as  a whole.  The fundamentals and infrastructure  that

made possible three decades of growth are still there.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the triangular relationship between United

States,  China  and  Japan is concerned, we can  say  that  this

remains fairly stable.  If it were not so, the situation can  be

worse.   Stability in the triangular relationship will  continue

to  provide the basic foundation for peace and security  in  the

region.    Asia's   recovery  will  in  fact  depend   on   this

relationship holding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the United States-China relations, which is an important

part of this triangular relationship, in the first half of 1998,

we saw that it was stabilising at a comfortable pace.  Following

President  Jiang Zemin's visit to the US in November  1997,  and

President Clinton's return visit in June 1998, this demonstrated

the  United  States' commitment to constructively engage  China.

But  there  are  now signs of traditional problems  resurfacing.

These  include United States' concerns over China's human rights

record,  the  widening  trade  deficit,  and  the  transfer   of

sensitive  technology.  Underlying differences have  once  again

been  brought to the fore.  We hope that there would  not  be  a

downturn in US-China relations as had happened in 1996.  Because

that certainly would not be in the interest of either party, and

it  would  not be in the interest of the region as a whole.   We

hope  that  United States-China relations can settle on  a  more

even  keel after Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to the United States

next month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On United States-Japan relations, the United States sought

closer  ties  with  China, there was a  perception  that  United

States-Japan  relations suffered a slide.  Japan, some  analysts

said,  was  concerned  that the warming of US-China  ties  could

undermine  the  US-Japan Security Alliance.  However,  following

President Clinton's visit to Japan in November 1998, it restored

relations to an even keel. Notwithstanding friction in  economic

and  trade  issues, the US-Japan relationship remains  the  most

stable leg in the triangular relationship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China-Japan relations is the other part of the triangular

relationship.   China  remains high on  Japan's  foreign  policy

agenda.   President Jiang Zemin made an historic state visit  to

Japan in November

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>

1998,  the first by a Chinese Head of State.  However,  it  will

take   time  for  the  two  countries  to  completely   overcome

traditional   mutual   suspicions  and   to   forge   a   closer

relationship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in Singapore's interest to have the three major

players constructively engaged and their triangular relationship

strengthened.  This will ensure a stable and peaceful balance of

power  in  the region. As Members know, Singapore has reiterated

the   importance  of  continued  US  presence  in  the   region,

especially   during  the  present  difficult  times.    Internal

domestic  changes  in  each of the powers, including  China,  we

believe, will have an impact on their relations with each  other

and the triangular relationship as a whole.  A China that lapses

into  serious  trouble,  because of an inability  to  cope  with

internal   economic   and   social  problems,   obviously   will

drastically alter the regional strategic landscape.  An unstable

China  is not in the interest of the other major powers nor  the

region as a whole.  Japan is undergoing major long-term economic

and  structural  reforms and her efforts should  be  recognised,

although  the results will take time to show.  As  for  the  US,

notwithstanding  a foreign policy increasingly  subject  to  the

stresses  and strains of domestic political considerations,  the

US must show global leadership.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung also mentioned about Europe. Singapore

welcomes  a  stronger European engagement  in  the  region.   We

believe  that Europe should complement its economic  involvement

in the region with a greater strategic presence.  This will help

to  promote regional stability and security and assist in Asia's

economic  recovery.  I might add that at the end of this  month,

Asian   Foreign  Ministers  will  be  meeting  European  Foreign

Ministers  in the Asia-Europe Foreign Ministers' meeting  to  be

held in Berlin and we expect a good discussion to take place  at

that time.

<br>4.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me touch on the other aspects of the strategic

situation  in  Asia.  First, cross-strait atmospherics  improved

with the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>

Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Khoo Chen-fu's  visit

to  China  last  October.   The scheduled  visit  to  Taiwan  of

Association  for  Relations Across the Taiwan's Straits  (ARATS)

Chairman could lay the path for further progress in cross-Strait

relations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nuclear tests in the Indian sub-continent in May 1998

are a reminder to all of us that balance of powers, even outside

the  major  ones, remains a delicate issue.  The  recent  summit

between  the  two Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan  can  be

seen as an encouraging sign of rapprochement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in North Korea continues to be a very real

potential flashpoint.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members also referred to the territorial disputes in the

South  China Sea.  Singapore is not a claimant state.   But  the

recent Mischief Reef incident is the latest in a  string of such

less-than-friendly encounters between the claimant  states.   It

highlights the need to maintain safe passage through  the  major

sea-lanes  in the region.  Freedom of navigation and  access  to

sea-lanes is crucial, not only for economic development but also

for a stable security environment in the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mischief Reef incident has also demonstrated the

importance  of  resolving disputes through  peaceful  means  and

substantive  progress towards resolving contentious  issues,  of

course, will take time, but the atmosphere of discussions has at

least improved markedly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case in reply to the Chairman of the GPC, these

uncertainties  underscore the importance of a  continued  United

States' presence in the region.  Singapore also regards the Five

Power  Defence Arrangement (FPDA) as an important  component  of

the  regional security architecture.  In this regard, the recent

decision  to resume the scheduled FPDA exercises is  a  positive

development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I were to sum up, Sir, there are tentative signs of

economic recovery,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>

but developments in the region remain in a state of flux.  It is

difficult to predict how the region's political equilibrium  and

security environment will eventually take shape, although the US-China-Japan triangular relationship will likely be stable in the

near  term.   But we have to be alert to emerging  and  changing

trends  in  the  region, and to act in ways to best  secure  our

national interests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung asked how Singapore can position itself.

We  are  a small country, but Singapore continues to do what  we

can.  As Chairman of the ASEAN Standing Committee, our objective

will  be  to  keep ASEAN together and to ensure it  maintains  a

steady  course  in difficult times.  We will also  play  a  role

together with other members in forums such as the ASEAN Regional

Forum,   Asia-Europe  Meetings  as  well   as   ASEAN   dialogue

relationships with China, US and Japan to ensure that these  key

countries   continue  to  place  importance  in   the   dialogue

relationship as well as their involvement and engagement in  the

region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I now go on to comments made by colleagues on

Malaysia-Singapore   relations?   This  House   last   discussed

Malaysia-Singapore relations on 29th June 1998. At that time,  I

updated the House on the progress of the various items under the

Joint  Communique  issued after Prime Minister  Goh's  visit  to

Kuala  Lumpur in February last year.  At that time, I reiterated

that  we  were committed to forging a long-term relationship  of

mutual benefit with Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members have noted, since then our relations with

Malaysia  have  seen many ups and downs.  We ran  into  a  rough

patch  with  the  CIQ  issue  in July  1998,  when  we  rejected

Malaysia's claim to any legal right to locate its CIQ facilities

in  Tanjong  Pagar.  In July last year, I briefed the  House  at

length  on the background to the issue, and subsequently updated

the  House  on  fresh developments in October 1998  and  January

1999.   I  will  refer  to  this matter  later.   In  September,

following  the  furore  in Malaysia over the  launch  of  Senior

Minister's memoirs, Malaysia, without

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>

prior  notification,  unilaterally  revoked  RSAF's  access   to

Malaysian airspace given under earlier agreements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said before, Singapore and Malaysia are

really  bound by a multiplicity of complex ties, a  point  which

more  than  one Member underscored.  Therefore, any  such  close

relationship  inevitably  must  go  through  different   phases.

Therefore, we must expect ups and downs from time to  time.   As

two  countries which are so close to each other, we  compete  as

well  as cooperate to advance our national interests.  But  what

is important is that we do not lose sight of the central fact of

our  interdependence.  Singapore, on its part, is  committed  to

forging  a  long-term  mutually  beneficial  relationship   with

Malaysia,  and  we will manage bilateral ties on  the  basis  of

reciprocity and mutual respect for each other's interests.   And

this  point about mutuality and reciprocity was also alluded  to

by other Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, bilateral relations improved following the meetings

between  Prime  Minister  Goh and Dr Mahathir  in  November  and

December  last  year.  At that time, both Prime  Ministers  were

working towards concluding a mutually beneficial water agreement

in  return  for  our financial assistance to  Malaysia  under  a

framework of wider cooperation.  At their last meeting in  Hanoi

in  December  1998,  Dr Mahathir said that  Malaysia  no  longer

needed  financial  assistance from  Singapore.   This  has  been

reported.   Instead,  Dr Mahathir proposed  that  Singapore  and

Malaysia  could  begin  to  discuss  all  outstanding  bilateral

issues,  including the long-term supply of water  to  Singapore,

within an overall package.  Prime Minister Goh agreed to it  but

he  made  it clear that Malaysia still had to submit  its  legal

arguments  on the CIQ facilities first, before both sides  could

begin  negotiations  on the package. Both Prime  Ministers  then

agreed that the package would include issues like the withdrawal

of  West  Malaysian CPF funds, the long-term supply of water  to

Singapore,  KTMB land in Singapore, the RSAF's use of  Malaysian

airspace and the location of Malaysia's CIQ facilities.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I told this House on 20th January this year, we had

informed  the  Malaysians that before we could  proceed  to  the

negotiations  on the package, Malaysia would have  to  recognise

Singapore's sovereignty and not claim that it had a legal  right

to operate its CIQ in Singapore.  We had also informed them that

if  Malaysia  did not produce its written legal arguments  in  a

month's  time  from  20th January, Singapore would  assume  that

Malaysia no longer wished to pursue its legal claim to remain at

Tanjong Pagar.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 10th February 1999, we received a paper from Malaysia

which  clarified  their position on certain  issues.   In  their

paper,  Malaysia  did  not claim a legal right  to  operate  its

customs and immigration facilities in Singapore.  Together  with

the  Foreign  Minister Dato Seri Syed Hamid's public  statements

that  Malaysia had never questioned Singapore's sovereignty over

its   own  territory,  the  paper  met  our  concerns  over  the

sovereignty and other legal issues pertaining to Malaysia's  CIQ

operations in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We replied to Malaysia on 18th February 1999 that

Singapore's conclusion, after studying the Malaysian paper,  was

that  the  Malaysian government did not claim to  have  a  legal

right  to  operate  its  customs and immigration  facilities  in

Singapore;  that  it  acknowledged  that  these  operations   in

Singapore were by Singapore's agreement and consent; and that it

acknowledged  Singapore's sovereignty  over  Tanjong  Pagar  and

Woodlands.   We  informed  them  that,  on  the  basis  of  that

understanding,   Singapore  was  ready  to  proceed   with   the

negotiations on the package of outstanding issues, as agreed  by

the  two  Prime  Ministers in Hanoi.   In  this  connection,  we

invited them to suggest dates to begin the negotiations  on  the

package.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, in response, the Secretary-General of

Malaysia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposed to my  Permanent

Secretary that senior officials meet in Singapore on 11th  March

to  discuss  the  package.  As our understanding  of  Malaysia's

position was not disputed, we accepted Malaysia's

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>

proposal.  Accordingly, the first meeting between officials took

place last week on 11th March. At this first meeting, both sides

have  got  down  to  detailed discussions on the  items  in  the

package.  They have agreed to meet again in April.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realise that several Members who have spoken are

anxiously expecting me to give a lot of details about  what  has

happened  in that one day's discussions.  But I hope  they  will

appreciate that as the negotiations are still in progress, I  am

not  in a position at this stage to disclose the details of  the

discussions on any of the specific items.  We are negotiating to

arrive at a mutually beneficial outcome.  As Prime Minister  Goh

said  in  his  National Day Rally Speech last year, "both  sides

have much to gain by pragmatic win-win cooperation."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong raised the question about the status of

the POA.  And as a result of what he has said, I should make  it

clear so that Members would not misunderstand.  The fact that we

are  having these discussions on the package does not mean  that

agreements  that have been validly entered into  and  which  are

binding  have somehow lost their legal force.   That is not  so.

As  I  have told the House before, the POA is a legally  binding

agreement  and came into force immediately after it  was  signed

between  the  then  PM, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, and  Malaysian  Finance

Minister Tun Daim Zainudin in 1990.  However, Prime Minister Goh

has  said  that the Singapore Government is prepared to consider

Malaysia's  proposals to have supplementary  agreements  on  the

POA,  but  only  in  the context of a wider framework  or  wider

package  with Malaysia that includes Malaysia selling  water  to

Singapore  on  a  long term basis.  Therefore, the  decision  to

discuss the POA as part of the package of bilateral issues  does

not in any way affect the legal status of the POA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give an analogy. The bilateral discussions on the

package  include our request for extension of the 1961 and  1962

water agreements.  The fact that the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>

extension  of the water agreements is being discussed  does  not

mean  that the two agreements are in any way suspended.  And  if

the  package  deal does not produce results on the extension  of

the  water  agreements, the water agreements  will  continue  to

remain valid until their expiry dates.  I thought I should  make

that clear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, I think Mr Charles Chong and one or two other

Members  also  asked about the CIQ.  Likewise, the  Government's

position,  as I stated in the House on the status  of  the  CIQ,

remains  unchanged.   Members will recall that  I  explained  in

great  length  why  Malaysia's CIQ could not remain  in  Tanjong

Pagar  after  we had moved to Woodlands.  I also explained  that

when  Singapore's  CIQ  moved to Woodlands,  the  administrative

arrangements  and the legal cover for Malaysia to  exercise  CIQ

functions  in  Tanjong Pagar ceased.  Also, I mentioned  serious

problems which might be created concerning the improper sequence

of  immigration clearance, especially if passports were endorsed

at  Tanjong  Pagar.   However, because  Malaysia  at  that  time

claimed  a  legal  right for its customs to  remain  in  Tanjong

Pagar,  we  agreed,  as an interim measure, to  allow  Malaysian

customs to operate at Tanjong Pagar pending a resolution of  its

claim  by its Singapore customs officers lending cover of  legal

authority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, again in line with the agreement between the two

Prime Ministers in Hanoi to resolve the CIQ issue as part of the

package  of bilateral issues, Prime Minister Goh had  said  also

that  it  is  prepared to consider the question of the  possible

location  of the Malaysian CIQ in Singapore provided that  there

is an overall package agreement.  However, at that time, he said

we  must settle the issue of sovereignty and Malaysia's claim of

a  legal right before proceeding to the negotiations.  As I have

said,  we  are glad to have put the legal issues behind  us  and

have  moved on to the negotiations on the package of outstanding

issues.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>5.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A question was asked about the time frame and whether we

should  give a deadline.  I agree with the Member that a package

which  involves  so many issues and of such magnitude  obviously

cannot  be  rushed.  But I also think he is right that  if  both

sides are earnest, then it should not drag on indefinitely.   He

is  right.  But I believe that the officials are fully aware  of

this fact and they know that the two Prime Ministers expect them

to achieve early progress in their talks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong asked how do we ensure that these

agreements,  when they are reached as a result of  the  package,

will  be  respected  and  they  will  be  binding  international

agreements   with  full  force  of  validity   and   status   in

international  law,  and will be governed by international  law.

He  will recall that the Prime Minister has told the House  that

when  we spoke about loan and water arrangements, he would bring

it  to  Parliament.   I  know that it is  the  Prime  Minister's

intention  that  the  agreements, as a  result  of  the  package

negotiations,  would also be brought to this  House.   I  assume

that this will be done likewise in Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli Baharudin made some useful suggestions about

promoting  bilateral relations and, as a general principle,  one

would find it very difficult to disagree with him.  I agree with

him that civic organisations and NGOs have an important role  to

play.   Not only do I agree with him, it is important to  stress

that  in  diplomacy  and  the conduct  of  foreign  policy,  the

promotion  of bilateral relations is not the sole responsibility

and  preserve  of  the  Ministry of  Foreign  Affairs  or  Prime

Ministers  or  Foreign  Ministers.   Other   officials,  private

sector,  NGOs and civic groups also can supplement the  work  of

the Government agencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned re-establishing sports and cultural links, but

these  have  always existed.  The point I want to make  is  that

Singapore,  on  its part, has not made any move  to  stop  these

links.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may now go on to the points made by colleagues on

Indonesia.  Sir, last year on 1st June 1998, I informed  Members

that though Indonesia is in political transition, Singapore will

continue  to  work with Indonesia, both bilaterally  and  within

ASEAN,  to further strengthen relations to the benefit  of  both

countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have already pointed out that Singapore is

a  small  country  with limited means.  I  believe  Mr  Zulkifli

underscored  that point. We have limited means  to  resolve  the

magnitude  of  the  needs of Indonesians in  the  political  and

economic crisis.  When the crisis started, we sought the support

of  Indonesia's major trading partners for a Multilateral  Trade

Finance  Guarantee Scheme because we knew that we were not  able

to  do  it alone. As most of these countries preferred  to  have

their  own  bilateral  schemes, we did not pursue  the  proposal

further.   When  Indonesia  pressed us,  Singapore  subsequently

offered its own Bilateral Trade Financing Guarantee Scheme  with

diffidence  because we did not have the expertise in this  area.

The Indonesians found our scheme too cautious.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the economic crisis had caused hardships for the

people  of  Indonesia, Members know that Singapore announced  in

July  last year our humanitarian assistance package in the  form

of  rice  and  medicines.   Another phase  of  the  humanitarian

assistance  under this package will be launched  soon.   I  note

what Mr Sin Boon Ann has said, but since the current package  of

humanitarian assistance is not over, we will have to assess this

matter later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the current difficulties in Indonesia have not stopped

us from investing in Indonesia.  In January 1999, both countries

signed  an  agreement for the gas project in  the  West  Natunas

which is expected to generate revenues of about US$8 billion for

Indonesia.   This  project reflects the strong  commitment  from

Singapore   to   work  together  with  Indonesia   in   economic

cooperation amidst the on-going crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as with our other efforts to be of help, Singapore can

act as a catalyst to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>

bring  back foreign investments into Indonesia when the position

is  stabilised.   We  can  co-invest  with  big  MNCs  in  their

industrial  and  agricultural sector.  By ourselves,  we  cannot

make  a  significant  difference.   But  getting  big  MNCs   to

accompany   us  can  be  useful  in  restarting  the   flow   of

investments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Indonesia is undergoing a political transformation.

It  has to overcome deep economic, social and political problems

on   its  road  to  recovery.   Eventually,  they  will  restore

political stability and confidence.  But along the way, we  have

to  expect  stresses  and  strains that  will  affect  bilateral

relations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have indeed commented the fact that relations

between  Singapore and Indonesia are going through  a  difficult

period.   Various  Indonesian leaders and  officials  have  made

allegations and negative comments against Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is pointless for me to give a detailed

rebuttal of all the various allegations that have been  made  in

an  off-hand  manner  without  any  supporting  facts  to  these

allegations.   Let  me, however, restate that  Singapore  has  a

vested interest in Indonesia's stability, growth and prosperity.

Indonesia is a close neighbour and a major trading partner.   As

Mr   Rai  mentioned,  an  Indonesian  setback  would  hurt   its

neighbours, including Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On these criticisms, I can do no better than to refer to

the speech made by Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew on 20th February

1999  as well as Prime Minister Goh's comments made in Australia

recently.  Senior Minister Lee said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As the internal situations of the crisis-hit countries

worsened,  there have been more accusations and threats  against

Singapore.  When countries are under pressure, their leaders say

and do things that they normally would not.  We must expect more

of this."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the run-up to the Indonesian parliamentary elections in

June  1999, and the Presidential elections later this  year,  we

can expect more allegations to be directed

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>

against  us.   But  we  have to avoid  being  drawn  into  their

politics.  As Prime Minister Goh said, we should say the minimum

so  as to avoid giving any provocation.  Singapore would try  to

avoid being a party in Indonesia's domestic elections.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we hope that Indonesia will succeed in overcoming its

challenges   to  restore  political  certainty  and  confidence.

Stability in Indonesia will be the key factor.  In this  regard,

the  outcome  of  the  coming elections  in  Indonesia  will  be

critical.  It is important that the elections be seen to be free

and  fair.   Otherwise, it may prolong the political instability

and the loss of investor confidence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli touched on the importance of working relations

between  different agencies.  Let me say that, in the  meantime,

the  working relationship between Singapore Government  agencies

and  their Indonesian counterparts have not been affected by the

changes taking place there.  Cooperation in various fields, I am

glad  to say, is still going on.  For instance, my Ministry  has

continued  to work closely with DEPLU, which is their Indonesian

Foreign   Ministry,  both  bilaterally  and   at   the   various

international fora.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to reaffirm that the Singapore

Government is prepared to work with whoever becomes President of

Indonesia  and  forms the next government.   We  will  establish

rational  and  stable long-term relations with Indonesia  as  we

have  done in the past 30 years, a relationship based on  mutual

respect and equality between two independent countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe Dr Ong Chit Chung touched on the assistance given

to  Singaporeans caught in the crisis.  As a result of that,  he

asked  what is the nature of assistance which Singapore MFA  can

give.   I  thank him for what he has said about MFA.  It  was  a

combined   effort  between  MFA  and  various  other  Government

agencies.   But in answer to what else can be done, let  me  say

that  one of MFA's primary roles is to provide advice and assist

overseas Singaporeans when they are in trouble

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>

abroad, or they need our support and information.  This is quite

true,  particularly  as Dr Ong mentioned,  when  more  and  more

Singaporeans are travelling and residing overseas, either due to

their own efforts or because of our own regionalisation efforts.

Let me say that all our overseas missions have contingency plans

to   meet   various  exigencies.   Wherever  there   are   large

concentrations  of Singaporeans, we also put in place  a  warden

system  to  facilitate speedy communications among Singaporeans,

especially   during   emergency  situations,   such   as   civil

disturbances  or  natural disasters.  Under the  warden  system,

Singaporeans  are  organised  into  groupings  based  on   their

geographical  localities with wardens or leaders  appointed  for

each  group.  This system proves very effective in Cambodia when

over  400  Singaporeans were successfully  evacuated.   We  also

activated   the   warden  system  for  evacuating   some   2,000

Singaporeans  who  were  flown  back  from  Indonesia  with  the

cooperation of SIA at that time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Chuang's point on international perception of

Singapore,  I  take Mr Chuang's point that MFA and its  overseas

missions  should do as much as possible (a) to counter  negative

perceptions,   unfounded  allegations   and   criticisms   about

Singapore; and (b) to be proactively promoting a positive  image

about  Singapore.  In fact, this is one of the key functions  of

our missions abroad.  But as he himself has noted, Singapore  is

a  small  country.   We  have less than  30  resident  embassies

throughout the world.  But every one of our embassies knows  the

critical importance of doing this.

<br>5.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also talked about the use of the Internet. I agree

with  him  on  the  growing importance of the Internet  and  its

usefulness as a tool to explain our policies to Singaporeans and

foreigners.   And  MFA,  in fact, has  recognised  the  need  to

provide the latest information to an ever more discerning public

through  this  media.  He may not know that, in  fact,  MFA  has

revamped its home page last June

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>

providing  for  more  timely release of  our  press  statements,

speeches, and so forth.  The site is now more user-friendly  and

averages over 200,000 hits every month.  We have encouraged  our

overseas  missions to publish their home pages so that they  can

be more effective in their own way to reach out to the audiences

in  their  countries.   So far, our missions  in  Kuala  Lumpur,

Jakarta, New York and Paris have launched their own home  pages.

London  and  Shanghai will have theirs later in the  month.   In

financial year 1999, my Ministry will launch another 11 websites

for  all  our  overseas  missions.  In  addition  to  that,  our

embassies  also issue newsletters, and so on.  So  these  things

are being done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said that, I think we need to have a proper

perspective   in  addressing  the  question  of  perception   or

misperception,  as mentioned by the Member.  I  would  say  that

Singapore's general international image is not really  negative.

It  is, in fact, positive.  In recent weeks and months, in fact,

many stories were written in well-known reputed newspapers about

the  way in which Singapore had handled its own economy  in  the

midst  of the regional financial crisis.  What we have done  has

been  noted.   Of  course, from time to time,  negative  stories

about  Singapore will appear in the international  media.   When

these   negative  stories  are  based  on  misunderstanding   or

inaccurate  information, our overseas missions  proactively  and

robustly will correct such misperceptions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the end of the day, I think the crux of the problem

is  not  lack of information or inaccurate information.  Because

there  is always a small group of critics or foreign media  that

is  ideologically uncomfortable with Singapore.  We have to face

this,  because  we  do not fit their preconceptions  of  what  a

successful  developing  country should  be.   So  no  amount  of

dissemination  of accurate information or effort  at  correcting

them  is going to change their mindset.  Yes, we keep on trying,

and we will not stop trying.   In fact, these critics would want

to  change us to fit their ideas of what we ought to be.  Unless

we change, these critics will not be satisfied.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But obviously we should not change ourselves just to oblige

this  small  group of critics.  Their views are not  necessarily

shared  by a majority of Western policy-makers or Western public

at  large, as the Member has pointed out.  Many people supported

the actions we took.  So I think we should not be too rattled by

such criticisms.  Of course, we should not blow our own trumpet.

We  have our policies which we think work for us and where  they

work  for us, we will continue to pursue these policies.   Where

they do not work, obviously we will re-examine our policies  and

decisions,  and adjust.  We do not insist that  what  we  do  is

right for the rest of the world and we do not seek to impose our

policies  on  the others.  So we have to be very clear  of  this

perspective when we deal with the comment made by the Member  on

correcting international perception of Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, on what we have discussed just

now,  I  think it should be clear to the policy-makers in  Kuala

Lumpur,  and  also  in Jakarta, that Singapore and  Singaporeans

want to have good relations with our neighbouring countries, but

on an equal basis and as sovereign nations, and as good partners

within ASEAN.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, Sir, in terms of Singapore-Thai relations, I

want  to  say that Singapore-Thai relations have been  warm  and

very constructive, and beneficial to both sides.  There has been

recognition by Singaporeans and Thais that we have much to learn

from each other, and much to gain in cooperation and partnership

in the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In early February 1999, the Minister for Foreign Affairs

led  a  delegation of senior officials from the Singapore  Civil

Service  to  attend  a meeting with their Thai  counterparts  in

Bangkok.   Would the Minister brief the House on the outcome  of

this  meeting  and other recent initiatives to expand  bilateral

cooperation  with Thailand?  What are the steps that  have  been

taken to realise the vision of a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>

Singapore-Thailand Enhanced Partnership, which has  been  called

or  abbreviated as STEP, that the Prime Minister launched during

his official visit to Thailand in June 1997?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will give us a step-by-step account of

this bilateral relationship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I go on to the next amendment?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, Singapore and Australia have a

long-standing  relationship, a deep  and,  I  may  say,  abiding

relationship, over many, many years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In World War II, Australia sent its servicemen to defend

Singapore.  Some died in the field, never to return  home.   And

many were later imprisoned at Changi.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the post-war era, Australia is our strong partner in

defence  through  the  Five  Power  Defence  Arrangement.    The

economic  ties  between Singapore and Australia are  strong  and

growing day by day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just weeks ago, the Singapore Australia Joint Ministerial

Committee  held  its  meeting in Singapore, and  shortly  after,

Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong visited Australia himself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask the Minister to brief this House on the

significance and outcome of the recent Singapore Australia Joint

Ministerial  Committee meeting and the visit of  Prime  Minister

Goh Chok Tong to Australia.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, at the invitation of the Hong Kong

Legislative Council, Parliament sent a delegation to  Hong  Kong

in  the  last  week  of  January this year.   Seven  Members  of

Parliament  participated, and the Hong Kong Legislative  Council

arranged a full programme for the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>

delegation.  I am happy to report that throughout the visit,  we

could  feel  that the welcome extended to us by the  Legislative

Council,  the  various  Hong  Kong government  departments,  and

authorities  such  as the Housing Authority, the  Transportation

Department,  was  warm  and genuine.  The Hong  Kong  government

officials were friendly and open and were very willing to  share

with  us  their  difficulties, problems  and  information.   The

delegation   felt   that  to  a  great  extent,   the   friendly

relationship between the two territories owed much to the effort

of  the  Singapore Consul-General, Mr Chan Heng Wing, a  man  of

seemingly boundless energy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our dialogue sessions at the stately legislative

building, members of the two legislatures concluded that the so-called  "tension"  between Hong Kong and  Singapore  is  more  a

perception, resulting from the reporting by the news  media,  in

particular  the foreign media, and that it does not reflect  the

true feelings of the people of Hong Kong and Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, it is rather surprising to learn of the verbal

outburst  of Mr Chau Tak Hay, the Hong Kong Secretary  of  Trade

and Industry in the Legislative Council when he commented on the

extent  of control in the Singapore society.  Sir, with all  due

respect to the Secretary, I am afraid that his understanding  of

Singapore  is  rather  shallow for a man  of  his  standing  and

background.  Perhaps we should invite the Secretary, Mr Chau, to

Singapore, and spend some time with us.  At the very  least,  we

should send him a copy of SM's book, "The Singapore Story".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister to give us an assessment of the

relations between Hong Kong and Singapore, and whether there  is

any strained relationship that needs to be looked into?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, Singapore has taken over the

chairmanship  of  the  ASEAN Standing Committee  and  the  ASEAN

Regional Forum, two key appointments within ASEAN, just when the

region  is  undergoing  tremendous  economic  difficulties   and

crisis.  These are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>

trying  times  indeed: times of tension and stress.   There  is,

unfortunately,  emerging  a perception  that  ASEAN  has  failed

collectively  in  not  being able to  tackle  and  surmount  the

regional economic crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a perception that ASEAN is in disarray,

lacking in unity, lacking in cohesion, and lacking in direction,

especially  after  President Suharto stepped down  from  office.

This  has been fuelled by the emergence of bilateral issues  and

disputes between ASEAN member countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask the Minister for his views and assessment on

ASEAN  and  what  Singapore's expectations are in  our  role  as

Chairman  of the ASEAN Standing Committee and the ASEAN Regional

Forum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wider context, ASEAN and the European Union have a

long  established relationship, which has benefited both  sides.

Can  the  Minister  explain  why this  relationship  is  now  in

jeopardy  over  a number of issues?  What can we do  to  address

this issue and improve the relationship amongst the blocs?

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, ASEAN has been an important

cornerstone  of Singapore's foreign policy.  However,  bilateral

problems  in  the  past  year  between  ASEAN  member  countries

appeared to have affected ASEAN warmth.  What measures, if  any,

have  been  taken by both Singapore and by ASEAN  to  remain  on

course in regional cooperation?  As Singapore has taken over the

chairmanship of the ASEAN Standing Committee this year, can  the

Foreign  Minister  outline  the  main  agenda  and  focus   that

Singapore has set for ASEAN this year?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASEAN has demonstrated its unity in the face of differences

with  the  European  Union over Myanmar's participation  in  the

ASEAN-EU Dialogue.  Despite the differences with EU, ASEAN  does

have  other avenues for dialogues with European nations  through

the  Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM).  Is this observation right,  or

are there more costs to ASEAN than it appears to be?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Myanmar in particular, how successful has ASEAN's policy

of  constructive engagement been?  Has it led to any substantial

opening  of  Myanmar's economy?  Has any progress been  made  in

integrating  Myanmar into ASEAN's political  culture?   How  can

ASEAN  continue to stand united on Myanmar, and  yet  remain  in

constructive dialogues with other regional groupings?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the past seven to eight years, ASEAN has moved

towards wider economic cooperation through the ASEAN Free  Trade

Area  (AFTA).  And I believe ASEAN is now working on the details

to  liberalise  the  flow of investments  within  the  grouping.

Could  the Minister inform the House about the progress in these

areas of economic cooperation?  Has the regional economic crisis

affected adversely the scope and speed of these efforts?

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, Singaporeans

should understand that foreign policy in ASEAN is not irrelevant

in this time of crisis.  Our economy is in recession not because

of  our  internal  factors but largely because of  the  knock-on

effects of the crisis around us.  Our foreign policy, therefore,

becomes all the more important in our response.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Members who spoke before me, I would ask the

Minister  to share his thoughts on assuming the chairmanship  of

the  ASEAN  Standing  Committee and the  ASEAN  Regional  Forum.

ASEAN  is  the  core  group  for many international  and  inter-regional   institutions   concerning  investments,   trade   and

security.   In  this sense, I would like the Minister  to  share

with  us  his  thoughts on AFTA and AIA, not only  as  goods  in

themselves,   but   rather  what  this  may   signal   for   our

relationships with other regions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, ASEAN has been a grouping not only of

disparate   and  very  different  countries,  but   within   the

diversity,  ASEAN has worked as an institution to  build  norms,

discourage conflicts and the use of force in our region

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>

with  great  success.  We try to encourage  cooperation  and  to

minimise   bilateral  problems  within  the  context  of   wider

relations.  In this sense, I would ask the Minister to share his

perspectives  on  how  ASEAN might deal or  help  us  deal  with

various bilateral concerns we may have.

<br>5.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, Sir, I am concerned that some are now

talking about a century of ACE (America, China and Europe),  ie,

a  future century which would not include ASEAN.  What  are  the

Minister's thoughts as Singapore continues its chairmanship?  In

particular, I am concerned that Singapore leadership be not seen

as a self-appointed and loud captain, but rather as a leadership

of  service.  And in this context, I would encourage us  to  see

our  assistance as having to increase, but not just in terms  of

money  but  in  terms  of  technical cooperation,  training  and

assisting in dialogue as a bridge between our ASEAN members  and

the  wider world.  In this, I think Singapore, despite  whatever

criticisms  may  come our way, must not be  silent  nor  be  too

sensitive but should lead quietly and effectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, I am looking to the Minister for his

thoughts  on his plan of action and taking a longer  term  about

the  ASEAN  20-20 Vision, working not just with the older  ASEAN

members  but,  particularly,  with  the  new  ASEAN  members  of

Indochina and Myanmar in the ASEAN's enlargement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would call on the Minister to think not only of the

shorter  term  but also the longer term policies  to  help  this

region deal with what is potentially a lost generation of  youth

and  to  think of things that may not be so realistic like  now,

but  to lay the groundwork for future developments, such  as  an

ASEAN university.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I take the next cut?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, carry on.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> This concerns the ARF. Very briefly, again,

Singapore as Chairman of the ASEAN Standing Committee

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>

finds  itself  chairing the ASEAN Regional  Forum.   This  forum

allows  ASEAN  and Singapore to engage with a much larger  Asia-Pacific  footprint and with many of the major powers.  ASEAN  in

this  forum  is  meant to be in the driver's  seat.   Yet,  many

commentators  have been concerned that tensions and  differences

between  ASEAN have disabled ASEAN from being truly the  driver.

I  will  ask the Minister to share his thoughts about using  the

ASEAN Regional Forum to continue to engage USA, China, Japan and

indeed Europe which are all members of the ARF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, on the ARF, Sir, if I may ask the Minister to concern

himself  with  the ideas of confidence building  and  preventive

diplomacy as new stages of the ASEAN Regional Forum.  Sir, in my

main  speech  on  the finance policy of this Government,  I  was

concerned about the defence spending, not simply as a matter  of

a  military build-up.  I do not think that is our intention.  My

concern then was much more the perception of our neighbours  and

the  wider region.  Would the Minister consider using the  ASEAN

Regional Forum for confidence building measures (CBMs), dialogue

and transparency in this regard?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, Singapore has taken a strong

position  at the Sixth ASEAN Summit in Hanoi over the timing  of

Cambodia's  admission  into  ASEAN.   Can  the  Minister  please

explain  why  Singapore has objected to the  full  admission  of

Cambodia  at  the  Hanoi  Summit?  What  is  the  latest  status

regarding Cambodia's desire to become a member of ASEAN?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I move on to the next cut?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister wants to reply. Could you let

him reply first?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I will respond to the comments made

by  Members  on  ASEAN-related  issues  and  my  colleague,  the

Minister  of  State, Dr Ow Chin Hock, will take up the  comments

made on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>

Singapore-Thailand,  Singapore-Hong Kong and Singapore-Australia

relations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several comments were made about ASEAN. We cannot deny

that  ASEAN  is  going through a very difficult period  and  the

regional  economic  crisis has really affected  all  members  of

ASEAN.   Some  are experiencing internal political stresses  and

strains.  There have been bilateral issues amongst two  or  more

ASEAN countries.  Members are right that outside observers  have

expressed  all  sorts of comments and prognosis  for  ASEAN  and

ASEAN's  future  directions.   Because of these developments  in

the  past  year or so, it has led to perceptions that  ASEAN  is

weakened  or in a state of disarray.  My view is that we  should

not  deny  that  ASEAN is indeed going through  a  very  testing

period.   On the other hand, to be balanced, I would  not  paint

too gloomy and pessimistic a prognosis for ASEAN.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take the issue of bilateral relations problems

between  some ASEAN countries.  Yes, it has happened.   Malaysia

and  Singapore have had their problems and we are not  the  only

ones.   Some other countries have also had their bilateral spats

and  skirmishes.   But let us get things in perspective.   These

problems  have  always existed and it is not the first  time  or

last  time  that ASEAN will encounter such difficulties.   ASEAN

has   weathered  such  storms  before  and  fortunately  emerged

stronger.  This is quite a remarkable thing about ASEAN.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may quote two personal anecdotes from my experience.

When  relations with Malaysia were at times chilly  and  frosty,

there  was no problem in my picking up the phone and talking  to

the then Foreign Minister Badawi on a variety of matters.  In my

capacity as Chairman of ASEAN, I had discussed various proposals

and  got  his agreement on the phone, particularly,  when  there

were  fast  moving events like on Cambodia.   That  was  a  good

illustration of how ASEAN works.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, going back a few years back, when we had this

bilateral  problem with the Philippines over the  case  of  Flor

Contemplacion, it was clear that both of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>

us  did not want the issue to affect ASEAN, or ASEAN unity.   In

fact, Philippines and Singapore continued to cooperate on a wide

variety of measures in ASEAN.  Here, again, there was no problem

in  the Foreign Minister and myself being in frequent contact on

the  telephone.  So I think ASEAN's strength is to be  found  in

the  habit of consultations, personal ties and a strong  network

of  institutional links which were developed over a period of 30

years.   We  have  come to a stage where we have  discussed  our

problems  honestly  but  quietly.  ASEAN Foreign  Ministers  and

officials  continue  to  meet regularly  despite  the  bilateral

problems and I think the comfort levels are quite high.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Hanoi Summit last year, ASEAN leaders, without

exception,  felt  a  strong sense of purpose  to  restore  ASEAN

standing and they adopted a forward looking Hanoi plan of action

and Hanoi declaration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was asked about the chairmanship of ASEAN standing

committee.   In that capacity, Singapore would have to  work  to

ensure  that ASEAN countries continue to work together  to  deal

with  the  regional  economic crisis.  It is  very  likely  that

Cambodia  will  join  ASEAN  soon.   So  the  Foreign  Ministers

Ministerial Meeting which Singapore would have to host  in  July

this  year  will  be the first time that all ten  ASEAN  Foreign

Ministers  will meet together.  It is an important occasion  for

the  Ministers  to  discuss  how the  ten  countries  will  work

together to strengthen ASEAN and its future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As chair of the ARF, we also want to see the habit of

dialogue and consultation strengthened.  I believe ARF plays  an

important role in building confidence among its countries in the

region which contributes peace and stability.  And I will say  a

few  more  words about ARF.  I was asked whether  Singapore  can

play  a  leadership  role in opening new markets  amongst  ASEAN

members.   The  new ASEAN countries actually understand,  in  my

view,  the importance of economic liberalization and the opening

up of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>

economies.   As members of ASEAN, they have committed themselves

to  participating in the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and  ASEAN

Investment  Area  (AIA).  The participation will  lead  them  to

lower  their  barriers and encourage a free  flow  of  trade  in

ASEAN.   Singapore will work with the new ASEAN members to  help

them integrate into AFTA and also the global economy.  Singapore

can  share  with  these  countries our  experience  in  economic

development and familiarise them with measures that can  improve

the   business  conditions  and  investment  climate.   I  think

Singapore's  regionalisation programme will also help.   But  in

the final analysis, much will depend on the private sector.   Of

course,  in  seeking business opportunities in the new  markets,

the private sector will look for a business environment which is

conducive to open trade and investments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was asked about ASEAN-EU relations and how is it that

problems  have arisen.  Dr Ong Chit Chung is right that ASEAN-EU

dialogue  has  run  into rough waters.  In  fact,  it  is  at  a

standstill.   Why  is  that  so?  It  is  because  of  the  EU's

difficulties  over Myanmar's participation in two key  meetings.

One is the ASEAN-European Commission Joint Cooperation Committee

(JCC)  which is really a technical meeting to review cooperation

activities.   The other meeting which has run into  difficulties

is  ASEAN-EU  Foreign Ministers Meeting which was to  have  been

held back-to-back with the Asia-Europe Foreign Ministers Meeting

in  Berlin.  The JCC, the technical meeting, was postponed twice

due  to  a disagreement between ASEAN and EU over the format  of

Myanmar's  participation, and both ASEAN and EU are now  working

towards  reconvening the meeting.  But the prospects  of  having

the  ASEAN-EU Foreign Ministers Meeting on 30th March in Berlin,

I am afraid, appear rather dim at this stage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main problem is that the European Union's common

position  is  not  to  grant  a visa to  the  Myanmar's  Foreign

Minister.   The  European  Union  would  like   Myanmar  to   be

represented  at  a  more  junior  level.   But  as  the  Foreign

Ministers Meeting is a ministerial meeting at the Foreign

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>

Ministers'  level,  ASEAN's position is that all  ASEAN  Foreign

Ministers will have to be present and treated equally.  In other

words,  there  should  not be any discrimination  on  any  ASEAN

member's  participation and it will be difficult  for  ASEAN  to

leave  behind one member and the rest of us attend the  meeting.

It  is  unfortunate  that  some of the EU  countries'  bilateral

difficulties with Myanmar on its internal human rights situation

have   jeopardised   the   long   standing   ASEAN-EU   dialogue

partnership.  I say that because, over the past 22 years,  ASEAN

and  EU  have built well-entrenched institutional structures  to

facilitate  broad  based  functional and  economic  cooperation.

This  well-established relationship is one that ASEAN  continues

to value.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the EU could take into account the larger

interests of the dialogue.  My colleagues in ASEAN actually  are

rather puzzled by the EU position because the European Union has

no  problems  sitting with the Myanmar Foreign Minister  at  the

same  table at the ASEAN Regional Forum when it is held  in  our

region.   They  also have no problem sitting  with  the  Myanmar

Foreign  Minister  when ASEAN has its post-ministerial  dialogue

with  the European Union after the ASEAN meeting.  So they  find

this rather inconsistent.

<br>5.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay asked about the ARF. The ARF has actually

come a fairly long way since it was established in 1994.  It  is

the  only regional forum that brings in all the major powers  to

discuss  regional security issues.  It has, over the  past  five

years,  managed  to build up a certain comfort level  and  trust

among its participants so much so that in recent sessions,  even

sensitive  issues have been discussed.  The 5th ARF  in  Manila,

for  example,  saw a very candid exchange of views  on  regional

security  issues, including the impact of the financial  crisis.

There  was  also a candid exchange of views over the South-Asian

nuclear tests.  That these issues have now been discussed  in  a

non-confrontational manner, to me, it is a sign of how  the  ARF

has managed to increase and build up

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>

confidence among the participating countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to ARF's future and resilience is, even though

individual  countries  have different operating  styles,  it  is

ARF's adherence to the principles of consultation and consensus.

I  believe that the future of ARF is hinged on to the mindset of

the countries in the forum.  Hopefully, our constant interaction

will  inculcate  habits of dialogue and cooperation  instead  of

confrontation.   Although the comfort level  has  increased,  we

have to deal with decades of suspicion and distrust which cannot

be  obliterated within a space of a few years.  This  is  why  I

believe that the process of the ARF and the exchanging of  views

are important.  If the countries are more assured by the process

of  consultation and consensus, something which I place a lot of

emphasis,  it  will  lead  to  increased  trust  and  eventually

cooperation.   I  might mention here that as an illustration  of

consultation that even before the ARF is held, I have written to

all  the  Foreign Ministers of the ARF participating  countries,

soliciting  their views on how they see the ARF, to be  held  in

July  this  year, to move forward, and I have told them  that  I

will take their views into consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I do not foresee the ARF rapidly becoming a

dispute  resolution forum, I share Mr Simon Tay's view  that  we

should  probably  try  to  move several incremental  steps  from

confidence building measures to a stage of preventive diplomacy.

Mr  Simon Tay ended up his speech referring to assistance  which

we  can give to regional countries.  I am not sure whether  time

will  permit, but one of the questions which was raised by other

Members concerns technical cooperation and he will know that the

record shows that Singapore, in fact, is doing a lot within  the

limited  resources that we have under its technical  cooperation

programme.   We  spend a lot of money, we train  thousands  from

various  countries and the majority of participants who  benefit

are from the countries in the region.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with your permission, my colleague, the Senior

Parliamentary  Secretary drew my attention to the  fact  that  I

inadvertently omitted to reply to Dr Wang Kai Yuen, although  it

was on an earlier matter, when he asked me for information about

the bridge proposal.  In response, let me say that the Singapore

Government  has  not  received any proposal from  the  Malaysian

Government  on  the development of a new bridge to  replace  the

Causeway.   As  I have said before, and so has the Minister  for

National  Development,  any proposal for  such  a  project  will

require  the approval of both governments.  Of course, Singapore

will  seriously consider any initiative that will foster  closer

cooperation  between  Singapore  and  Malaysia.   Naturally,  we

cannot  give  a  response in abstract terms.  We  need  to  know

pertinent details.  Why is there a need to replace the  Causeway

with  a  bridge in the first place?  What will the whole project

cost be and what are the cost benefits?  Will the Singapore  end

properly tie up with the Woodlands train checkpoint?  What  will

be  the toll charges, if any?  All these must be addressed,  not

as  a  private  sector  proposal, but in  a  proposal  from  the

government  of Malaysia.  So we need a formal proposal,  and  if

there  is  one from the Malaysian government, we will of  course

consider it.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Dr Ow Chin</b>

<b>Hock):</b> Sir, let me first respond to Dr Ong's comments on

Thailand-Singapore relations.  Over the last two years, Thailand-Singapore   bilateral   relations  have  further   strengthened,

characterised by the increased regularity of high-level meetings

and  exchanges  of  visits between the two countries.   This  is

attributable   to   two  major  initiatives:  Singapore-Thailand

Enhanced Partnership (STEP) and Thailand-Singapore Civil Service

Cooperation  Programme (CSEP).  Both initiatives  were  launched

during  the official visit of our Prime Minister Goh to Thailand

in June 1997 and endorsed by the Thai Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STEP outlines the broad vision of the two countries to

forge a strategic and economic partnership in which the two

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>

countries  could  leverage on, and add  value  to  each  other's

strengths and competencies.  As noted by Dr Ong, the second CSEP

was  held  in  February 1999 in Bangkok.  In a relatively  short

period,  CSEP has proved to be an important tool to realise  the

STEP vision.  Let me just cite two accomplishments:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) the institutionisation of cooperation between the civil

services  of  Thailand  and Singapore  which  has  engendered  a

culture  of consultations and cooperation.  The linkages between

the  two civil services will contribute to the development of  a

good and mutually beneficial bilateral partnership; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) the identification of concrete cooperation projects in many

areas.   Notable  progress  has  been  made  in  the  fields  of

education,    trade    and   investment   promotion,    tourism,

telecommunications,  industrial  parks/estates,  and   technical

cooperation.  An MOU on Cooperation in IT was also signed at the

second meeting of CSEP in Bangkok.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such cooperation between Thailand and Singapore is an

excellent  illustration  of  how in times  of  adversity,  ASEAN

countries   can  pull  together  and  press  on  with   regional

cooperation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung also commented on Australia-Singapore

relations.  He is right.  The warm and strong relations  between

Singapore and Australia were given impetus by two recent  events

quoted by him:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) PM Goh made a working visit in early March 1999, just a few

days  ago,  where PM Goh had a frank and useful discussion  with

Australian Prime Minister Howard and other Australian leaders on

regional developments; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) the Second Singapore-Australia Joint Ministerial Committee

(SAJMC)  took  place  in Singapore in February  1999.   In  this

biennial  SAJMC,  three  Ministers from  each  side  meet  their

counterparts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong asked specifically about the Second SAJMC Meeting.

In this recent meeting, both sides reviewed the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>

progress  in  our  bilateral relations and  exchanged  views  on

international  issues and on the implications  of  the  regional

financial  crisis  and  regional political  developments.   Both

sides also agreed on several initiatives at the meeting: a G-to-G MOU on IT was concluded between DPM Lee and Australian DPM Tim

Fischer.   Seven  other commercial MOUs/Letters of  Intent  were

also  signed.  In addition, both sides also agreed  to  work  on

establishing  a  strategic dialogue partnership or  relationship

between  think-tank, a Youth Ambassador Exchange  Programme  and

Third Country Technical Programme courses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scope and depth of our cooperation with Australia have

increased.  Let me cite three areas briefly:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Defence. Defence relations between Singapore and Australia

are  active and strong.  Australia is an important training area

for  our  SAF.  We have also cooperated with Australian  Defence

Force   in   numerous  bilateral  and  multi-lateral  exercises,

including the FPDA;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Economics. Bilateral economic ties are close. Singapore

and   Australia   are   top  investors  and  trading   partners.

Singapore's  total foreign direct investment  in  Australia  for

1996  was  S$1.82 billion.  Australia's investment in  Singapore

totalled  A$1.16  billion as of June 1997.  Bilateral  trade  in

1998 was S$7.4 billion; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Other areas. The launching of Singapore-Australian

Business  Alliance Forum and Parliamentary Friendship Group  has

further expanded the scope of our bilateral cooperation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's long-term close linkages with Australia will be

beneficial  for  the region as well.  Let me cite  two  reasons.

Firstly,  as Singapore and Australia have weathered the  current

economic crisis better, we have been working closely to help the

affected regional countries.  We have also agreed to have closer

dialogue and cooperation on international and regional financial

management and financial reform issues.  Secondly, in view

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>

of  its unique cultural and historical links, Australia could be

the  interface between the West and the affected Asian countries

in  resolving the current financial crisis.  Australia has shown

its desire to play such a role by being engaged in Indonesia and

proposing initiatives on international financial reforms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Dr Wang Kai Yuen's comments on Singapore-Hong Kong

relations,  let  me  give him an overview.  Singapore-Hong  Kong

bilateral  relations  are  warm and close.   There  are  regular

visits  of  leaders  and officials from both  sides.   Bilateral

cooperation at officials' level is also progressing  well  under

the  Civil  Service Exchange Programme.  The programme comprises

(i)   exchange   of   visits  between  senior  officials;   (ii)

attachments  of  civil servants; and (iii) cross appointment  of

senior  officials.   There has been a steady  flow  of  incoming

visits by senior Hong Kong officials since the handover in  July

1997.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliamentary links, in the form of Singapore-Hong Kong

Parliamentary Friendship Group, are consolidated with  exchanges

of visits from both sides, including the recent visit by Dr Wang

and six other MPs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the bilateral economic relations, it is healthy and

good.  Total bilateral trade for 1998 was S$20.2 billion.  Total

Singapore  investment in Hong Kong for 1995 was  S$6.27  billion

and  total Hong Kong investment in Singapore at the end of  1994

was  S$5.02  billion.  I agree with Dr Wang that  the  so-called

rivalry and competition between Hong Kong and Singapore is  more

a  perception  rather than real.  However, this  perception  has

somewhat affected the bilateral relations between Hong Kong  and

Singapore.   But  we understand the stressful situation  in  the

Asian  region  as a whole has fanned the "absurd"  media  frenzy

over the so-called rivalry, which was played up by Hong Kong and

the Western media.  Some SAR officials felt obliged to answer to

queries  by the legislators and media, which have further  added

to  the frenzy.  We have reacted calmly and rationally, although

we have, at times, come out to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>

robustly  clarify  inaccurate and baseless comments  made  about

Singapore, including the example cited by the Member.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's recent financial liberalisation and cost-cutting measures were designed to make Singapore competitive.

In  some cases, we try to keep up with Hong Kong, not "stamp" on

Hong  Kong when it is down.  Let me cite the Senior Minister  in

his  speech at Tanjong Pagar Chinese New Year gathering,  and  I

quote,  "Singapore has learnt from Hong Kong's example  and  was

liberalising  its financial sector to keep pace with  New  York,

London, Tokyo, Frankfurt and Hong Kong, not to do Hong Kong in."

<br>6.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not a zero sum game. There is a considerable

degree  of  cooperation  and  mutual  benefit  from  having  two

financial centres, two prosperous cities in Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healthy competition in some areas is inevitable, but Hong

Kong  is not Singapore's principal competitor.  We are promoting

other   sectors   such  as  manufacturing,   petrochemical   and

pharmaceuticals, and services (other than financial services).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang would agree with me that it is in our interest to

have a stable and prosperous Hong Kong.  Given the nature of our

relationship, Singapore and Hong Kong will always cooperate  and

compete  with each other at the same time.  The success  of  one

will be a spur to greater success for the other.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, a quick word before Dr Ong moves on

to his other cuts.  It is not true that we opposed the admission

of  Cambodia.   In fact, Singapore's position on this  has  been

both  consistent and based on principles.  The decision to admit

Cambodia  was  taken some years ago in 1996 by  the  leaders  of

ASEAN.   And  it was really a question of timing  when  Cambodia

should take its place in ASEAN.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>

Members  are  aware  of the various developments  which  led  to

instability  in  Cambodia.  But the formation of  the  coalition

government  in  November last year was  a  very  important  step

towards a move to normalcy in Cambodia.  Unfortunately,  by  the

time  the  leaders met in Hanoi for the Summit  and  where  some

thought Cambodia could be admitted in time for the Hanoi Summit,

it  was  not  possible to take the decision  because  Singapore,

Thailand and the Philippines noted that the political parties to

the  coalition themselves had announced to the world that a  key

component   of  their  agreement  on  the  coalition   was   the

establishment  of a Senate.  And by the time we  met  in  Hanoi,

that  aspect,  which  they  themselves  had  proclaimed  as   an

important  element,  had  not yet been  given  effect  by  their

legislation.  So the position we took was that it was  premature

to  take  the decision to formally admit them at Hanoi.  Rather,

we  should wait for the establishment of the Senate, because  if

the  Senate  was  not  established and they  have  already  been

admitted, then you can have a situation where the political deal

could have become unravelled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to report that last week I received a letter from

the  Cambodian Foreign Minister informing me that the  necessary

steps  have been taken by the Cambodian National Assembly  which

has approved the constitutional amendments for the establishment

of the Senate.  I have accordingly written to all my colleagues,

the  ASEAN Foreign Ministers, as well as to Vietnam, which  will

be  the  host for the special admission ceremony, that we should

proceed to implement the decision of the leaders.  And I  expect

that  Vietnam  will consult and settle on a date  soon  for  the

formal admission ceremony.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, despite all the criticisms, pot

shots and snide remarks, the United Nations is here to stay.  It

simply  could not be wished away.  Neither is there  any  viable

substitute  to  replace  the  United  Nations.   It  has  indeed

established  itself as a world body for all countries,  big  and

small.   It allows small nations like Singapore a forum  on  the

world stage.  It is a good place to network, to make

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>

representation, to air views and to train diplomats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is active at the UN and is bidding for a seat on

the  UN  Security Council for the year 2001.  I wish to ask  the

Minister  for his assessment of Singapore's role at  the  United

Nations; whether Singapore will play an even more active role in

the UN Peace-keeping Missions; whether Singapore is on track  in

our  bid for the Security Council seat; and what are our chances

of securing such a seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Briefly, Sir. A few days ago, the hon. NCMP,

Mr  Jeyaretnam, suggested that Singapore did not need a  defence

force,  and that it could rely on the UN.  The answer by  almost

all  Members was that this was not possible.  I too concur  that

defence by the UN collective security is insufficient.  A first-line defence is always necessary.  May I invite the Minister  to

share  his thoughts on what then, if it is not defence,   do  we

seek  as  a  member of the UN?  Do we seek a layer  of  peaceful

existence and cooperation?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, on this matter, I am able to speak

with  a  little bit of personal experience because,  many  years

ago, I was Singapore's Permanent Representative to the UN.   And

I can say that if it was true then, it is still true today, that

as  a  small  country,  Singapore  lacks  the  resources  to  be

adequately represented by embassies throughout the world.  There

will  be  a  limit to the number of embassies we can  establish.

Therefore, a membership in the UN in the first place provides us

with  an opportunity to make contact with the broad spectrum  of

United  Nations'  member countries, many of whom  we  would  not

normally be in contact through diplomatic ties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say also that another important benefit is that

through  the UN, we are able to project Singapore and  to  raise

Singapore's international profile.  Our membership  at  the  UN,

together with our participation in UN-related groupings like the

Non-Aligned  Movement  and the Group of  77,  also  provides  us

opportunities  to  develop and maintain  our  links  with  other

countries in the developing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>

world.    Everybody  knows  that  we  have  limited   resources.

Therefore, we have focused on a limited number of issues in  the

UN.   We have not taken a blunderbuss approach of staffing every

committee  and sending large delegations, because we  believe  a

selective approach is one where we will be able to deliver  what

we have set out to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that in our own small and modest way we have, over

the  years,  developed the reputation of being a responsible  UN

member  as well as an efficient and effective one, but obviously

it  must  be  others who will have to judge us.   We  have  also

stepped up our involvement in UN activities in areas of interest

to  us,  but  where we may obtain political mileage  at  minimal

cost.  For example, peace-keeping which was mentioned, Singapore

was,  as of May 1997, one of only seven countries to sign a  MOU

with  the  UN  on  standby arrangements, ie, to  have  available

officers,  observers or medical personnel and  aircraft  for  UN

peace-keeping operations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also add that at the UN meetings, my Ministry

ensures,  as far as possible, we have high-calibre delegates  to

represent Singapore.  In this way, we have played an active  and

constructive role at various UN forums such as the  Law  of  the

Sea   Conference  or  the  UN  Conference  on  Environment   and

Development.  And within the UN itself, Singapore  tries  to  be

active  on high profile issues such as the reform of the UN  and

the UN Security Council.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are asked about our bid for the UN Security Council

candidature,  what  are  our chances like.   One  can  never  be

absolutely  sure  but  at this stage, I  would  say  that  I  am

confident  that  we have a fairly good chance of being  elected.

We   announced  our  candidature  early  in  order  to  give  us

sufficient time to mount a systematic lobbying campaign.    This

campaign is going well and we have received many expressions  of

support from numerous countries in all regional groupings in the

UN.   As  Members know, Singapore is the only declared candidate

for the Asian group seat, and this is an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>

Asian  group seat in the UN Security Council for the term  2001-2002.    All  the  other  ASEAN  countries  have  given   public

endorsement of our candidature.  I believe these factors put  us

in good stead for successful election in the year 2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will Singapore's role be in the Security Council? We

have  presented  our candidature to the Security Council's  non-permanent  seat  for the 2-year term.  And if elected,  it  will

give  us  first-hand  experience of  how  the  Security  Council

operates.   In many ways, the Security Council is the  heart  of

the  UN  system.  It is the only organ in the UN  that  has  the

authority  to  take  decisions that are binding  on  all  member

states.   Although Singapore has never served  on  the  Security

Council  before, we believe and we hope that we will be able  to

bring  to the Security Council constructive and useful, shall  I

say, small state perspective to the Council.  This role that  we

have  identified  for ourselves will be particularly  useful  to

those  UN members who themselves are small states and share  our

concerns and sense of vulnerability.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Very briefly, Sir. Our Prime Minister on

a visit to Chile in October 1998 mentioned the need to establish

a  forum for the academia, business people, Economic and Foreign

Ministers to forge a better understanding between Latin  America

and  Asia.  The call for a forum was driven by a desire to  know

more  about  Latin America, not just the economies  but  people,

culture  and the environment.  I would like to ask the  Minister

what  steps  have  been  taken since to promote  the  Asia-Latin

America Dialogue forum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Foreign Affairs (Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed): Sir, looking at  the

clock,  there is no time for samba!  Briefly, the Prime Minister

first  raised  the  idea  of the East Asia-Latin  America  forum

(EALAF) last September.  As we know, we have institutional links

with  North  America  through APEC, and with European  countries

through ASEM.  So there is currently

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>

this  missing link between East Asia and Latin America.  In  the

global  economy, such a gap between two dynamic regions must  be

addressed  in  the  interest of both regions and  thus  we  have

EALAF.   EALAF  is  envisaged  to be  a  meeting  of  individual

countries of East Asia and Latin America, and not as a  regional

group  to  group  meeting.   So interested  countries  can  join

whenever  they  are  ready to do so.   Prime  Minister  Goh  has

sounded  out leaders of ASEAN, China, Japan and Korea  on  EALAF

and the responses have been generally supportive.  Similarly, we

gather that the response from the 12 Rio group members has  also

been extremely good.  The plan is actually to hold a SOM meeting

sometime late this year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong, do you want to speak on technical

cooperation very briefly?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I will be brief. First, I want to

say  that we are in full support of the United Nations,  but  it

will be very naive for Mr Jeyaretnam to claim the other day that

the  UN  will  be  our first line of defence.   We  still  need,

paramount of all, as demonstrated in the Second World  War,  our

own defence, and a very strong SAF.  The UN can be a forum.  The

UN can be a back-up, but never the front line for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to ask the Minister whether he will tell us

what are the technical cooperation schemes between Singapore and

the other countries.  How can we help the other countries, since

we have benefited so much in so many areas?

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, on behalf of the Minister,

the  Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP) has an annual  budget

of  about $17 million.  SCP sponsors training courses and  study

visits  for  about 2,000 officials annually from 105  developing

countries  from  the  Asia Pacific, Africa, Middle  East,  Latin

America  and  the Caribbean.  Singapore, as we all  know,  is  a

small  country  with no natural resources and no large  manpower

base.   Nevertheless, we will do what we can within our  limited

resources to contribute to the manpower training and human

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>

resource development of other developing countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have trained, in fact, 8,000 officials from over 100

countries in specific fields including public administration and

management since 1992, and I am sure Members will agree that  it

is a commendable feat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong, would you like to withdraw your

amendment?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I think we had a very fruitful

discussion  on  foreign affairs.  I want to thank the  Minister,

the Minister of State and the Senior Parliamentary Secretary.  I

beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $117,147,650 for Head O ordered to stand part of

the Main Estimates.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $77,103,900 for Head O ordered to stand part of

the Development Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is 6.15 pm.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Deputy Speaker left the Chair of the Committee

and took the Chair of the House.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to report

that  the Committee of Supply has made further progress  on  the

Estimates  of  Expenditure for the financial year 1999/2000  and

ask leave to sit again tomorrow.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> So be it.
