<div align="center"><b>(Standardisation of normal working hours)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap</b> asked the Minister for

Finance, in view of the Government's policy to build a

rugged   and  robust  society,  if  he  will  consider

standardizing  the  normal  working  hours  of   civil

servants to the hours from 8 a.m, to 4.30 p.m., so  as

to  allow all civil servants more time in the evenings

to partake in the various forms of exercise.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, officers may at present

opt to work on weekdays from 8.00 a.m, to 4.30 p.m, or

from  8.30  a.m, to 5.00 p.m. Those who are interested

to leave early to take part in exercises or sports are

free  to  opt for 8.00 am, to 4.30 p.m. Forcing  those

who  are not interested to leave office early will not

achieve anything. As the saying goes, "You can lead  a

<div align="center"><b>WORKSHOP INSTRUCTORS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>AND STUDENTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Insurance coverage against physical injury)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b> asked the Minister for

Education  whether  there is  any  insurance  coverage

against  physical injury resulting from accidents  for

workshop   instructors  and  students  in   industrial

training  centres  and  vocational  institutes   doing

practical subjects.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I propose to answer this

question in two parts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, concerning the insurance coverage

against  physical injury resulting from accidents  for

workshop  instructors, there is no separate  insurance

coverage   against  physical  injury  resulting   from

accidents for them in the industrial training  centres

and  vocational institutes. But being public officers,

if  they sustain injuries in the course of discharging

public duties, they are covered under two schemes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first scheme is the Pensions Ordinance, 1956.

Under Regulation 19 of this Ordinance, the quantum  of

compensation where payable as a result of injury is in

addition  to any pension, gratuity or other  allowance

granted  under  the  same Ordinance.  Subject  to  the

provisions of the Ordinance, the quantum of the annual

allowance payable as compensation ranges from  5/60ths

(for  slight impairment of earning capacity) to  1/3rd

(for  total  destruction of earning  capacity)  of  an

officer's emoluments at the date of injury.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second scheme is the Workmen's Compensation

Ordinance.  Under  this  Ordinance,  where  a   public

officer   (including  a  technical  teacher,  workshop

instructor,    workshop   attendant,   and    workshop

assistant)  is  classified as a "workman"  and  is  in

receipt  of a salary not exceeding $400 per month,  he

is  entitled  to  be compensated under  the  Workmen's

Compensation  Ordinance provided  he  is  not  paid  a

pension  or  gratuity  for such injury.  The  rate  of

compensation is governed by the Workmen's Compensation

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of the question deals with insurance

coverage  for students. The Ministry assists  students

in  taking  personal accident insurance coverage  when

they are sent for practical training to any industrial

establishment,  job sites, and schools.  Students  are

advised  but  not  compelled  to  participate  in  the

insurance scheme. So far all students



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>



concerned  have  joined the scheme,  as  the  rate  of

premium  is  relatively low, i.e. $1 per  student  per

month for a capital sum assured for $10,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of injury caused by the negligence or

omission   of  the  teacher  or  instructor   in   the

vocational institutes, the Government and the  teacher

or  instructor concerned are jointly liable, and it is

for the injured party to determine which party or both

parties  to  sue  for  damages.  However,  the  school

authorities  will  not  be  liable  if  all  necessary

precautions and safeguards have been taken to  prevent

accidents  in schools. Adequate action has been  taken

to  ensure that safety precautions are observed in all

schools, vocational institutes and industrial training

centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the onus of providing insurance coverage against accidents not caused by negligence of the school authorities in industrial training institutions should rest on the parents, and I do urge parents to take insurance coverage for their own children.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

the  Parliamentary Secretary has stated that  teachers

of   Government   schools  sent  to   the   vocational

institutes  as  instructors  are  covered  under   two

schemes.  But  what  about  those  teachers   in   the

Government-aided schools?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if they draw a

salary of less than $400 a month, they will come under

the  Workmen's Compensation Ordinance.  If  they  draw

more  than  that, I presume they will sue  the  school

authorities for damages.

<div align="center"><b>TIMBER LORRIES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Cause of traffic congestion and hazard to road users)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap</b> asked the Minister for

Defence if a survey has been made by the Police as  to

whether  timber lorries using busy roads, like  Nicoll

Highway, in and near the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>



City centre during peak periods are a cause of traffic

congestion and a possible hazard to other road  users;

and whether and what remedial action will be taken.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker,   Sir,   it  is  true  that  timber   lorries

travelling along the busy roads in and near  the  City

centre  during  peak periods are a  cause  of  traffic

congestion  and also a possible hazard to  other  road

users, as they are huge vehicles carrying heavy  loads

and  moving at a slow speed not exceeding 20 miles per

hour.  These  lorries transport timber logs  from  the

railway  yard at Keppel Road to the various  sawmills,

most  of  which are situated in the Kallang  Road  and

Lavender  Street  areas,  and must  inevitably  travel

through the City centre. It would not be conducive  to

our timber trade, however, if transportation of timber

logs to sawmills were to be restricted to outside  the

peak periods of the day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Traffic Police are watching the situation very

carefully,  and drivers of timber lorries are  advised

to keep to the left-hand side of the road so as not to

hinder vehicular traffic and also endanger other  road

users.  The  Traffic Police are also taking  stringent

action  against  these lorry drivers  for  failure  to

comply with the traffic laws for speeding, for causing

obstruction, and having smoky exhausts. For the  whole

year of 1969 and since the beginning of this year,  no

case  of  traffic  accident involving  timber  lorries

occurred in the City area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, an area South of Kranji industrial estate is being developed by the Jurong Town Corporation for re-siting sawmills at present situated in various parts of the Republic. Those sawmills in the City area which will be affected by the urban renewal scheme will also be given alternative

accommodation  in  this area.  Once  this  project  is

completed,  timber lorries will not and need  not  use

the  already heavily congested roads in and  near  the

City centre.

<div align="center"><b>HAWKERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Eligibility for public assistance allowances)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b> asked the Minister for Social

Affairs  whether  hawkers  are  eligible  for   public

assistance allowance and, if not, why.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker (Acting Minister for Social Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, hawkers are not eligible

for  public assistance allowances as long as they  are

holders  of  a  current hawker's licence.  A  licensed

hawker is presumed to be in regular employment, and it

is regretted that the Social Welfare Department cannot

consider  such  cases  for  public  assistance.   This

presumption  is  necessary as it is  not  possible  to

assess the actual income of hawkers, particularly  the

itinerant ones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department will, however, consider applications

for public assistance from hawkers who are temporarily

incapacitated by illness, provided the applicants  can

produce the necessary medical certificate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hawkers who have become unemployed and have

surrendered  their current hawker's  licences  to  the

Hawkers   Department  will  be  eligible  for   public

assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one underlying objective in the recent

exercises   of  increasing  Members'  allowances   and

Ministers'  salaries  and  of  providing   for   their

pension.  That underlying objective is to  remove  the

financial  disincentive in getting men of ability  and

integrity to undertake political life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed increase in Members' allowances and

Ministers'  salaries  is  a  further  step   in   this

direction. The first step was made when the Government

passed  the  Parliamentary Pensions Act in  June  last

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving the Second Reading of the Bill, the

Minister  for Finance said, and I quote from  Hansard,

Vol. 29, No. 1, col. 18:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We cannot expect to get future leaders of calibre

on  the cheap, whatever was the case in the past,  and

it is as well that the people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>



of  Singapore  realize and accept  this  fact.  Unless

Singaporeans  want  to settle  in  the  future  for  a

mediocre  crack-pot or corrupt leadership,  they  must

not believe they can continue to expect men of ability

in  future  to  suffer severe financial sacrifices  in

pursuit  of a hazardous political career.  In  my  opi

nion,   a  mediocre  crack-pot  or  corrupt  political

leadership  will  ruin this country in  an  incredibly

short   time,  and  such  ruination  could  be  final,

complete  and permanent, as Singapore has  no  natural

resources or a large economic base on which to  effect

a recovery.'



<br><br>The Minister for Finance concluded, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`And to ensure the continued prosperity and success

of Singapore, the cost of the pension is a small price

to pay.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Pensions Act has now been in force for about a year.

In this time, it has been found that some  of the provisions of the Act

are too restrictive and need modification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, the Act provides that to qualify for

pension,  a Member would have to put in at  least  ten

years'  reckonable service and be not less than  fifty

years  of age. This means that a Member would have  to

serve not less than two full terms of five years  each

in  order to qualify for pension. A Member who  serves

for two terms, any of which is less than the full term

of  five years, would therefore not be eligible for  a

pension unless he is elected for a third term.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Australia, a Member of Parliament can qualify for

a  pension  at  the age of forty years, while  in  New

Zealand Members of Parliament are entitled to pensions

after nine years' service and on attaining the age  of

fifty  years. In Canada, on the other hand, a  pension

is paid to a Member of Parliament who serves more than

two terms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore proposed to amend the Act so that a

Member  who has put in nine years' reckonable service,

instead  of  ten,  would  qualify  for  pension.   The

qualifying age for the grant of pension is also  being

reduced from fifty years to forty-five years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, only a Speaker who is also an elected

Member  of Parliament may qualify for pension, and  it

is  proposed to amend the Act so that a Speaker who is

not an elected Member may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>



also qualify for pension. It is only reasonable that a

person who serves in Parliament as Speaker, whether or

not he is an elected Member, should be eligible for  a

pension for the service he puts in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may also be cases where persons who are

Members of Parliament subsequently cease to be Members

without  having served the minimum period  to  qualify

for  pension but who, nevertheless, on ceasing  to  be

Members,  may  hold  public  offices  such   as   High

Commissioners or Ambassadors for several  more  years.

Such  persons  should be adequately  provided  for  in

their  declining  years. It is therefore  proposed  to

amend the Act so that a person who has completed  less

than nine years' reckonable service in Parliament, but

the  aggregate of whose service in Parliament together

with  the  service in a public office  makes  up  nine

years,  would qualify for pension under the  Act.  For

this purpose, "public office" is to be defined as  the

office  of  High  Commissioner or Ambassador  or  such

other  office as the President may, from time to time,

declare in the Gazette.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, when passed, will be made retrospective

to  1st  July,  1969, the date when the principal  Act

came  into operation, to enable the provisions of  the

principal Act and the amending Act to dovetail.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the First Reading of the Bill, Mr Speaker, Sir,

eight years was specified as the qualifying period. As

I  said in moving the Second Reading, one full term of

Parliament  lasts for five years; two terms  would  be

ten   years.  On  deeper  reflection,  therefore,   we

consider  that nine years of reckonable service  would

be more appropriate. Hence the amendment.

<div align="center"><b>CIVIL LIST AND PENSION BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been the tradition in many countries for the

Legislature  to  provide by law for a Civil  List  for

their Presidents. And this tradition is enshrined  iii

our Constitution, Article 4 of which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>



reads:  "The Legislature shall by law provide a  Civil

List   for  the  President."  Part  I  of  this  Bill,

therefore,  seeks to make such provision in accordance

with the Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will note from the Schedule to the Bill that

the  President will draw an annual salary  of  $48,000

which  is tax free. In addition, he will get an annual

entertainment allowance of $10,000, also tax free. The

expenses  for  maintaining the President's  household,

together with salaries for his personal staff, come to

$474,000  a year. By clause 3 of the Bill, the  amount

payable  under this Schedule is charged on and payable

out of the Consolidated Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunity is also taken in the Bill to provide for

the  President's pension when he retires. At  present,

there is no statutory provision for the payment  of  a

pension to a former President. All civil servants  are

given  pension  rights; in Singapore, all  persons  in

employment have at least the protection of the Central

Provident Fund to provide for them and their  families

in  their  retiring years; and, since July last  year,

even politicians who have been M.P.s can have pensions

provided  certain  conditions  are  met.  It  is  only

reasonable therefore that our President, who holds the

highest  office  in the land, should be  superannuated

for his services on his ceasing to be a President.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part II of the Bill, therefore, provides for the

payment of pension or gratuity to "former" Presidents.

Clause 8 of the Bill provides that a former President,

who  has  ceased to hold office, shall  be  granted  a

pension  or  gratuity of such amount  and  under  such

circumstances as Parliament may determine. No specific

period  of  service as a President is prescribed,  and

the Bill leaves it to the discretion of Parliament  to

determine the amount to be paid. This discretion  will

give  flexibility to meet changing circumstances,  and

Parliament can be relied upon to determine  an  amount

that  would  allow a former President  to  maintain  a

standard of life in keeping with the exalted office he

has held.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill has a threefold purpose. Members may

recall  that  a Gift Voucher Scheme was introduced  in

May  last  year with the object of encouraging  newly-weds,  national servicemen and others to save  in  the

Postal  Savings Bank. It has been found  necessary  to

provide legislative authority in connection with  this

Scheme and, therefore, a new section 7A is inserted in

the  Ordinance  to  empower the Postmaster-General  to

sell  Post  Office Savings Bank Gift Vouchers  and  to

accept them as deposits into Post Office Savings  Bank

accounts.  Section 21 is also amended to  empower  the

Minister to prescribe conditions for the sale,  issue,

refund, etc, of such vouchers. These amendments are to

be   back-dated  to  2nd  May,  1969,  the   date   of

introduction of the Gift Voucher Scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other purposes of this Bill are to amend

sections 9 and 11 (1) which deal with the prescription

of  interest rates and the investments of Post  Office

Savings Bank funds respectively. At present, section 9

allows a variation in the interest rates to be paid on

savings deposits after giving three months' notice  in

the  Government Gazette. For greater flexibility, this

requirement of three months' notice is being  deleted.

Similarly, section  11(1)  is   amended   to   allow

flexibility  of  investments.  The  amendment  confers

wider powers upon the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>



Minister  to direct investment of Post Office  Savings

Bank  deposits in stocks, funds and securities  as  he

may approve.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main object of this Bill is to enable Singapore

to adopt the International Load Line Convention, 1966.

The  Load  Line  (i.e.  Plimsoll Mark)  indicates  the

maximum  depth  to  which a ship  can  be  loaded.  At

present,  the Load Line Convention, 1930,  applies  to

Singapore,  and  is  implemented  by  United   Kingdom

legislation which was extended to Singapore.  The  new

International  Convention of  1966,  which  came  into

force   in  July  1968,  takes  into  account   modern

technological  advances in shipbuilding  and  provides

for  tankers  of  over 600 feet  in  length.  The  new

Convention  also  provides certain  advantages  -  for

example,  it  allows deeper loading which  results  in

about  4  per cent increase in carrying capacity,  and

therefore  earning capacity, for some tankers.  It  is

necessary  for Singapore to accept the 1966 Convention

so  that  Singapore-registered  ships  can  enjoy  the

benefits  of  deeper  loading, and  furthermore  ships

calling  at  Singapore are often loaded in  accordance

with the 1966 Convention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of acceptance of the Convention, the

Merchant Shipping Ordinance needs to be amended. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>



existing  load  line provisions are  deleted  and  new

provisions substituted. Members may wish to  refer  to

relevant provisions contained in clause 23 of the Bill

which, inter alia:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) prohibits ships from sailing without Load Line

certificates;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) empowers the Minister to exempt ships under

certain    circumstances,    and    to    appoint

classification  societies  to  issue  Load   Line

certificates; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) empowers the Minister to make regulations for

the purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another amendment provides for the licensing of all

harbour  craft operating for trade or business  within

Singapore territorial waters. At present harbour craft

which  are registered either in Singapore or elsewhere

are  exempted  from licensing. This  means  that  such

craft  are  not  subject to control and can  therefore

avoid  safety and other requirements. There have  been

instances  where condemned craft sold for breaking  up

as  scrap  were subsequently registered under  foreign

flags  and  being operated as harbour craft.  This  is

clearly  undesirable on grounds of safety. The  object

is  achieved by amending section 453 of the Ordinance,

vide clause 36 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the provisions in the Bill deal with

amendments    recommended   by    the    Law    Review

Commissioners, and are mainly amendments consequential

on constitutional changes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like to raise a very small point. As far  as  I

can  see,  it will require a great number of qualified

surveyors of ships to ensure the proper implementation

of  this Bill. I am just wondering whether the present

number of qualified surveyors in Singapore is adequate

to cope with this work.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The Member for Jalan Kayu has

raised  a  fair  point.  That  is  why  we  have  made

provision    to   accept   certificates   issued    by

classification   societies  which   are   well   known

throughout the world. It will not be necessary for our

surveyors  to survey the ships. They need only  accept

the  certificates and classify them as being  adequate

for  our  purpose. We have a few surveyors in  service

who will be able to handle the rest.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the  Bill  be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National service was first introduced in Singapore

in  1967  and administered under the National  Service

Ordinance,  1952,  which  is  in  turn  based  on  the

Federation  of  Malaysia Ordinance 37 of  1952.  Since

then,  new  demands and recent changes in the  policy,

administration and management of national  service  in

Singapore have rendered it necessary to introduce  new

legislation on the subject. The said National  Service

Ordinance,  1952, has been found to be  inadequate  to

meet  such  changed  conditions.  Accordingly,  a  new

Enlistment Bill has been drafted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Enlistment Bill any citizen or a permanent

resident  of Singapore between the ages of 18  and  40

residing  within or without the Republic is liable  to

be  enlisted  for national service,  in  the  case  of

officers  and  persons  who  possess  special   skills

required by the armed forces, the maximum age for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>



national  service liability is 50. However, this  does

not  necessarily  mean that all persons  in  such  age

group  will  actually be called  up.  With  the  rapid

expansion  in the technical services of the  Singapore

Armed  Forces, highly trained and qualified  personnel

will  have  to  be  made available to  cater  for  the

maintenance   and  running  of  highly   sophisticated

equipment  and  weaponry  which  the  Singapore  Armed

Forces  are  acquiring over the next  few  years.  The

provision  of the Bill has extended the age limit  for

service  from  40 years to 50 years in order  to  make

available  to the Singapore Armed Forces  persons  who

have had specialised training and extensive experience

which  may  normally  not be available  from  ordinary

manpower resources. Some of the special skills we have

in mind are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Electronic engineering,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Electrical engineering,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Telecommunication engineering,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Mechanical engineering,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Marine engineering,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Aeronautical engineering,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Naval architecture, and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Automobile engineering.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National service under the Bill consists of any one

of three types of service:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) full-time service for a period of two years or,

in  the case of officers or persons selected  for

officer training, for a period of three years;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) reserve service, which means either service on a

part-time basis consisting of -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) a period of 14 days followed by eight hours

per week during the first six months service, and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) a period of seven days annually and three

hours per week or six hours per fort night or 12

hours per month after the first six months;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>



or  for periods not exceeding in the aggregate 40

days annually.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) mobilized service when the interests of Singapore

so require



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides that any person who is

registered  or  is  liable to  register  for  national

service  thereunder shall not leave or remain  outside

Singapore  unless he is in possession of a valid  exit

permit. The granting of such exit permits will be very

strictly implemented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be no automatic postponement or exemption

from  national  service liability for  any  person  or

class  of persons by virtue of profession, calling  or

otherwise. Such postponement or exemption will only be

by way of specific orders of the proper authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also provision made under the Bill for

enlistment  of persons in regular service. Ordinarily,

persons  who are not in national service can apply  to

serve as regular members of the Singapore Armed Forces

under such terms and conditions as may be prescribed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to protect the rights and employment

interests of national servicemen, Part V of  the  Bill

imposes on employers three main duties:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) employers are required to reinstate in their

employment  full-time or mobilized national servicemen

who  were employed by them for a continuous period  of

at least six months preceding the day they were called

up for service;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) employers shall not dismiss a person solely or

mainly by reason of his having been called up;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) employers of the person ordered to report for

national service shall grant him leave of absence

during the period of such service and shall be obliged

to pay the difference between an employee's service

pay and his civilian pay when he is called up for

reserve or mobilized service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers who have paid the difference between their

employee's service and civilian pay shall be  entitled

under   regulations  to  claim  from  Government   for

reimbursement thereof.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>



Similarly, self-employed persons shall be paid make-up

pay  in  the  same  manner as those who  are  employed

except  that their civilian earnings shall be  limited

to  the  maximum of $1,500 per month. Thus, no make-up

pay  will be payable in respect of that part of  their

civilian  earnings which is in excess  of  $1,500  per

month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any person who fails to comply with any provision

under the Bill shall be guilty of an offence and  upon

conviction thereunder be liable to imprisonment for  a

term  not  exceeding three years  or  to  a  fine  not

exceeding  $5,000  or  to both such  imprisonment  and

fine.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the purpose of this Bill is to  provide

various   measures  for  enlistment  of  persons   who

include:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) all those persons who, on reaching the age of 1

6½  years, should go for national service registration

and medical check-up; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) all those persons in the age group between

18  years  and 40 years who are citizens and  who  are

required to enlist for national service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for full-time national

service,  reserve  service, and mobilised  service  in

cases  of emergency. All these are explained in  great

detail in the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although our national service scheme has been

implemented for only a few years, the facts have shown

that  we  have  achieved  100 per  cent  success.  All

parents understand the Government's policy of building

up  our national defence because they realise that, as

an  independent newly emergent country, we should have

our  own defence capability. Therefore, they encourage

their children to take up national service in order to

receive  military training and to shoulder the  sacred

task of defending their country. Our young men

have  also shown their courage, resolution and loyalty

in  national defence. I believe that, for the sake  of

our  national  defence, independence, sovereignty  and

territorial  integrity, all loyal  citizens  will  not

oppose  national service and will not  object  to  its

importance  to our country. They will agree  with  the

principle of national service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, we must also recognise that since

the implementation of the national service scheme,  we

have  been experiencing a shortage of labour or skills

in  certain fields. In this respect, I would like  the

Minister to clarify the Government's policy of opening

the  door  wider  to non-citizens to  apply  for  work

permits. The questions are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Whether the implementation of this Bill will

create a labour shortage in our labour market. If so,

has the Minister any remedial measures?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What is the Government's policy in relation to

applications  by students in colleges and universities

for  delayed  or postponed national service?  Has  the

Government any better arrangement whereby there can be

a  balance between military training and the education

of  the  boys  so  that there will be no  shortage  of

personnel  for  nation building,  and  no  undesirable

consequences in this respect?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The Bill contains certain provisions regarding

the  employment of national servicemen. These are  all

very  good.  But  if  certain employers  disregard  or

infringe  these  provisions, what  measures  will  the

Government take to deal with them?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The Government has announced that it will give

priority   of  employment  opportunities  to  national

service  personnel. This is a very reasonable  measure

and  it  has  been announced many times.  But  I  have

recently  received  complaints from  people  who  have

undergone two years' full-time national service. Their

complaint is that they have not been able to  get  any

jobs  even after two or three months of their  release

from  national  service.  I  hope  the  Minister   can

investigate  into this matter and try  to  remedy  it.

However, national service



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>



is  the bounden duty of every citizen. If we want  our

country  to  survive,  we must  ensure  that  we  have

stability and progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure that in

his  heart of hearts the Member for Sembawang welcomes

national service. I shall try to clear up his doubts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have mentioned in this House before that there is

no  question of a labour shortage being caused when we

conscript the 18-year olds. What I said was that there

would  be  a  temporary  labour shortage  while  these

people are in national service. There would be a delay

of  two  years  before they come out into  the  labour

market. Moreover, the present labour shortage  is  not

so  much a shortage of unskilled labour. When a boy or

a  girl  of  18  years leaves school,  he  or  she  is

considered  as unskilled labour. The present  shortage

is greater in respect of skilled labour than unskilled

labour. So I would say that enlistment or conscription

of  our 18-year olds will not cause a labour shortage.

It   is   actually   a  delay  in  supplying   labour.

Conscription first began in 1967. And in 1969 some  of

the  national servicemen were released,  and  quite  a

large number of them have been placed in employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the complaint voiced by the Member

for  Sembawang  -that those who have  been  discharged

from  the armed forces after a service of two or three

years,  as  the  case  may be, have  found  themselves

without  jobs for three months or so. We will  try  to

place  all  discharged  personnel  in  employment   as

quickly as possible, but this takes time. In our short

experience of national service, we have found that  we

have   had  no  difficulty  in  placing  a  discharged

national  serviceman in employment if he is  not  very

particular.  Some of them are really choosey  as  they

feel  that  they  deserve  more  than  what  they  are

offered. But I think that less than five per cent  are

still unplaced after three months of their discharge.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>



In  most  cases,  if  a  national  serviceman  has   a

realistic assessment of his capabilities, a  job  will

be found for him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the problem of either conscripting the 18-year olds or allowing them to continue with their

education, we have considered that very carefully  and

have  devised  a scheme. I would like  to  inform  the

House  that  last  year, of those who  have  the  full

Higher  School  Certificate, we have  given  deferment

from national service to 855, and have allowed them to

proceed to higher institutions of learning. As for the

rest of those who have obtained the full H.S.C., about

572  have  not been called up, and we expect  to  call

them up by June.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a discussion going on at present between my

officers  and  those from the institutions  of  higher

learning,  particularly  Nanyang  University  and  the

University  of  Singapore, to  make  arrangements  for

conscripts  with full H.S.C, qualifications  to  do  a

year's course of study if they are chosen as officers.

With  this arrangement, the completion of three years'

service  in  the Army would be taken as equivalent  to

the  first year in the university, so that after their

discharge as officers of the armed forces, they  could

join  the  university at the second-year level.  There

are  a  lot  of details to be worked out,  but  I  can

assure Members that both parties, i.e., officials from

the  universities  and my officers, are  trying  their

very  best  to work out a solution for those  who  are

conscripted  and  fit enough to  be  officers  in  the

Singapore  Armed Forces to save a year in  the  higher

institutions  of  learning after they  are  discharged

from national service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question raised by the Member for Sembawang

concerns  the  employment of national  servicemen.  He

asked  me whether we can take action against employers

who  infringe the provisions of the Bill.  I  think  I

have  already mentioned that any person who  fails  to

comply  with  any  of the provisions under  this  Bill

shall   be   guilty  of  an  offence  and  liable   to

imprisonment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>



for  a term not exceeding three years or to a fine not

exceeding   $5,000,   or  to  both   such   fine   and

imprisonment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I have fully replied to all the queries raised.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the   Minister  has  omitted  to  answer  one  of   my

questions. What is the Government's policy with regard

to non-citizens?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, the Enlistment Bill gives no

option  to  a permanent resident, who is a non-citizen

of  Singapore,  not  to  serve.  Under  this  Bill,  a

permanent resident in Singapore is liable to be called

up. However, there is no provision for a person who is

a non-citizen and a non-resident of Singapore to serve

in our armed forces at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, does the

Minister  mean that as long as a person is a permanent

resident  of  Singapore,  even  though  he  is  not  a

citizen, he is liable to be called up under this Bill?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Acting Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Social Affairs (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Second-hand Dealers (Amendment)

Bill is to empower the Police to enter and search  the

premises   of  unlicensed  second-hand  dealers.   The

Ministry  of  Social  Affairs  is  the  administrative

authority   for  the  Second-hand  Dealers  Ordinance,

whilst  the  Police are responsible for licensing  and

control  of  such  dealers.  The  Ordinance  now  only

empowers  the  Police  to  enter  and  search  without

warrant  the  premises of licensed second-hand  dealer

shops when they have reason to suspect that stolen  or

lost property is kept therein. The Police have no such

power,  however, in respect of premises where  second-hand  goods  are  sold without a licence.  To  justify

their  entry into such unlicensed premises, the Police

have  to  rely  on  the  provisions  of  the  Criminal

Procedure  Code. The procedure is cumbersome  in  that

the  Police  must  obtain, in the  first  instance,  a

search warrant from a Magistrate's Court. If there  is

insufficient  time  to apply for a search  warrant,  a

list  of the articles stolen or missing must be  taken

down  in  writing with a declaration  stating  that  a

robbery or theft has been committed and, moreover, the

person  who lost the goods or his representative  must

accompany the police officer in the search. Powers  of

summary   search   are  limited  to  certain   special

circumstances, for example, where the premises  to  be

searched are used by any person who has been convicted

of receiving stolen property or harbouring thieves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is therefore proposed to amend the Second-hand Dealers Ordinance in order to give the Police

power  to  enter and search without warrant  any  shop

where  there is reason to suspect that any  person  is

dealing in second-hand goods without a licence and  to

seize such goods found therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<div align="center"><b>PROHIBITION ON SMOKING IN CERTAIN PLACES BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Acting Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Health (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a simple piece of social legislation

necessitated  by the inconsiderate behaviour  of  some

smokers   in  public  places,  such  as  cinemas   and

theatres.  I  think Members will agree that  it  is  a

matter  of  survival for ourselves  that  our  society

should  be a closely knitted one with special emphasis

on  the  strict exercise of social discipline  by  its

members.  Such  a pattern of life makes it  imperative

for  every member of society to value the comfort  and

convenience of his fellow citizens as much as his own,

and  that he should completely and voluntarily refrain

from acts that make life miserable for others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In matters such as smoking in public, the ideal

solution is for the smoker to exercise self-discipline

and  to see to it that his smoking does not cause  any

discomfort  to persons around him. However,  this  has

not always been the case. Only after traditional forms

of  public  exhortation  have failed  to  produce  the

desired  effect  is the law being invoked  to  give  a

helping  hand,  in fact, the Ministry  of  Health  has

given  attention to the problem of smoking in  cinemas

and  theatres since 1966. The voluntary ban on smoking

in  certain cinemas which started in 1967 has not been

very fruitful in that, in practice, the patrons of the

cinemas  concerned have simply and invariably  ignored

the management's request to refrain from smoking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be pointed out that smoking under crowded

conditions   within  enclosed  spaces   or   in   air-conditioned rooms causes a nuisance and irritation  to

the other occupants, especially the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>



non-smokers. Members of this House must have  had  the

unpleasant  experience of leaving the  cinema  or  the

theaters after the day's last show with their clothing

and even the articles inside their pockets reeking  of

nothing  but tobacco smoke. Further, the smoke  screen

in  the  auditorium  not only interferes  with  proper

viewing,  but  also makes the eyes smart.  This  Bill,

however,   by  prohibiting  smoking  in  cinemas   and

theatres,  and  certain  other  places  that  may   be

specified by the Minister, is designed to remove  this

source  of  nuisance and irritation, thereby enhancing

the pleasure and comfort of the patrons of the cinemas

and theatres as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to prohibit smoking in the auditorium

of any cinema or theatre and in any specified building

at any time during which these are open to the public.

The  expressions  "cinema", "theatre"  and  "specified

building" have been carefully defined. The prohibition

on  smoking  is  confined only to  the  auditorium  of

cinemas  and theatres to which members of  the  public

are  admitted upon payment of admission fees, and only

during  the periods when these are open to the public.

The  premises of clubs, associations and the like have

been  expressly  excluded from  this  prohibition.  In

order  to  obviate the need for an amending Act  at  a

future  date, the Minister is empowered, under  clause

3,  to  specify in the Gazette any particular building

or class of buildings or part thereof to which members

of  the  public have access as being a place or places

in   which  smoking  shall  not  be  permitted  either

permanently or for such period or periods  as  he  may

deem fit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalty for smoking in prohibited places is a

fine not exceeding $500 and enforcement action will be

by  means of ticketing. This device has been found  to

be very suitable, effective and expeditious in dealing

with  persons caught littering in public places  under

section  26  of the Environmental Public  Health  Act,

1968.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main task of enforcing the prohibition will fall

on  the  public  health auxiliaries  attached  to  the

Public  Health Division and police officers.  Managers

of cinemas, theatres and other specified buildings are

required  to  display  notices in  four  languages  in

conspicuous  positions stating that smoking  has  been

prohibited and the penalty provided therefor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsibility has also been placed on managers and

certain  authorised  employees  of  these  places   to

request  any persons smoking therein to cease  smoking

forthwith,  and  if such persons fail to  comply  with

their  request,  to require them to  leave  the  place

forthwith  without  entitlement to  refund  of  ticket

money. Should the management encounter any difficulty,

they may seek the assistance of any police officer  or

a  public health auxiliary. Provisions have also  been

included for the punishment of any person who  abuses,

hinders  or  assaults the manager  or  any  authorised

employee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other clauses are explained in greater detail in

the  Explanatory Note accompanying the Bill, and I  do

not  wish to take up the time of this House to  repeat

them.  All I need stress is that the success  of  this

measure  depends  very much on  the  support  and  co-operation the public give to the Government.  The  law

cannot  be everywhere. There is nothing more effective

than  the  reproachful eye of the public to prevent  a

smoker  from causing nuisance to his fellow  citizens.

With the law spelt out clearly on their side, the non-smoking public can now stand up to assert their  right

to  more  comfortable conditions in cinemas,  theatres

and other specified places.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt that this Bill will have the support

of  Members  of this House and it is for  the  greater

good of all the patrons of cinemas and theatres, while

it will not cause any hardship to any person, not even

to the smokers themselves. I expect that after a while

they  will  acquire  the good  habit  of  looking  for

convenient places when the urge to smoke comes, places



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>



such as the toilets or lobbies where they can smoke to

their  hearts'  content  without  causing  any  public

discomfort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish further to assure Members that enforcement

action   will  only  be  taken  after  an  educational

campaign which will be conducted later this year,  and

that   this  law  will  be  applied  with  the  utmost

discretion and consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.58 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok. Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I am a smoker and I enjoy smoking.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Against the

doctor's advice!



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, any Bill that is introduced

should  be  a  Bill that is enforceable, and  strictly

enforceable.  For  the last few years,  we  have  seen

notices  in  cinema halls quite prominently  displayed

requesting patrons not to smoke. They have been abused

and  I  am afraid they will continue to be abused.  We

see   in  the  theatres  persons  smoking.  There  are

portions  in  the  buses  -public  transport  -  where

smoking  is allowed and a front portion where  smoking

is  not  allowed. Yet any bus traveller will tell  you

that  this  regulation is not at all  enforced.  Taxi-drivers,  Sir,  are, I think, under the Ordinance  not

allowed to smoke. You need only stand on the road  and

you  can see taxi-drivers smoking happily. Just a  few

days  ago,  I  read  a  reply from  the  Registrar  of

Vehicles  that  on inspection every  six  months,  the

Registry  sees  to it that taxis contain  an  ashtray.

Sir,  I  travel in a taxi almost every day and I  have

yet  to  come  across a taxi with, an ashtray  in  the

front seat, or the back seat for that matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sometimes go to the theatre and I notice that

people who are smokers start to smoke as soon as  they

see advertisements of cigarettes on the screen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, during the last Budget

debate,  I  made a point about doing away  with  these

advertisements, but the Minister for  Health  did  not

give me an answer. The melodious jingles on cigarettes

put  on TV and over the radio are repeated by children

and  they sound better than the pop songs that we hear

of. Sir, what should I do, as a smoker, when I go to a

theatre  and  see  an advertisement,  "Smoke  Kingsize

Cigarettes", and, at the same time, another notice  by

the side telling me not to smoke?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is going to enforce the law of no-smoking in

cinemas? The managers, assistant managers and  ushers?

Sir,  in  every  cinema there are only  two  or  three

ushers  and they cannot be looking out for people  who

smoke.  Furthermore, this is not a law  which  can  be

easily enforceable. I agree with the Minister that, as

a  follow-up to this Bill, there should be a  campaign

like  the "Anti-litter Campaign" that we had recently.

I  wish  the Minister luck and I hope this law can  be

enforceable. But I have my misgivings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill, which the Minister spoke

about,  is,  I  think,  rather  loose  and  gives  the

Minister far too much powers. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Minister may, by notification in the Gazette

and  subject to such conditions as he may  think  fit,

specify  any  building or part  thereof  or  class  of

buildings  or  parts thereof to which members  of  the

public have access as being a place or places in which

smoking  shall not be permitted either permanently  or

for such period or periods as he may think fit.'



<br><br>Sir,  I  know that the Minister for Health is  a  non-smoker.  One day he may decide to prohibit smoking  in

the  Ministry of Health. I think this law may  not  be

workable  if it applies only to theatres. I  was  just

wondering whether stricter measures cannot be taken to

prohibit  smoking  in buses and taxis  also.  And  the

precondition is that we have to ban advertisements  of

cigarettes on T.V., cinemas and over the radio, which,

I believe, is more important than this legislation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

this  Bill seeks to prohibit smoking in certain places

which  include cinemas. Undoubtedly this measure  will

cause  some inconvenience to smokers in certain places

at  certain  times. Possibly these people may  include

some  Members of the House who have taken to  smoking.

But  to  those  members of the  public  who  are  non-smokers,  this  Bill brings good tidings.  As  a  non-

smoker, I welcome the introduction of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, speaking dispassionately, smoking is a bad

habit. Medical practitioners have made researches into

smoking  and  have found that it is harmful  and  will

cause  cancer  of  the  lungs. They  therefore  advise

people  that  if they value their lives at  all,  they

should  not  smoke. From the economic point  of  view,

smoking is a waste of money because money is literally

going  up  in  smoke. Of course, to  people  who  have

money,  the  amount  that they  spend  on  smoking  is

negligible.  But to a person whose monthly  income  is

$100  to  $200, the necessity to satisfy his  urge  to

smoke  by  spending a dollar or two a day  will  bring

considerable hardship to his family. In spite  of  the

harm  in  smoking,  the  number  of  smokers  is   not

decreasing.  That  is  because  one  man's  poison  is

another man's food.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill before us today is not to enforce a

complete ban on smoking. It seeks to ban smoking  only

in  certain places. As a matter of fact, nobody at the

present juncture expects the Government to introduce a

Bill to ban smoking totally, because doing so will  be

unwise. That would mean a loss of revenue in terms  of

hundreds of thousands of dollars. But, in any case, it

is  my view that in order to bring up a healthy second

generation,  we have the responsibility  of  educating

our  younger generation, particularly children in  the

schools,  to cultivate good habits, which include  the

habit  of  not  smoking. I do  not  know  whether  the

Minister for Health agrees with this point of view. No

doubt  we  are an open and free society and  everybody

has the freedom to indulge his propensity for smoking.

But this freedom



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>



is  limited  to  the extent that  it  should  not

interfere  with the comfort of others.  Therefore,  in

public  places like cinemas or public buses, we should

respect  the feelings of those around us. We must  not

do  things  which  will cause them any  discomfort  or

inconvenience. For example, in the cinema, if you  are

concentrating on the screen and enjoying the show  and

the people around you happen to be smokers who have no

regard  for  your feelings or your comfort,  then  you

will   be  literally  smoked  in!  These  people  will

continue  to smoke, and because they smoke,  they  may

cough  and spit. This will nauseate you. This kind  of

public  behaviour  will really  adversely  affect  the

feelings and comfort of others around them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are some cinemas which screen notices requesting the audience not to smoke. But people who are smokers continue to smoke, and because there is no enforcement of these notices, they are simply ignored. I believe this Bill will bring better results and make our public places, like the

cinemas,  better,  healthier and  cleaner  places  for

those  members  of the public who wish  to  enjoy  the

facilities  provided.  I must however  admit  that  it

takes time to cultivate a good habit. On this basis, I

express  the  hope that in the earlier stages  of  the

implementation of this Bill, the punishment meted  out

to  offenders  should  not be too  severe.  A  warning

should  be  given  to  the first offender.  We  should

enforce  the  law  with some humane considerations.  I

believe  that  only in this way can we achieve  better

results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to ensure the smooth implementation of

this  Bill,  I  wish  to  suggest  that,  firstly,   a

publicity  campaign  should  be  carried  out  in  the

newspapers, over the Radio and Rediffusion and on T.V.

to  make the people understand the intentions  of  the

Bill  and  to  help  them obey the law.  Secondly,  in

places  where  smoking is banned, such as  cinemas  or

buses,  notices  should  be  displayed  in  the   four

official  languages so that members of the public  are

made to realise that the ban is on and that no offence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>



should  be  committed  out of ignorance.  I  hope  the

Minister will give due consideration to my proposals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, generally speaking, it is my view that the Bill

has  the  same good intentions as the "Keep  Singapore

Clean  Campaign", that is, to inculcate in our  people

good social habits and discipline. I believe this Bill

will receive wide support from the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  fully  support  the  Bill to  prohibit  smoking  in

cinemas  or theatres. I only regret that the  Minister

did  not include the prohibition of smoking in  public

buses  and  taxis. I sincerely hope that at  the  next

sitting,  if  possible,  the  Minister  will  move  an

amendment  to  include the prohibition of  smoking  in

buses  and taxis so that there will be no nuisance  to

the passengers.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  merely  to underline the points that  have  been

brought  up,  especially  by  the  Member  for   Telok

Blangah. One of his points regarding the necessity  to

prohibit   smoking  in  buses  too  has   again   been

emphasised. But I wish to say how fortuitous it is and

what a happy coincidence that the Acting Minister  for

Health  is  also the Minister for Culture! That  being

the case, perhaps notice can be taken of the necessity

to  encourage  theatre managers  to  remove  cigarette

advertisements from the screen. In order to do that, I

think  the Ministry of Culture should set the  example

by  removing these advertisements from T.V, and  over

the radio.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must thank

Members  for their enthusiastic support for this  Bill

and  I am quite sure that the Ministry of Health  will

be  able  to carry out all the suggestions put forward

by them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only need to reply in brief to several points made

by  Members. In the first place, the Member for  Telok

Blangah has complained about the lack of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>



ashtrays  in  taxis and buses. As a smoker  -  he  has

admitted  this  - he finds the lack of  this  facility

very  inconvenient. But I do not think he  need  worry

about  the enforcement of this Bill. Judging from  the

speech   he   has   made  just  now   condemning   the

irresponsible behaviour of smokers, I do not think  he

will  want to run the risk of being caught smoking  in

an auditorium!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complaint about the lack of ashtrays in taxis

and  buses  has  to  be referred to the  Registrar  of

Vehicles. I am sure he will look into this matter more

closely.  Smoking  in buses is very  undesirable.  The

public, especially the non-smoking public, should play

their  part more effectively. I do not think we should

leave  everything  to the law. The  public  should  be

asked  to  play an effective role in maintaining  good

social order. If the provisions in this Bill are found

to  be  inadequate, I am sure the Ministry  of  Health

will  put  forward  further amendments  to  strengthen

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards advertisements of cigarettes in public,

especially on television and over the radio,  I  agree

that  it is morally unjustifiable for these two  media

to  advertise them when the Government is  prohibiting

smoking  in cinemas and theatres. However, I must  say

that most of the contracts to advertise cigarettes  on

TV, and  over the radio were accepted some time  ago,

and  most of them run for a period of at least  twelve

months.  It is now our policy not to accept  contracts

for  advertisements of cigarettes  which  will  expire

later  than  the end of this year. It is fair  at  the

present  moment to allow these contracts to run  their

natural  course.  It  is not considered  necessary  to

terminate them immediately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for advertising smoking in public, the Government

will  probably put forward certain amendments to  this

House



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>



to prohibit all forms of advertisements of cigarettes

as from 1st January, 1971. This is to prohibit the

advertisement of cigarettes in all media - newspapers,

magazines, T.V, and Radio, and billboards and so on.

Members will thus have no cause for complaint.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do agree with the sentiments expressed by the

Member  for Sembawang, and his strong condemnation  of

smoking in public. However, I think we should  have  a

certain degree of freedom in this country. Although we

can  prohibit smoking in cinemas, theatres and certain

specific  places, it is not desirable to  prohibit  it

altogether.  Otherwise, we would  make  the  lives  of

smokers  very miserable. I do not think we  should  do

that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I think I have to clarify one point.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister has replied and I am

afraid you cannot say anything more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Jek Yeun Thong].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be

fixed." - [Mr Barker].
