<div align="center"><b>ORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>RETIRED CIVIL SERVANTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Re-employment in Government service)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for

Finance (a) how many civil servants have retired

on reaching the age-limit since 9th August, 1965;

(b) how many of them have been re-employed in

Government service and which department employs

the most; (c) how many retired officers have been

re-employed for more than one year, the reasons

for their continued employment and the basic

salaries they are being paid; and (d) if

Government will consider avOiding the re-employment of retired officers for more than one

year so as to make more jobs available for

Singapore's growing population.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Sir,

a total of 1,075 civil servants retired on

reaching the age limit since 9th August, 1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of these, 73 persons or 6.8 per cent have been

re-employed. The hospitals and primary schools

employed ihe largest numbers. The hospitals le

employed a total ef 16 pensioners, 14 of whom are

medical ancillary staff and 2 are medical

officers. The primary schools re-employed 12

retired teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-nine retired officers have been re-employed for more than one year. A re-employed

pensioner is normally paid four-fifths of basic

salary and variable allowance or the difference

between his last drawn salary and his pension,

whichever is the lesser.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government does not re-employ retired

officers without good reason. The number of

retired officers re-employed for more than one

year, namely, 29, will not make any difference to

the level of unemployment.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, if I am not wrong, the Minister

for  Education  has stated that there  are  enough

teachers.  Why are retired teachers now being  re-employed?

very large number.

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Main Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure

for the year 1968 have been considered and

approved by the House as Cmd. Paper 26 of 1967.

Under section 85 of the Constitution of Singapore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>

Heads of Expenditure other than statutory

expenditure to be met from the Consolidated Fund

have to be included in a Bill to be known as the

Supply Bill. The purpose of such a Bill is to

provide for the issue from the Consolidated Fund

of the sums necessary to meet the expenditure and

the appropriation of these sums for the purposes

specified therein.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supply Bill before Members is to give

legislative approval for the issue of funds from

the Consolidated Fund to meet the sums of

expenditure for 1968. In the Schedule to the Bill

are shown the various Heads of Expenditure and the

sums that may be incurred in respect of each Head.

These have been approved by the House in the

Estimates of Expenditure for 1968 and appear in

pages 53 and 54 of Paper Cmd. 26 of 1967.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the Supply Bill is approved, I will be

empowered to issue warrants authorising

expenditure up to the amount under each Head as

shown in the Bill to be paid out of the Consolidated Fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to provide statutory

authority in accordance with clause 2 of Article

85 of the Constitution of Singapore for additional

provisions for expenditure in excess of the pro

visions for expenditure authorised in the Supply

Act, 1966. These additional sums have been

<div align="center"><b>LABOUR (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a short Bill. Its purpose is to seek

discretionary powers for the Minister to grant

exemptions from the prohibition of female workmen

working at night. "night" in the context of the

present provisions of the law means a period of

not less than 11 consecutive hours including the

interval between ten o'clock in the evening and

five o'clock in the morning or such other interval

of seven hours as the Minister may by notification

in the Gazette prescribe for any particular

industrial undertaking or branch thereof or kind

of labour. The restriction on the employment at

night of female workmen is in accordance with the

requirements of the International Labour

Convention and was introduced into the Labour

Ordinance in 1955. The situation then existing did



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>



not warrant the employment in Singapore of female

labour at night. However, with the increasing

impetus of industrialisation in Singapore, certain

export-orientated industries find it increasingly

difficult to meet production targets without

introducing a night shift in which female

employees may have to be employed in certain kinds

of labour. The law as it stands, however, will not

permit the employment of female workers beyond

twelve midnight in view of the very restrictive

interval period of seven hours contained in the

law. Apart from allowing for the variation of this

prohibited interval, there is no provision for the

lifting of the restriction entirely in certain

cases. The structure of our economy has changed

and will continue to change more speedily with the

progress of industrialisation, and it will be

necessary, in the interest of the economy, for

some factories, especially those which are export-orientated, to work on a 24-hour shift system

which will involve the employment of female

workmen at night in certain kinds of labour. It

is, therefore, necessary to take account of the

situation to ensure that existing legislation does

not stifle industrial progress and expansion and

deprive the creation of employment opportunities

to our people. The logic of the situation demands

that the present legal restriction on the

employment of female workers during a night shift

should be relaxed so that certain industries or

undertakings can introduce a night shift and

increase their productive capacity to meet the

demands of our export market. What is even more

important to us is that by allowing female workers

to work in the third shift, we are able not only

to utilise the expensive equipment and factory

space more profitably, but also to create more

employment opportunities for our workers. A number

of countries have provided for the relaxation of

night work in respect of female employees. These

countries include the United Kingdom and Japan. It

is pertinent to point out that highly

industrialised countries have thought it necessary

to relax the restriction in the interest of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>



their economy and, therefore, a relaxation of this

nature would be of even greater benefit to a

developing economy such as ours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are certain categories

of female employees who even now work in shifts

round the clock, tor example, nurses and airline

workers in consonance with the social and economic

demands of these vocations. It must also be

mentioned that our female population today is more

progressive and sophisticated than they were

before, and that the well-developed social

services in the country serve their needs most

satisfactorily, both from the health and security

points of view.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present amendment does not do away with the

existing restrictions, but only gives powers to

the Minister to grant exemptions where it is

desirable in the public interest to do so for the

purpose of maintaining or increasing the

efficiency of industry. It will not in any way

affect the protection that female employees now

enjoy, because before an exemption is granted

their interest will be very carefully considered

and in most cases we will consult the union before

we agree to exempt. But this is only applicable to

those unions which are willing to work with the

law. To the Communist-controlled unions which have

every intention to break the law, I say it is a

waste of time to consult them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Joo Chiat):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I know it is rather difficult to

use certain terms and words. But these two words

"female workmen" really offend me. I cannot, for

the life of me, understand why our workmen should

become females. Why cannot we use better terms

like "female labourers", "female employees" or

"female workers", rather than "female workmen"?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I seem to remember that these are

words used in the Ordinance which this Bill seeks

to amend.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of

the proposed Labour (Amendment) Bill, 1967. My

reason in supporting the proposed amendment Bill

is that, from my experience as one of the

secretaries of the Pioneer Industries Employees'

Union, I have found that the absolute prohibition

against the employment of female workers in night

shifts is not conducive to [he industrial

development of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain industries, such as the

textile industry, where the jobs to be performed

by workers are of a very delicate nature requiring

infinite patience and a light touch. For such kind

of work, women workers are riiore suitable than

male workers. But because of the present absolute

prohibition against employing women workers on

night shifts, employers in such industries have no

other choice but to employ male workers during the

night shifts. As to why night shifts are

necessary, the explanation is that because it is

economical to utilise a set of equipment

continuously rather than to utilise double the

equipment half the time only. Also, the exigency

of business may require factories to operate

continuously for 24 hours a day in order to enable

deadlines for deliveries to be met.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the present session in this House,

Members have heard the Minister for Finance

analyse the economic situation in Singapore and

emphasise the need for Singapore to develop more

industries and to cultivate a bigger export

market. One factor which may attract foreign

investors to Singapore and determine the

competitiveness of Singapore goods in foreign

markets is productivity of labour. The use of male

workers on night shifts in industries where women

workers are more suitable is not a circumstance

which is conducive to the promotion of higher

productivity of labour. Members of this House may

then ask why it is not satisfactory to employ male

workers in such industries. One explanation may be

that male workers who are employed on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>



such night shifts find the work uninteresting and

uninspiring. Another explanation may be that male

workers do not have the necessary patience of the

female workers to do such work. Then again, the

wage level in such industries may be lower than

the wage level in other industries in the Jurong

Industrial Complex. I shall be talking more about

this wage level later on. But for the present I

shall confine myself to the explanation why

employment of male workers instead of female

workers on night shifts in certain industries is

not satisfactory. Because of the many reasons

which I have just enumerated, there is a high

turnover among the male workers who are at present

employed in night shifts as a result of the

absolute prohibition against female workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that Members of the House will agree

with me that any high turnover of labour force,

whether involving male workers or female workers

in any industries, is not a satisfactory

situation. In such industries where women workers

are more suitable, it must also be appreciated

that workers employed in such industries must

undergo long intensive periods of training. The

wastage of labour, therefore, can be imagined when

workers leave their employment immediately after

the end of the period of training or even before

the end of the period of training. Because of such

workers leaving their employment, new workers have

to be employed to take their place and this means

that new employees must undergo similar long

intensive periods of training. In such a situation

it is not difficult to understand that the workers

cannot attain a higher level of efficiency during

their period of training. And this is the

situation in those industries where female workers

are more suitable but are prohibited from work on

night shifts, because of the high turnover of male

workers employed on such night shifts. The

production of the factories involved suffers as a

result.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was in these circumstances that some of the

employers who are most affected by the absolute

prohibition against the employment of women work

ers on night shifts approached me to make

representations to the Minister for Labour in

respect of section 50 of the Labour Ordinance, so

that the absolute prohibition against the use of

women workers on night shifts should be removed.

I, accordingly, conveyed their views to the

Minister who, I am happy to say, is also of the

view that the absolute prohibition is impractical

and not conducive to the industrial development of

Singapore. It must be pointed out that the Labour

Ordinance was enacted at a time when Singapore's

economy was essentially orientated to the export-import trade. There were then not many

manufacturing industries, and those that existed

do not justify the use of women workers on night

shifts. The present situation is different. At the

risk of repeating myself, I must point out that

there are now in Singapore many industries where

women workers are more suitable than male workers.

This situation will continue in future when more

industries are attracted to Singapore, but such

industries which require women workers may be

discouraged from coming to Singapore if they find

that they cannot employ women workers on night

shifts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present amendment will remove the absolute

prohibition against the employment of female

workers on night shifts and substitute in its

place a qualified prohibition with an enabling

provision for the Minister to exempt any industry

or branch thereof from such prohibition. I think

the statutory safeguard against the exploitation

of women workers by unscrupulous employers is

adequate. And I am sure the Minister will make an

exhaustive investigation before granting exemption

from such prohibition to any employer making an

application to him in that behalf. I, as an

official of the Pioneer Industries Employees'

Union, can assure Members of the House that the

union will also see to it that, where women

workers are employed on night shifts, all of them

will receive the special allowance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>



or night-shift premiums in line with those

prevailing among the other industries in the

Jurong Industrial Complex.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, I wish to make some reference to

the surprising remarks of the Member for Delta,

who has said that the whole of the Jurong

Industrial Complex is one big chaos, presumably including the Pioneer Industries Employees' Union.

As to the specific allegation that workers,

particularly women workers, are earning a wage of

$2.50 per day, I wish to point out that these are

allowances paid during th.e period when the

workers are receiving training. Such periods of

training are seldom more than six months, and once

they have completed their training, workers receive an immediate increase in wages. I can assure

the House that the use of women workers on night

shifts does not necessarily mean exploitation of

women workers. My union, the Pioneer Industries

Employees' Union, in spite of the derogatory

remarks made about it, has always protected and

promoted the interests of the workers and will

continue to do so in the Jurong Industrial Complex.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, if there is any significant number of

workers who are not members of the union, it is

because they are still under training or on

probation. Such workers may not be able to become

members of the union. This is an accepted

principle in industrial relations in Singapore.

But if the Member for Delta knows of any specific

instance of exploitation in Jurong, I should think

it is her duty to furnish such particulars to the

Ministry of Labour, if not to the union.



<br><br>2.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I cannot understand the intention of

the Minister for Labour in bringing forward this

amendment Bill which precludes women from working

at night. It is correct that female workers should

not be asked to work at night. If there are female

workers working in industries, they should work

during the day. The place for female workers,

especially married female



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>



workers, to work at night is the house, in the

house they can look after their husbands and

children whom they leave during the day. To the

best of my knowledge, the wife of the Minister for

Labour is working. I am quite sure he does not

wish his wife to work at night, leaving him alone

to tend to the children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, whilst not allowing female workers

to work at night, according to section 50

subsection (1), the Minister may exempt any

employer from asking his female workers to work at

night, if he is satisfied with his application

that it is in the public interest or to increase

efficiency of the industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Minister for Labour is of the

opinion that female workers when working at night

are more efficient than male workers, but I cannot

see how female workers can show extra skill or

increased efficiency in this respect. I have also

heard from the Member for Telok Blangah just now

that female workers are more patient than their

male counterparts. I would like to cite an example

in the Singapore Telephone Board. Previously the

telephone operators who worked from 7 a.m. to 5

p.m. were female operators, and from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. the switchboards were attended to

by male operators. But now for 24 hours of the day

the trunk call and inquiry services are looked

after by female operators. According to the

employers, this is to increase the efficiency of

the S.T.B. But both the female and male operators

have the same kind of work at the switchboard -

connect the plug, enquire and pull it out. If this

is a means to attract callers, then this may be

the reason. I cannot, however, see the extra

efficiency of female operators. I hope this

amendment will increase the efficiency of the

industries and I also hope it will not be a source

of inconvenience to the household. Mr Speaker, I

trust the Minister, when exercising his

discretionary powers to exempt applications from

employers, will consider whether they are for a

good purpose or not.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully

understand the intention of the Labour Minister in

introducing this amendment Bill, which is to gear

our legislation to the industrialisation of

Singapore. We know that this is a very competitive

age. In order to progress in our indus

trialisation, it is necessary to increase the

efficiency and productivity of our labour. This is

a good intention from the outset. But it may give

rise to two problems. Firstly, as the Member for

Telok Blangah has said, the wages of female

workers are lower than those paid to male workers.

I do not know whether there is really some form of

exploitation, because if low wages are paid to

female workers, then employers will tend to employ

more female workers. As a result, there will be

more unemployment among the male workers. This is

one point which I wish to bring to the attention

of the Minister. Mr Speaker, in order to give

facilities to and make it convenient for the em

ployers, we must advise them not to exploit the

situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second problem arises in cases where

employers may have female workers. If night shift

is compulsory for female workers, then some

inconvenience will be caused to the household of

the female workers concerned. Before any

compulsion is exercised on working night shifts,

the employers should ask the female workers

whether they agree to working night shifts or not.

If some female workers are not prepared to work

night shifts, I think they should not be asked to

do so.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I only wish to touch

on one aspect of this Labour (Amendment) Bill. It

is the labour policy of the Government to help the

workers. This is a progressive policy which is

difficult to find in South-east Asian countries.

We have every reason to be very proud of it.

Comparatively speaking, our labour policy is

better and more enlightened than that of other

neighbouring countries in this region. However, in

my humble view, if we have a new labour policy,

then there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>



should be no distinction between female workers

and male workers in respect of labour. They are

workers all the same. We should not distinguish

between the sexes as far as labour is concerned.

It is the policy of the P.A.P. Government not to

make a distinction between the sexes. Of course,

in anatomy there must be some differences. A male

is a male. But in so far as the working class is

concerned, there should be no distinction between

female and male workers. In my view, there should

be equality between workers of the two sexes,

equal pay for equal work. This is in the manifesto

of the P.A.P. According to this progressive labour

policy, if we should come across any female

workers receiving lower wages than men, then, as a

progressive labour Government, we should not allow

this to happen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I spoke earlier in this House about

the poor treatment given to workers in the Jurong

Industrial Complex. I was not talking about female

workers particularly. I was just passing a general

remark that the wages paid in the Jurong

Industrial Estate are generally poor. We should

not sacrifice the interest of labour in order to

cut down the cost of production. It is on this

point that I spoke earlier. We must give some

thought to the question of whether labour will

benefit by this kind of productivity increase. We

should not gauge the cost of production in terms

of labour only. We must not forget that if we cut

down the cost of production in terms of labour

only, that will give more benefit to the employers

and the capitalists. It is the business of employ

ers and employees together to shoulder a lowering

of the cost of production. I think the wages of

female workers are not so attractive as those paid

to the male workers. I do not know whether the

Labour Minister is aware of this. In my

constituency there are many female workers working

in the Jurong Industrial Estate. When I saw them,

they expressed the same sentiments. Mr Speaker, I

do not want to bring this matter up myself because

Singapore has many unions in existence and because

I do not want to show off. The unions have enough

strength to speak



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>



for the workers, it is my hope that the labour

leaders will make clear their attitude on this

point. But as a representative of the people and

since such views have been expressed by the voters

in my constituency, I have to bring them up in

this House. A progressive labour policy should

make no distinction between the sexes. All workers

must be given equal treatment and eoual wages.

Only then will there be no chance for the

employers to exploit the situation by way of a

disparity in the wages of female and male workers.

In this way the female workers will not be

exploited. Mr Speaker, if we allow this situation

to go on, then the tendency among employers will

be to employ more female workers and that will be

against our progressive labour policy. I do not

think the labour leaders will allow this to

happen, although most of them are of the male sex.

I do not believe the males will allow the females

to be exploited in this way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to night shifts for female workers in

this amendment Bill, several Members have spoken

on it. So far as I am personally concerned, the

main point will depend on whether there is any

necessity or justification for female workers to

work at night. There are many countries in Europe

where female workers work at night without causing

any inconvenience. In so far as security is

concerned, if female workers are safeguarded at

night, there will not be much trouble. That is my

view. Therefore, Mr Speaker, I hope the Minister

for Labour will take heed of the problems I have

outlined earlier and make some clarification.



<br><br>3.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Singapore has already

got the Women's Charter, and there have been some

amendments introduced in this House to improve it.

Now we are giving some thought to the labour laws

in regard to female workers working at night. We

are opening the door to female workers working

night shifts. Although it is your ruling, Mr

Speaker, Sir, that Members should not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>



praise the Government too much, I feel I owe the

Government a duty to praise it in this respect. At

the same time ---



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lim, I did not rule that Backbenchers should not praise the Government. Having

heard of complaints that they did not have enough

time on the Estimates, I said that if they did not

spend time praising the Government, they could

have that time to make their proper criticism of

the Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

I thank the Speaker for his clarification. This

gives me encouragement to praise the Government

all the more. In short, the Labour (Amendment)

Bill and the Women's Charter are measures aimed at

the emancipation of the female sex. The idea

behind the amendment Bill is to give facilities to

female workers in cases where the work is more

suitable to them. The question that arises is

whether this amendment Bill will have any

repercussions. In some cases where the work is not

so suitable for female workers, will it be the

tendency for employers to employ more female

workers, instead of male workers? Will there be

any discrimination on their part between the

sexes? Is it possible to engage either a male

worker or a female worker? Will there be a

stronger bias against the males? Supposing you

want to engage a secretary, a male or a female can

do the job all the same. If you pay equal wages

for equal work, then, according to the Member for

Sembawang, this will give rise to exploitation.

There is bound to be a disparity in wages between

the two sexes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I will now go to the second point.

Following the passage of the Labour (Amendment)

Bill, we can expect more female workers to appear

in our labour market, particularly in night

shifts. So the question of security measures

arises. I have some experience with regard to the

Redhill Industrial Estate. Previously some

factories in Redhill refused to engage female work

ers because at that time street lights were not

installed, so that some parts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>



of Redhill Estate were rather dark. It was,

therefore, not convenient for female workers to

work at night. In spite of my repeated requests to

install lamp posts, we have not seen any in the

Redhill Industrial Estate. Because of the darkness

there was a sense of insecurity then among the

female workers who were called to do night shifts.

I hope that following the passage of this Bill,

appropriate steps will be taken to make working

conditions more conducive to the security of the

workers of both sexes.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, what has been said by the Minister

for Labour to amend the Ordinance is to meet the

seriousness of the unemployment situation in

Singapore in the light of the economic situation.

In this context, this Labour (Amendment) Bill is

suitable, and I fully agree with it. But after

hearing the different speeches by the Members for

Delta and Telok Blangah about workers employed in

the pioneer industries in Jurong and other

industrial areas, it is not convenient for me here

to express any more points of view. If our

Government is a pro-labour government which adopts

a very enlightened policy on labour, I think it is

advisable to form an investigation committee and

go to the Jurong industrial area to investigate

whether it is true that the labourers there are

exploited by the employers, or whether they get

equal treatment for both sexes. This is my view.



<br><br>3.17 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Sir, I wish to say a few words on this

amendment Bill. It looks as though the employers

will benefit by it, because the wages of female

workers are less. They will be of the opinion that

they may profit more if they employ female

workers. The men may take advantage of the

situation and send their wives to work at night

while they go off to sleep. If this is the

attitude of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>



the men, then women will be working at night in

all the establishments. Why should we allow them

to work at night? We should provide security for

them and if they go to work after 7 p.m., their

parents or their husbands should escort them. So

it is not proper to send women to work at night.

Even if we have to do so, the employers should pay

them the same wages as the men. If we insist on

that, we have to see that the employers comply

with this request. I do not think this is proper

for the country or for the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labour Ministry says productivity will be

increased by the passing of this Bill. But this

aim may result in a decrease in production because

the employers may be employing female workers at

night and I do not think this will give any

benefit.



<br><br>3.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. V. Lingam (Aijunied):</b> Sir,

originally I did not intend to speak, but after

hearing some of the Members who spoke, I just wish

to say a few words. When the P.A.P. came to power

in 1959, it introduced the Women's Charter Bill.

Now we have the Labour (Amendment) Bill in front

of us, enabling women workers to work round the

clock. May I know when Government will introduce

an Act for men to safeguard themselves?



<br><br>3.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I support the amendment Bill because

we will stand to benefit both from the security

point of view and from the point of view of the

family relationship as mentioned by the Member for

Kampong Kembangan. But. I would like to ask the

Minister for Labour whether this amendment Bill

will be imposed on waitresses in bars and night

clubs who work beyond 10 p.m. If this is imposed

on them, it is good because it will be for the

benefit of our society at large.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I take it there are no other

Members who want to speak. Mr Jek.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.22 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, the Member for Joo Chiat

is wondering why we call a woman a workman. I

really cannot satisfy his curiosity why we should

call a female labourer a workman instead of a

workwoman. I think this is the word in the

original Labour Ordinance where it is stated that

a workman means a worker whether it is of the

female or male sex. I think this is only for the

sake of convenience. Maybe the Member for Delta

has already answered the question when she said

that we must never emphasise the sex when we speak

of a workman. A worker is a worker whether it is a

male worker or a male worker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is rather old-fashioned of the Member

for Kampong Kembangan to insist that the female

worker should be allowed to work only in the day-time and not at night. He is also worried that,

with the passage of this Bill, telephone operators

and workers in other establishments will be

subject to this 24-hour work shift. I have said

just now that this law does not necessarily apply

to all the establishments. Once this law is

passed, it will still be necessary for a factory

or an establishment to apply for the right to work

female workers on a 24-hour shift. It is not

automatically the case that they will come in.

Initially we will only allow factories which are

export-orientated to put their female workers on a

24-hour shift. So the Member need not have any

worry that operators in the Telephone Board will

be put immediately on this 24-hour shift.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah and the Member for

Delta touched upon the low pay of female workers

especially in the factories at Jurong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> Point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> Sir, I never said that the workers

are very lowly paid. I made a general remark, that

workers are paid according to the industry in

which they work.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> I beg his pardon. But last

Tuesday and also today the Member for Delta says

that female workers especially in Jurong are very

lowly paid. The Member for Bras Basah has

suggested that we should set up a commission of

inquiry to look into this matter. I do not think

this is really necessary. It may be a one-sided

affair because, according to a sample survey

conducted in July 1966, the monthly average

earnings of female workers of 18 years and above

in all factories was

$100.80, and the highest average monthly earnings

of $120.90 was recorded in the tobacco, cigarette,

cigar and other tobacco product industry, whilst

the lowest average monthly earnings of $70.50 was

recorded in the paper product, including

stationery and hard boxes, industry. The main

factor affecting the differences in the rates of

pay of female workers in various occupations and

industries is the skill required in the

performance of the job. In other words, the

greater the skill, the higher the rate of pay.

This is clearly manifested by the figures already

given for the paper product industry in which

unskilled labour is involved, as against the

relatively higher monthly earnings in the tobacco,

cigarette and cigar industry. In the textile and

garment industry, the predominant rates of pay for

female workers, other than those who are under

training or who are partially trained, vary from a

minimum of $2.70 to $2.90 per day of eight hours

in such occupations as weavers, spinners, knitters

and twisters. Whilst in the shirt and garment

manufacturing industry, the average wages per day

range from $2.58 to $3.24, in occupations such as

cutters, sewing-machine operators, iron workers,

packing workers and seamstresses, the average

wages are up to $5.49 per day. However, during the

period of training which ranges from one month to

six months, female workers are paid from $1.50 to

$2.25 per day according to the trade in which they

are being trained. After training,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>



they are generally put on piece rates subject to a

minimum earning of $2.50 per day, which is the

amount an inefficient worker earns. A worker with

greater productivity earns from $4 to $5 per day

and even up to $8 in the case of some workers in

one particular factory. In other words, the

earnings are dependent on the skill of the worker,

and the greater the skill and productivity of the

worker, the higher the earnings. It is quite

evident that no factory will pay a worker much

more than he or she is worth in terms of

production. If labour costs are artificially

inflated merely to increase the earnings of the

workers even though their productivity is low, no

one is going to open a factory in Singapore. The

intelligent way to deal with this problem is to

help the workers to improve their skills so that

they may earn more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Productivity Centre at J urong is

now considering the introduction of three

industrial training classes for new workers before

they get into the factories. The objective of

these classes is to acclimatise the workers to a

working environment with some rudimentary

knowledge of the trade into which he or she will

enter. This will enable them to imbibe more

quickly the skills required for the jobs they will

have to perform. These courses, in the initial

stages, will be mainly directed at producing

female workers for the textile industry so that,

with the skills that they will acquire in a

shorter period, they will start earning better

wages earlier. Indeed, trained textile and garment

factory workers can easily earn from $4 to $5 per

day with improved skills and better productivity.

Members of the House will agree that these rates

compare favourably with the rates given even to

male unskilled workers in many cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang is also afraid that by

putting female workers to work at night, it may

affect their family life. I do not think he need

worry about this because most of the workers in

these factories are between



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>



18 years and 22 years of age, and I do not think

that women in this age group have a lot of babies

to look after at home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Merah is concerned about the

security of women who have to go home very late

at night. I think the answer, as he has said, will

be to ask for more street lights and to seek

better and more efficient police protection in the

area. But even at the present moment, without this

law being enforced, female workers still have to

go home very late, because they are allowed to

work up to 11 or 12 o'clock at night. But, on the

other hand, if this, law is passed whereby a woman

is allowed to work the third shift, then, instead

of going home at 11 or 12 o'clock midnight, she

may have to go home very early in the morning, at

6 o'clock, in which case I do not think we have to

worry much about the darkness.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Third

time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members will recall that this Bill, which

is comprehensive and far-reaching in its effects,

was referred to a Select Committee on the 21st of

December last year. Since it has taken one year

for it to come back to this House and the memories

of some Members may be short, I think it would be

of advantage for me to read part of the

Explanatory Statement to the Bill:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The need for an up-to-date Company law has long

been felt, as the existing law, which is based

upon the English Companies Act of 1929, is now

completely obsolete.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst Singapore was a component of Malaysia, it

was associated with the drafting of a new

Companies Act for Malaysia which took over

eighteen months to prepare. The Malaysian

Companies Act, 1965, was enacted soon after

Singapore was separated from Malaysia and came

into operation in April, 1966.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill follows closely the provisions

contained in the Malaysian Companies Act, 1965, as

it is considered that Singapore's new law relating

to companies should not be different from the

legislation in force in Malaysia in order to

facilitate trade and commercial intercourse with

and within this region.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the response to invitations for

representations was good. Fourteen written

representations were received and the Select

Committee heard oral evidence from eleven of them.

Some of these contributions were valuable and a

number of suggestions have been accepted. I will

not burden Members of the House with details of

the amendments which have been made during the

Select Committee stage. These are listed out at

pages C8 to C37 of the Select Committee's Report

which was tabled in this House on the 7th of

December, 1967, as Paper Parl. 11 of 1967. Most of

the amendments are drafting amendments, while a

number of them have been incorporated as a result

of representations made by the Singapore Society

of Accountants, the Singapore Association of the

Chartered Institute of Secretaries, the Singapore

Advocates and Solicitors Society, the Association

of Certified Public Accountants, the Singapore

International Chamber of Commerce and the

Association of Banks in Malaysia. To these bodies

and to others who made representations to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>



Committee, I wish to extend our thanks for their

valuable suggestions and assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendments as have been

made by the Select Committee, while they have gone

a long way to refine the Bill, do not substan

tially alter the character of the Bill. One Part

of the Bill, Part XIII, relating to reciprocal

provisions with Malaysia, which authorises the

Minister to make arrangements with Malaysia for

their extension to Singapore of winding-up orders

made in Malaysia and for the extension to Malaysia

of winding-up orders made in Singapore, has been

deleted. Deletion of this Part is considered

necessary as clause 340 of the Bill, which is

similar to section 340 of the Malaysian Companies

Act, with necessary modifications agreed to be

tween Singapore and Malaysia, should meet the

reciprocal requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill, as now tabled before

this House, incorporates the recommendations of

the Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>FINANCE COMPANIES BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to license, and impose minimum

standards on, finance companies which accept

deposits from members of the public. Heretofore,

such companies did not have to comply with any

requirements, save those under the Companies

Ordinance. Inasmuch as these companies are

custodians of the savings of individuals, it is

imperative that their operations should be subject

to Government supervision in much the same way as

banks and insurance companies are. As a rule, the

role of finance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>



companies as financial intermediaries is limited

to the mobilisation of domestic savings to finance

the purchase of consumer durables. In the absence

of proper supervision, however, these companies

could turn into vehicles for risking household

savings on speculative ventures of the directors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two limbs to the definition of

"financing business" given in clause 2 of the Bill

- (i) borrowing money from the public by

acceptance of deposits and issuing documents

acknowledging indebtedness and undertaking to

repay the money on call or after an agreed

maturity period; and (ii) lending money to the

public or to a related company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the coming into force of this Bill, no

financing business shall be transacted by a

company unless it is a public company and is in

possession of a licence granted by the

Commissioner for Finance Companies who shall be

appointed by the Minister. One of the conditions

for the issue of a licence is that the paid-up

capital of a company shall not be less than

$500,000. The Bill contains transitional

provisions enabling exemption of existing finance

companies from this requirement. It also allows

the licensing of unincorporated firms, such as

pawnbrokers who are now engaged in financing

business, on condition that they incorporate

themselves into public companies within three

months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A finance company is prohibited from engaging in

trade or investing more than 25 per cent of its

capital and reserves in other undertakings. Nor

can it acquire immovable property otherwise than

for the purpose of conducting its business.

Unsecured advances are subject to a maximum of

$1,000. There is also a prohibition on a finance

company dealing in its own shares. Existing

finance companies who have so entered into any of

these prohibited transactions are allowed six

months, subject to extension by the Commissioner,

in which to liquidate such transactions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every finance company is required to maintain a

reserve fund. This Bill imposes restrictions on

the declaration of dividends to shareholders until

a company builds up its reserve fund equal to its

paid-up capital. A prescribed percentage of a

finance company's deposit liability shall be held

in liquid assets comprising legal tender, bank

balances, money at call, and Treasury bills. Here

again, existing finance companies are allowed a

six months' period of grace to meet this

requirement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister is empowered to prescribe maximum rates of interest payable on deposits and chargeable on advances, the maximum amount of advances which may be made to any person or class of persons, the maximum percentage of total assets that a company may hold in particular types of

advances, minimum down payments and maximum

maturity periods for loans or advances. The

Minister may also prescribe reserves to be

maintained with the Accountant-General.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides for periodic inspection by the

Commissioner of the books and accounts of a

finance company. The Commissioner is also

empowered to obtain such information and data as

he may require for the proper discharge of his

functions. If a finance company contravenes any

provisions of the Bill or carries on its business

in a manner detrimental to the interests of its

depositors or becomes insolvent, the Commissioner

may revoke its licence. There is also provision

for appeal to the Minister on the Commissioner's

decision to revoke a licence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of a winding-up of a company, the

depositors shall be deemed to be holders of

debentures secured by a floating charge over all

the property and undertaking of the company. The

liquidator of the company is enjoined to inform

every debtor of the company and to require him in

writing to redeem within three months any property

he had deposited with the company as security.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Co-operative societies, banks, and the Post

Office Savings Bank are exempted from the

provisions of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill has been drafted with the assistance

of an expert sent by the International Monetary

Fund. It was the intention of the Government to

send this Bill to Select Committee so that the

views of the public and those whose interests are

directly affected by the Bill may have opportunity

of expression. Unfortunately, in the last few

months there has been a very rapid increase in the

number of finance companies. This proliferation of

finance companies can hardly be looked upon with

equanimity. Members will recollect that in 1962 it

was necessary to legislate for the control of

mushroom insurance companies. Many of these were

of dubious character and in the process of

liquidation, large numbers of innocent persons who

had placed their money with these insurance

companies suffered losses. I am not suggesting

that all or any of the finance companies now in

operation are of the same class as the insurance

companies. I know for a fact that a number of

finance companies have impeccable backgrounds.

Unfortunately, I cannot say this for all of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the very rapid growth in the number

of new companies, it is necessary to pass this

Bill without reference to Select Committee so that

proper control may be established and that future

proliferation can be checked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the introduction of this Bill, I have

received a number of representations from finance

companies and these are being studied. Every

consideration will be given to the representations

and, if necessary, this legislation can be amended

in an amending Bill. I must say, however, that I

am not in sympathy with all the representations

that I have received. We cannot have finance com

panies encroaching into territory which properly

belongs to banks. It is not an accident that the

growth of finance companies took place at a time

when control and supervision of banks were

tightened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, I acknowledge that different

kinds of finance institutions are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>



needed to mobilise our capital resources and that

a proper role must be defined for finance

companies. This Bill is the first attempt at the

definition of such a role. Some companies have

expressed alarm that `they would have to liquidate

some of their liabilities within six months. I

give them an assurance that an extension of this

period will be granted to' finance companies which

have genuinely been attempting to liquidate these

liabilities within the six-month period of grace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.54 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the establishment of finance

companies in Singapore has recently been

increasing at a very speedy pace. They might not

be as prolific as the mushroom, but they certainly

have become, in total, a very significant and

influential financial institution in our economy.

Their influence and dynamism in our economy have

caused us no comfort. As representatives of the

electorate, we cannot sit back with little care or

total indifference. As influential financial

institutions, the finance companies operating i11

Singapore may be able to contribute significantly

to the economic well-being of our society if they

are brought under proper control. On the other

hand, they may render inflation-investment,

disequilibrium and even economic chaos should we

indifferently allow them to run wild. I positively

support and congratulate our Minister for Finance

on tabling this timely Finance Companies Bill to

regulate the operation of finance companies in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking a sweeping survey of the island, we

discover the following types of business

organisations operating as finance companies.

First of all, there are the so-called hire

purchase companies which deal with sales of motor

vehicles, sewing machines, television and radio

sets and other durable goods in instalments. They

call themselves hire purchase companies when, in

fact, they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>



are conducting sales of goods in instalments. The

distinction between hire purchase and sales in

instalments is this. On hire purchase terms, the

goods are delivered to the buyer after he has made

a down payment, but the ownership of the goods

remains with the seller, while the buyer enjoys

the use of the goods as well as the option to buy

while making the monthly instalments. On sales in

instalments, the goods are delivered to the buyer

who is supposed to buy the goods without an

option; thus the ownership of the goods goes to

the buyer immediately. Against this legal

conception of hire purchase and sales in

instalments, we understand that hire purchase

companies finance the sales in instalments on hire-purchase agreement, giving the buyer no option to

buy, but the ownership of the goods remains with

the finance companies unless and until the final

payment is made. In other words, the buyer has to

forego the option to buy and yet he holds no title

to the goods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many hire-purchase companies of this kind are

being set up with very little paid-up capital.

They normally act as agents for big finance houses

to conduct hire-purchase transactions. Though they

deal in the borrowing and lending of money, they

operate under the Hire Purchase Ordinance and are

not in any way regulated or restricted by the

Moneylenders Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we have pawnshops all over the island

borrowing and lending money. The bulk of their

business is to lend money on acceptance of durable

articles, though title deeds are also acceptable.

The sources of funds for their operations are

their own paid-up capital, operating profits,

deposits from the public, and money received for

custody. Many cases of deposits of money received

for custody are accepted on a gentlemen's

agreement and business trust, with or without

documentary evidence acknowledging their receipt;

and there are not a few cases where the so-called

gentlemen's agreement and business trust are

rendered valueless as they are not enforceable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>

in a court of law or even in equity. As

we have as yet no legislation or a statutory

prescribed rate of interest payable by pawnshops

to the depositors of money, the consideration

allowed for the deposit of monies with the pawn

shops remains a subject for bargaining. Mr

Speaker, Sir, we require very little imagination

to visualise a simpleminded member of the public,

with a sum of money and without any investment

opportunities, going to a pawnshop and bargaining

with a highly business-minded pawnshop proprietor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have the business-front organisation of

the banks, i.e., the finance companies wholly

owned by the banks. Openly these finance houses

are set up to conduct business transactions which

the banks are prohibited from doing. For instance,

the Banking Ordinance controls the payment of

rates of interest by banks to depositors for fixed-term savings, but the finance houses are at

liberty in this respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we cannot afford to deny the

importance of moneylenders licensed or unlicensed,

in the money market. Licensed moneylenders, on

obtaining a licence, automatically come under the

restrictions and regulations laid down in the

Moneylenders Ordinance. Unlicensed moneylenders,

though not legally recognised, or to be more

correct, they are operating illegally, certainly

have some business influence in business circles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not the least are the finance companies

incorporated under the Companies Ordinance. They

form the major arm in financing business. They

deal in heavy borrowing and lending, yet they may

or may not come under the restrictions laid down

in the Moneylenders Ordinance, depending on

exemption provided in the Ordinance being granted.

On exemption being granted, these finance

companies have a free hand in financing

activities. They are apt to charge the borrowers

exorbitant interest rates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, having described the aforesaid

categories of financial institutions, my

uncertainty, which I hope can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>



be clarified, is this. Is the Finance Companies

Act, 1967, as introduced by the Hon, the Minister

for Finance, to be adopted for regulating and

controlling all categories of finance

organisations, firms, houses and companies? Sub-clause (1) of clause 3 provides that no financing

business shall be transacted in Singapore except

by a company that is in possession of a valid

licence granted by the Commissioner for Finance

Companies, and "financing business" as interpreted

in clause 2 means the business of borrowing money

and lending money. Am I to understand that a

licence is essential for all types of financing

business organisations irrespective of whether

they are under the regulations and restrictions of

other Ordinances?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in our society where public

economic planning and private enterprises are

operating hand in hand, certain projects are

operating under statutory bodies as monopoly under

takings and as an encouragement to commercial and

industrial activities. In the absence of national

finance organisations, financial institutions

operated by private entrepreneurs become the baby

to be taken care of by legislation. From the

economic point of view, the financial institutions

in Singapore are playing a supplementary as well

as a complementary role to the banks as evidenced

by the fact that most banks establish finance

houses of their own. A banking corporation in any

country, even in totalitarian States, is a vital

financial institution. The banking corporations in

Singapore, as elsewhere, owing to certain

limitations, statutory, economic or otherwise,

have not been able to serve the economy to the

best of their ability and because of this, finance

companies have come into the picture. One of the

financial activities which the finance companies

undertake to supplement those of the banks is the

tapping of the financial resources at large and

collectively channel them into fruitful investment

and development projects. Another financial

activity undertaken by finance companies to

supplement those of the banks is to providc loan

facilities, it is very well



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>



known that practically all banks in Singapore are

reluctant to provide long-term loans and even

their short-term credit facilities are available

only to selected clients and with the provision of

security. In the light of these wants and demands,

finance companies come in to make available hire-purchase financing, house and property mortgage

loans to individuals, machinery and equipment

loans to industries, and general unsecured loan

facilities. In summary, finance companies provide

services and conduct financing activities which

are not available from banks and these

supplementary activities help in accelerating the

economic growth of the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, knowing the significant role

the finance companies are playing in the economy,

we recognise without any reservation the urgency

of a Bill to regulate and control the operations

of finance companies as financial institutions,

lest they run wild and give rise to inflation,

business disorder and economic destruction. In

addition to recognising the need of a Finance Com

panies Bill, I wish to reiterate my appreciation

of our Minister for Finance in introducing the

Finance Companies Bill. But while we recognise the

need for such a Bill to be introduced to protect

the interests of depositors and the general public

against unscrupulous finance institutions, there

is also the need to review some of the clauses and

certain provisions included in the Bill for the

implementation and administration of the Bill. I

know that the object of the Finance Companies Bill

is to safeguard the depositors and the general

public against any malpractices by some of the

unscrupulous finance houses. I also know that

impractical restrictive control will curtail

business activities or even make the finance

institutions extinct. The possible adverse effects

will no doubt bring home serious negative

consequences to the State. While supporting the

Finance Companies Bill in imposing control on the

operations of finance companies and welcoming the

introduction of the Bill, I wish, Mr Speaker,

Sir, at this juncture to make



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>



some constructive criticisms of some of the

provisions of the Bill. Firstly, clause 20 limits

the investment of finance companies to the extent

of 25 per cent of the paid-up capital. The purpose

of including this restrictive clause in the Bill

is presumably to prevent finance companies from

engaging in risky investment and investing in

unsound propositions. It may be necessary to

ensure the sound investment policy of each finance

company, but a flat percentage may not be a good

yardstick in ensuring a sound investment

programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is the provision prohibiting

finance companies from granting loan facilities of

an unsecured nature of more than $1,000. Without

the support of any statistical information, I can

safely maintain that $1,000 is too insignificant,

and to take that amount as the ceiling is very

inadequate. Bearing in mind the business volume

and the turnover of the unsecured loan facilities

granted and executed by finance companies, I have

no doubt that the ceiling of $1,000 warrants

reconsideration. As far as I know, Sir, there are

finance companies who grant unsecured loan

facilities to borrowers to as much as $10,000 to

$20,000. The turnover of unsecured loan facilities

to within $1,000 does not constitute much of a

total. I will pause just a while to ascertain the

implications of unsecured loans. Do we, Mr

Speaker, Sir, consider a loan granted to a

borrower who has a guarantor willing to undertake

to indemnify the repayment as an unsecured loan?

If the Bill considers loan facilities granted with

some personal guarantee are unsecured loans, then

I maintain that the $1,000 ceiling warrants recon

sideration. If the Bill considers that as a

secured loan, I shall withdraw my observation in

respect of this restrictive

clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I should be very grateful if

the Hon, the Minister for Finance would kindly

assist in clearing up my uncertainties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I wish to give my full

support to the Finance Companies



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>



Bill as introduced by the Hon. Minister for

Finance.



<br><br>4.11 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I have something

to say on this amendment Bill. Certain points

therein should be brought up for discussion. This

Bill will not actually promote economic activity

and increase the liquidity of finances in the

country to the fullest extent. We know that the

capital of these finance companies is obtained by

way of deposits from the general public. These

finance companies are quite different from

ordinary banks. Since our own people invest in

finance companies, the Government should look

after them. The depositors are mainly middlemen

and other small traders. Finance companies are not

like banks which are controlled by big

capitalists. Finance companies carry on operations

which banks do not like to undertake. For

instance, they provide loans to the ordinary

people to buy cars or houses, or to set up small

family or cottage industries. The ordinary people

can get such loans from these finance companies

which they cannot get from the banks. I feel that

finance companies have a great role to play in the

accumulation of capital and a very important place

in our economy. This Bill touches upon something

that is of great importance to the general public

as well as to the finance companies. I do not

oppose its introduction. This Bill regulates

financing in our economy and protects the

depositors. The Government will have to exercise

some measure of control over these finance

companies. But because of their close relationship

with the population, especially our small

merchants, I feel that if we control these finance

companies too much or too strictly, then it may

cause some undesirable consequences. These finance

companies have a very close relationship with our

small merchants, industrialists and ordinary

people. The Government should not discriminate

against them or single them out for special

treatment because they have some contribution



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>



to make to our economy. Yet there is a

provision in the Bill that a finance company

should have $500,000 paid-up capital and also a

certain percentage of liquid assets. In fact, the

capital invested in some of these finance

companies exceeds the minimum amount imposed on

the banks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently there was a regulation that if a

foreigner invests $350,000 in local industries,

then he can bring his family to Singapore and they

can even become citizens of Singapore.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>4.16 p.m.



<br><br>This may appear to some people as some sort of

favouritism and therefore we have to look into

this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is provision for the post of Commissioner

for Finance Companies to look after the operations

and accounts of finance companies. Will this

enhance the confidence of our people in finance

companies? This legislation is aimed at

safeguarding the interest of the depositors. We

should look after the interest of all the people.

We should base our viewpoint on the benefit which

these finance companies can bring to our economy.

We should bear this in mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has said that the Bill is for the protection or the security of depositors, but he has not looked into the consequences. I am worried about the consequences that may befall finance companies as a result of the passage of this Bill. I am also rather worried about the consequences it

will have on our economy, a great part of which is

motivated and stimulated by finance companies

through deposits by the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides that finance companies

should not undertake certain transactions, and

unsecured loans should not be more than $1,000.

Certain transactions which are not allowed under

clauses 19, 20 and 21 and so on, will have to be

liquidated within six months. If finance companies

had entered into such transactions and if they

have to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>



liquidate them within six months, then they will

have to auction their assets and business. They

have to close shop as a result of this. And what

benefit will it give to the depositors if such

consequences take place? Also the staff of these

finance companies will be joining the camp of the

unemployed. In fact, people find it more

profitable to have immovable property in their pos

session. For instance, a finance company can buy

over a whole building for its operations and for

letting Out to other businesses. Money accruing

from rents would be sufficient to meet expenditure

on running costs, etc., besides leaving a profit.

The finance companies can pay the 36 per cent

property tax and 40 per cent income tax. In

addition to paying these taxes, they can also make

a profit. So there will be no loss to anybody.

Without the profit finance companies can secure

from this sort of operation, how can they pay

interest to the depositors? If they are required

to auction all their immovable property, then this

may shake our economy. As a result, some family

and cottage industries may suffer, because they

cannot get loans easily from big banks. So they

have to look to finance companies for unsecured

loans. The finance companies are the only

providers of loans to them. According to the

provisions of the Bill, finance companies are

prohibited from providing unsecured loans of more

than $1,000. This being the case, the small

industries will suffer. And if finance companies

comply with these provisions, there will be

liquidation within a certain period and the small

industries will again suffer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now touch on the provision of unsecured

loans which should not exceed $1,000. If this

provision is to be complied with and other than

the liquid

assets the finance companies have, I feel there is

no security for the depositors because the finance

companies can also give large amounts of loans on

other things. There is also a provision stipul

ating that the loans given out should not be more

than a certahi percentage of its paid-up capital.

I should say some finance companies may find it

difficult



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>



to carry on with their business because of this

restriction. Small industries will also suffer. If

the Government's intention is to look after the

interest of the depositors, then I would suggest

amending clause 16 of the Bill which provides

that:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Where a finance company has accepted

money from any person as a deposit the company

shall within two months after the acceptance of

the money issue to that person a document which

acknowledges or evidences or constitutes an

acknowledgment of the indebtedness of the company

in respect of that deposit.'

<br><br>Now if the finance company does not issue a

receipt on the spot on receipt of the sum of

money, it can put the money away without issuing a

receipt or any document to show that it has

already received that sum of money deposited. Then

where is the security that is talked of which the

depositor can have? If the finance company has a

latitude of two months, then it may, perhaps on

the last day of the second month, issue a receipt

of acknowledgment and the depositor will lose two

months' interest on the amount of money deposited.

If such a thing happens, it will be a loss to the

depositor because he has lost two months' interest

on that amount of money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there are other Members who want to

speak on this Bill. So I would not like to say too

much. I feel generally that the Minister should

not be too insistent. He should be more flexible.

He should send the Bill to a Select Committee and

hear representations from the people concerned and

amend the Bill if necessary so as to make it

perfect.



<br><br>4.28 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Chew Chin Han -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chew Chin Han (Tampines):</b> Sir,

the expressed purpose of this Bill is to safeguard

the interest of members of the public who deposit

funds with finance companies. In moving the Second

Reading of the Bill, the Minister for Finance

tried to make out a case for his new law. As in

any trade or business, there are good companies

and bad ones, good traders and bad ones, There may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>



be a finance company formed by persons who require

money for their own business. They are unable to

obtain finance from banks or other sources of

loans and so they form a finance company to raise

capi.tal for their own business. There may be

others where the intention of the directors is to

collect as much money as possible from the public

on the promise of very high interest, and then do

a bunk. Finance companies which are formed on this

basis or which are run on these lines are a menace

and the public must be protected from them. But

the question I ask is, are these .the only types

of finance companies? The answer must be "No". We

have not heard of any finance company in Singapore

failing. There are many finance companies

operating in Singapore. Most are honest and

provide a very useful service to the investing

public who do not have enough money to buy

property. Also to those who do not understand

shares, they give a slightly higher rate of

interest than the bank gives. There are many

borrowers who cannot obtain loans from banks. They

say that banks only lend money to people who have

a lot of money and want to double what they have.

It is impossible for the small trader or the young

professional man who is just starting out in his

career to obtain any starting capital from banks.

In other countries, banks are not so old-fashioned

as Singapore banks. The small trader and the young

professional man in Singapore must turn to finance

companies. The explanatory statemen.t of the Bill

says that it is proper that finance companies

should wherever possible be assimilated with

banks.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why must this be done? Finance companies are

very different from banks. If we pass this new

law, we may have no finance companies but numerous

banks in a few years' time. Where then is the

small trader or young professional man to go if he

cannot give security to obtain a loan of more than

$1,000? If the main reason for introducing this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1051</b></font><br><br>



law is to control the bad finance company, is

there no risk that we will kill the good finance

company as well? There is a serious danger that

this will be the result because there is little

that is certain in a section of this Bill. A lot

of discretion is given. I am not a lawyer. From my

little understanding of this Bill, the

Commissioner for Ftnance Companies is going to be

made a very powerful man. He may even have more

powers than other civil servants except the

Banking Commissioner. Everything is left to his

discretion. Under clause 5, he can grant a licence

with or without conditions. He may refuse a

licence. No rules are laid down, though he must

act with the approval of the Minister. He need not

give reasons. There is no appeal from him. Having

given the licence, he may at any time vary or

revoke the conditions or impose additional

conditions. This is in clause 5 (4). Sub-clause (4) says nothing about the Minister's approval.

Again, no rules are laid down to say when the Com

missioner can vary or revoke conditions. All that

the sub-clause says is that he can do so at any

time. Furthermore, there is no appeal; no notice

is required. A provision like this makes the Com

missioner a very powerful man indeed! Clause 7

also gives him such powers. So does clause 8, but

here in sub-clause (4) there is a right of appeal

to the Minister. But under clause 28 (3) , the Com

missioner must act in accordance with the

Minister's directions. I am not worried about the

present Minister, but who knows what kind of a man

our future Minister may be? There is no appeal

under clause 9. Clause 10 gives a finance company

a chance to present a case to the Commissioner

before its licence is revoked. Why cannot this

also be done in clauses 7, 8 and 9? So far I have

referred to the Commissioner's wide powers over

the issue and cancellation of licences and

conditions. He has similar wide powers over the

regulation of business. By clause 15, he can ask

for all information and data as he reasonably

requires. There is no limit - only the

Commissioner's ideas of what is reasonable! He is

given power to determine the minimum



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>



amount of liquid assets. This is in clause 24. By

clause 26, he can order corrective action. What

does "corrective action" mean? He can tell the

finance companies to stop business. He can also

tell them how to run their business, and if they

suffer a loss, clause 30 frees him and the

Government from responsibility unless he is guilty

of fraud. He is given wide powers but no financial

responsibility. This is very dangerous. Is there a

financial wizard in the civil service who can tell

competing finance companies how to run their

business properly? If a company fails, the

directors will naturally tell the public, "The

company has failed because the Commissioner gave

wrong directions." They may be wrong, but the

public may blame the Government. Does the

Government want the blame? My fear is about the

Commissioner's powers. If such powers are given to

one civil servant, other civil servants may want

similar powers, because their work will be made

easier. The Director of Public Works will be

`tempted to ask for such powers over the

contractors and engineers; the Chief Architect

will want powers over the architects; the Attorney-General will want powers over the lawyers; and the

Director of Medical Services will want powers over

the doctors. If all these civil servants can work

well without similar powers, why should we give

them to the Commissioner? I hope the Minister will

explain the necessity for this unrestricted wide

power. I also hope he will tell us whether any

other country has a law like this and whether

officers in charge of finance companies in other

countries have similar power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the general intention behind the Bill.

I would like the Minister to give clarification on

the matters I have raised and to inform the House

why the intention cannot be carried out without

giving such wide powers to the Commissioner for

Finance Companies. Furthermore, would it not be

better if the Bill were sent to Select Committee

because it is quite complicated? I do not believe

there is an urgency to push it through for Third

Reading today. I am sure that if it is referred to

Select



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>



Committee, we can have not only the views of

finance companies but also the views of banks,

depositors and borrowers. There might be a

proliferation in the establishment of new finance

companies, but if we pass the Bill quickly

without careful examination, it will carry a lot

of dangerous provisions.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajoo (Farrer Park):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, it is satisfying to note that the

Government has realised the need to control

finance companies in the interest of members of

the public. We have seen many finance companies

and institutions advertise attractive terms and

conditions which they claim to be in the best

interest of the general public, but can they deny

the fact that ultimately it is they themselves

which stand to gain more than the general public?

Nevertheless, taking into consideration the fact

that the finance companies do have a genuine

interest in enhancing the financial and economic

interest of the public in particular and the

State in general, it is the duty of the

Government to protect the public from any swindl

ing by some finance companies. For instance,

before getting a loan on the pledge of a motor-car or an article, some companies do charge

"football money" which i's illegal and which will

never come out in the accounts. I am not saying

that all finance companies charge "football

money", but some companies do charge it. By not

showing this income in their accounts, they do

not pay income tax. The borrowers, in addition to

paying the illegal interest, have also to pay

more than what the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>



law allows. Will the Government do something to

stop this illegal practice?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I want to bring up is that

finance companies charge 10 or 12 per cent

interest on secured loans on hire purchase. This

interest is calculated on the original sum lent

and is not calculated on the amounts due after

payment of instalments. So this so-called ten per

cent interest actually works out to more than 18

or 19 per cent. We have laws to see that

mortgagors do not charge more than 12 per cent on

secured loans, but in the case of finance

companies, the interest charged is actually more

than the interest legally allowed. I hope the

Ministry of Finance will look into this problem

and standardise the interest charged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I want to raise is with regard to

"chit fund" which is publicly known as "tontine".

There are a dozen chit fund companies in

Singapore which run chit funds and they deal in

hundreds of thousands of dollars. They are not

doing business on the accumulated capital hoarded

by them but on funds collected from the public. 1

do not know whether, under the present Bill

before this House, these chit funds can be

controlled by the Government. Recently, I heard

that some of these companies are unable to repay

to the depositors the amounts deposited by them

after an agreed maturity period. People who have

been convicted of criminal breach of trust and

people of not a reputable character are known to

be managing such business. I appeal to the

Government to bring these chit fund operators

under some form of Government control by way of

legislation so that the public can be protected.



<br><br>5.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hup Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hup Teck (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the introduction

of this Bill aims at strict control of finance

companies and the operation thereof. It also aims

at the protection of depositors who invest money

in them. Therefore, the intention is good in

principle, and I believe it is the aim of the

Bill to get rid of those finance companies which

are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>



not properly run or not bona fide. But the

operation of this Bill may also affect those

companies which are bona fide. So, Mr Speaker, we

must accept the fact that a well-organised and

properly operated finance company is of benefit

to small traders and wage earners in Singapore. In

short, to the small man, finance companies which

are bona fide are good because they provide easy

and convenient financial aid. But we agree that

those which are not so good, of course, should be

dealt with. So before this Bill is passed in this

House or implemented in future, we should go a

step further and study this Bill more carefully to

see whether certain clauses in it are over-restrictive, thereby stifling the proper operation

of bona fide finance companies. We must see that

such bona fide companies are not adversely

affected by the operation of the law. On the

contrary, if operation of finance companies in

Singapore contributes to the prosperity of our

country, then they should be encouraged and not

restricted adversely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if this Bill is passed hurriedly

without any overall careful consideration of the

various repercussions and consequences, then it

will cause some confusion in our society, parti

cularly to those who are now depositors. Ef such

depositors lose their confidence in the finance

companies, then some sensitivity will be caused

and a lot of depositors will queue up outside the

finance companies to withdraw the `money they have

deposited. This will give rise to very serious

repercussions and dangerous consequences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I fully endorse the views expressed

by the Member for Ulu Pandan when he suggested

that this Bill should be referred to a Select

Committee for further careful consideration. In

this way, representatives of finance companies and

members of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of

Commerce and other interested parties, including

members of the public, will be given a chance to

express their views on this Bill. At the same

time, we can avoid the misunderstanding on the

part of finance companies in Singapore who may

allege



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>



that this Bill is introduced in order to assist

foreign capital at the expense of local capital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, generally speaking, we all know

that the role played by finance companies is

similar to that played by banks in Singapore.

Mainly their business is to collect deposits from

the people and give out loans at some interest. So

in this way they are the same as banks. And their

existence need not necessarily pose a threat to or

compete with the banks in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I wish to quote the editorial of

the Sin Chew Jit Poh of the 19th of December. This

editorial made certain suggestions in regard to

the present Bill. It says that banks play a very

important role in the accumulation of capital, but

the role that they play has not reached the ideal

stage. The standard of living in Hong Kong may not

be as high as Singapore, but, on the average, the

population in Hong Kong have about $2,100

deposited per capita in the banks. This is higher

than the average deposit in Singapore per capita,

which is only $650. So the average deposit per

capita in Hong Kong is about three times that of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, if finance companies can assist

in looking for liquid assets or idle capital, then

the accumulation of capital brought about by the

finance companies will be of great benefit to the

industrial development of Singapore, particularly

in the field of investment. So it is clear that

there is scope for expansion of the business of

finance companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The editorial also dealt with three points. The

first point is that this Bill is actually a

duplication of the Banking

Ordinance, but it is more restrictive

than the Banking Ordinance. So because of this

Bill, the position of finance companies in future

will not be as good as that of the banks, and

difficulties will arise which may stifle the

flourishing business of finance companies in

Singapore. This may give rise to very serious

consequences.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point brought up in this editorial is

that the future activities and businesses of

finance companies under strict control will not

function so well, and this is the negative aspect

of this Bill. As a matter of fact, it may be good

to protect the interests of the whole of society,

but in protecting the interests of the society,

particularly the depositors, we should also see

that the restrictive law does not interfere with

the role played by the finance companies in

national development. And so they should be given

the same protection as insurance companies are

given in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point brought up in the editorial is

that the regulation of the operations of finance

companies in loans and mortgages and other aspects

is too restrictive. It suggests that if banks are

allowed to give loans on hire purchases and

mortgages, why cannot finance companies be given

the same facilities? If insurance companies are

treated as banks, why cannot finance companies be

similarly treated?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the existence of finance companies

is more or less complementary to the operation of

banks in Singapore. I would like to show in what

way this is true. Many small traders,

industrialists, or small manufacturers are unable

to get financial assistance from banks, but they

can get it from finance companies. This is one

instance of industrial or commercial activities by

finance companies, and in this way they make a

great contribution to our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill provides that the paid-up

capital of a finance company shall not be less

than $500,000. But clause 17 (1) (c) provides that

any unsecured loans should not exceed $1,000. So

if a company has a capital of $500,000, its

unsecured loan is to be limited by this clause to

$1,000 or less. This is inconvenient to the

operations of the finance company, and I feel that

this clause should be reconsidered. We must see

whether the financial position of the individual

finance company



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>



warrants such a blanket restriction. In other

words, we must have some discretion in respect of

restriction of loans according to the paid-up

capital and the position of the individual finance

company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if a finance company is big, bigger

than the others, then I think it can increase the

loan granted. In order to meet the very high

overhead expenses, some finance companies may

raise "football money" or the rate of interest in

respect of loans given out, and because their

scope of activities is narrowed down, their

turnover becomes smaller. So their profits may not

be able to meet the overhead expenses. Because of

this, some of the finance companies may have to

retrench their' staff and some may have to close

down, thereby giving rise to more unemployment and

aggravating our present unemployment situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, clause 21 of the Bill' says that no

finance companies shall purchase or acquire any

immovable property. We must understand that when

finance companies receive deposits, from the

public, they pay interest. Therefore they must do

some business by way of loans given out at higher

interest rates. If there is a provision that no

finance company shall purchase or acquire

immovable property, then how do we expect them to

continue with their operations? Generally speak

ing, banks can make use of money in current

accounts without interest. This position which is

enjoyed by the banks is not enjoyed by the finance

companies. In fact, banks also levy service

charges to meet their overheads, even in respect

of current accounts. On the other hand, finance

companies do not enjoy such facilities. So if they

are to be more restrictively controlled than

banks, then in order to meet their overhead

expenses and to maintain their level of profit,

they will meet with great difficulties. In fact,

they may not even make a profit at all under these

stringent restrictions. The idea of this Bill, of

course, is to protect the interest of the public,

and the strict control of finance companies is

good only to this extent. Mr Speaker,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>



before this Bill is read a Third time, it is my

humble view, a view shared by the Member for

Tampines and the Member for Ulu Pandan, that it

should be referred to a Select Committee for

reconsideration.



<br><br>5.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in

support of the Finance Companies Bill whose object

is to license and control finance companies and to

govern matters connected therewith. Since the

purpose of this Bill has been made very clear and

specific, therefore, bona fide finance company

houses should have no cause for any undue apprehension.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although clause 22 of the Bill provides that

within six months of the date of its coming into

operation finance companies are required to

liquidate all transactions prohibited by the

provisions of the Bill, nevertheless, Mr Speaker,

Sir, earlier on the Finance Minister has already

stated that consequent on the passage of this

Bill, if and when genuine grievances arise, he is

prepared to consider sympathetically their

respective difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important feature of the Bill is the

restriction placed on the powers of the directors

and other officers of a finance company to deal

with the money deposited with the finance company.

This is very important, Mr Speaker, Sir, because

many members of the public are induced to place

their savings in a finance company by the

attractive interest rates offered by the company

on such deposits. Up to now, there is no specific

Ordinance to ensure that a finance company takes

as good care of such deposits as any honest

businessman will take care of his property. In

that sense, the Government should be congratulated

on initiating such a Bill. Mr Speaker, Sir, my

concern is this. As a socialist by conviction, I

feel that the the larger interests of the

community in stead of a microscopic few should be

given first regard. Sir, another concern is this.

As a trade unionist, I feel that if the Minister

for Finance can give



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>



his sympathetic consideration to genuine

grievances, there is no fear at all for bona fide

finance company houses having to resort to

retrench employees as a result of the passage of

this Bill. And if this end can be achieved, I will

propose to the Minister for Finance that the

day of the coming into operation of this proposed

Act is not made retrospective but is to take

effect in the near future. Hence there is no need

to refer this Bill to a Select Committee.



<br><br>5.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the touchstone test of this Bill is

not so much whether it can control finance

companies, but whether it can control them without

killing them. With the present-day economic

arrangements of our society and of any advanced

society, there is no dispute that finance

companies do play an important part in our

economic life. Gone are the days when a person

wants something, he saves for it. Today he pays a

small down-payment. Sometimes he does not even

have to do that, and he enjoys the use of the

article he wants and pays for it in instalments.

Consumer credit is now the rule rather than the

exception. Under such circumstances, finance

companies are something we cannot do without. And

yet for a long time many people have felt that

they should be abolished. Sir, this is because

finance companies readily lend themselves to abuse

by unscrupulous people. One of the causes of

apprehension over the profusion of finance

companies over the past few years is that by their

very profusion they are forced by competition to

pay such high interest rates that they can only

hope to pay them by resorting to speculative

ventures. A large number of finance companies are

known to be speculating, and at times even wildly,

in properties and in the stock market. If a person

speculates with his own money, that is his own

funeral if he fails. But when a finance company

plays around with depositors' money, then clearly

it is the duty of the State to ensure that such

things cease. The present Bill before the House

does provide



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>



the means to restrict the number of finance

companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 5 and 6 provide the Commissioner not

only with the powers to shape the structure of

finance companies, but also to limit them. I

personally would have preferred to see the figure

of $500,000 in clause 6 doubled. But I do not wish

to press this point as I am confident that the

Government will not hesitate to raise it should it

become necessary to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another cause of apprehension over finance

companies is that few of them provide adequately

for bad and doubtful debts. This is so because

operators of finance companies prefer to lose

other people's money rather than their own. And so

they distribute as much of their profits as

possible and allow their depositors to carry the

risk of bad and doubtful debts. Clause 12 will, I

feel, go a long way to safeguarding the depositors

and, in addition, to providing a built-in growth

factor for the finance companies to grow to a

reasonable size. Of course, this clause will have

the disadvantage of inducing minimum initial

capitalisation even when funds are available. It

is conceivable that funds which otherwise would be

capitalised would be rearranged as loans. However,

as such an arrangement will be countered by the

liquidity ratio required by the Commissioner, I

feel that a correct balance has been struck.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 requires that every finance company

shall exhibit its balance-sheet and the list of

its directors at its principal and branch offices,

if any. The company is also required to publish

its balance-sheet in at least each of the four

local daily newspapers in the four official

languages. There is no requirement to publish the

list of directors. A better requirement, I feel,

is to have the publication in the leading instead

of any daily newspaper in the four language

streams. I further suggest that the list o

directors should also be published. My suggestion

to have publication in leading newspapers is to

ensure that some finance companies do not select



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>



little-read newspapers for publication of their

balance-sheet and widely-read newspapers for

advertisements calling for deposits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20, as it stands, can, I feel, be by-passed quite easily. The clause only requires that

a finance company shall not hold share capital or

have a direct interest in any financial, com

mercial, agricultural, industrial or other

undertaking, exceeding a quarter of its paid-up

capital and published reserves. This clause does

not, in my view, prevent a finance company

indirectly committing funds exceeding a quarter of

its capital and reserves. I should like to see the

clause rewritten to include a restriction on

direct and indirect participation exceeding a

quarter of the capital and reserves. The proviso

that excess share holdings acquired in the course

of debt-realising should not be allowed, appears

not to be necessary. Indeed, the very existence of

this proviso indicates the weakness of the clause

itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 25 and 26 put teeth into the provision

for supervision. As such, the penalty provided

under sub-clause (4) of clause 25 of $250 is

rather low. Normally one would expect that no

finance company would refuse to show its books and

data to an officer appointed by the Commissioner.

The occasion when it will do so will be rare but

very important from the point of security of the

depositors. I would suggest a heavier penalty be

provided. Mr Speaker, Sir, with these comments, I

support the Bill.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I support the Finance

Companies Bill. Why I support it is that in the

past the law has loopholes. For example, not long

ago there was an assurance company owned by a

foreign investor. He earned a lot of money.

Perhaps the people thought that he was from a

financially strong country. Therefore, many people

bought policies from him and he earned a lot of

money. He requested the Government to allow him to

remit his money back to his country. After

investigations, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>



Government found that he had no capital invested.

Why is it easy to do business without capital? It

is because we have loopholes in our law.

Therefore, we must revise and amend our law in

order to deal with speculators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know there are many finance companies in

Singapore. There are as many finance companies as

there are coffee-shops. Therefore, we should con

trol them. We must take care and look into the

matter. We know that the capital of finance

companies varies. Some have large capital and

others have less. But the business done exceeds

the capital. Where is the security granted to the

depositors? One day if the money is swallowed up

by the company, who is to repay the depositors? Is

it the Government? Therefore, I fully support the

Bill introduced by the Finance Minister. However,

we should refer it to a Select Committee in order

to study it in greater detail.



<br><br>5.49 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b>

Sir, I do not in any way oppose the introduction

of the Finance Companies Bill which is now tabled

in this House for Second Reading. However, I wish

to offer my brief observations. First, I do agree

that there is a need for the passing of laws to

control finance companies in the best interest of

the public at large. The main purpose of this Bill

is to safeguard the interest of would-be

depositors who are mostly the working-class in our

Republic. This is a correct move and in line with

the policy of our Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the provisions in this Bill are far

too rigid. They are designed not only to control

and restrict the establishment of finance

companies, but also to regulate the scope of their

business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to offer some suggestions.

The control must be gradual and not too rigid.

Sir, the provisions contained in clauses 17 to 22

are far too stiff and restrictive. The result will

be that the small trading houses will have to

close down and the interest of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>



public may be jeopardised and unemployment will

also result. The control and licensing of finance

companies would create an impression that finance

companies in general have been fiddling with

public money. I agree that there may be a few

dishonest and unscrupulous ones, and so there goes

the saying - a rotten egg in a basket of good eggs

has made the entire basketful rotten.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to this Bill, the Commissioner seems

to have wide powers. The prescribing of the

maximum rates of interest - and they are going to

be ceiling rates - should be treated as a guide

rather than an order, as some companies may not be

able to pay such rates. As a matter of fact, it is

purely in the public interest to have an equitable

distribution of profits. Unlike service, the

payment of interest varies according to the sums

deposited. For example, if $10 million has been

utilised and if it has resulted in profits of,

say, $1 million, then the management of the

finance company will be able to pass on part of

the profits to the depositors according to the

amounts they have deposited. Surely any finance

company which can afford to pay such bonuses

should deserve the support of the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the finance companies in our Republic

do play an important role in our economy. This

being the case, the Government should encourage

the existence of such companies rather than push

them over the cliff, so to say, because of the

extremely restrictive measures in this Bill. To

me, some of the measures are even stricter than

those in the Banking Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fifth point is that at the present moment the

finance companies are carrying on a very wide

range of business ii our trading society. If too

many restrictions are to be imposed, the end

result will be that a few finance companies will

exist and this will, in turn, contradict the

policy of our Government to encourage industrial

growth, as a lot of small traders and small

factories are depending on loans from finance

companies to carry out their expansion programmes.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to my sixth point. As the

present position stands, finance companies have

actually participated in the development carried

out by the private sector, i.e., housing

development for the higher income group, for which

there is at the moment no government

participation. In this particular field, a lot of

private funds are involved and the depositors will

then in turn enjoy the benefit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I wish to urge the Minister for Finance

to refer this Bill to a Select Committee for views

from all sections of the public. I see no urgent

need to rush through this Bill today.



<br><br>5.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Sir, this Finance

Companies Bill has my full support. It is to

control the activities of finance companies and to

safeguard the interest of the public. The proposal

that this Bill should be sent to a Select

Committee is a means of delaying its passage. My

view is that it should be taken through all stages

and passed into law.



<br><br>5.56 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the advent of finance companies

seems to be quite a recent one. They have sprung

up like mushrooms. At a glance, they may be

classified into three categories :-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Finance companies which are subsidiaries of

banks;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Small-time finance companies which lend

money in respect of sales or hire purchase

of cars, taxis and even to kelong owners,

fishermen and farmers;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Large finance companies which operate

independently in the field of investment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fact that banks operate their Own

finance companies appears to stress the need for

such institutions. It also to a certain extent

reflects the inadequacy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>



of the services provided by the banks themselves.

On the whole, finance companies do serve the needs

of certain sections of our population. One may

place them somewhere between banks and the

chettiars or moneylenders. For those who have

access to banking facilities and who are reluctant

to use the facilities provided by the chettiars or

moneylenders, finance companies will be in a

position to offer the necessary assistance in

their financial problems. The increasing number of

finance companies operating in the Republic does

point to the necessity of legislating certain controls over them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the Bill itself, my colleagues and I are

concerned about the ceiling of $1,000 for loans of

an unsecured nature. This will definitely affect

the small traders, farmers and kelong owners I

hope the Minister will reconsider relaxing a

little on these $1,000 unsecured loans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if finance companies are to be allowed to

continue their operations in the Republic, they

should be placed under some control in order to

safeguard the interest of small depositors, but

they should be allowed reasonable scope for

conducting their business to ensure that there is

enough profit for discharging their obligations. I

am sure that the Bill, in spite of its

restrictions, gives genuine finance companies, not

the mushroom type, enough scope to do business and

make some profit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, originally I thought that after the Second

Reading of this Bill, it would be referred to a

Select Committee to enable the affected parties to

have an opportunity to voice their opinion.; or

make their recommendations. Sir, I would further

add that it would appear, at first sight, unfair

on the part of the Government to pass a Bill of

such a nature without listening to the views of

the public. I could not understand the urgency for

this Bill going through its Third Reading today,

but having heard the explanation of the Minister

for Finance, I am satisfied and convinced that the

earlier the Bill becomes law, the better it will

be for the have-nots.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I doubt whether other countries have similar

legislation, but unique circumstances must be met with legislation. After all,

the P.A.P, is the People's Action Party, not just

in name only. If we are to protect the small

traders, fishermen and farmers from being swindled

by unscrupulous operators of finance companies, the

protection given by this Bill is very necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill without reservation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (Choa Chu Kang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government's intention

of bringing in legislation to regulate finance

companies was first announced in last year's Budget

debate. It has taken a full year for the Bill to

come before Parliament. It is, of course, better

late than never. It is very necessary that

legislation be introduced to control what my

colleague calls the mushrooming of finance

companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of this Bill is to protect small

investors. That is what a socialist government like

the P.A.P, should and must do. It is ironical,

therefore, that some of my colleagues in this House

who are good socialists should have forgotten the

small man and have taken up the cudgels on behalf

of finance companies. I think the reason for this

is that my colleagues are labouring under the

misunderstanding of what a finance company is. In

this connection, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I be allowed

to read the definition of "finance company" in

clause 2 of the Bill:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"finance company" means any company licensed

under this Act, to carry on financing business,

and all branches and offices in Singapore of

such a company shall be deemed to be one finance

company for the purposes of this Act;'.



<br><br>We must now go further down and read what the

definition of "financing business" is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"financing business" means the business of -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) borrowing money from the public, by acceptance

of deposits and issuing certificates or other documents acknowledging or evidencing indebtedness to

the public and undertaking to repay the money on

call or after an agreed maturity



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>



period, which period shall be not

less than one month of the original

acceptance of any deposit; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) lending money to the public or to a company

deemed to be related to the finance company

by virtue of section 6 of the Companies Act,

1967 (hereinafter in this Act referred to as

the "related company") on the basis that the

public or the related company undertakes to

repay the money, whether

within an agreed period of time or

not, or by instalments;'.



<br><br>Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very clear from

this that a finance company is a company that

borrows money from the public and lends money to

the public: that is, a company that makes use of

the public's money by borrowing and lending and in

the process makes a profit. If it does not borrow

money from the public, it is not a finance company.

So in order to fit in with the definition, it must

borrow money from the public and lend money to the

public. When a company borrows money from the

public and makes use of that borrowed money to make

a profit, it must accept a certain degree of

control. If, however, it makes use of its own money

and does not borrow money from the public, it does

not come within the definition and it can do what

it likes. It can establish a limited company and

throw away its money by taking unnecessary risks

and nobody will complain, much less the Government.

But finance companies are not making use of their

own money; they are making use of the public's

money. The Government has a responsibility to the

public and must see that the small investors are

not - to use a common phrase done in. Therefore, if

finance companies want to make use of the public's

money, they must accept certain responsibilities

and must equally accept a certain degree of

control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without exception, all finance companies are, as

far as I understand, limited companies. In law, if

a limited company fails, who is responsible?

Nobody. The shareholders or contributors of the

company are only responsible to the extent of the

unpaid portion of the shares which they hold and

generally these shareholdings are very small and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>



normally they are fully paid up. So when a finance

company, which is normally a limited company,

fails, who is responsible? Nobody. The

shareholders have fully paid up their shares. They

will say, "It is just too bad. The company has run

unnecessary risks and it has failed." You can only

get hold of their common seal. The directors are

not responsible, unless, of course, they can be

prosecuted under the Companies Ordinance for

fraud, and it is always very difficult to prove

fraud. Even if you succeed in the prosecution and

send them to gaol, what does it benefit the poor

investor? It is small consolation and cold comfort

to a small investor who has lost his life savings

to see the director of a finance company sent to

gaol. In this connection, I must point out that

even finance companies which are subsidiaries of

reputed banks stand in the same legal position.

They may be subsidiary companies but they are

separate legal entities. If a subsidiary company

fails, the parent company, which is a bank, is

under no legal obligation to come to its aid. In

this connection, Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps I may

be allowed to quote a passage from the Minutes of

Evidence taken before the Select Committee on the

Companies Bill. I refer to the Report of the

Select Committee on the Companies Bill [Parl. 11

of 1967]. I quote from column 37 at page B 19 of

the Minutes of Evidence. As you know, Mr Speaker,

Sir, I was on this Committee and this is what I

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`...Surely a wholly-owned subsidiary - a finance

company - would also be a limited company. The

bank is legally in the clear. Although, according

to what you say [meaning what the witness says],

there is moral responsibility, surely moral

responsibility is just not good enough. We want

legal responsibility for the protection of the

depositors.'



<br><br>And in the Select Committee you, Sir, as Chairman,

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I think Mr Tang's point is simply this.

You make use of a bank's good name in your

advertisements to get deposits for that bank's

wholly-owned subsidiary finance company. You

utilise the bank's good name without any legal

liability on the part of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>



bank. Let us say today you have the Pasir Panjang

Bank Ltd. It owns a subsidiary finance company

called the Pasir Panjang Finance Ltd. You see irs

the papers advertisements by the Pasir Panjang Finance Ltd.

stating that it is a wholly-owned subsidiary of

the Pasir Panjang Bank Ltd. So there full

advantage is taken of the bank's, good name and

that may well be the only reason why the public

deposits with that finance company, rather than

with an index pendent finance company. But, at the

same time, the bank is not in any way legally liable

should its finance company fail. A bank may have

the advantage of that finance company without any

of the attendant disadvantages. That is the point,

is it not, Mr Tang?'



<br><br>And I replied, "That is right." The witness then

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Speaker, although there is no legal.

liability on the part of the bank, the moral

responsibility here, however, is very grave.'



<br><br>You went on to say, Mr Speaker, Sir:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I think we accept that. But Mr Tang's

point of view is that, if a finance company that

is a wholly-owned subsidiary of a bank, fails, it

will be poor consolation to the depositors who

have lost money even if that, finance company has

had the bank's moral.

backing.'.



<br><br>And that is exactly the position with regard to a

finance company which is wholly owned by a bank. I

think it was very well put, Mr Speaker, Sir,

when you said that it was cold comfort to the

depositors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks are strictly controlled because they also

make use of the public's & money for re-lending and

in the process make a profit. In the same way, the

finance companies do that on a smaller scale. If

banks are controlled, why should not finance

companies also accept some control?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think most of the

complaints of my colleagues about this. Bill centre on clauses 19, 20 and 21. These are

restrictions on the type of business that a

finance company can enter into. I think these

complaints arise from a misunderstanding of the

functions of a finance company. If a company

professes its business to be that of lending money

to the public, and borrowing and using the money

for relending, why should it be allowed  carry on

all sorts of trade, especially import and export,

which, unless you



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>



are in that line, is a very risky sort of

business? Again, why should a finance company be

allowed to hold more than 25 per cent of its

equity capital in the shares of any of the under

takings listed under clause 20 of the Bill? Clause

21 does not prevent a finance company from holding

immovable property as long as such property is

held as security and not as assets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think another complaint is that finance

companies are required to keep a certain liquidity

ratio. Again, I see no reason why this should not

be done. If banks have to hold a minimum liquidity

ratio, I see no reason why finance companies

should be an exception.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are one or two minor complaints that I can

voice. One of these complaints, which I made in

the Budget debate, is the need to introduce legis

lation to control hire purchase, which is the

other side of the finance company's business. The

other minor complaint is the unhappy drafting of

some of the clauses of the Bill, especially clause

17. But as far as the main aim of the Bill in

controlling finance companies for the proper

protection of the small investor is concerned, I

am in hearty agreement with the Government, and I

support the Bill unreservedly.



<br><br>6.19 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Member for Choa Chu

obligation and not a legal obligation to support

the finance company, so that the finance company

could use a bank's name and in that way attract

deposits. Here, Sir, in today's Straits Times

one of the big local banks, which disclaims all

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To save confusion, may we point out that THE

OVERSEAS UNION BANK LTD, and the OVERSEAS UNION

GROUP have no

connections whatsoever with the OVERSEAS UNION

FINANCE LTD. of Singapore.'



<br><br>Sir, when things have reached such a pass, that

finance companies resort to this kind of dubious

practice, I think it is absurd to suggest that we

refer this Bill to Select Committee in order to

allow more scope for rather dubious characters to

engage in this kind of dubious practice. So I am

afraid I cannot agree with the proposal from Mem

bers to refer this Bill to Select Committee, as

there is urgent need to see that control is

instituted forthwith over finance companies. In so

saying, may I repeat again that I do not regard

all finance companies as of a doubtful character?

I have stated in my speech on the Second Reading

that they do perform a useful role in society and

that we should try to allow them to fulfil this

useful role. The Member for Have-lock and the

Member for Choa Chu Kang have so clearly and so

forcefully put the case for control of finance com

panies that there is very little for me to say,

without repeating what they have already said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do wish to refer to the points made by the

Member for Havelock. He said that we should not

try to control how people should lend their own

funds. That is not the case. We are trying to

control the means by which people lend other

people's funds. It is all right if you speculate

and make money; or if you speculate and go

bankrupt. No one is going to stop you one way or

the other. But we must make sure that you do not

endanger other people's money, and that when you

borrow money from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>



public, you invest it wisely and securely, and

that abuses of various kinds whereby directors of

companies can make use of other people's money to

get rich, must stop. This is the cardinal

principle underlying this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Critics of the Bill have said that it will bear

very harshly on finance companies and many of them

may close down. On the one hand, they say that

these companies are essential to the economy and

that they are being well run. In fact, the Member

for Ulu Pandan claims that in many cases their

liquid position is even better than that of the

banks. If that is so, what have they got to fear

from this control?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members have stressed the need to safeguard

the interests of small borrowers who are traders

or small industrialists and have to go to finance

companies for finance. I can give an assurance

that we will do everything to safeguard the

interest of small borrowers from finance

companies, be they small traders, fishermen, or

small industrialists. What we want to prevent is

the wrong or inappropriate investment of other

people's money either in non-liquid or in

speculative ventures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tampines says that the

Commissioner for Finance Companies is a powerful

man. Of course, he is a powerful man. He needs the

power to control finance companies. How are you

going to ensure that adequate control is exercised

over these people if the Commissioner does not

have these powers? But what the Member for

Tampines has not said is that these powers are

unnecessary. He says that civil servants cannot

tell finance companies how to make a profit. I

agree with him. But we can tell finance companies

how their assets can be secured so that when their

depositors want their money back, it can be

forthcoming.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tampines also asks:

do other countries have similar powers in their

legislation? The answer is: in other countries

finance companies are not allowed to be

established. You have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>



to establish a properly-run bank, which is subject

to all the controls which a central bank

exercises over people who take in deposits and

lend out deposits. It is only here, due to a

lacuna in the law, that these finance companies

have been allowed to be established. We cannot get

them under the Moneylenders' Ordinance. We cannot

get them under the Banking Ordinance. Therefore,

it is necessary to introduce new legislation to

control them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu has not made any new

points. I think he has repeated the points made by

previous speakers, and I think the Member for

Havelock and the Member for Choa Chu Kang have

adequately answered all his points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point raised - that there is fear

that there will be unemployment as a result of

Government control of finance companies. Why

should there be unemployment? Unless, of course,

some of these finance companies are found to be

unsound, then they have to close down. If that is

the case, it is better that they close down early

so that fewer depositors lose their money than

that more people are stung.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten, I think, has made

some valid points. He says that we must ensure

that the small businessmen who go to finance com

panies for credit are not endangered. I have

already given this assurance. Then he mentions

housing investments and says that many finance

companies invest in housing projects, and that

this practice is disallowed in the Bill. Precisely

so - you cannot take other people's money and

invest it in long-term projects, money which the

lender is entitled to have back, it is difFerent

if you use your own money. If a group wants to

invest in housing so that there can be better and

more houses, the proper way is to use its own

money to float a company and invite public sub

scriptions for shares and use the capital to build

the houses. You cannot use short-term deposits in

building houses.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsecured loans have been limited to $1,000, and many Members, both critics

and supporters, think that this may be too

small. I am prepared to look into it. But at

present you cannot say to what

extent the finance companies are, in fact,

helping the small traders or small manufacturers.

We just know nothing about the way these finance

companies operate. My Ministry tried to get some

information and asked for returns. These com

panies refused to give any returns, so we just do

not know what they are doing, and how they are

investing their assets. Once this Bill becomes

law, it is my intention to call upon all these

companies to furnish me with the fullest details

of how they have been investing their money. If

it so turns out that a small trader or small

manufacturer will suffer considerably by the

limitation of unsecured loans -

reconsider the matter. But my colleague and

skilful hands this Bill was produced, says none.

He is also an experienced banker. All the same, we

will give the benefit of the doubt to the Back-benchers who claim that small traders will be

affected and, if that is the position, we will

have a second look at this particular clause. In

the meantime, this Bill must go through and

controls must be imposed.

stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 17 stand part of the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with

the aims of clause 17 in controlling the dealings

of finance companies. My only complaint is that

the clause is not happily drafted, it is rather

vague. Clause 17 (1) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No finance company shall ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) accept any deposit which is repayable on

demand by cheque, draft or order;'.



<br><br>I do not quite know what this means, if it is the

intention of the paragraph that deposit accounts

in finance companies should not be drawn on by the

depositor by the use of cheque, draft or order, it

should be expressly stated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to paragraph (c) . Sir, the granting

of unsecured advances to



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(i) a firm ...



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) any other person or body of persons

whether incorporated or not.',



<br><br>I am of the opinion that legally it is

comprehensive enough to say that no finance

companies shall grant unsecured loans to any

person or body of persons whether incorporated or

not, it embraces everybody - persons, companies,

firms or what have you. It is unnecessary to have

the first paragraph which expressly defines a firm

in which a director of a finance company is

interested, etc. These are my complaints about the

drafting. They have nothing to do with the aim or

the intention of this clause to control finance

companies

.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The intention of

clause 17 (1) (a) is as stated by the Member for

Choa Chu Kang. I do not know how it can be redraf

ted in a happier way. I would have thought that,

as it stands, this is to describe a bank account

which is operated by payment on demand by cheque.

If the hon. Member can propose a happier form of

words, I am sure the House will be willing to

consider it. I thought that there was some

ambiguity about paragraph (a). It looks a bit odd,

I confess. But on deeper reflection, I think the

meaning becomes clear. My colleague, the Minister

for Law, might want to comment on this. It is not

really within my professional province.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards clause 17 (1) (c), what the Member

said is quite true. But I think the intention of

the law officers who drafted it is to draw

attention to the fact that the director, agent or

manager of a finance company is not exempted from

these restrictions. I think the intention is to

make it clear beyond all doubt. I do not know

whether my colleague, the Minister for Law, can

perhaps elaborate on this.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> The object of clause 17 (1) (a) is

to prevent finance companies from acting like

banks. Hence, anyone who deposits money with a

finance company cannot get it back, as it were, on

demand by writing out a cheque, as one does with a

bank account. You deposit money in a bank which

issues you with a cheque book, and by writing out

a demand note by cheque, draft or order, you can

immediately draw on that account. This is the

object of clause 17 (1) (a) . I myself cannot see

how it can be drafted in a better way. It does not

prevent finance companies from returning money by

cheque, draft or order. One deposits money not for

immediate return but for return after three

months, six months or a year, when it can be done

by cheque, draft or order. What clause 17 (1) (a)

seeks to prevent is a deposit followed by an

immediate demand for payment by the depositor.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as clause 17 (1) (c) is concerned, I

need not add more to what the Minister for Finance

has said. It is aimed at everybody. But the

drafters felt it would be safer specifically to mention partner, manager or agent or any

individual or firm of which any of its directors

is a guarantor. This is to prevent ambiguity, and

it is to make sure that these people do not get

away with it that they are specifically mentioned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance has asked whether I

can propose a happier set of wording.

Unfortunately, I have not given notice of an

amendment to this paragraph (a). But with your

consent and with the general assent of the House,

I can do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tang, before I give consent,

may I offer a little comment? The words "cheque,

draft or order" to my mind clearly refer to the

means by which the "demand" is made,, and not to

the means by which repayment is made. If you agree

with that, interpretation, you may not wish, at

this-stage, to seek to introduce an amendment. In

any event, I take it the Minister will want to

consult professional opinion in the Attorney

General's Chambers before he expresses any views

or accepts, any amendment from you at this stage.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> As you please,

(2)  will give you an opportunity to say what you

wanted to say a few minutes, ago on "chit fund"

companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 28, stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thosecompanies which

have "chit" funds need not come under the Banking

Ordinance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>



or under the Moneylenders Ordinance. Therefore,

these companies are registered as limited

companies and the directors are not doing business

in the

best interest of the public. I understand that

when some of these limited companies were

registered, certain banks gave a guarantee to

them. When cheques were issued by these companies

to their depositors, the same banks returned the

cheques dishonoured because of insufficient funds.

So I would suggest to the Minister that in the

public interest these "chit fund" companies should

also be brought under this Finance Companies Bill.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Companies Act, which

has just been passed by Parliament, provides under

section 38 certain obligations in respect of com

panies which invite the public to deposit money

and there are certain obligations laid down under

this Act to ensure that some control is exercised

over them. I am not sure whether the companies

referred to by the Member for Farrer Park would

not come under the provisions of this Bill,

because finance business is defined as borrowing

money from the public, and this is exactly what

these tontine companies do. They lend money to the

public. I would have thought that it could be that

these `companies would fall under the provisions

of this Bill. This is really a rather legal

technical point and perhaps the Minister for Law

and National Development may come to the rescue

again.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Rajoo, is there anything you

wish to say further?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo:</b> I have not got anything

further to say. But as the Minister for Finance

has requested the Minister for Law and National

Development to look into the matter, I hope he

will do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, these tontine companies, which

the Member for Farrer Park is rather worried

about, will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>



caught by section 38 (1) of the Companies Act

which was read for the Third time a few hours ago.

Section 38 (1) provides that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'An invitation to the public to deposit money

with or lend money to a corporation or proposed

corporation shall not be issued circulated or

distributed by the corporation or by any other

person unless -'



<br><br>paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) are complied with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 38 (9) provides for heavy penalties -

'conviction to imprisonment for a term not

exceeding two years or to a fine not exceeding

five thousand dollars.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I doubt very much whether these tontine operators

will be caught by the Finance Companies Act which

strictly covers finance companies which borrow

money and then lend it out. A tontine operator

does not strictly borrow or lend. What he does is

to invite people to subscribe to a certain fund

and then it is more of a debt. I say $20, you say

$21, someone else says $22, and the highest bidder

gets the money for the month, after which he has

to return a fixed sum. It is a group of people

getting together, putting in a certain sum a

month, and every month someone takes it away. All

the operator does is to get his little commission.

So, strictly speaking, he is not borrowing and

then lending out. They are all perhaps borrowing

and lending to one another. I doubt whether they

would be caught by the Act. I may be wrong but, in

the final analysis, it is for the courts to

decide, and if we are wrong here, we can always

amend our laws.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to say a few words on tontine

organisations. These organisations originated out

of some moral responsibility for friendly mutual

aid. For instance, if I am short of $2,000 for

business, I gather a few friends together and form

a tontine organisation. The purpose is to help

myself to run



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>



my business. But nowadays people are different.

They make use of this sort of organisation to

swallow up other people's deposits. Once the

leader has collected the money, he runs away. So

there should be a law to control tontine

organisations. Originally, the purpose of tontine

organisations was very good. It was for mutual

assistance. But now it is different. Nowadays the

morals of the people are quite different from what

they were in ancient times. So in law, we should

have some measures to prevent people from a breach

of faith by running away with the money deposited

by their friends.

<br><br><!--Mr P. Selvadurai-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. P. Selvadurai (Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, now that we are talking about tontines, I

agree with what the Hon. Minister for Law and

National Development has stated just now, that

this Act does not catch tontine operators. In

fact, I think there is a dubious line of common

law authority which says that tontines are illegal

as they are against public policy. In any event, I

think there is a case that at some future session

of Parliament, measures should be introduced in

Parliament to control tontine operators and

regulate this kind of business, because tontines

also satisfy certain social and economic needs in

Singapore. I think a study is being made by the

Faculty of Law of the University of Singapore and

perhaps we will have the time to go into it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo:</b> Sir, I am a bit disturbed by the

Minister for Law and National Development's reply

that he cannot do anything about this "chit" fund.

In fact, I am not asking him to look into illegal

tontine organisations, but these are companies

which are registered under the Companies Ordinance

or some other law, and they seem to operate in a

way which is not in the interest of the public.

The public subscribe to these "chit" funds. Say

the tontine is for $20 a month. They subscribe to

the tontine. They put their savings into these com

panies. Finally, after paying for 10 or 12



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>



months, these people are informed by the operator

that he is not going to pay back their deposits.

This is something which the Government should look

into, in order to safeguard the interest of such

people. If there is no law at present to control

tontine organisations, then the Minister should

introduce legislation or amend the law to control

them.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I always thought that

tontine operators were small-time people,

domestic servants and such types. This is the

first time I hear that they have formed a limited

company. If, in fact, they have formed a limited

company, then they will fall under section 38 of

the Companies Ordinance provided, of course, the

Member for Bukit Panjang is not correct in saying

that these activities are illegal in law. Assuming

that they are legal and they are registered, then

they will come under section 38. Subsection (7) of

section 38 gives the Minister authority by

notification in the Gazette to specify terms and

conditions subject to which subsection (6) of this

section shall have effect. In other words, the

activities and terms upon which these transactions

are conducted can be regulated by the Minister; in

this case, the Minister for Law. So the Member for

Farrer Park need not despair. Of course, all this

is on the assumption that these activities are

legal. If they are illegal, then such companies

cannot be registered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 28 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 29 to 45 inclusive ordered to stand part

of the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> After that interesting

debate, I must refer to a very mundane matter. A

spelling correction is to be made in the Long

title. In the word "licence", the letter "c" where

it occurs, for the second time should be an "s".

This error will be corrected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported without amendment; read a Third

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Third Reading read.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Third time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House will recall that the Land

Titles (Strata) Bill was referred to the Select

Committee on the 27th June this year. Written

representations were received from the Estates

Manager. Housing and Development Board, the Land

and Housing Development Association of Singapore,

and the Real Estate Valuers Association

(Singapore). In addition, the Select Committee

also heard oral evidence from the Real Estate

Valuers Association. A number of useful

suggestions which were made have been accepted.

The amendments made by the Select Committee are

set out on pages C4, C5 and C6 of the Committee's

Report tabled in this Parliament on 7th December

this year as Paper Parl. 12 of 1967. I will not

burden the House with details of these amendments,

many of which are drafting amendments which merely

refine the Bill. One particular clause, however,

in the original Bill `dealing with the collection

of pioperty tax in respect of flats has been

deleted, as it appears that such a provision, if

necessary or advisable, should properly be in the

Property Tax Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill as now tabled before

the House incorporates the recommendations of the

Select Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There is a clerical error in the

marginal note of clause 32 which reads "Surrender

of unregistered land to Singapore.....". It should

read "Surrender of unregistered land to the President....."     as provided in the clause itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That correction will be made.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I am much obliged, Sir.

<div align="center"><b>REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS AND EXPORTS RULES, 1967</b></div>



<br><br>7.03 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament, pursuant to subsection t3) of

section 5 of the Registration of Imports and

Exports Ordinance (Cap. 261), resolves that the

Registration of Imports and Exports Rules, 1967,

published as Notification S 244 in the Gazette

Subsidiary Legislation Supplement No. 76 of 14th

December, 1967, as contained in Paper S.L. 60 of

1967, he approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Registration of Imports and Exports

Rules, 1967, embody the Imports and Exports Rules

of 1935 together with a new provision for the

documentation of trade between Singapore and West

Malaysia. Until now, imports and exports to and

from West Malaysia do not require Singapore per

mits or Singapore documentation. The proposed

documentation is to enable us to compile our own

statistics of trade with West Malaysia. Such trade

statistics are now compiled and supplied by the

Statistics Department at Kuala Lurnpur.

Documentation of our trade with West Malaysia is

also made necessary by the export incentive scheme

which is to be effective next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the amended Rules, importers and exporters

will be required to submit documents to cover

goods imported from or exported to West Malaysia.

In the case of imports by road or rail, the

document required will be submitted to the Customs

and will merely be an additional copy of the

export permit which the exporter in West Malaysia

submits to Malaysian Customs. For exports to West

Malaysia by road or rail, the document required

will be a copy of the Malaysian Customs import

permit. In case of imports or exports by sea or

air, the trader will submit one copy of the

Singapore Inward Declaration or Outward

Declaration to the shipping or airline agent. The

shipping or airline agent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>



concerned will then forward the declarations to

the Import and Export Office. All declarations

will not have to be approved by the Import and

Export Office. No fees are payable on these

declarations. In this way, very little delay and

no inconvenience will be caused to the traders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already consulted the various Chambers

of Commerce, shipping associations and the Airline

Operators Committee, and they have agreed to the

procedures proposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament, pursuant to subsection (3)

of section 5 of the Registration of Imports

and Exports Ordinance (Cap. 261), resolves that

the Registration of Imports and Exports Rules,

1967, published as Notification S 244

in the Gazette Subsidiary Legislation Supplement

No. 76 of 14th December, 1967, as contained in

Paper S.L. 60 of 1967, be approved.
