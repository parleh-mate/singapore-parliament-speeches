<div align="center"><b>BUSINESS MOTION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have been informed that the Prime

Minister desires to make a Ministerial statement. As

there  are  Questions  for Oral  Answer  and  Supply

Business  on  the Order Paper, perhaps it  would  be

convenient   to  hon.  Members  if  the  Ministerial

statement is taken before Questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Leader of the House or a Minister move a

motion under paragraph (2)  of Standing Order No. 10,

"That  the  Ministerial statement  be  taken  before

Questions"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, may I under paragraph (2)  of Standing No. 10,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That a Ministerial statement be made today before Question time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That a Ministerial statement be today before

Question time.

<div align="center"><b>WATER SITUATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Prime Minister)</b></div>



<br><br>2.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the statement

I  wish  to make to the House is in respect  of  the

water situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the belated break of the North-East Monsoon,

hon.  Members  would like to know the present  water

situation   and  the  outlook  - whether   and   when

rationing  can  be  lifted.  The  total  stocks   in

impounding  reservoirs  today,  16th  December,  are

around 2,780 million gallons or 47.1 per cent of the

total.  The  corresponding figure on the same  date,

16th  December, last year was 68.6 per cent or 4,050

million gallons in impounding reservoirs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rainfall to-date in Singapore taking the

readings  of  Peirce Reservoir shows  62  inches  as

against the yearly average of 100 inches. In  Johore

in  the Tebrau area the rainfall up to date has been

81 inches as against a yearly average of 108 inches.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will notice that rainfall figures up to

date  have  been about 38 per cent below average  in

Singapore and 25 per cent below average in Johore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will have noted a considerable amount of

attention in all the language newspapers about water

rationing,  coinciding  with  a  recurrence  of  the

cholera epidemic. A number of people have taken  the

trouble  to  write  to  the  newspapers  urging  the

abolition of water rationing as one of the means  to

combat the cholera epidemic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Utilities Board has given this matter

urgent consideration. They have been in consultation

with  the  medical officers of the Health  Ministry.

The  Health Ministry is of the view that  move,  the

present  El Tor cholera epidemic has Order not  been

brought  about  so  much  by drought  conditions  in

Singapore resulting in water rationing, but more  by

the higher incidence of human carriers of cholera. A

complete  de-rationing  may  lead  to  a  much  more

dangerous  condition if there should  be  a  drought

next made year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there has been a relaxation of two hours per

day with water supply stopped at 10 a.m. instead  of

8 a.m. in order to allow the City area to be flushed

clean  more  thoroughly at least once a  week.  This

change  adds  to the daily consumption of  water  by

about 150,000 gallons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water rationing has to be continued until the

safety  level in our water stocks has been  reached.

Members may like to know what is the safety level of

water stocks. This varies at different times of  the

year.  The level should be such as to see us, at  an

average  daily consumption, now of about 75  million

gallons  per day, through the annually expected  dry

months of June to September to the next wet season.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time we lifted rationing at the end of

January 1962 after the 1961 drought, the stocks were

at 67.5 per cent or nearly 4,000 million gallons. To

see  ourselves  safely through the next  dry  season

between  June  and September, there should  be  more

than  60  per cent of water stocks in our reservoirs

by the end of the North-East Monsoon in January.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present the stocks are only 47.1 per cent and I

regret  to say that rationing will have to  continue

until it reaches 60 per cent, we hope, by the end of

the  rainy  season.  However, the  forecast  by  the

Meteorological  Office has not been  optimistic  and

less   than  average  December  rainfall  has   been

forecast.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position will be reviewed at the end of

January,  and at the review, consideration  will  be

taken  of the Scudai supplies expected in June  next

year  a  which would produce another 10-15  -million

gallons  per day in conditions of drought and  25-30

million gallons per day normally.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> May I remind hon. Members that there

is  no  debate  on  the Ministerial  statement,  but

Members may ask questions provided they are relevant

to  the  statement and are phrased in  the  form  of

questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There appear to be no questions. We go on to the

next  item, i.e. Questions for Oral Answer. Question

No. 1, Mr Kow Kee Seng.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>LICENSED HAWKERS AND STALLHOLDERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Total number on 30-11-63)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b> asked the Minister for Health

what  was  the  total  number  on  30-11-63  of  (a)

licensed  itinerant  hawkers; (b)   licensed  shelter

hawkers: (c)  licensed street pitch hawkers; and  (d)

licensed market stallholders.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Sia Kah Hui) (for the Minister for Health):</b> Mr Speaker, I have been asked by the

Minister to reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 30th November, 1963, the total number of

licensed itinerant hawkers was 515; licensed shelter

hawkers  was  1,024; licensed street pitch  hawkers,

day,   2,896,   and  night,  990;  licensed   market

stallholders was 3,588.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>TOTAL NUMBER OF REGISTERED UNEMPLOYED ON 30-11-63</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b> asked the Minister for Labour

what was the total



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>



number  of  registered unemployed on 30th  November,

1963 or at the latest available date.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the total

number  of  persons registered and actively  seeking

employment  assistance from the Employment  Exchange

was  40,534 on 30th November, 1963. Not all of  them

are  totally  unemployed. There are many  on  casual

part-time   or  full-time  employment  among   these

registrants who are seeking better employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also have to point out that whilst the

Government is doing everything to reduce the  number

of    unemployed   through   its   industrialisation

programmes, the Barisan Sosialis is doing everything

to   increase   the   number  by  sabotaging   these

programmes.  In  fact,  the  Barisan  Sosialis   has

contributed  much  to the unemployed  figures.  More

than  1,800  workers were forced  into  unemployment

through  the irresponsible and unreasonable  strikes

created by the Barisan trade unions in the past  two

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these are the people who are constantly and deliberately causing misery, hardship and unhappiness to the workers, and now they say they are concerned over the unemployment situation. This is just shedding crocodile tears or, as the Chinese saying goes, "the cat pretending to mourn

for the death of the mouse."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>PUBLIC ASSISTANCE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b> asked the Minister for Social

Affairs  how many persons received public assistance

as at 30th November, 1963.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng) (for the Minister for Social Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been

asked  by  the  Minister  to  answer.  As  at   30th

November, 1963, a total of 28,682 families  received

public  assistance.  Based on  an  average  of  five

persons  per  family,  this will  give  a  total  of

143,410 persons.

<div align="center"><b>GEYLANG FIRES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Government aid to victims)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b> asked the Minister for Social

Affairs  what was the total amount of  aid  in  cash

received  up  to 30th November, 1963, by  each  fire

victim  of  the recent fires in Lorongs  3  and  21,

Geylang,  and  what  other  aids  in  kind  has  the

Government given to each of the fire victims.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng (for the Minister for Social</b>

<b>Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, I have been asked by the

Minister to reply to Question No. 4.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victims of the Geylang, Lorong 21, fire which

occurred on 29th October, 1963, have received  total

assistance  in  cash  of $40 each.  Victims  of  the

Geylang,  Lorong  5-9, fire of 15th November,  1963,

have so far each received $40 aid in cash.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these payments, families which have

lost  all their possessions as a result of  the  two

fires  will be paid rent subsidy, calculated  at  $7

per  victim, subject to a maximum of $35  per  month

per family, for a period of three months. Victims of

the  Lorong  21  fire were also  given  one  tin  of

condensed  milk per person from stocks  of  previous

donations in kind which had been received  from  the

public  in respect of previous fires. For the Lorong

5-9  fire,  donations of condensed  milk,  rice  and

noodles  were  received from the  public,  and  were

distributed to the victims as follows:



<pre>

                             Condensed milk       1 tin per person

                             Rice                 3 katies per person

                             Noodles              1 lb. per person

</pre>



Old  clothing donated by members of the  public  was

also distributed to victims of both fires.

<div align="center"><b>KOVAN ROAD</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Road metalling and installation of street lights)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock</b> asked the Minister for

National  Development (a)  whether the policy  is  to

metal a road and install street lighting at the same

time (b)  whether he is aware that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>



Kovan Road is metalled but has no street lights; and

(c)   when  will street lights be installed in  Kovan

Road.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I have been asked by the Minister for National

Development to answer the question.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Yes. It is the present policy to metal a road

and  install  street lighting at the  same  time.  I

should  add that with the coming into force  of  the

Local   Government  Integration  Ordinance  on   1st

September, 1963, when a private road is made  up  to

Government's specifications, the owners of frontages

will  have  to pay for the road as well as  for  the

cost of providing street lights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Kovan Road was made up under the provisions of

section 133 of the Municipal Ordinance which did not

require  a  road to be metalled and lighted  at  the

same  time. Street lights are provided according  to

priority. Priority is normally given to areas  where

schools   are   sited  or  where   accidents   occur

frequently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) That part of Kovan Road from its junction with

Yio Chu Kang Road to Hillside Drive has already been

lighted.  It  received  priority  because   of   the

existence  of  three schools. The  lighting  of  the

remainder  of  Kovan Road at an  estimated  cost  of

$13,000 is under consideration.

<div align="center"><b>(Supply of electricity)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock</b> asked the Minister for

National  Development (a)  whether he is  aware  that

residents   of  Surin  Avenue  have  made   repeated

requests for the supply of electricity and that they

have  sent  a  petition to the Prime  Minister;  (b)

whether  he is aware that electric wires  were  left

there  early  this  year  but  nothing  further  has

happened (c)  whether he could indicate when the work

will  proceed; and (d)  whether the electricity could

be supplied by Christmas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon (for the Minister for National</b>

<b>Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, (a) the scheme for

the  supply  of  electricity  to  Surin  Avenue  and

Charlton Lane was approved towards the end  of  1962

and work was put in hand in early March 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Due to objections raised by the owners of the

land through a legal firm, work was suspended at the

end of March 1963. Legal opinion was sought from the

State  Advocate-General and, acting on  his  advice,

the owners' solicitors were advised that work was to

be  recommenced. The ownership of the land  has  now

changed hands, and a notice has been served  on  the

new owner, informing him that work will recommence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Work will recommence before the end of the

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) It is hoped that houses will have electricity

supplied in early 1964.

<br><br>2.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> For the convenience of hon. Members,

I intend taking the total of each Head as it appears

in the third column of the summary of expenditure on

page  7  of Paper Cmd. 31 of 1963. We will now  deal

with  Heads  of  Expenditure  in  respect  of  which

amendments stand on the Order Paper.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D7 -



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D7 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I merely wish to know from the Prime Minister whether this vote includes the purchasing of land at Kampong Eunos, Jalan Ladang, Jalan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>



Ang Teng and Jalan Eunos for the purpose of building

community  centres  in  these  places,  as  he   has

announced  during  his  visit to  Kampong  Kembangan

lately.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, may I first clarify the

purpose  of  this particular development  vote?  The

provision  envisages expenditure under the following

categories:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Prompt acquisition of fire site.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The purchase of land excess of actual areas

required for a specific project in circumstances

which reduce the overall cost of acquisition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Taking up of surplus land held under title and

offered by the United Kingdom Armed Services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The acquisition of large areas of vacant

private   land   ripe   for  development   whose

availability  in  the open market  is  known  in

advance,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Expected and foreseen expenditure by each

particular  Ministry  for  development  purposes

includes  the  purchase  of  land  required  for

development projects. The matter that  has  been

raised  by  the  Member  for  Kampong  Kembangan

strictly  relates to the development vote  under

Social  Affairs. However, whilst I am unable  to

give  him  an undertaking now on the details  of

the  request  for community centres  which  will

entail  acquisition of land  in  Kampong  Eunos,

Jalan Ladang, Jalan Ang Teng and Jalan Eunos,  I

can  say  that  it  is the policy  to  site  the

community   centre  in  the  rural  areas   most

convenient  from the population  point  of  view

with  regard to transport and rural  tracks  and

footpaths. In the specific instances that he has

in  mind,  the  situation is being studied  with

regard to the community centres already erected,

and  should a case be made out for more  centres

near where the concentration



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>



of  population  in the kampongs  is  now  sited,

acquisition  of  the  various  pieces  of   land

indicated   by   the   petitioners    will    be

considered.





<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, we can see that the provision amounting  to

$10,700,000 in respect of the Government's policy of

land acquisition for development purposes is quite a

large   sum   of   money.  But  judging   from   the

achievements during these few years and  up  to  the

end   of  1963,  we  see  that  the  sum  spent   on

acquisition is only $1,450,000. In other words,  the

sum  for  the acquisition of land for next year  has

been  greatly  increased. We can also see  from  the

other  heads in the Development Estimates that there

is  provision  for land acquisition for  development

purposes. I do not know whether, when drafting these

Estimates,   the  Government  have  considered   the

necessity  for  such a large sum of money  for  land

acquisition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question I would like to ask is how the

price for land acquisition is fixed. Is it based  on

the price obtained in January 1961? Not long ago  we

read  in  the newspapers that there was a  piece  of

land in Jurong amounting to 1,020 acres belonging to

a  foreign company - Bajau Rubber and Produce  Estate

Company.  This is owned by big foreign  capitalists.

As  a  result  of  the  development  of  the  Jurong

industrial site, the value of that piece of land has

increased   very  greatly.  In  other   words,   the

Government have used public money, through taxation,

to  develop the Jurong industrial site. As a result,

the  value  of the land in this area has  increased.

This  will only benefit such foreign capitalists  as

the  Bajau  Rubber and Produce Estate Company.  This

has enabled this particular company to make a profit

of  $8  million. According to the market price,  the

price  of  land should not be more than  $1,000  per

acre  in  that  area. If the Government  are  really

sincere  in  wanting to look after the interest  and

welfare of the people, then it should not use public

money to develop land in such a way that in the  end

it is the foreign



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>



capitalists who benefit. I do not know what measures

the   Government  will  take  in  regard   to   this

particular land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government have also acquired land from the

Hokkien  Huay Kuan. The price paid to them  at  that

time was very low. It was about $1,000 per acre,  as

I  have  just now mentioned. But what price  do  the

Government intend to offer for this particular piece

of  land owned by a foreign capitalist? Is it a high

price?  How? Or will the Government allow the  price

of  land to increase so that it will get higher  and

higher  in  the course of time. I hope  the  P.A.P.

will not try to do things in such a way that in  the

end it is the foreign capitalists who will benefit.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, those of us who are new in

this  Assembly  will  soon  have  to  get  ourselves

accustomed to the regular drivel that is churned out

by  the  ghost writers and the mentors on the  other

side.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's last point, if I may take it first.

The  implication is that here is a Government  which

goes  out  of its way, either willingly or stupidly,

to assist foreign capitalists and who treats its own

capitalists harshly. He referred to what has already

been  printed  in  some  political  journal  of  the

Barisan Sosialis about the Bajau Land Company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to take advantage of the mathematical virtues of the Member for Jurong at some stage in this session of the House when a Bill with regard to land acquisition and development charges is raised before this Assembly. We are not concerned with whether the land belongs to European

capitalists  or local capitalists. We are  concerned

to  see  that  no private land owner benefits  as  a

result of capital expenditure made by the Government

- the  building  of  roads, the laying  of  services,

water, gas, electricity, railroads and, in any case,

the  general increase in the price of land,  because

land is limited and population increases. The amount

of  currency increases with the population  increase

and the increase in wealth;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>



but  land  does not. All over the world, this  is  a

problem  which is faced in all growing  communities.

Of  course, if we were a community falling backwards

and  land values collapsed, and population dispersed

into  the  hinterland  of Malaysia,  then  different

considerations would apply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to put to the Member for Jurong certain

broad principles which we are trying to apply  in  a

Bill  which  we shall introduce in this  House.  The

first principle is that nobody should get a windfall

because of development at public expense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second principle is that whenever land is

required for a public purpose, the price to be  paid

for  that  land should not be higher  than  what  it

would  have  been  worth  had  the  Government   not

contemplated development generally in that area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these two principles, we are then faced with

a   constitutional  difficulty  in  that,   in   the

Constitution of Malaysia, there is a provision which

says  that  no land or property can be  acquired  or

requisitioned   by   the  State   without   adequate

compensation  being paid, and one has  to  reconcile

the  two broad principles I have enunciated, namely,

that nobody should benefit as a result of government

expenditure  and  development;  and  secondly,   the

principle enunciated in the Constitution. This is  a

highly  complex matter. I am quite sure  the  Member

for  Jurong, if he is sincere, will spend some  time

in  Select Committee in working out an ingenious way

whereby  concerns  like the Bajau Land  Company,  or

whatever  realty  company, does not  profit  at  the

expense of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member is interested in real estate values,

one  of  the ways in which it is possible to control

land  values is that suggested by my Chief  Planner,

that land should no longer be freehold and that  all

land  should be leasehold, say, for 66 years  or  99

years.  So that at the lapse of every 66th  or  99th

year,   as  the  case  may  be,  the  land   reverts

completely  in toto to the State and is  then  again

sold or otherwise disposed of to the public. That is

one of the techniques which we could employ.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain difficulties as to how and what

development  charges  should  be  apportioned.   One

develops  Jurong  at  the cost  of  several  million

dollars.  How  does  one apportion  the  development

costs  against  all  the contiguous  frontages?  The

people  who own land around the area will  naturally

profit  because  the whole of that  area  becomes  a

developed area. Certain schemes have been  tried  in

Britain  unsuccessfully and have been abandoned.  We

are studying other schemes which are in operation in

Australia,  where  the technique of  the  short-term

lease  has been employed. But the disadvantage there

is  that nobody builds any house worth while because

the  land  very  soon  reverts back  to  the  State.

Somehow between these two we have to strike a  happy

mean.  But I would like to assure the House that  it

is  our  intention  to  see that  no  private  owner

benefits out of public expenditure on land. That  is

the first principle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the legislation is passed, it will have

retrospective effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as to the price that will be paid, the reason

why we have increased the sum to $10 million is that

there  is  a contingency of several large  purchases

for  the  coming  year. We are  sanguine  enough  to

believe  that  after the exposure that  the  Barisan

Sosialis suffered at the hands of the electorate  in

September  this  year,  they  will  find   it   more

difficult to try to block our resettlement  schemes.

There  is  also  a  resettlement  scheme  which  the

Minister  for  National  Development  will  soon  be

announcing,  generous  terms  of  cash  payments  or

substitution  in  kind.  That  is  because  we   are

sanguine enough to hope that - whatever may happen in

two  or  three years' time as the situation develops

and   the  Barisan  become  more  skilful  in  their

techniques of blocking development - they  will  have

considerable   difficulty.  One,  because   of   the

generous  terms  which  we will  be  offering,  and,

secondly,  the fact that they are suffering  from  a

nervous  feeling that they will not be so successful

in  preventing our redevelopment projects. The price

of the development in most of these cases - the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>



market value as at the time of acquisition - will

have to be taken into consideration during the

passage of this Bill.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Minister for National Development

about  the loans given to the Housing Board; whether

there  is  any interest borne by the loans given  to

the  Board, and at what rate of interest?  How  much

will Government get from the interest per year?  For

what purpose will this interest be used?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is there a difference in rentals for two-room

flats  built by the Housing Board? Another  question

is  - how many units of the $20-rental flats built by

the  Housing Board are vacant at present?  Have  the

Government   laid  down  the  maximum   income   for

applicants of one-room and two-room flats?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker, in connection with the loans to the Housing

and  Development  Board,  I believe  the  programmes

implemented by the Housing Board cannot be denied by

anyone, that the Board has used these loans  to  the

best  advantage  and thousands of  flats  have  been

built  quickly.  The  Barisan  Sosialis  have   made

continuous  efforts  to obstruct  the  programme  of

construction of these flats to be implemented by the

Housing  and  Development Board. For  instance,  the

Housing Board attempted to acquire land at Toa Payoh

for  the  purposes  of putting  up  flats,  but  the

Barisan  Sosialis instigated the settlers  there  to

obstruct  the  good  work  of  the  Housing   Board.

Unreasonable  demands were put up  by  the  settlers

there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, Mr Speaker, the S.P.A. claim that the plan

of  the Housing Board to sell flats to occupiers  is

their  plan, whereas, in fact, they could  not  even

proceed  with the construction of flats  during  the

Lim Yew Hock and Company regime since 1955.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing Board scheme to sell flats to the

occupiers  is  a novel scheme for the  lower  income

group so that they may own these fiats, as has  been

stated in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope the Minister in charge will explain to

the House when such a scheme will be implemented and

the areas in which work will be started, so that the

occupiers  of  flats  will  be  able  to  make   the

necessary  preparations for  the  purchase  of  such

flats.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first I will answer the

Member  of  the Opposition as regards loans  to  the

Housing  Board. I will say that the rate of interest

charged by the Government is an effective rate: that

is,  if the interest on loans in the market is about

5� or 5� per cent, the Housing Board will be charged

accordingly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his next question - what do the Government do

with  the  rate of interest that is charged  to  the

Housing  Board? I will say this, that the Government

will  have  to raise loans also from the market  for

their   development   projects.   Therefore,   these

interest  rates are in payment for the  loans  which

the  Government raise in the market in order to lend

to the Housing Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is: how many one-room flats are

completed?  Our Five-Year programme  calls  for  the

completion  of 51,000 units of flats. We  know  that

the  people  of  Singapore have  various  rates  of

income:  some of them earn $100, $200, $300  up  to

$800  a  month,  or  some of them are  millionaires.

Therefore, in our building programme, we take  into

account  tenants in different categories  of  income

and  we  work  it  out so that 30 per  cent  of  our

programme will be for a one-room unit, 30  per  cent

of  the units built will be for a two-room unit, and

40 per cent will be for a three-room unit. Now it is

usual all over the world for housing authorities  to

calculate  on the basis that a family or wage-earner

should  set aside between 20 and 25 per cent of  his

income  as  rental. Therefore, our flats cater  for

people  with an income of as low as $100  a  month,

because 20 per cent of $100 is $20 and that  is  the

rent  of  a  one-room unit. Last year, we  completed

about  12,000 units and out of that 3,000  are  one-room units.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the number of vacant Housing Board flats, at

the  moment  it  stands at 2.87 per  cent  of  about

40,000 units that are under our control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now to come to the question raised by one of our

Back-benchers with regard to the selling of  houses.

We  are  looking into this question now  because  it

involves  pricing,  terms  of  payment,  and,   most

important  of all, the maintenance of and titles  to

these  units  when we sell. There is a team  looking

into  it  and  I  expect  to  be  able  to  make  an

announcement  after  it has made  its  findings  and

recommendations with regard to the selling of houses

built by the Housing and Development Board.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would like to add to what our Minister has said just

now.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The building experts give credit to the Government

for  their ability in building such cheap  flats  in

Singapore. The flats are considered to be one of the

best in the world. The experts also say that no  one

can  build  cheaper  flats than those  built.  These

flats  are  built to suit the various  lower  income

groups. They are offered to the people at rentals of

$20,  $40  and $60 per month in respect of one-room,

two-room and three-room flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, I understand there are no more one-room

flats.  We  had  a few thousand of them,  and  since

there has been such a great demand, we have to build

several  thousand  one-room  units  at  the  Redhill

industrial site.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now have only 2.87 per cent of flats vacant and

this  is considered by building experts to be a very

small  figure. This is because the people  pick  and

choose the flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I have this to say. The Communists always

exploit  the poor because in a prosperous  community

Communism  will not survive. This is  a  lesson  the

Barisan Sosialis must always learn and not forget.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

there are several points on which I am not clear and

I  would  like  the  Minister to explain  them.  The

Minister  says that the rate of interest charged  is

5.75  per  cent. I would like to know the total  sum

involved on this rate of interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 2.87 per cent of flats vacant, I would

like to know the actual number of such vacant flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. Are the Government still

building  flats in spite of the fact that there  are

these   vacant  flats?  Are  the  Government   still

contemplating flats with monthly rentals of $20?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I understand

the Member for Choa Chu Kang correctly, he wants  to

know  the total amount we have paid out in interest.

Well,  this  loan  is a loan for  60  years.  It  is

possible  to  compute what we will be paying  in  60

years.  But I see no relevant point in asking  that,

because  it  is  a  60-year loan  and  we  pay  both

principal and interest at the same time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards his question on the number of vacant

flats  in  existence, I can say that, from the  last

census,  it is 2.87 per cent. His reasoning is  that

if there are empty flats, there is no reason why the

Government  should  go  on building  flats.  I  have

already explained a few days ago why there are about

1,000 flats vacant. We complete about 1,000 flats  a

month and it takes some time for the people to  take

up the flats which have been allocated to them. This

is  also  a measure of our success because, at  this

stage, out of every 1,000 fiats allocated, about  30

per  cent  of  them are rejected by  the  successful

applicants because they feel sure that if they  were

to  wait a little longer, the Housing Board would be

able  to  allocate them flats in the locality  which

they desire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member asks why we should build more flats. I

do  not  know whether it is his desire, but  I  feel

that it may be his desire to see that the people  of

Singapore  are not better housed and do not  have  a

better standard of living. On the other hand, we are

making  long-term plans so that not only the  present

generation but also the future generations  will  be

housed in healthy and sanitary surrounding. Now  our

population increase is estimated at 60,000 per  year

and  if we average five members to a family, we will

have  to build 12,000 units a year just to cope with

the   increase   in   population.   Therefore,   the

Government programme is to provide for this increase

in population for the years to come.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I wish to clarify what the Member  for

Choa Chu Kang has said about the 2.8 per cent vacant

flats,  which  is equivalent to about 10,000  vacant

flats. These flats are vacant not because there  are

no  applications for them. These fiats include those

newly  built in Bukit Ho Swee, Aljunied and Redhill,

totalling  more  than 9.000 units. So  actually  the

vacant  flats do not number more than a few hundred.

I can tell the Member that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>



the  flats  built by the Government cannot  cope  up

with  the demand. The flats in Selegie House are  in

great demand. I hope I have clarified the position.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member for Choa Chu Kang

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The same amendments also stood in the name of Mr Ong Lian Teng.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>I would like to take the two amendments together. On

the  provision  of $4,738,000 for resettlement,  how

much is provided for each resettlement area? I would

also  ask  whether the Government have the intention

of  revising the compensation rates which date  back

to the Lim Yew Hock Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also ask whether those rural people who

have  been  asked to move out are given  alternative

sites,  what is the period of lease given  to  them,

and  whether  there is any security or safeguard  to

protect them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is whether Government will allow

them  to assign the land given to them to others  if

they  find  that the land given is not suitable  for

their purposes. In the past, the Government practice

usually  has been to allot one to two acres of  land

to  these  affected rural people.  But  usually  the

alternative  sites  given  to  them  are  not  quite

suitable for agricultural purposes. So I would  like

to  know  whether  Government would consider  giving

either interest-free loans to these farmers or loans

at a very low rate of interest in order to help them

in their cost of production.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head D13 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Choa Chu Kang has also moved his

amendment  to  subhead 3, so that  the  debate  will

range over both these amendments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is expected

that  about 1,200 families will be moved  into  this

area  for development in 1964. The provision  of  $4

million  is  in  respect  of  land  acquisition   of

suitable farming land so that these farmers  can  be

given  alternative sites on which to carry out their

activities;   compensation  $1  million,   cost   of

development   work   in   the   resettlement    area

$1,100,000,  administration $261,000,  and  personal

emoluments $310,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Prime Minister has said earlier that

the  Government are revising the compensation rates,

and  it  is likely that the settlers will  be  given

better  compensation or alternative  sites.  Details

are  now being worked out and, as the Prime Minister

has said, an announcement will be made later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have found that in the past where these

squatters  may occupy illegally about ten  acres  of

land, invariably in no case have we found that  they

were  able  to  farm  more than one  or  two  acres.

Therefore,  in our resettlement scheme  we  do  not

give  them more than two acres because, as you know,

Mr  Speaker,  land is very scarce and  valuable  in

Singapore and it should not be given to someone when

it is not being made full use of.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards assignment, we try as far as possible to

stop  assignments because in the past we have  found

that  this practice has been abused. It is done this

way. A squatter is resettled. He is given a piece of

land. He is given compensation. In the next month or

so,  it is sold to someone else and the squatter  is

back  somewhere else squatting. In order to  prevent

such things, we have put a stop to assignments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no scheme to lend money to the resettled

family because from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>



compensation they get we expect them to be able  to

start life in their new surroundings.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, the Four-Year Development Plan  is

a  great  failure  in respect of rural  development.

There have been no results whatsoever. If we compare

the figures in the Estimates with those contained in

the P.A.P. Government's Four-Year Plan 1961-64, they

will  show whether or not there are any improvements

in  the rural areas. The Four-Year Development  Plan

blue  book gives the amount as $53,700,000  and  the

sum  provided for rural development was $26,100,000.

But  these  figures, it seems, are  quite  different

from  what  the  Minister for Finance  said  in  his

recent  Budget statement. He said that $1.77  million

was  allotted  for  rural  development.  That  is  a

decrease   of  $24.3  million.  According   to   the

Government, 97 per cent of the development has  been

achieved. In fact, it is not even up to 4 per  cent.

According  to  the Four-Year Development  Plan,  the

Government  intend to develop about 1,000  acres  of

arable  land, 1,000 acres of prawn ponds, and  2,000

acres of fish ponds. I do not know where these ponds

can be found.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has just now mentioned about resettlement, saying that at present there are many problems relating to the question of resettlement and that these problems need solution. I hope that a solution is forthcoming in the near future. I also welcome the Minister's assurance that he has a plan

to  improve  the  resettlement  areas.  I  hope  the

project will also include loans to the resettlers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past those people affected by resettlement

were  not  willing to settle down on the alternative

sites offered. The reason is that they could not get

loans.  Most of the resettlement areas are far  away

from  the  town  where  there are  not  many  social

facilities.  If the Government force  them  to  move

into  these resettlement areas, of course, they will

meet  with  opposition.  For  instance,  if  farmers

living  in  the Geylang area, which is arable  land,

are asked to move into Kallang where the land is not

suitable for agricultural purposes, then, of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>



course,  they  will oppose such resettlement.  If  a

farmer has two acres of land originally, and  he  is

compensated  with only one acre, he  will  also  not

agree to the plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is about transport, which should

also  receive Government's consideration. If farmers

in  the  Toa Payoh and Geylang areas are  forced  to

live  in  Choa  Chu Kang or Lim Chu Kang,  which  is

about 12 to 14 miles away from town, they will  have

difficulty in transport. Perhaps the land there  may

be  quite suitable for cultivation, but the cost  of

production to them will be more than the actual cost

because  of  the added and higher cost of transport.

So  this  question should be considered in order  to

reduce the burden on the farmers concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is medical services which have been

very   poor  recently.  Also  connected  with  these

services   are   veterinary  services,  agricultural

services,  inoculation of chickens, which have  also

been poor. Up to now the Government can only provide

tractors  to help the farmers. Since the alternative

land they occupy is not very extensive, the tractors

are therefore of no great value to them.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to talk about the water supply

which  is  a  very serious problem to  many  people.

There are lots of land which are very low and marshy

and  not suitable for agricultural purposes. Judging

from  the Government's resettlement area in Geylang,

the land there is not suitable for agriculture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will consider these problems

and  that  he  will  do  something  to  improve  the

situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot

reconcile  the fact that the farmers want - at  least

he  says  they want - to be farmers and at  the  same

time  want  to  be  in  town  and  enjoy  all   the

facilities  in town. I should be very  happy  if  he

would  indicate to us where we can get a  large  and

suitable farm tract in town so that these people can

have all the modern facilities of town life and,  at

the   same   time,   do  their  farming.   I   would

straightaway advise the Government to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>



acquire  this  land and give it to the farmers.  You

have either to be a farmer or an urban dweller. That

is all there is to it. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> He says that the rural development

project  of  the Government was a failure.  He  has

perhaps forgotten that before 1959 we had to  import

our  pigs from Bali, Indonesia. We had to import our

eggs.  But because of our rural development project,

because of the scientific advice given by members of

the  Primary Production Department, and  because  of

the veterinary centres that have been put up, we are

now  able  to  export  pigs  and  eggs.  That  is  a

criterion whether our rural development project  has

been a success or not, and not just empty talk.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an allegation that people are not willing

to  accept  the  alternative site  provided  by  the

Government  in the resettlement scheme.  My  figures

show  that  during the last three years, there  were

altogether   2,286   farmers   who   had    accepted

alternative  sites and had released  their  land  so

that   we   could  carry  on  with  our  development

projects. I would take a long time if I were to read

the schemes that we have in hand for the improvement

of  the farmers. But I believe the Member for  Bukit

Panjang knows as well as I do that a lot of projects

are being undertaken at the moment. Since this is an

era  of  science, if you want to have  progress  you

must   have   scientific  aid.  We  are,  therefore,

increasing the provision in the Estimates  for  more

laboratories   and  technical  equipment   for   the

guidance   of   the  farmers  in  the   nutritional,

diagnostic and other spheres.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  cannot agree with what the Minister has said.  He

says  that  if  you want to have facilities  in  the

city,  you  cannot expect them in the  rural  areas.

That  is  to  say, people in the rural areas  cannot

enjoy the facilities which the people living in  the

city area are now enjoying, and vice versa. I cannot

understand this kind of talk. City people are having

free  medical  services, free  veterinary  services,

water and electricity



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>



supply. Does it mean rural people cannot enjoy these

facilities? Does it mean that the Government have  a

double  standard, one for people living in the  city

area  and one for people living in the rural  areas?

The   P.A.P.  Government  have  said  that  whatever

facilities are available to urban dwellers will also

be available to rural dwellers. Now the Minister has

turned round and said that whatever facilities urban

dwellers   have  may  not  be  available  to   rural

dwellers. He says they cannot have it both  ways.  I

have  mentioned  just  now something  about  medical

services, transport and other things. The Government

could  provide  all these facilities. For  instance,

they    could    provide   better   transport    and

communications,   better  medical   and   veterinary

services and so on. All these are problems which can

be   solved  in  a  practical  way.  As  far  as   I

understand, there has been no export of  pigs.  Does

the  Minister  know that in the past two  months  we

have   imported  several  thousand  pigs  from   the

Federation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to

refute the allegations made by the Member for  Bukit

Panjang  with regard to rural development  projects.

Whatever he has said is not true. For example,  some

of   the   main   arterial  roads   in   the   rural

constituencies have been metalled. These roads  have

been  metalled  because they link up with  the  main

roads.  In  a  way,  transportation  in  the   rural

constituencies is now much better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to electricity supply. I know - being

myself  a  member  of the Urban and  Rural  Services

Consultative  Committee - that we have approved  many

kampong  electrification schemes.  This  shows  that

what he has said is not true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also installed many stand-pipes and water

mains  for the kampong folks. More community centres

have  been  built. At the same time, we  have  built

several veterinary centres in the rural



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>



constituencies.  For  example,  there  is   one   in

Tampines,  one  in Jurong and one  in  Thomson.  All

these  belong  to  the  Barisan constituencies.  The

Primary  Production Department give free  advice  to

the  farmers in respect of agricultural and  poultry

farming and so forth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about communications? We have also installed

many public telephones. I am sure if they were to go

to  the  rural  constituencies, they could  see  for

themselves  whether  the rural development  projects

carried  out by the P.A.P. are a success or  not.  I

say it is a tremendous success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to prawn ponds, he says he does not

know  where they are. It is up to him to go  to  the

constituencies,  at  Jalan  Kayu  and  Punggol,  for

example, where he can see these prawn ponds. Do  not

ask  silly  questions. He has asked, "Where  do  you

find prawn ponds?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D17 be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for Health about

school  dental  clinics. There is only  one  clinic.

Have  the  Government any plans for the building  of

more  school dental clinics for school children?  At

present  there  is at the Outram Road  Institute  of

Health,  only one school dental clinic to cope  with

all  the  school children in Singapore.  It  is  not

convenient for school children living in  the  rural

areas  to attend this Institute of Health.  Some  of

them  do not even know how to find their way  there.

It  will  be too expensive for them to go  by  taxi.

With  that money they can very well go to a  private

dental  surgeon.  This is not  a  very  satisfactory

state  of  affairs. So I wonder if the Minister  for

Health  would  consider building more school  dental

clinics at more convenient sites instead of spending

money  on  community  centres  which  are  not  very

important.  The building of community centres  would

only  be used by the P.A.P. for propaganda purposes.

[Interruption]  I  do  not know  what  Doctor  anti-Communist  is  talking about! The vote envisaged  in

the  Budget  for  works  and  buildings  under  this

subhead  is  $150,000. There  is  another  item  for

$162,000  for furniture and equipment. I would  like

to have more details concerning these two items.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, on the subject of the development  of

dental   services,  the  Member  for   Thomson   has

indicated  that  there  is only  one  dental  clinic

available  for school children. That is a matter  of

the  past.  There is a new dental  clinic  at  Pegu

Road, which is just next to Middleton Hospital,  and

which was opened very recently with 13 dental chairs

solely  for school children. So in addition  to  the

school  dental  clinic at the Institute  of  Health,

Outram  Road,  which  the  Member  for  Thomson  was

talking  about, where there are only  eight  chairs,

there  is,  as I have said, a second one, which  was

opened  just a few months ago. I hope it  meets  his

question on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>



building  of more than one dental clinic for  school

children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to say that that is not all. In

fact,   the  Ministry  of  Health's  dental  service

section has been very fortunate in that in the  last

Four-Year Plan about 90 per cent of achievement  has

been  reached in that there are a number  of  school

dental  huts.  Therefore,  for  1964,  we  will   be

building the remaining 10 dental huts; six  will  be

in  primary  schools at Tanjong Katong, Bedok  Boys'

and  Girls'  School,  Dunearn School,  River  Valley

School and Newton School which is the one covered by

the  1964 project. In addition, there will be 12 new

dental  clinics  in  12  new  integrated  Government

schools. But during the past year, we have been able

to build 12 school clinics in new integrated schools

and  there are also four dental clinics at  maternal

and  child  health  centres  at  the  Yio  Chu  Kang

Maternal  and Child Health Clinic, Ama Keng Maternal

and  Child  Health Clinic, Buona Vista Maternal  and

Child  Health  Clinic and Bukit  Panjang  Outpatient

Centre.  So  an attempt has been made to spread  out

dental  clinics  throughout the  island  as  far  as

possible.  I think this answers the request  of  the

Member for Thomson for a spread of dental clinics to

look  after the dental caries of our young children.

I  do  not  agree with him that it is preferable  to

build  dental clinics in place of community centres.

I  think  each has a function to perform.  Community

centres have a function to perform for adults ---

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D18 be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are both related. Can I take them together?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In the Development

Estimates,  we  find that there is no provision  for

the  Orthopaedic Unit and the Radiotherapy Unit this

year.  In 1963, the estimate for Works and Buildings

(Orthopaedic  Unit) was $117,000 and for  Furniture

and  Equipment, there was no provision; and for  the

Radiotherapy Unit, there was no provision for  Works

and  Buildings and Furniture and Equipment. For next

year,  there is only a token provision  of  $10  for

these  four items. I would like to know whether  our

Government  hospitals  have adequate  equipment,  or

whether there is a shortage of qualified doctors, so

that  expansion cannot take place, or is it  because

of   other  reasons  that  we  do  not  have  enough

provision  for these few items? I find that  in  the

Development Estimates in the Ministry of Health, the

provisions  for the Ministry have been  reduced  for

last year. It is a very strange state of affairs  in

view of the rapid increase of population.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Thomson  has an eagle eye when he noticed the  token

vote  of $10 for the two subheads concerned.  May  I

refer you to Hansard, 28th November, 1963, Col.  98,

when  the  Minister  for  Finance  made  his  Budget

speech?   In   referring  to  the  1964  Development

Estimates in the second paragraph, he stated:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There are three matters of note. First is the

deletion  of  a  number of projects entered  in  the

original plan.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original plan is the Four-Year Development Plan

of the Government for the years 1961-64.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The two Heads under which a significant number of

projects have been deleted or deferred are Head  D18

Hospital  Services and Head D37 Fire Brigade  [which

does not concern us this afternoon].'



<br><br>He went on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The second District Hospital has been deleted from

the  present  plan  as  also  has  been  the  second

Maternity   Home  and  the  Chronic  Sick  Hospital.

Similarly  all proposed clinics for 1964  have  been

deleted.  The  second  District  Hospital  and   the

Chronic Sick Hospital have never got off the ground.

These  are matters which may be raised again in  the

second Five Year Plan or some other Five Year Plan.'



<br><br>Now comes the relevant sentence:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Orthopaedic Hospital [I think it should read

as  the  Orthopaedic Unit in the hospital]  and  the

Radiography  Unit  [this also  should  read  as  the

Radiotherapy   Unit],  for  which  there   is   more

justification  than  the  other  projects,  may   be

reconsidered in the second Five Year Plan.  It  will

be  necessary to assess the availability of  doctors

when these major projects are reassessed.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, Sir, that is the explanation that

these   items  were  originally  in  the   Four-Year

Development Plan for the Ministry of Health for  the

years 1961-64.  Therefore, the token votes  for  1964

development  indicate  that  the  matters  will   be

reviewed. After I have been given the opportunity to

study  the two projects in my Ministry, it  is  very

likely that the green light would again be given and

we  would  then have to seek the permission  of  the

House for an allocation of funds. I trust that  when

that  time comes, our friends in the Opposition will

support the request for additional funds required.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Could the Member for Thomson indicate

whether he wishes to withdraw the amendments or have

a vote?



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

still not clear on the answers given by the Minister

for  Health  because  for  the  projects,  the  plan

provided  for  $1,700,000, and for the  Radiotherapy

Unit, the sum provided was $1,300,000. But for  next

year the provision is only $10 - a token vote. I do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>



not  know whether in drafting these Estimates he was

hiding in his air-conditioned room and had not taken

reality  into  account. If that is  so,  it  is  not

surprising  that they have accumulated  such  a  big

surplus.  Since  we  have this plan  and  since  the

Finance  Ministry  has provided such  an  amount  of

money, why should these projects not be carried out;

why  should  they  wait  for a  further  development

plan? If this is a way of saving money, then I  say

this Government is not competent.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I thought the Member for Thomson

is a reasonable man, but evidently ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> He is like the former Member for

Thomson.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Yes. The Member for Thomson runs

true to course. Perhaps he has not had the advantage

of  serving in the Government to realise that before

drawing  up  a Budget it was necessary for  estimate

figures  to  have  been  decided  earlier  on.   For

example, for 1964, the estimated figures should have

been  submitted sometime in February/March of  1963

before  you  can  produce the 1964  Budget.  It  has

already been explained that it is one thing to  draw

up a plan, but then you might encounter difficulties

when  the  Development Planning  Committee  may  not

approve  certain projects, although they  have  gone

into  the  plan,  because there are other  items  of

higher  priority  which have to  be  proceeded  with

first.  So I have tried to explain that the Minister

for  Finance has already revealed that in the  first

Four-Year Plan (1961-64) for the Ministry of  Health

the  percentage of achievement - if we turn  to  col.

112  of Hansard of 28th November, 1963 - showed  that

capital development for Health reached only  28  per

cent.  There have been a number of plans which  just

did  not  take off from the ground. But the Minister

for  Finance was kind enough at least to me  as  the

new Minister for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>



Health  - to  indicate that there  were  certain  big

projects  which,  although  scrubbed  out  from  the

1961-64  Plan, could be reconsidered  for  the  next

Five-Year Plan; in other words, 1965-69. But after I

have  had the opportunity of reviewing the position,

there is no reason why I will not be able to satisfy

my  Minister  for  Finance that this  is  an  urgent

project  which must get the green light in 1964,  by

which  time I can come back to this House  again  to

seek  additional funds to proceed with this project.

That is why I have said that when that time comes, I

hope  the  Opposition Members opposite will  support

me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the

Minister for Health has explained matters clearly to

the Member for Thomson. I would like to give them  a

bit of fatherly advice, Sir. They have been here  in

this  Assembly for just one week. The  Budget  is  a

very  complicated business. This process of a  token

vote  is  obviously a mystery which. I think,  they

should try to understand instead of launching out on

tirades  against the Government without evidence  of

Government  failure. As far as they  are  concerned,

Sir, they should regard themselves as wolf cubs  and

girl guides ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Let us have a debate on the

matter under discussion, and no comments on how  the

wolf  cubs. This takes us nowhere. I have asked this

Assembly right from the start of this Session not to

indulge in these personal attacks. One attack  leads

to  another,  and we will never get anywhere  except

that  some Members may lose their temper. I ask  the

Minister for Culture to bear that in mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are no other speakers, I will ask the

Member for Thomson whether he wishes to withdraw the

amendments or put them to a vote.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Development Estimates, we find that the

progress in respect of Maternal and Child Health-cum-School Health Clinics and Midwives Centres has  been

very  poor.  For example, in respect  of  Works  and

Buildings the original Plan Cost was $1,900,000  but

up  to the end of this year only about $200,000  has

been  spent,  i.e. the work carried out  amounts  to

about  ten per cent of the provision. For next year,

the  expenditure is estimated at $105,000,  and  the

work  yet to be completed is estimated at about  $1�

million. In respect of Furniture and Equipment,  the

original  Plan was to spend $300,000 but up  to  the

end  of  this year, $90,000 only has been  expended,

i.e. roughly  about  30 per cent  of  the  original

estimate.  For  next  year, this  estimate  is  only

$12,000, which is an even less figure. I do not know

whether  the Government consider that these Maternal

and  Child Health Centres are not important for  the

welfare  of  the people. The rural people  including

mothers  and school children have to travel far  for

medical care. They have to spend money and find time

to go to the clinics, and if the clinics are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>



crowded,  they  have to queue up. This  is  a  great

inconvenience  to  them. Why do the  Government  not

take care of them properly?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not agree

with  the Member for Jurong when he states  that  we

are  not  doing  enough in respect of  Maternal  and

Child  Health Centres in Singapore. It is just  like

the  opening  of out-patient clinics throughout  the

island.  It  is true that Maternal and Child  Health

Centres  need not necessarily be staffed by doctors,

but  we  still require certain doctors to  supervise

the  work  of  nurses and midwives. So here  is  the

question  of whether there is an adequate supply  of

staff.  I  think the shortage of trained  staff,  be

they  doctors, nurses, midwives, health nurses,  and

so  on,  is  a matter that has to be put  right.  An

attempt was made to put it right, but I think we can

still make greater efforts in that direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, in all, something like 58 Maternal and

Child   Health   Centres  throughout  Singapore   as

distinct  from  out-patient clinics  which,  I  have

previously said, number 32. There are ten, what  are

known as urban type clinics in the city area. But  I

believe the Member for Jurong was talking about poor

rural  folk having to travel long distances  as  the

centres are so far away. There are 24 clinics in the

rural areas. I will now call them out to satisfy the

Member for Jurong - they are all over the island  and

not close to the city area where they have to travel

by bus over long distances:

Sir, I could go on listing the attendances. For  the

year  1962, these infant welfare centres had to deal

with  427,000 infants of the age when they were born

till  one year old. For children over one year  old.

the number attending was 733,000. There were tens of

thousands  of  mothers. I am sure there  are  always

worried  fathers who come along to these clinics.  I

have  visited some of these Maternal and  Child  Health

Centres   during  the  present  cholera  inoculation

month, and I know how the people crowd there.  There

are  a  number  of  yelling  babies  and  distraught

parents - mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, aunties

and  all - who turn up at our centres. It is true  we

could  do very much more. But this is the best  that

we  are  able  to  do. I think our people  know  the

situation  well  enough, that this is  a  Government

which  has done its best to provide medical services

to its people. I, therefore, hope



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>



the Member for Jurong is now satisfied that far from

being unsatisfactory, the medical services of

Singapore are something of which we can well be

proud.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Would the Member for Jurong indicate

whether he wishes to withdraw the amendment or take a

vote?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, while

I  was  listening to the Minister for Health, he  was

reading  a  list of the names of roads.  Perhaps  the

reason  why  work has not been properly done  in  the

past  is  due to the shortage of doctors and  nurses.

This  is  the impression he has given me. I therefore

urge  him  to  take  immediate steps  to  remedy  the

situation and do a better job in the future. In  view

of that, I withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,147,000 for Head D19 ordered to stand

part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D21-



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We now proceed to Head D21 - Ministry

of Finance. The first amendment stands in the name of

<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I am

not moving the amendment*.



<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Amendment (1) reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D21 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member for Jurong is not moving

the  first amendment shown under Head D2l. The second

amendment stands in the name of Mr Poh Ber Liak.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D21 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 6.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This item concerns the $30 million loan for

development in Sarawak and Sabah. I wish  to  express

my dissatisfaction with regard to this provision. Mr

Speaker,  I  will  give my reasons  for  moving  this

amendment. First of all, I am of the opinion that the

White Paper on merger was drafted as a result of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>



intrigues  of  the Governments of Singapore  and  the

Federation of Malaya in conjunction with the  British

colonial power. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please allow the Member for Tampines

to  continue  in  silence. I do  not  want  any  more

interruptions. Please continue, Mr Poh.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you, Mr

Speaker.  These are the facts. Our economic interests

have   been  sold  out.  According  to  the   Finance

Minister's Budget statement, it is 40 per cent of the

national  income, that is, the loan amounts  to  $120

million.  The ruling clique in Singapore  and  Malaya

have  not  only ignored the wishes of the  people  of

Singapore,  but they have also wanted  to  confiscate

the income of the people of Singapore. The M.C.A. of

Malaya was also a party to this arrangement. Thus, as

a  result  of this arrangement, the small power  that

still  remains  in  the hands of  the  Government  of

Singapore was taken away.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> On a point of order. I do not think

the  Member for Tampines is reading the right  speech

because  this Head refers to loan for development  in

Sarawak  and Sabah. His speech is obviously  intended

for the White Paper on merger.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Surely the Minister will know that

the loan for development in Sarawak and Sabah came as

a  result  of Malaysia. I think the Member  is  being

relevant. Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> On a point of

order.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of order? The Minister for

Culture  has  just  risen. What is the  Parliamentary

Secretary's point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, the amendment

should  be such that it reduces the sum by  $100  and

not $10. If the Member wishes to speak in broad



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>



and  general  outlines, then he should have  reduced

the sum by $100 instead of $10 only.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> This is an item under subhead 6, it

is  not  the main heading D21. If it were under  the

main Head D21, the amendment would be to reduce  the

vote  by $100. But here it is under subhead  6.  The

hon. Member is correct. Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The purpose of the

P.A.P. in doing so is to facilitate the achievement

of its purpose. But now the Alliance is running over

the  heads of the people of Singapore. This  sum  of

money is put forward as a sort of cover in the  name

of  aid to the Borneo territories. Without this  the

P.A.P. would not be able to cover up its deceit.  We

can  also  see  the split sometime ago  between  the

M.C.A. and  the P.A.P. The differences between  the

M.C.A. and the P.A.P. that have arisen sometime  ago

have   been  caused  by  the  P.A.P.'s  device   and

intention. Otherwise there would not have been  such

an agreement like this.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time the P.A.P. claimed that this sort of

arrangement  was  a  victory  for  them.  The  power

struggle between the M.C.A. and the P.A.P. had  been

published in the newspapers and much dirty linen had

been washed. Today, the difference between these two

cliques,  which are both anti the people, cannot  be

resolved.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> On a point of order. What has

this  M.C.A. and P.A.P. struggle got to do with  the

loan?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member is making passing

references.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> He is wasting time.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have only got about 12 minutes. At

5  o'clock this particular item finishes.  Will  the

Parliamentary  Secretary allow him to  proceed?  Mr

Poh.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you, Mr

Speaker. They both



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>



tried  to become rulers and arbiters of the fate  of

the people in these areas. They tried to get hold of

this  surplus from the people to benefit themselves.

Both sides did not want to yield, but as a result of

the conciliatory efforts of the Tunku, they came  to

terms.  But  in the end the Tunku was still  on  the

side  of  the  M.C.A., Malaya, because  the  M.C.A.,

Malaya,  had been more useful to the Tunku than  the

P.A.P. in Singapore ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> On a point of order. I am still

trying  to  find  out  how Lee Kuan  Yew  being  the

father,  the Tunku being the father of Lee Kuan  Yew

and  the  M.C.A. politics relate to this  particular

subject.  I  also notice the paper  from  which  the

Member  is  reading; I am quite sure it is  intended

for a different speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member for Tampines is drifting

away  from the loan. I have allowed him to do  it  a

little  way, but I think he should come hack to  the

particular  item, which is "Loan for Development  in

Sarawak  and Sabah". He can make passing  references

to  merger, the Tunku and the Prime Minister, but he

should  try to confine his remarks, if possible,  to

the loan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I suggest he read the last page.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Change to a new speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

firstly,  I  mentioned that this provision  had  not

been  entered  in  the White Paper on  merger;  and,

secondly, I told you that this had been agreed to by

the  P.A.P. The P.A.P. had agreed in their  type  of

merger  arrangements  to give  $30  million  to  the

Borneo  territories. According to them,  both  sides

had  won in the struggle. According to calculations,

the  40  per cent surplus in national income amounts

to  $120  million.  According to the  agreement,  an

additional $30 million will be given. When can  this

sum  of  money  be  given  hack  to  the  people  of

Singapore? There have been no stipulations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>



in  the merger agreement. This is the way the P.A.P.

give out loans freely. The Minister for Finance said

that  we could get back this loan. But when  are  we

going  to  get it back? Mr Tan Siew Sin  also  said

that  $50  million  would be given  as  aid  without

interest.  So  the  loss on interest  would  be  $55

million. According to the P.A.P., by using our loans

the  Borneo  territories must use the labour  coming

from  Singapore.  But is this a fact?  The  Minister

said  that  although the Sabah Leader had  told  the

Press  that  he was not going to admit  our  workers

from  Singapore,  but  then  under  Sabah  laws  the

Minister had the discretion to admit anyone ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the Minister for Labour must

give  me  a few seconds to listen to what  has  been

said  by  the  learned gentleman before he  objects;

otherwise, I cannot rule.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Yes. I know he is tapering

away. I think it is only fair that the Minister  for

Finance  should be allowed time to reply to what  he

has  been  alleging  because this  will  stop  at  5

o'clock.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister has a point there. I was

about  to  ask the Member for Tampines  myself.  But

that is not a point of order. That is the discretion

for  the  Speaker  and the Member on  the  Floor.  I

assure  Members of the Government that I  will  give

them  a  chance  to reply. Perhaps  the  Member  for

Tampines will indicate how long he will be. Could he

wind  up his arguments quickly? We stop at 5 o'clock

and I am sure he would like to give the Minister for

Finance a chance to reply to his allegations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Read the last sentence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I will wind up my

speech  as  soon  as  possible. At  the  moment  the

Government should note that the trade unions in  the

First  Division of Sarawak and The Stevedores' Union

have reacted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>



very  strongly against the suggestion  that  workers

will  be  imported  from Singapore  for  development

projects.  If  the  Borneo territories  cannot  find

workers   and  have  to  import  them   from   other

countries, it will be a great blow to the workers in

the  Borneo  territories. I do not know whether  the

P.A.P. wish to create disharmony among the  workers

in  the Borneo territories and workers in Singapore.

On  the other hand, we do not believe that Singapore

can  send  workers to the Borneo territories,  since

the Minister for Finance has admitted that it is not

easy   to   send  our  workers  there.  Under   such

circumstances,  how are we going to deal  with  this

problem? The best policy is to make use of this loan

to  invest  in  our own country so as to  solve  our

unemployment problem. On the one hand,  we  have  to

beg  for  loans from the World Bank at 5�  per  cent

interest, but, on the other hand, we seem to be very

generous and charitable to be able to lend money  to

other people.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  there is nothing  new  in  what  the

Member for Tampines has said. Dr Lee Siew Choh, his

leader,  was making this point in the last Assembly,

sometimes spending eight hours saying how merger was

a   sell-out,  the  White  Paper  was  bad  and  the

financial arrangements were against the interests of

the  people.  The  Barisan said that.  What  is  the

result? In the general elections they got whacked ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Answer the question.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. There are interruptions from

both  sides  of  the  House.  Please  proceed,   Mr

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Allow the Minister three minutes to

speak in silence.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member for Tampines has the

audacity  always  to say not only  people,  but  the

broad  masses - "Kwang Ta Ren Min". That fellow  just

scraped  in  by  a  minority vote and  he  says,  "I

represent the broad masses." How can they say so?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Answer the question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Another hon. Member</b>: Lies!



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, there is nothing for me to

answer  because  he  is always talking  rubbish.  He

brought  up  the point of what will  happen  if  the

Borneo  territories do not want to use our  workers.

If  they do not want to use our workers, they do not

get  our money. It is as simple as that. We are  not

going to force this loan on them. So if the Governor

of  Sabah  or  the Member's colleagues in  the  pro-

Communist unions in Sarawak do not want our workers,

then  that is settled. Use the money here. I do  not

see any problem ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Unity of the working class.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> As to whether the loan is of

benefit to the people of Singapore. I say it will be

of immense benefit. My calculation is that under the

terms of the merger agreement, signed and agreed  to

by  the Governments of Singapore and the Federation,

we  should provide jobs in Sabah and Sarawak to  the

extent  of  something like 6,000 to  8,000  workers.

This  is  a substantial contribution in the  way  of

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D32 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask: since the State will spend

$4.38 million for the Singapore Conference Hall-cum-Trade Union House, when will the work be completed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The answer is

very simple. The Singapore Conference Hall-cum-Trade

Union  House will be completed by the early part  of

November 1964.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I have a question

to ask about the Singapore Conference Hall-cum-Trade

Union  House.  After  its  completion,  may  I  know

whether  trade  unions which are  not  under  P.A.P.

control can also make use of the Hall?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the policy on trade unions is very clear. We want to

offer the trade unions every help and assistance  so

that they can develop in the proper way. But as  for

those trade unions controlled by the Communists,  we

will   try  to  give  them  blows  until  they   are

eradicated. If they, however,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>



choose not to be under Communist control, then I can

assure  them that they will enjoy all the facilities

and benefits of the Trade Union House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

would  like to ask the Minister for Labour, what  is

meant  by a "Communist controlled" union? Is a union

which  does  not  support the  P.A.P. considered  a

Communist controlled union?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Not necessarily

so.  That  is  not the definition. All  those  trade

unions  which are not for the benefit  or  the  true

interests  of the workers and which are  engaged  in

non-union  activities are Communist controlled.  If,

instead  of  serving the genuine  interests  of  the

workers,  we  find that they serve the interests  of

the   Communists,  that  these  Communist  elements,

whether they be big or small in the Communist  trade

unions  - though they deny that they are  Communists,

but  through our observation and experience  in  the

past few years, we have found that they are actually

Communist elements and their presence in the  unions

is  to  carry  out  their Communist activities  - are

making  use  of  the  trade unions  for  other  than

legitimate  union purposes, to do things detrimental

to  the interests of the workers and to endanger the

security of the State, then I assure the House  that

the  Government  will not evade their responsibility

to  take proper steps to deal with them in order  to

safeguard the interests of the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot allow these trade union traitors to ride

over  the heads of the workers under the pretext  of

working  for  the people, no matter how  they  style

themselves  as "heroes of the workers" or "champions

of  the workers' interests". We will not allow  them

to  make  use of this cover to do things harmful  to

the workers and detrimental to the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this matter, the P.A.P. Government have a pro-labour policy, and the Singapore Conference Hall is

a concrete symbol of our policy. It was only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>



after the P.A.P. came into office that the Singapore

Government allotted millions of dollars to build the

Singapore Conference Hall-cum-Trade Union  House  to

foster the growth and development of the trade union

movement,  that  is, of all healthy  and  democratic

trade   unions.  We  cannot  allow  a   handful   of

undesirable and illegal elements to carry out  their

activities to ---

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since television was inaugurated in Singapore at the beginning of this year - at first there was only one channel but now there are two channels (Channel 5 and Channel 8) - it seems to me that the programmes are still limited in scope. Therefore, I should like to know whether the

Ministry of Culture will increase the scope of  T.V.

programmes  so that they will be at par  with  radio

broadcasts  in each of the language streams,  as  is

the  case  with Radio Singapore, so that  the  Malay

programmes on T.V. can be increased. At the  moment,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, there are practically  no  Malay

films   shown  on  television,  and  although   T.V.

Singapura  telecasts quite a good number  of  Indian

and Chinese films, for the Malay service only Kalong

Senandong and Dondang Sayang are telecast.  I  would

ask  the  Minister  for Culture whether  more  Malay

films could be telecast in future.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Television

Singapura is quite conscious of the fact that at the

moment there is no adequate provision for programmes

in  all  the  language streams, in  particular,  the

Malay and Indian programmes. Of the 61 hours a  week

that  we  broadcast over T.V. Singapura, only  about

one-fifth   of  that  time  is  devoted   to   Malay

programmes.  Now, the reason for this is  that  very

few  feature films in Malay are available. In  fact,

some  time  ago,  we tried very  hard  to  get  some

feature  films  but only succeeded in  getting  some

very  old films of such poor quality that there were

protests  from the listeners and we had to  withdraw

them from exhibition.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, Sir, unlike English and Chinese films

which are produced extensively both in Hong Kong and

Singapore,  Malay  films are produced  only  in  two

studios  in Singapore, and they cater for a  limited

and  competitive market in the country.  It  is  not

possible for these two studios to provide recent and

up-to-date Malay films at low rentals for use by our

T.V.,  as this will spoil their cinema market.  They

do  spend a lot of capital in producing these films.

However,  the  film  companies  concerned  have  now

agreed  that  Television Singapura  can  show  films

which  are  more  than five years  old,  provided  a

reasonable   price   is   paid.   At   the   moment,

negotiations  are in progress. A further  difficulty

which may be of interest to the Barisan is that,  as

a  result of confrontation, we are not able  to  get

the  more  wholesome Indonesian films for exhibition

in this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Culture is conscious of the

shortage  and is trying to rectify it in  two  ways.

One  is by trying to produce more live entertainment

in  Malay,  and when we have extra studio facilities

and  more  equipment, I think we should be  able  to

provide  more  live entertainment in Malay  for  our

Malay listeners. At the moment, out of six hours  of

programme  entirely  in  Malay,  half  of  them  are

entertainment features



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>



produced  exclusively  by Television  Singapura,  and

these exclude sub-titling of other films in Malay  or

commentary in Malay over the second sound channel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason why this position may be somewhat

rectified is that with the introduction of television

in Kuala Lumpur, and later in all the principal towns

in Malaya, it will be possible to exchange programmes

to  increase the output of Malay films which will  be

made  available to Television Singapura. I also  hope

that  with the introduction of commercial television,

we  may  be  able  to prevail upon certain  firms  to

sponsor live shows in Malay and in other languages to

meet the inadequacy of films.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things I would like to point out is

that,  I  am  told,  to have one  minute  showing  on

Television Singapura - a feature or a film you see for

one  minute - involves work up to 8 hours to 12  hours.

So  you see, Sir, the difficulty of our being able to

produce enough entertainment to fill 60 hours a week.

I  hope this explanation will satisfy the questioner.

I would like to assure Members that, on its part, the

Ministry  of  Culture  will  try  to  concentrate  on

increasing the programmes in Malay and Tamil.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Development Estimates the Government on this

item  are providing for $1,000,000 for next  year  to

carry  out their so-called "Youth Leadership Training

Centre". We can see that the money spent on the Youth

Leadership  Training Centre under Social  Welfare  is

far  more  than  that  on other  items  in  the  same

department. This shows that the P.A.P. Government are

very much concerned with the project which will serve

their  Party.  As  regards  other  items  which   are

beneficial to the people, the Government are not very

much  concerned.  We  can  see  that  the  people  in

Singapore  are facing difficulties. The  unemployment

problem  is  very grave. Those who are  in  need  are

receiving  a  very  small  sum  of  money  from   the

Government. The Government should pay more  attention

to  these people. The Government, on the other  hand,

are  spending  a  big  sum  of  money  on  the  Youth

Leadership Training Centre and very little  on  other

items which are really beneficial to the people.

in  which unemployed people can live or stay  or  be

housed?  The  point  I  am making  is  that  we  are

expenditure  can  be made in the  other  alternative

subhead.

talked  about anti-Communism. The P.A.P. are  using

the people's money to carry out activities which are

not  beneficial to the people. The sufferings of our

to  train their own Party's cadres. We have no doubt

that  the P.A.P. are using this $1 million to  train

their  own Party's cadres. And we condemn  them  for

using public money for their own purposes.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can well

understand why the Members opposite are getting very

annoyed  at the expenditure on this Youth Leadership

Training  Centre. It is because they see  the  long-term  danger  to  themselves. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  in

Singapore  the number of youths amounts to something

like 300,000 and out of this number of young men and

women,  only 10 per cent are under some proper  form

of  organised youth movement, 90 per cent  are  not;

and  it  is  in  this 90 per cent that  the  Barisan

Sosialis,  their  stooges and other  Communist-front

organisations have been working and,  to  give  them

credit,  working  very effectively - young  boys  and

girls coming out of primary schools, youths of  ages

16,  17, at a loose end, their minds seduced by evil

men.  This  is  coming to an end, Mr Speaker,  Sir.

Their supremacy in that sector is now being directly

threatened by us. We are not going to apologise that

we  use  public  money, of course,  $1  million;  if

necessary, $10 million will be put forward for this.

Not  for  the  P.A.P.  This is  a  democratic  youth

movement. We are going to put the whole resources of

the  State; money will not be spared; personnel will

not  be  spared,  and it is going to  be  a  roaring

success  as  we move into their enclave and  destroy

one  outpost after another. That is the way to fight

the  Communists. True, if they step over  the  limit

they  get nabbed, put aside, put out of harm's  way.

That will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>



go  on.  There is enough of them to keep our Special

Branch in Singapore and the Special Branch in  Kuala

Lumpur busy for some years to come. But that is  not

the  decisive  method in the long run.  If  one  can

employ a mathematical jargon - that is necessary  but

not a sufficient condition of success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary to go further than this, not only

to  use  the prophylactic method of cleaning up  the

field whenever it gets contaminated, but it is  also

fundamentally necessary that we should  provide  our

young  men  and women with healthy activities  in  a

well-run,  well-managed and well-led youth movement.

We  have  spent some time thinking of the programme.

The  first training programme is already running  in

the  form of the Buona Vista Community Centre.  That

is  not to train youth leaders but to train  people

who  will train youth leaders. And so the thing will

go on. Eventually we will have something like 10,000

trained youth leaders and we will deploy them in all

fields,  winkle  out the Communists  from  each  and

every  enclave,  be it in the trade  unions,  be  it

among the farmers, be it in the schools. We have the

resources,  we have men of ability and  intelligence

to  destroy  the  last vestiges of  their  influence

among  the young in Singapore. That is why they  are

worried. That is why they say it is of no benefit to

the  people.  It is of no benefit to the Communists.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, we are not in power to do  things

for  the  benefit of the Communists. We are here  to

see  that they are totally destroyed and irrevocably

removed from the political stage in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, to add to what has

been said by my colleague, the Minister for Finance,

let  me explain that the training undertaken at  the

Buona   Vista  Training  Centre  mentioned  by   the

Minister  for  Finance is not  to  train  youths  in

connection with party politics or the P.A.P., but it

is  to  train  people who in turn will  train  youth

leaders.  This  training will  be  taken  through  a

concentrated four-month course in matters of civics,

methods    of    instruction    and    organisation,

recreational activities for youth, youth



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>



education, the national language, physical  fitness,

technical  skill in audiovisual aids and  vocational

activities; and finally first aid. Those people  who

are  undergoing this training live in  this  centre.

The  total number of youths taking part is 100 at  a

time  and  this  training will be conducted  in  all

language  media - English, Malay, Chinese and  Tamil.

As  explained by the Minister for Finance just  now,

the training has already been undertaken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member in moving the amendment has

said  that  the  Singapore  Government  ignore   the

welfare   of   the  people,  that  the  people   are

confronted with difficulties, that the aged  do  not

receive   adequate  social  assistance,   and   that

Government are giving priority to youth training  to

the  amount  of  $1 million. The reasons  have  been

given by the Minister for Finance. I merely wish  to

emphasise  that  during a month the  Social  Welfare

Department  spend about $1 million in  the  form  of

social welfare and aid to the needy and aged. If the

Members opposite wish for further information, I can

outline  it  in  detail, but because time  does  not

permit it will take me about 20 minutes - let me  say

that   the  Government  have  never  shirked   their

responsibilities towards the needy and the aged.  We

constantly    give   attention   to   needy    cases

irrespective of race.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

we are debating the question on the Youth Leadership

Training Centre. I think there is grave doubt as  to

whether  the  P.A.P. Ministers  are  able  to  train

proper  leaders in the youth field. In the  Minister

for  Labour's speech he has used vulgar and  abusive

language.  In spite of our challenge as  to  whether

they  can  say that our Party is controlled  by  the

Communists,  he  has  not  accepted  our  challenge.

Instead, he is dumbfounded at our challenge. On  the

other hand, however, he is trying to make use of the

case  of public assistance to refute our allegation.

The  Parliamentary  Secretary to  the  Minister  for

Social Affairs said a few days ago that he wanted to

produce evidence to show how much the Government had

done. But I told him that if he really had the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>



guts,  then  he  should make use  of  his  so-called

evidence  against those arrested in Court  to  prove

beyond  any doubt that they are Communists. If  they

really  can do it, produce sufficient evidence.  But

they mention Communism just to call a dog a bad name

and  hang  him. Apart from this, they are unable  to

debating  the Youth Leadership Training  Centre  and

not Communism.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, we have gone off the track, but

it  was  the Minister for Finance who, I  think,  in

discussing   the   question  of  youth   leadership,

referred  to  his idea or object of  training  youth

leaders  to  smash the Communists. So  I  think  the

Member for Tampines can, if he objects to it,  speak

about it. Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak (In Mandarin.):</b> Mr Speaker, we

are  actually  debating the question  of  the  Youth

Leadership  Training Centre. We do  not  oppose  the

idea   of  training  our  youths  to  become  useful

citizens  of  the  State. But from  the  incompetent

behaviour and attitude of the Ministers, such as the

Minister for Labour, we can see that they only  make

accusations against us, calling us Communists.  That

shows  their  incompetency and inability,  they  are

politically  ignorant. When they are at their  wits'

end, they will call us Communists just to find a way

out.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member said "the Minister for

Labour", but the Minister for Labour has not  spoken

on  this particular subject. It was the Minister for

Social  Affairs,  but I do not  think  he  made  any

allegations  against the hon. Member.  Can  we  come

back   to  the  debate  and  forget  these  personal

attacks?



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I am

making my points in reply to the views expressed  by

the  Minister for Finance. I am trying to  say  that

the  Minister for Finance has been incompetent  and,

therefore, I have grave doubts of their capacity  to

train youths



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>



to  become useful citizens. As we can see  from  the

past few days, all that they can do is to abuse us,

call  us  Communists and try to challenge  us  to  a

fight.  That is all they are good for. But  if  they

really  are capable, then they must face up squarely

to  the  problems and go according to  parliamentary

procedures to show that not only are they capable of

training  others,  but  they  are  also  capable  of

dealing  with  our questions. But during  all  these

days,  all  that  they can do is  to  interrupt  our

speeches,  intimidate  us and  call  us  Communists.

Apart from these, they are incapable of showing  any

more  of their ability. So that is why we have grave

doubts  of  their  capacity to  train  youths.  This

amount  of $1 million for their purpose is  just  as

good as being thrown into the sea.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Why is the Member trying to

bluff? Why try to bluff? His Woodhull was there,  an

old  friend of mine - he has let the cat out  of  the

bag.  Puthucheary  has said Lim  Ching  Siong  is  a

Communist. I mean, why try to bluff? Does  he  think

we   are  children?  When  they  say  they  are  not

Communists,, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is like a seasoned

whore pretending to be a virgin. It is not something

anyone would accept.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as for capacity to run this more effectively,

I  can  assure the Member for Tampines that  we  are

going  to  get  the  best  experts  to  run  it.   I

personally spend half my time away from the  Finance

Ministry  to make sure that this will be  a  roaring

success. If he doubts my ability - he is entitled  to

doubt  it - but we will see in five years' time  that

they  will be winkled out of all their pockets. They

have no chance. Let them give up the ghost now.  Not

a chance will they have.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think it would be convenient for

the   Member   to  debate  all  the  five   proposed

amendments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Before we debate on

the  Budget statement the Minister for Finance  said

in  his speech that this is the worst debate on  the

financial  statement that we ever had in five  years

in  this  Chamber, but he seems to  have  failed  to

understand how this should come about. It is because

his  financial statement is the worst ever.  So  you

have  the  worst Estimates, followed  by  the  worst

debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> A worst Opposition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I wish to say there is

ample evidence in the Development Estimates of  1964

as  produced by the Minister for Finance.  In  these

five  items, that is, from subhead 13 to subhead  17

we  discover that, in so far as the school  building

programme  is concerned, it has not been implemented

satisfactorily and to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>



fullest  possible extent. Why? Perhaps it is because

the  Minister for Finance, in making the  estimates,

only  wants  to  have  some big figures  to  impress

others. For example, our Minister for Education  has

been  boasting about the fact that one-third of  our

expenditure  goes  to education. But  what  are  the

facts?  The facts are they are only able to  produce

big  figures  but they are not able to complete  the

programme. We have already calculated that in  these

five sub-heads a total provision of $46 million  has

been  made. But let us calculate some more  figures.

In  the  past  four years what has been  spent?  The

Government  has only spent $11 million  against  the

total  figure  of $46 million. And what  about  next

year,  1964? Well they are going to have an estimate

of  $13 million for the building of schools. In  the

past  four  years  they were only able  to  use  $11

million. Next year they are going to make use of $13

million.  Now, even if we assume that the  programme

for  next year will be achieved and completed to the

fullest  extent,  the provision for school  building

can  only  be used up to only half the total  amount

provided, and that is $22 million. We wish  to  know

why  this should be the position. Is it because they

want to bring up big figures - impressive figures - to

show  that they have achieved a great deal? But,  in

fact,  they  do not have an overall plan to  utilise

the  money provided to the fullest possible  extent.

They   cannot   fulfil   the  programme.   So   this

development  estimate is, if I  may  use  a  Chinese

proverb,  "to smack your own face so that  you  will

appear to be normal when, in fact, you are swollen."

Then he will have some plaster put on the muscles of

the  Minister for Education and he will  then  start

showing  the people his artificial muscles.  In  the

end  when  he moves his arms the plaster will  fall.

This  is  the analogy that I wish to draw, the  fact

that they are able to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>



make  use  of one-quarter of the amount provided  in

the  school  building programme. I doubt  very  much

whether they can do any more in future.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head D40 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 13."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have indicated before, the debate will range

over  all  the first five amendments as shown  under

Head D40 - Ministry of Education - on the Order Paper.

Mr Yong Nyuk Lin.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Thomson has alleged that I was trying to put on some

false muscles. Fortunately, I am not a woman.  I  do

not  have to use falsies. But I can tell the  Member

for  Thomson  to  refer  back  to  Hansard  of  29th

November, 1963, col. 132, wherein it was stated that

the  back  of the problem of inadequate schools  and

teachers,  of  the  shortage of  homes,  houses  and

flats, had been broken. Sir, if he will now turn  to

the  Hansard  again, to the Minister  for  Finance's

Budget  address  of 28th November, 1963,  col.  112,

Table   VI,  under  Social  Development,   item   2,

Education,  Capital Outlay, the Plan  Provision  was

$94.48  million. I believe the Member said only  $48

million, so it is only one-half. So he has his facts

wrong by 50 per cent. The Plan Estimates came to $73

million,  the Actual Outlay $32 million,  which  was

only 44 per cent of achievement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Member for Thomson is true to himself

and  true to the people of Singapore, and knows  how

to  use public money, far from making fun of me,  he

should congratulate me on the fact that with 44  per

cent  achievement  I have broken  the  back  of  the

school problem in Singapore. There is no question of

falsifying  figures  and pretending  to  be  bigger.

Naturally,  we  would  like  to  be  bold  to   make

estimates   for   a  country  that  attained   self-government  4� years ago, in 1959, for  a  popularly

elected    government   to   shoulder   the    whole

responsibility for education, which was  never  done

in the past, and that it was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>



possible to achieve it with only 50 per cent of what

we wanted to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> It does not mean that, if one

becomes  the Government and there is a provision  of

$90  million, one should just spend $90 million. One

must always consider that this is public money,  and

every cent must be carefully accounted for, and  if

it  is possible to achieve it at half the cost, then

I  think  it  is  time  that they  woke  up  and  be

responsible and not say time and again that they are

unsatisfied,  that everything is wrong.  It  is  far

from  me  to claim credit because it is the teamwork

of  this Government which is dedicated to serve  the

people,   the  true  interests  of  the  people   of

Singapore, and not the disloyal manner in which  the

Barisan  have claimed that they would speak for  and

represent the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the

ex-Minister  for  Education,  namely,  the   present

Minister   for  Health,  when  we  were   discussing

questions relating to the Health Ministry, was quite

calm.  But now he appears as though we have  wronged

him.  And he used excitable words - words of  feeling

and   emotion  - and  he  spoke  with  emotion,   and

vociferously attacked us in his reply. But there are

a  few  points I would like to clarify, namely,  the

development  expenditure on  education.  First,  the

Minister for Health was wrong in listening to us.  I

said  that  $46  million was used in building  - Head

D40,  subheads 13 to 17. I was talking about  school

building, and not on the whole development programme

for  education. So the Minister was wrong in getting

at  me.  I only talked about capital expenditure  on

building  schools. As we have said, you cannot  show

that  you  have  any  achievements  by  giving   out

figures.  The Minister for Health told us  that  the

P.A.P. Government have achieved much in the field of

education  and the money has been put  to  practical

use. I would like to ask this. Recently there was  a

news  item  in  the newspaper that, from  next  year

onwards those students wanting to go



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>



to secondary grammar schools would have no place and

they  would  be  given  accommodation  in  technical

schools  instead.  On  this  I  would  ask  why  the

Government  have not made full use of the  money  to

build  secondary  grammar schools  to  enable  these

students to study. Why should there be no places  in

such secondary grammar schools? This is not the  way

to save money.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year $13 million will have to be spent on

building  schools. A remaining sum  of  $22  million

from  the  past Five-Year Development Plan  has  not

been used. What is the use of voting for this amount

if  the money is not put to full use? As a result of

this, students next year will have no schools to  go

to.  Now  this is a fact. I would like  to  ask  the

Minister to answer this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The Member for Thomson tries to

pick  on a little technical point, which is  to  say

that  just because it was necessary for the Ministry

of  Education  to state that some of those  who  had

passed  the  Primary  VI  examination  in  1963  and

wishing to join secondary academic schools in  1964,

but   are  being  posted  temporarily  to  secondary

technical  schools,  secondary  vocational  schools,

therefore,  it is badly planned. This is just  utter

nonsense because a secondary school, whether  it  is

vocational,  academic or technical, is  a  secondary

school  and  they  will be learning common  subjects

most  of  the  time, in addition to other  subjects,

specially  for  vocational,  academic  or  technical

schools.   The   buildings,  the   facilities,   the

laboratories and the teachers will be there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we have to deal with a secondary school

population that has increased by nearly 100 per cent

within four years, surely it is just like asking the

Member  for  Thomson  to buy a new  pair  of  shoes.

Sometimes when it twitches the little toe,  it  does

not mean that you should throw the shoe away. I mean

with  a  new  pair of shoes it will be necessary  to

break  it  in  and,  in course of time,  when  other

schools are built - it takes almost a year to build a

new school - then they could be sent to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>



the new schools. But what is important is that every

child  leaving a primary school has at least another

two  years of secondary education. In Singapore  for

the  first  time in its history, it is possible  for

every school-going child to be in school right up to

the  age  of 15 plus. And even in advanced countries

like  the  United Kingdom with compulsory  education

for  umpteen years, they have not been able to raise

the  school leaving age from 14 plus to 16 plus.  So

it  is  such a small technical point to say  because

the  children  are being posted not to  a  secondary

academic school but to a secondary technical  school

and  to a secondary vocational school, therefore the

Education Ministry has failed. This is just  wasting

time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

there was one question which received no answer. The

Government  has  been allotted  so  much  money  for

education  but  they  use the money  for  propaganda

purposes. Why are the Government trying to show that

they  have been using the money on education instead

of  making a full admission that the money has  been

spent on propaganda purposes? This only goes to show

that  the plan is merely a plan which is not drafted

according to practical needs, because we cannot deny

that certain students will not get a place in school

next  year.  This has been printed in the newspaper.

It  is  a news item. When the Minister is unable  to

give  a  reply, he will say nonsense. His reason  is

one  which  amounts to nonsense. Those are  all  the

reasons  he can advance. I was quoting from  a  news

item.  I  wish  to  know whether the  Government  in

drafting this plan wanted only to make use of it  as

a means of propaganda when, in actual fact, they did

not know how to put the money to good use.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> I

think the important thing is whether every child  in

Singapore who wants to go to school can find a place

in  school.  I  say for the last 4�  years  we  have

managed to expand the building programme to such  an

extent  that we are able to find a place  for  every

child who wants to learn. Everyone who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>



passes  the  primary school leaving  examination  is

given  a place in a secondary school. For the Member

for  Thomson  to  allege that there are  not  enough

secondary schools for the primary school leavers  is

just not true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the important thing is to satisfy the needs of school children - if we can spend 50 per cent of the provision in the Estimates and yet satisfy the needs of the people - that proves that we are more efficient, we can effect economy. So the Member should give us the credit. Instead, he is

running  down the Government. And Mr Speaker,  Sir,

following  his line of argument, it would mean  that

the Government of the People's Republic of China and

the  Soviet  Socialist Republic are most incompetent

and  inefficient, because their Five-Year  Plan  has

been subject to revision year after year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis never like figures, I mean,

statistical  figures, for these figures always  nail

the  lies  of  the Barisan Sosialis.  There  are  in

Singapore today 464,000 children in our schools  and

there will be more next year. And of this figure  25

per  cent  are in our secondary schools.  Now,  this

means that one in every four of our population is in

school. This is a record not to be surpassed in  any

of  the emerging nations in South-East Asia. 48  new

schools with 1,035 classrooms and accommodation  for

85,000  pupils have been built since 1960. Of these,

30  are primary schools and 18 secondary schools. In

addition,  eight primary and secondary schools  were

further  extended. Today there is a place for  every

child   who  registers  for  admission  in   primary

schools.  Similarly everyone who passes the  primary

school leaving examination will be found a place  in

secondary  school, an achievement that  the  Barisan

Sosialis'  country of adoption can  only  dream  of.

Confrontation notwithstanding, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  a

further  26  new  schools are due to be  constructed

next   year.  In  addition,  12  new  schools,  five

primary,   three   vocational  and  four   secondary

technical  schools, will be functioning  in  January

1964.

<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Ministers of the P.A.P. are wont to use figures

and  statistics to argue against any reasons or talk

advanced  by  the Opposition. But these figures  and

statistics are not based on facts. Now let  me  base

my  speech on what I have seen for myself in my  own

constituency  to rebut and to expose the  Minister's

figures.  I would challenge the Minister for  Labour

to  a debate with me either over Radio Singapore  or

at  a public forum, anywhere he chooses. You are not

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Would the Minister for Labour allow

the Member for Tampines to proceed in silence? When

he had the Floor, he was not interrupted. The Member

for  Tampines  has  not been on  his  feet  for  two

minutes  when I had occasion to shout order,  order.

Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you, Mr

Speaker.  Now  I  will try to expose the  Minister's

statistics by facts, no matter how he boasts of  his

achievements in education. Boasting that every child

who  wishes  to  go  to school will  have  a  place.

Boasting  that the money has been put to  full  use.

Let  me  now  recount what I have  seen  in  my  own

constituency,   the  situation  and  conditions   in

certain schools in my own constituency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the 8 m.s. Tampines Road, there is a school

called  Ling  Long  School which  has  already  been

established for 40 years up till now. But  when  the

P.A.P. came  into  office, the  principal  of  this

school  was sacked. This happened in 1961.  In  1962

this  school  was  dissolved  by  the  Ministry   of

Education, the reason being that the school did  not

conform to sanitary and hygienic conditions and  the

Ministry  of  Education has been  wont  to  do  such

things  as a pretext to dissolve a school.  But  why

did the Ministry not allot some money to improve the

conditions of such schools? This particular  school,

after  being dissolved for this reason, was absorbed

in  1963 into an integrated English school. When the

Prime Minister toured the rural areas,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>



a  few  hundred rural people in that area petitioned

him  to  consider their request to run this  school,

but up till now there has been no news.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This school has now been confiscated by the

Government and the site is used for the expansion of

the Airport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more important than education? How many

students  have lost their education because  of  the

expansion  of  the Airport? Some  of  them  have  no

further   opportunity  of  continuing   with   their

education;  some  of  them have been  absorbed  into

English schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give another instance which I know of and

let  me  state  the facts. At the 8�  m.s.  Tampines

Road, there is a school called It Sun School. A  few

days ago, the student enrolment was filled, and many

children  wishing to enrol were unable to  register.

Some of them were forced to enrol in English schools

very  far  away  from  their  homes.  Many  of   the

villagers  in this area wanted to extend the  school

building,  but the educational authorities  did  not

give  them  the necessary permission  and  aid,  for

instance, in respect of building expenses, financial

aid and the acquisition of the land which is part of

Pang Koh Estate. I would ask the Government: do  the

Government  dare acquire this piece of  land  to  be

used as a site for a school?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many other instances. For example, when

a  child  is already in school, his or her  brothers

and  sisters also want to be admitted into the  same

school. But the schools do not take this point  into

consideration. If the enrolment is full, the child's

sisters  and  brothers  have  no  chance  of   being

admitted  into  the  same school.  This  is  another

instance  to  expose the talk of  the  Minister  for

Education  just now. That is what I have to  say  on

education. [Interruption] If the Minister for Labour

wants  to have a debate with me, we can have  it  at

any time and at any place.

is  whether  the  Government have  shouldered  their

responsibility  in educating our future  generation.

And  what  is  also important is whether  there  are

enough places for school-going children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member talks of this school collapsing, and

that  old  schools have to make way for new schools.

If  a  school building is going to collapse, we must

not  allow it to collapse and so be a danger to  the

children.  What is most important is  that  we  have

provided  enough  schools  to  accommodate  all  our

children.  Let  me ask them: in the past,  how  many

children  have had no places in schools? Today,  can

you tell me whether there are any children without a

place  in  school? If you can point out  one  single

case  of a child who has no place in a school,  then

we  are  prepared  to give you a cash  award.  As  a

matter  of  fact,  in  the past four  difficult  and

tumultuous years, the Government have been  able  to

put  forward an education programme and to implement

it with the least amount of money to produce maximum

results.  This  only shows that in the  Government's

education  policy, it is not necessary to spend  all

the  money  that  we have. It all depends  upon  our

needs. Our school building programme has to be drawn

up  according to our needs. If the children are  all

accommodated, in schools, it is pointless  to  build

more schools, as the schools will remain vacant  and

the  money  spent will be a waste. What is important

is  that we must meet the educational needs  of  our

children and their parents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we have been able to provide children

places in primary schools or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>



secondary schools, the next step is to prevent those

children  who  want  to create  trouble  -  such  as

wanting  to  obstruct other children from  going  to

school  and  insulting their teachers. It  is  these

children who are not allowed in school. In order  to

safeguard  our  education system and our  children's

right  to go to school and sit for examinations,  we

will give them every facility and help.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that in the past four years, notwithstanding

strikes  and boycotts which were instigated  by  the

Barisan  Sosialis, we were still able to  carry  out

our  school building programme. Our school  building

programme is under the charge of a special committee

and  the  Government are providing enough  money  to

carry  out  the  programme. This achievement,  which

cannot  he matched by any other country in Asia,  is

only possible under an efficient and good government

of  a good Party. If we were to follow the advice of

Opposition  Members,  then we might  have  to  spend

every  cent  of  our revenue on education.  This  is

wrong, and cannot be done.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

from the debate over the last few days I see that if

the  Minister  for  Labour wants to  debate  on  the

education  policy  he must change his  attitude.  He

must first be educated in the technique of debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I must ask the hon. Member not to

make  personal attacks. I have stopped the Minister;

so I must also stop the Member.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Government

boast  that they have achieved a great deal  in  the

matter of education. But let us analyse their school

building  programme. What have they done?  In  item

(1)   of subhead 16, Primary Schools, the 1963 School

Building Programme has an original plan cost of $2.6

million. But after three years, i.e. up to  the  end

of  this  year, the money spent only amounts  to  $117,600. It is the same with other items.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government have not properly dealt with our

education   problem.   They   want   to   monopolise

education, yet they have achieved nothing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has said that they have built many schools, and that every school-going child has a place in school. But what is the attitude towards some of the aided schools which lack proper sanitary conditions? Now, for these schools the Government must give them financial aid to improve their school

building and their sanitary conditions, because they

are   helping  the  Government  to  implement  their

education  policy. But instead the  Government  have

banned  and  closed  down  all  these  schools.  And

towards certain Chinese schools in the rural  areas,

for example, many parents in the past wanted to send

their  children to these schools, but these  schools

had  no  places for them. So the parents wanted  the

Government to extend the school buildings,  but  the

Government ignored them. The management committee of

the  school  applied for permission  to  extend  the

school  buildings, but instead of helping  them  the

Government  tried  to  obstruct  their  application.

There  was  an example in which some of  the  school

authorities  submitted plans for extension  but  the

authorities  always tried to delay  approval.  After

some   years   when  approval  finally   came,   the

management  committee tried to raise funds  for  the

extension  of  the  school but the Government  would

then forget their dollar-for-dollar aid.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So as a result of this delay in giving aid, the

school  management  committee  will  have  to  raise

further  funds.  Now, why must the Government  adopt

such  an  attitude?  Is  it because  the  management

committee  does  not  deserve  any  help  from   the

Government?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, the Government have put forward many  plans

and programmes. The figures showing how much we have

achieved in our school programme will nail  all  the

falsehoods  put forward by the Barisan Sosialis.  We

have heard the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>



Tampines repeating himself again and again about the

Beng  Lun  School, but the fact is that he has  been

unable to bring up facts to refute our achievements;

he  keeps on frying the rice and making use  of  the

same  material over and over again. Now, in view  of

this repetition, I have to stand up to reply to  his

point about the Beng Lun School. He says that in his

constituency  the  Government built  a  new  English

school  next  to Beng Lun School to  take  over  the

children from the Chinese school. Is this  a  fact?

How  far  is  this  true? I want  to  enlighten  him

further on this matter, because I think I know about

this case better than he does. As far as I know, the

position regarding the Beng Lun School is this.  The

school building is in very bad shape and in fact  it

was  originally an unauthorised structure. It was  a

shophouse which was later turned into a school,  but

after  some years of disrepair, it could not  comply

with the health regulations; it was on the point  of

collapsing.  So in order to safeguard the  lives  of

the  school  children and to ensure that they  could

study in better circumstances, the Government put up

a school in its neighbourhood. This new school which

was  put  up  is  not  an  English  school,  but  an

integrated  school,  so on the  completion  of  this

school, the Beng Lun School, which was on the  point

of  collapsing,  was not allowed to  exist.  So  the

children  of  this  school were transferred  to  the

integrated  school and they continued  to  study  in

Chinese. The teachers were also transferred to  this

integrated  school. In fact, the  principal  himself

was also transferred as the principal of the Chinese

section of the same integrated school. Now, this  is

the  treatment that we give to Chinese schools.  Can

you  say that this is unfair treatment? Can you say

that this treatment calls for any unfair criticism?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the facts that I have stated show clearly that

the  Barisan  Members  do not  understand  the  true

position of the school. I ask them: do they want  to

wait  until the school building collapses  and  then

some  of the school children are killed in order  to

give them an excuse to attack the Government? If



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>



that  is  their desire, then I do not know  what  to

say!  I  am  not going to give them this  excuse  to

attack  the Government. I think I should leave  some

time for the Minister for Education to reply.



<br><br>7.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Time has expired, it is five

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head D40 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $24,358,780 for Head D40 ordered to

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D41 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item (1)  of subhead 7.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the Kampong Kembangan Constituency which comprises Jalan Tengah, Jalan Towgay, Jalan Ladang, Jalan Lobak, Jalan Bawang, Jalan Masjid, Jalan Kuda, Jalan Yasin, etc., the drainage conditions are in a bad state. The settlers in these areas experience hardship during the rainy season,

more  particularly so, Mr Speaker, during the heavy

spells  which we are experiencing just now.  In  the

provision  to improve drainage in the Geylang  Serai

Malay  Settlement, I wish to know from the  Minister

in  charge  whether  the areas I have  mentioned  in

Kampong   Kembangan  are  included.   The   drainage

conditions in the areas I have mentioned  are  in  a

bad  state.  I  hope  the  Minister  will  give  due

consideration to this question, so that provision to

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>



tune  of  $10,000 for 1964 will be expended  on  the

improvement  of the drainage system in  the  Kampong

Kembangan Constituency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> The present drains in the

Geylang  Serai  Malay Settlement are too  small  and

there  is  no  effective outlet. A scheme  has  been

prepared for an effective local drainage system.  In

all  drainage  schemes, work  must  start  from  the

outlet   end.   In   this   particular   case,   the

construction  of  a main drain cannot  be  proceeded

with   because  of  the  presence  of  hundreds   of

squatters.  Accordingly,  there  is  no   point   in

proceeding  with  the  improvement  scheme  on   the

Geylang  Serai Malay Settlement drainage  until  the

main drain has been constructed. This local drainage

scheme  is  therefore being deferred  for  the  time

being.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member for Kampong Kembangan

and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D41 be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to take these amendments together because they are related. Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government are expending a considerable amount of money on constructing Bus Bays and Vehicle Parks and Bus Shelters for the

people  who  are in need of such social  facilities.

The   Government  are  constructing  these  for  the

benefit  of drivers and conductors who are  doing  a

useful service to the people. But, Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  bus  drivers and conductors of the  Changi  Bus

Company,  who  I  believe  are  influenced  by   the

Communist anti-national elements in the Bus Workers'

Union,   behave  rudely  towards  their  passengers,

especially  the women folk. They use nasty  language

towards them and their buses are not kept clean  and

well. I would like to state here, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

that  I  believe the Prime Minister has  received  a

number of petitions and complaints, copies of  which

have  been  forwarded to me. I myself have  received

some complaints.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Government are giving these social amenities

to  the people - these amenities which are misused by

certain  drivers and conductors of bus companies  - I

would like to know from the Minister concerned  what

action  will be taken against those bus drivers  and

conductors  who  are ill-mannered and  rude  to  the

public. I hope the Ministry concerned will take  the

necessary action.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The debate will also range over the

amendment shown as amendment (5)  on the Order  Paper

which relates to item (6)  of subhead 18.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to the

question raised by the Member for Kampong Kembangan,

my  answer  is:  the Government cannot  take  action

against  an employee of a private company.  I  would

suggest that the Member for Kampong Kembangan  write

to the bus company concerned to investigate further,

and if the allegation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>



is  found true, the company will have to take action

against its employee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Member for Kampong Kembangan has raised a point

about  the  attitude  of  certain  members  of   bus

workers'  unions,  alleging  that  they  have   used

abusive  and vulgar language against the passengers,

and  he  has requested the Government to investigate

into this matter and take appropriate action against

them.  It  is  not surprising that  the  Member  for

Kampong   Kembangan   should   have   alleged   such

incidents, because he has also linked this  up  with

so-called  Communists. That is why, as he has  said,

as  a  result,  the service provided  by  these  bus

conductors and drivers has been so bad. I would like

to  point out to the Member concerned that there  is

no  question of the workers during their  period  of

service being rude to the passengers. If he wants to

have  orderly and good behaviour in the bus service,

this  should  not only be from one side.  We  should

realise   that  the  bus  conductors'  and  drivers'

working conditions are quite different from those in

other  fields of work. While we are sleeping in  our

bed,  these workers are on the road in their  buses.

While  we  are  still dreaming in  our  beds,  these

workers  are  in  their buses  serving  the  general

public. Therefore, they have to work long hours  and

are sometimes tired. They work during odd hours,  so

we  should  expect co-operation from the  Government

and  the  Member concerned in particular. We  should

not  put  all the blame on the workers because  they

have  their  own difficulties. Before the Government

look   into   this  matter,  there   should   be   a

comprehensive plan to see that not only the workers,

but also the passengers, should be courteous. To put

the  blame only on the workers is not good. On  this

matter, I hope the Member for Kampong Kembangan will

understand better. People who travel in cars usually

do  not  understand  the  difficulties  of  the  bus

conductors.  It  is  usually difficult  to  work  in

crowded buses. For instance, if a bus conductor does

not  receive  the  exact amount  of  money  for  the

tickets  issued,  he  might face  dismissal.  If  he

punches the tickets



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>



wrongly   or  omits  to  punch  them,  he  is   held

responsible. Bus passengers and other people  should

consider all this. Due to their long hours of  work,

these  workers  can be moody or in a bad  temper.  I

hope  the people will understand this. Even in  this

House  we  see  that  the Ministers  and  Government

Backbenchers  are not so polite and courteous  after

all.  They  even use abusive and vulgar language  in

this  House.  So you should not blame  the  workers.

They  are  uneducated, unlike  the  Members  sitting

opposite.  I  hope that whenever such  a  matter  is

raised,  you should not put Communist caps on  their

heads. [Laughter]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order in the Gallery.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

these  allegations of mine are not wild. I can  give

specific  instances and produce  witnesses.  If  the

Member on the opposite side is the Secretary of  the

Bus   Workers'  Union,  I  am  prepared  to  produce

witnesses.  If these occurrences seldom take  place,

that might be so, but these acts of discourtesy have

happened  so  many times. I myself have  seen  these

things  happening.  If  the  Secretary  of  the  Bus

Workers'  Union  says that because the  workers  are

tired they are inclined to be in a bad temper,  then

I say that they should not work. If he is keen on my

bringing forward witnesses, I am ready to do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

did  not  say that the Member for Kampong  Kembangan

was  wrong  in  raising that matter.  If  there  are

occasions  when  bus conductors have  been  rude  to

passengers, then they are in the wrong. They  should

be  polite to them. But what I tried to say just now

was  that  we  should  also try  to  understand  the

difficulties of the conductors. We should understand

the  matter thoroughly and look at both sides of the

picture.  We  should not try to blame everything  on

the  Communists. The Government should not  describe

our  people  as wearing Communist caps  whenever  we

raise a question. The Member should not bring up the

question  of  Communism  on  this  question  of  bus

conductors. Even when we debated other matters, such

as education,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>



Members on the Government side did not behave in the

way they should.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member is repeating exactly what

he  has said just now in his previous reply. Has  he

got  anything new to say? We have not got much  time

left. We have only half an hour left.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

will  try to finish quickly in just one minute.  The

bus conductors do not even have the time to drink  a

cup   of   coffee  or  rest  during  working  hours.

Therefore,  the Government should try to make  rules

regulating  the hours of work and provide lavatories

to  enable  the  conductors to answer  the  call  of

nature. This is a very serious matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I would like to make some suggestions

to  the  Government on the question of bus shelters.

There are no bus shelters at bus stands in the rural

areas.  So whenever there is rain, especially during

the   rainy  season,  the  passengers  suffer   much

inconvenience. I hope the Government will see to  it

that  at  certain places where such  facilities  are

required,  bus  shelters  will  be  built  for   the

convenience  of bus passengers. It looks  as  though

the  provision  of  $65,000 for  this  item  is  not

enough. For instance, the Government should put some

benches  in Maternal and Child Health Clinics.  They

should also put benches at bus shelters in the rural

areas.  This  is  necessary  because  sometimes  the

people have to wait for about half an hour and  they

will  have to stand all the time. In such cases,  if

there are pregnant women, they may find it difficult

and  tiresome to remain standing for a long time.  I

will  be very glad if the Government will build more

bus  shelters and provide benches at health  clinics

in order to meet the convenience of these people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

again? We have got 25

minutes  more.  Cannot we get on  with  the  debate?

Every  Member  seems to paraphrase  whatever  he  is

going to say by a direct attack on somebody else  on

the other side. If the Member has anything valid  to

say, please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, in actual fact,

the  Government  in 1962 constructed  about  43  bus

shelters  throughout the island.  In  1963  we  have

constructed 65 bus shelters.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is impossible for the Government to construct

bus  shelters all over Singapore in one year because

of  our  limited funds. We have a programme for  the

construction  of  bus  shelters  in  which  we  will

increase the number of bus shelters year by year.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  just now we have heard  one  of  the

Members of the Opposition, viz, the Member for  Paya

Lebar,  saying  that he supports the workers.  Some

days  ago  I  had  occasion to say that  Opposition

Members in the Barisan Sosialis work for the workers

only  in  theory. We in the N.T.U.C. work  for  the

improvement  of the lot of the workers in  Singapore

and  the  world in general. We work in  a  practical

way. So we know what is good and what is bad for the

workers. We also know the difficulties and otherwise

of  the workers. This is because we the leaders  not

only say things but also go out to see for ourselves

the   difficult  conditions  of  the  workers.   For

example, we not only observe the work of bus drivers

and  conductors  but  also bus  passengers  who  are

mostly workers. It is our responsibility to see that

these workers - the good and the bad - really work  for

the  State.  We also observe those workers  who  are

being  used  for the benefit of foreign powers.  For

that  reason,  we  know  the difficulties  of  these

workers. The main concern of the leaders of S.A.T.U.

unions,  which are pro-Communist unions, is  now  to

topple the Government by usurping its power.  The

Member  for  Paya Lebar says  he  is  for  the workers.

But  what has been done  by  the  S.A.T.U. unions is

to work



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>



for  leaders outside this country. They  have  shown

that  they  do  not  work for  the  benefit  of  the

workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I remind the Member for

Kampong Kapor  that we are debating bus bays, bus

shelters, and  vehicle parks - item (2)  of subhead 18

of  Head D41?  The Member has unfortunately drifted

away into discussing the policy of trade unions. Can

he  come back?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Thank you, Mr

Speaker,   Sir, I  was  about  to  reply   to   the

allegations of the Member for Paya Lebar that we are

not  pro-worker  when you made your ruling.  I  have

stated  that the Member himself is not aware of  the

true conditions of the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to what we are debating, as has been

said  by both sides of the House, we should not take

this   debate  as  an  opportunity  to   bring   out

irrelevant  points. The Member for  Paya  Lebar  has

said that this Assembly should give consideration to

the question of constructing better bus shelters  or

bus  bays.  This, he says, is a joint responsibility

of  this Assembly, as it is for the benefit  of  the

people  of  this country. The Member for Jalan  Kayu

also  says  that benches should be placed  at  these

shelters,  I  do not know what he means by  benches.

Throughout    Singapore,   the    Government    have

constructed bus shelters with benches for passengers

to rest while waiting for their buses. If by benches

the  Member for Jalan Kayu means benches similar  to

armchairs or sofas or even benches in this Assembly,

then I cannot understand his request. The people  of

Singapore know that the use of a bus shelter  is  to

protect them from the rain or sun while waiting  for

their  buses. I believe that if there is  a  request

from  the  people  that  a  bus  shelter  should  be

constructed at any particular place, then I am  sure

the Government will construct one there, as has been

the  practice  in  the  past. This  is  because  the

request  is  something for the people of  Singapore,

who are loyal to this country and not to any foreign

country.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I feel

that if the Back-benches



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>



on  the  Government side were to adopt this kind  of

attitude  in  dealing with our  questions,  then  it

would  be  a waste of time. Today, we want  to  look

into  whether what the Government have done is right

or  wrong. There would be no meaning if they were to

treat  our questions in this manner. We raised  this

question to inquire whether there are benches in bus

shelters.  If there are none, the Government  should

build  them.  There should also be bus  shelters  at

maternity centres. The Government cannot solve these

problems by treating our questions in this way.  The

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National

Development  has  not answered  our  questions.  The

important   thing   is  whether  they   accept   our

suggestions or not. It is no use talking  about  the

number  of shelters the Government have built.  This

is   the  time  for  the  Opposition  Party  to  ask

questions.  The  Government  must  allow  Opposition

Members  to ask questions. The Back-benchers  should

not  praise the Government by saying that they  have

done  this  and that for the people. Such words  are

merely a waste of our time here.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I feel

that  this topic which we are debating has  gone  in

such  a  way that the Member for Thomson has accused

the   Government  of  not  having  satisfied   their

questions. I was surprised that when this matter was

brought  up by the Member for Kampong Kembangan  and

then  replied  to by the Parliamentary Secretary  to

the  Minister for National Development,  the  Member

for  Paya Lebar should suddenly speak up, as  if  he

was  the Minister for Labour. He began to answer the

question  regarding bus shelters. I  know  that  the

Member  is  the Secretary of the Bus Union.  I  have

sympathy  for any sort of workers. What  the  Member

for Kampong Kembangan was saying was that the people

who  make use of the buses in the morning are  those

who are on their way to work. There are some who are

going to the market. These are the people who cannot

afford to go in big cars. They go about by bus.  The

Member for Paya Lebar, the Secretary-General of  the

Bus



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>



Workers' Union, should remember this and go back and

tell  the  workers  that  these  things  should  not

happen. This will affect the feelings of the workers

and  the  children. This matter will be  closed.  He

thinks  he is the Minister for Labour when he  tries

to  defend this by saying that the allegation is not

true.  That  is not fair. The Member for Jalan  Kayu

has  raised the question of bus shelters  which  are

not in his constituency. Mr Speaker, there are many

bus  shelters  in the rural areas.  The  Member  for

Jalan  Kayu was for two years a committee member  on

the  Rural Board. He had not even spoken once on the

construction of bus shelters in his constituency.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It is only ten minutes. Again

the  Parliamentary  Secretary  is  indulging  in   a

personal  attack  which is most  unwelcome  in  this

Assembly, and which I am against.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, we

have raised these points on behalf of the people. We

have done it in all sincerity. We want to point  out

to  the Government what can be done and what we feel

should  be  done for the people. But the  Government

are  not  prepared  to  accept our  suggestions  and

criticisms which are made in all sincerity. Instead,

they abuse us by calling us all sorts of names. They

say  I was a member of the Rural Board for two years

and  that I had not spoken a word at the meeting.  I

think  the  Member concerned should  look  into  the

minutes of the meeting and find out whether or not I

did  speak  at  the meeting and what I  did  at  the

meeting.  I  am  making  the  allegation  that   the

Government are trying to do a superficial  piece  of

work just for the purpose of propaganda. We urge the

Government   to  carry  out  some   work   for   the

improvement of the people and do it with  sincerity.

They  cannot  just  abuse  us  and  turn  down   our

suggestions  and  criticisms. They must  accept  our

suggestions  which have been made in  all  sincerity.

They  should  accept our suggestions even  if  there

might be some difficulty in implementing them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, I would like to

answer what the hon. Member for Thomson has alleged

just  now.  I  agree that Budget time is  Opposition

time.  But  if Members of the Opposition ask  proper

questions   but,  at  the  same  time,  make   false

allegations against the Government, then I  say  the

Government Back-benchers have the right to reply  so

as  to  refute  the  allegations.  Government  Back-benchers can also speak during Budget time. I do not

see  any reason why Government Back-benchers  cannot

rise up and refute their allegations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng:</b> What are you saying?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Is there anyone else intending

to   speak  in  the  debate  on  the  matter   under

discussion, that is, bus shelters?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we on the

Government Front-bench have always accepted the fact

that  we  welcome constructive criticisms  from  the

Opposition.  The Opposition Member, the  Member  for

Jalan Kayu, has said that ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the Minister getting on with this

debate or not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Yes, I am getting on.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have five minutes. Has the

Minister come here to speak about the Opposition?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I have said that the Member for

Jalan  Kayu  was making certain suggestions.  I  was

getting on to it, Mr Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister should sit down when the

Speaker is speaking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have five minutes. I suggest that

the  Minister  should proceed  to  speak  about  bus

shelters and buses. We do not want any more  remarks

about  the  Opposition and what they  have  said.  I

would  ask the Government Members also to allow  the

Minister to proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker. I will not

refer  to the Opposition Member by his constituency.

I would say a Member of the Opposition has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>



proposed  that we should build more bus shelters  in

the rural areas. Of course, we are looking into this

matter. We have formed a committee to look into  all

these  amenities. Wherever it is necessary, we  will

build  these  bus  shelters as a  facility  for  the

people.  I do not know why they say we never  accept

their   criticisms.  We  will  surely  accept  their

criticisms if they are constructive criticisms.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member for Kampong Kembangan

indicate   whether  he  wishes   to   withdraw   his

amendments or take a vote?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I wish to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have only about four minutes more.

The  next  amendment is also in the  name  of  Inche

Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D41 be

reduced  by  $10 in respect of item (14)  of  subhead

18.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I merely wish to know from the Minister concerned firstly, when will street lighting be effected at Lengkong Tiga, Teo Kim Eng Road, Kampong Eunos and Jalan Ang Teng; and

secondly,  when will agricultural and kampong  roads

be constructed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to

the  questions  raised  by the  Member  for  Kampong

Kembangan,  the  item  consists  of  two   sections,

namely:  street  lighting along public  streets  and

street   lighting  along  agricultural  and  kampong

roads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the first question, that is, the provision of

street lighting along public roads in both city  and

rural areas which have not been provided with street

lighting  in  the first instance, all  projects  are

first  approved  by  the Urban  and  Rural  Services

Consultative Committee before work is put in hand by

the Electricity Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The standard of lighting provided depends on

whether  traffic along the roads is heavy  or  light

and upon the width of the roads.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class A lighting is usually provided for dual

carriage-ways  like Nicoll Highway, MacPherson  Road

and the Airport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the second question is that the

provision   of   kampong   street   lighting   along

agricultural  roads  and  kampong  roads   is   also

controlled   by   the  Urban  and   Rural   Services

Consultative   Committee   which   determines    the

priorities for these installations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The standard of lighting provided is below that for

public   streets  as  this  is  intended  more   for

pedestrians and cyclists than for vehicles and  also

for  brightening up of troubled areas  in  order  to

prevent crime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1962, 74 public roads were provided with street

lights  at  a cost of $227,000 and 75 kampong  roads

were lighted at a cost of $633,000 ---



<br><br>7.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It is 7.55 p.m. Time is up.

Will  the  Member  for  Kampong  Kembangan  indicate

whether he wishes to withdraw the amendment or  have

a vote taken?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time allotted for Head D41 having expired, the

following  amendments,  standing  in  the  names  of

Messrs.  Chio Cheng Thun, Poh Ber Liak,  Chia  Thye

Poh and Tan Cheng Tong, were not proceeded with:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chio Cheng Thun:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D41 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 34.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Poh Ber Liak:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D41 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 37.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chia Thye Poh:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D41 he

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 38.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D41 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 40.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Cheng Tong:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head D41 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $29,224,370 for Head D41 ordered to

stand part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The remaining Heads of Expenditure in

respect  of which no amendment stands on  the  Order

Paper are Heads D15, D20, D26, D38, D42 and D43.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the sums stated for those Heads as

they  appear in the third column in the  summary  of

expenditure en page 7 of Paper Cmd. 31 of 1963 stand

part  of the Development Estimates," put, and agreed

to.
