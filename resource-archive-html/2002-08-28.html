<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>OVERSEAS AND LOCAL UNDERGRADUATES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Difference in costs of subsidy)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mdm Ho

Geok Choo -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To ask the Minister for Education what is (i)

the difference in the costs of subsidising undergraduates

who   are   sent   overseas  for  exposure   to   foreign

entrepreneurial  cultures and those who  go  through  the

normal course of study in our tertiary institutions;  and

(ii) the percentage of undergraduates being sent for such

overseas stints relative to the total student population.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Question No. 1, Sir.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the Government has actively encouraged  an

entrepreneurial   spirit   among   Singaporeans.      Our

universities - the National University

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>



of  Singapore, Nanyang Technological University  and  the

Singapore Management University - have responded to  this

call  by  promoting a culture of enterprise on campus  by

various  means,  for example, mounting relevant  academic

modules,   establishing  entrepreneurship   centres   and

technology  relations  offices.    These  provisions  are

available to all students of the respective universities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National University of Singapore has also

launched  the  "NUS  Overseas  Colleges".   This   is   a

strategic programme aimed at providing a small number  of

select  students  the  opportunity to  be  nurtured  into

dynamic  and  resourceful entrepreneurs by  immersion  in

vibrant entrepreneurial hubs which are anchored by strong

academic institutions.   Students will be sent on a  one-year  stint to these overseas colleges to work as interns

attached    to    high-tech   start-ups,    and    attend

entrepreneurship  courses  at  partnering   universities.

NUS  has  to date set up two overseas colleges -  in  the

Silicon  Valley in partnership with Stanford  University,

and in the Bio Valley, in partnership with University  of

Pennsylvania.   38 students are currently in the  Silicon

Valley,  and another 10 are expected to set off  for  the

Bio  Valley in January 2003.  By 2010, NUS plans to  send

250  students  (or 4% of the average NUS  annual  cohort)

each year to its overseas colleges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The additional cost incurred for a student who

spends  one year at an overseas college is about $35,500.

About  two-thirds of this cost is borne by the internship

companies which our students are attached to.  The  other

one-third  is borne by the Government.  Students  on  the

programme  therefore do not pay additional fees  for  the

duration of their programme in the overseas college.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, once the

students  return from their overseas stint, I would  like

to  ask the Minister if there are any programmes in place

to    allow   them   to   continue   to   nurture   their

entrepreneurial  spirit  or  mindset.    Is   there   any

programme in place to ensure

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>



that  in  future when they graduate, this overseas  stint

would   also  be  helpful  in  helping  them  to   become

entrepreneurs?

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> As I have explained earlier in

my   answer,  the  universities  do  have  a  variety  of

programmes to help students set up companies if they  are

interested  in doing so. They have incubators, technology

relations  offices  and  so on.   Apart  from  that,  the

various   economic  agencies  also  have  a  variety   of

programmes available for not just graduating students but

other  Singaporeans  who are interested  in  starting  up

their   own   companies  or  venturing  into  their   own

enterprises to go ahead to do so.

<div align="center"><b>NATIONAL EXAMINATIONS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Annotation of certificates for students given special</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>arrangements)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</b> asked the Minister for

Education  (a)  what is the rationale for his  Ministry's

recent   requirement  that  students  who  need   special

arrangements  or considerations for national examinations

(PSLE,  "O"  and "A" levels) will have their certificates

annotated  with  special symbols;  (b)  on  a  nationwide

basis,  how  many  of  these students  who  sat  for  the

national examinations last year had asked and were  given

such  special  arrangements or considerations  for  their

examinations; and (c) what proportion of the total cohort

do these numbers represent.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, before I ask Question

No.  2, I would like to declare that I have a son who  is

dyslexic and is taking his PSLE examination this year.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in every

examination, there is a set of pre-determined conditions,

for  example, the duration of the examination, to  ensure

that  all  candidates are assessed on a common yardstick.

Special  arrangements,  however,  are  made  for  certain

candidates  to allow them to take their examinations  and

demonstrate  their mastery of the subject being  examined

without being disadvantaged by the special difficulties

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>



that they have. By doing so, our intention is to open  up

opportunities for students with special needs to sit  for

and   obtain  qualifications  at  the  various   national

examinations.   And indeed, the number of  such  students

who  have been able to get such special arrangements  has

been  rising.  This will pave the way for them to proceed

on  to further education.   The special arrangements that

are made include giving the candidate additional time  to

write the examination, exempting him from aural/oral test

and  providing  other  forms of assistance  that  may  be

needed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, there has been a significant

increase   in   the  number  of  requests   for   special

arrangements.  For example, there was an increase of  39%

in  the requests received between 2000 and 2001, from 469

to  650.  These requests come from candidates with a wide

range  of medical or psychological conditions of  varying

degrees  of  severity  from mild to  very  serious.   The

determination  as to whether a condition  merits  special

arrangements,  and the extent of special  arrangements  a

disability  merits, are not clear-cut,  black  and  white

decisions.   The Ministry has therefore decided  that  an

even-handed,  transparent and fair approach  be  adopted.

All candidates who have been granted special arrangements

in  an  examination  will  have an  annotation  in  their

certificates.  This annotation will indicate  that  these

candidates have taken their examinations under conditions

which  are different from those who take the examinations

under  the normal prescribed conditions.   The annotation

will   only   state  that  the  students  sat   for   the

examinations under special arrangements.  No  details  of

the  special arrangements will appear on the certificate.

The Ministry of Education will also not reveal details of

the   student's  reasons  for  requesting   the   special

arrangements  unless the student authorises the  Ministry

to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This policy of annotation will ensure that even as

we  allow candidates who need special arrangements access

to  our  examinations, we do so in a way  that  maintains

transparency  in  our  examination system  and  that  the

examination system is as fair as possible to those

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>



students  who  take  the examinations  under  the  normal

prescribed conditions.  And that it is also fair to those

small  number of candidates each year who do have medical

or  psychological conditions which are serious enough  to

merit special arrangements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, there were 216 students from the PSLE and

434   students  from  the  GCE `N',  `O'  and  `A'  level

examinations  who  applied for special arrangements.   Of

these,  all the students from PSLE and 382 (88%) students

from  the  GCE  `N', O' and `A' levels  who  applied  for

special    arrangements   were   given    such    special

arrangements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These numbers represent about 0.43% of the total

candidature  for  the 2001 PSLE and about  0.63%  of  the

total candidature for the 2001 GCE `N', `O' and `A' level

examinations.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister  if  the  Ministry had considered  the  negative

impact  and consequences of annotation on these  children

in  subsequent years, such as labelling and stigmatising,

which   could   bring  about  a  further   reduction   of

opportunities  for  these children for mainstreaming  and

integrating  into  the society and  hence,  increase  the

obstacles  for  independent living, when  all  that  such

disadvantaged students are asking for is accommodation to

help them level up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, did the Ministry discuss the issues with

the  relevant organisations such as the Society  for  the

Deaf and DAS before implementing the annotation policy?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, besides the US, which are the other

countries that practise annotation or flagging?

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, the Ministry considered

the  matter  very  seriously and we decided  to  adopt  a

balanced and open approach.  We recognise that there  are

students  who have medical or psychological problems  who

will  be  able to sit for and do well in their PSLE,  GCE

'O', 'A' and 'N' level examinations.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>



because we want to give these students an opportunity  to

take    these   examinations   that   we   provide   this

accommodation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no question about not providing

accommodation.  The  Ministry  is  prepared  to   provide

accommodation   where  there  is   proper   medical   and

psychological assessment and the Ministry considers  that

these  reasons  are strong and serious  enough  to  merit

special arrangements.  That will continue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, we have to balance this against

fairness  to other candidates who may not have asked  for

special  arrangements  to take their  examinations  under

normal   circumstances.   The  range  of   requests   has

increased  over the years.  In the early years,  we  have

had   very   clear-cut  requests  -  generally,  physical

disabilities for which there is very little doubt one way

or  the  other.  But in recent years, we have received  a

larger  number  of  requests, mainly of  a  psychological

nature  for which the severity and the precise nature  of

the  requests require much more judgement, and  even  the

medical  and  psychological professionals do  not  always

agree  on them. So what we want to do is to balance  this

desire  to  accommodate more of such requests  which  are

valid together with the need to be more open and balanced

with  regard  to  having agreed to  these  requests.   We

believe  that  this is a fair and open  system  by  which

students  who  have conditions which are  serious  enough

will  be  able to get access to special arrangements  and

allow them to proceed on to higher education.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister  to comment on the number of students  who  have

been asking for special accommodation which has increased

over  the  years.   Would it not  be  fair  to  say  that

previously, most parents would not be so informed  as  to

the  types of disabilities that our children could suffer

from   but  with  society  maturing  and  becoming   more

sophisticated  and  informed, some of these  disabilities

which were previously not detectable or the parents would

not know about it ---

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Khor, could you make your questions

concise, please?

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> I would like to ask the

Minister to comment that perhaps the Ministry could  look

at  it  from  the  point  of view  that  the  number  has

increased because of information access.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My other question is: why did the Ministry actually

implement  the  annotation policy  at  a  time  when  the

College  Board of the US has just agreed to stop flagging

the  scores of disabled students who take the  SAT  under

special conditions, such as extra time?  From what I read

about  the  practice of flagging in the US,  one  of  the

reasons for flagging is to prevent abuse by students who,

in reality, have no real disabilities.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Khor, you are making a speech again.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> No, I am asking a question.

This  links  to  the question that I am asking  now.   If

indeed  one of the primary objectives of the Ministry  is

to  prevent this abuse, can the Ministry consider instead

to  implement  more stringent conditions  under  which  a

student  can  have special accommodation?   For  example,

recognising tests ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Khor, if you do not ask your

question, I will ask you to resume your seat.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Yes, this is the question.

I  would  like  to ask the Ministry if they can  consider

recognising  tests from, say, accredited panels  so  that

the  Ministry can be assured that these are students  who

have   real  disabilities  and  are  asking  for  special

accommodation.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, Dr Khor is indeed correct.

As  I have said earlier, there is an increasing number of

conditions  which  have now been   recognised  for  which

students are asking for special accommodation.   So,  the

increase  in  the  requests for special accommodation  do

come  from this wider range of conditions.  Not all these

conditions  are completely well established.  Even  among

the medical

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>



professionals and the psychologists, there  may  be  some

disagreement as to the impact of these conditions on  the

examinations  which the student is taking, and  they  may

well  disagree  also  on the extent and  whether  or  not

accommodations are justified.  So the Ministry is,  in  a

sense,  in  a  rather difficult position.  And  even  the

doctors,    whom    the   parents   who    bring    their

children/students to, are also in a difficult  situation,

because  the  parents, obviously, would want  doctors  to

certify  their  children/students and  would  bring  such

certifications to the Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some of these conditions, there is no clear-cut

decision  one  way  or  the  other.   And  the  kinds  of

accommodations  the Ministry can make have  to  be  of  a

rather  coarse  nature.  We cannot  say  that  with  this

condition,  we will give you two minutes extra  time  per

hour.   This other condition, three minutes, four minutes

or  five minutes.  It is very difficult to make such fine

adjustments.   Basically, where there is  a  request  for

extra time, generally, we give a student about 15 minutes

extra  per hour.  So this is a coarse assessment, and  we

are unable to make such fine assessments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The differentiation between mild, moderate and

serious    is  very  judgmental.   Basically,  what   the

Ministry  has decided is that if the student  feels  that

the   condition  is  serious  enough  to  merit   special

arrangements, and if that is the case, then we  ought  to

annotate it, because the condition is serious enough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Khor asked what other countries practise

annotation.  Annotation is practised in the UK  as  well.

The UK Examinations Board does so.  Dr Khor is right that

the  College  Board which runs the SAT 1 in  the  US  has

recently  been ordered by the courts in the  US  to  stop

annotation.  Dr Khor is also correct that there have been

concerns  raised about whether this will cause  abuse  of

the  system.  If I may quote from an article in  the  New

York  Times  of 15th July by Tamar Lewin entitled  "Abuse

is feared as the SAT test changes disability policy".  It

says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"High school guidance counsellors have said that the

elimination  of  flagging could set off  a  wave  of  new

applications  for  accommodations,  including  some  from

students without disabilities."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 968</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some college admission officers too say they worry

about  how the change will play out and whether  it  will

lead   to  so  many  requests  for  extended  time   that

ultimately everyone will be allowed four or five hours on

a 3-hour exam."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, there are real concerns about abuse, and it is

very  difficult  to make a judgment on these  situations.

Because  some of the conditions are quite new ones  which

are   not   completely  well  understood  even   by   the

professionals.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister  whether the Ministry is aware that in countries

where  annotation is practised, such as in  the  US,  the

level of special accommodation is generally higher.   For

instance,  a dyslexic child is not only given  50%  extra

time, say, in the SAT test, but is also given a reader to

read the questions, and a writer to write the answers  as

directed by the student.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask whether the Minister could

actually  reconsider the accommodation provided  to  such

students,  to see whether the same level of accommodation

can be given since annotation is here to stay.  So, it is

not  just  a  negative impact that the  disabled  student

would  receive.  In addition, he would be able  to  level

up.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, my Ministry is prepared to

make  special  accommodations.  And the kind  of  special

accommodations  which  we are prepared  to  make  include

extra   time   allowance,   modified   question   papers,

exemptions  from  certain components of  a  subject,  eg,

aural/oral  test,  the  use of readers  and  the  use  of

practical  assistants  as  well,  particularly  where   a

student has physical disabilities which make it difficult

for  the  student to write or to manipulate  a  piece  of

equipment.   We  have Braille question  papers;  we  have

enlarged print and so forth.  Basically, the objective is

to  try  and  make  the examinations more  accessible  to

students  with these kinds of conditions.   But,  at  the

same  time,  we need to balance this with having  a  more

open  and transparent system, so that students who  offer

reasons which they consider serious

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>



enough  to  merit special consideration would  also  have

this annotated in the certificate.

<div align="center"><b>HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mdm

Halimah Yacob -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. To ask the Minister for Health in view of a

recent  American report which cast serious  doubts  about

the  safety of Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT), can his

Ministry confirm whether (i) HRT is safe; (ii) there  are

studies done in Singapore to determine the impact of  HRT

on  women and, if so, what are the findings; (iii) it has

checked with the World Health Organisation on the  safety

of HRT; and (iv) there are HRT alternatives for women and

are  these  made  available  at  Government  clinics  and

restructured hospitals.

<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</b> Sir, Question No. 3.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan (Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Health (Dr Balaji Sadasivan) (for the Minister for Health):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) refers to the  use

of  prescription drugs to "replace" the hormones that the

ovaries stop making at the time of menopause.  The short-term  use  of  HRT  to  relieve menopausal  symptoms  and

improve quality of life is established.  This benefit  is

recognised by the World Health Organisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There had been past studies which suggested that

long-term HRT use could reduce the risk of heart  attacks

and  hip  fractures due to osteoporosis.   On  the  other

hand,  there had also been studies which associated long-term  HRT use to breast and ovarian cancers and pulmonary

embolism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study in the

United  States is the first randomised control trial,  or

the  "gold standard" in studies on effectiveness, in  the

world to study the potential benefits of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 970</b></font><br><br>



long-term  HRT  use.  The study was terminated  early  as

health  risks exceeded health benefits.  For every 10,000

women using combined HRT at the prescribed dosages in the

study  for  one  year, there would be  seven  more  heart

attacks,  eight more breast cancers, eight  more  strokes

and  eight  more pulmonary emboli compared to  six  fewer

colorectal cancers and five fewer hip fractures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been no randomised control trials on HRT

done in Singapore.  The Ministry of Health will appoint a

specialist  group  to  develop  practice  guidelines  for

doctors  on  HRT.  Depending on the indications  for  HRT

treatment, there are alternative treatments available  at

polyclinics and restructured hospitals.  The Ministry  of

Health  advises  women  on HRT to consult  their  doctors

regarding their treatment.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Minister of State whether it is correct to say that  many

HRT  products  contain different compounds  in  different

dosages?   Therefore,  should the WHI  result,  mentioned

earlier by the Minister of State, be applied to any other

HRT  products  other  than the one  investigated  in  the

trial?  Am I correct to say that market research confirms

that the relief of menopausal symptoms is the number  one

reason  why women take HRT?  But the effects of  the  HRT

product  on menopausal symptoms and the quality  of  life

were  not measured in the WHI trial.  Should this not  be

included in any comprehensive trial?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, Dr Neo is correct that

there  are quality of life issues involved in the use  of

HRT,  and  the  long-term  treatment  of  HRT  should  be

individualised to the patient.  That is why the  Ministry

of  Health  feels that individual patients  must  consult

their   doctor  regarding  the  appropriateness  of   the

treatment.

<div align="center"><b>DISABLED AND AGEING POPULATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Transportation needs)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang</b> asked the Minister

for  Transport (a) what are the difficulties his Ministry

faces in ensuring that the public transportation needs of

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>



disabled   and  an  increasingly  ageing  population   in

Singapore   can  be  met,  as  befitting  a   world-class

transport  system, and (b) what steps  his  Ministry  has

taken and will take to overcome the difficulties.

<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan (Senior Minister of State for Transport) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan) (for the Minister for Transport):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  our  public transport system strives  to  meet  the

needs   of   the  elderly  and  the  disabled.   Wherever

practicable,  we ensure that the system is  user-friendly

and  accessible  to  them.  However, in  making  such  an

accommodation,  we  have also to take  into  account  the

needs  of  the large majority of commuters who require  a

speedy mode of transport.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, trains. For the Rapid Transit System, LTA

has,  since 1995, required all new MRT projects to comply

with   the   "Code   On  Barrier-Free  Accessibility   In

Buildings".   This 1995 Code sets out the provisions  and

requirements  of  building facilities and  fixtures,  eg,

ramps,  toilets, lifts, public telephones,  signages,  to

meet  the  needs of the disabled.  Hence, newer stations,

such  as  those coming up in the North East Line and  the

MRT  Extension  to Changi Airport are in compliance  with

this 1995 building Code.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the LTA has embarked on a major

exercise  to  retrofit the existing stations with  lifts,

ramps   and  toilets  to  make  them  user-friendly   for

commuters  with disabilities.  This exercise is estimated

to   cost   the  Government  about  $82  million.    When

completed, the entire MRT system will be fully  disabled-friendly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of public buses, LTA mandates that they

must  have  low  floor boards so as to facilitate  easier

boarding by the elderly and those with mild disabilities.

Unfortunately,  we  are not able to  require  our  public

buses  to  kneel or come with special boarding  equipment

for  those  who are on wheelchairs.  This is because  our

public   bus   services   are   meant   for   the   rapid

transportation of the masses.  The priority is  to  speed

up boarding and alighting.  Making our public buses cater

to  the  needs of the wheelchair-bound will  impact  this

priority.  This will affect the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>



cost  and  service  level to the large  majority  of  the

commuters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A better way to address the needs of the wheelchair-bound is to provide a dedicated service for them. The

Ministry  of Community Development and Sports (MCDS)  has

therefore set up an Inter-Ministry Workgroup to look into

this  problem.   It  is  led by the National  Council  of

Social Services.  My Ministry and LTA are represented  in

the Workgroup.  And I understand that the Workgroup is in

the process of finalising its recommendations.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, it is one thing to have the infrastructure, except

for the public bus transport system, but it is another to

make  it affordable for the disabled and the increasingly

ageing  population  to utilise the  public  buses.   What

schemes  are in place for the affordability of those  who

cannot  access the public buses and would  have  to  take

other  forms  of transportation, eg, taxis?  Because  the

increased cost of looking after and maintaining  oneself,

if  one is disabled, is compounded by expensive transport

costs if no public transport means are available.

<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Sir, how we should assist

Singaporeans  who  are disabled and, at  the  same  time,

financially disadvantaged is a larger topic.  I think  it

is  best addressed holistically.  I believe this  is  the

purview  of my colleagues in MCDS working with  NCSS  and

the  various VWOs.  Whether financial assistance for them

is  best focused on transport needs, medical treatment or

skills training can then be examined on an overall basis.

In  my Ministry's primary focus, we have to target at the

rapid  transportation of the masses.  We will as  far  as

practicable accommodate, be sensitive and sympathetic  to

those  commuters with disabilities.  And I think we  have

been improving over the years, as I elaborated earlier.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang:</b> As public transport

operators,  the bus companies, is there an obligation  on

their  part  to  provide this service to  the  public  at

large,  and  that includes the disabled and the  elderly?

If so, what measures is LTA having to ensure

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>



that  the  obligations of a public bus  operator  include

helping  financially, or in other ways, the disabled  and

the  elderly?  Otherwise, the cost will be passed  on  to

the  individual families and the disabled  themselves  or

the  VWOs,  who are already burdened with finding  enough

funds for the other services that they run.

<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know

whether the Member was in this House when we had  a  very

robust  debate about transport fares and the role of  bus

operators.   I think we all know that they are commercial

entities,  they have to make ends meet.  My  Ministry  is

just  a regulator of these licensees.  They have to  make

ends meet, and whether they should subsidise a particular

segment  of their passengers or commuters, we  know  that

finally  the overall cost has to be borne by the rest  of

the  commuters.   If Singaporeans, the  majority  of  the

commuters,  are  prepared  to cross-subsidise  the  other

smaller segment of the population who are disabled,  then

that is a different consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as I said, the overall issue of how we should

assist  financially the disabled Singaporeans is a larger

issue because their needs go beyond transport.  There may

be  medical  needs  and there may be  other  occupational

training   needs.   I  think  it  is   best   looked   at

holistically  and  the appropriate Ministry  to  look  at

that,  I believe, is MCDS.  I am just a SMS, Ministry  of

Transport.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Under

the  directions of the Ministry in wanting a  world-class

transport system as well as a seamless transport  system,

how would the Ministry account for a good MRT system that

is  currently  disabled-friendly in  terms  of  those  in

wheelchairs?  When they get out of the MRT, there is  not

a  good public transport system as in buses to help them.

Would  the  Ministry be looking into  perhaps  a  greater

advisory role where the PTC is concerned in this matter?

<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I share the

Member's wish to make our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>



system  as  user-friendly to all and sundry.  After  all,

every Singaporean matters.  If they are unfortunate, have

certain  disabilities, we hope that we can  also  include

them  in the transport system.  I think that is an  ideal

that we should always strive for.  But to achieve such an

ideal requires the part to be played by many parties.  It

is  not  just Government.  The corporate sector  is  also

involved.   The NGOs are involved.  The people themselves

are  involved, and even within the Government,  different

Ministries  are involved.  MOT will play  its  part,  but

many other people will have to play their part too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottomline is this. If we look back today and,

say,  10  years  ago, I think we are a lot more  disabled

user-friendly now than 10 years ago, and we  continue  to

make improvements.  We cannot achieve it tomorrow, but we

are  making  progress.   As  I  said,  the  existing  MRT

stations  which  are  not yet disabled-friendly,  we  are

putting  in  a  lot of resources to retrofit  them.   The

whole exercise should be completed by 2005; so that makes

MRT disabled-friendly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bus is quite a different story because to load the

whole  requirements onto the entire bus service has major

implications.   I  see  two  major  implications.    One,

financially,  because  buses  which  are   made   to   be

wheelchair-bound friendly are more expensive  than  those

buses which are not.  So, that will translate into higher

cost,  and  that higher cost has to be borne by somebody.

It means the rest of the commuters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the time taken to board and to alight by

the  wheelchair-bound naturally is longer.  We can do  so

in  MRT  because MRT has many doors, so that at the  same

time the disabled and those without disability can board.

The  whole process takes two to three minutes, and it  is

not  a  problem.  But for a bus, there is only one  door.

And  one-at-a-time sequential alighting and boarding hold

up  the whole traffic.  We are a very busy city.  If  you

look  at  our bus lanes, there are many buses  per  hour.

The frequencies are huge.  So once you pile up, it causes

other kinds of problems.  And that is why it is not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>



surprising that in many other big cities, whether  it  is

New  York, London or wherever, they do not fully load the

wheelchair  needs  onto the public bus  system,  although

they try to.  But, at the same time, they supplement with

dedicated  bus services for the disabled.   And  I  think

that is where MCDS, working with NCSS, is working in that

direction.  I think that is the right direction to take.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, my message is this. It is good to achieve door-to-door, curb-to-curb user-friendliness for all, but

everyone has to play his or her part.  MOT will play  its

part.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang:</b> I thank the Senior

Minister  of State for clarifying that an alternative  to

the  bus  system is being pursued with maybe a  dedicated

scheme,  rather than this public at large  scheme.   With

regard  to that, the crucial aspect would be the cost  of

even  providing a dedicated service.  If you look at  the

National  Council  of  Social  Service's  latest   annual

report, CommChest funds are used, that is, the public  at

large funds are used to provide a public transport scheme

for  the  disabled.   This is where the  public  is  also

playing its part.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am just wondering what part would public bus

operators be playing.  In the initial years when this was

first  broached, there was actually funding from the  bus

operators to start a fund for NCSS.  But my understanding

is  that they have stopped providing this.  So the  whole

burden is now loaded onto the individual, the family  and

the  public  at large.  I know, but I may be wrong  here,

MCDS also has been trying its best to push this along but

it  does  not seem to have much progress.  My concern  is

that  this  dedicated service would end up an interesting

exercise  on paper.  But when it comes to implementation,

the wherewithal, the funds, would not be available.  What

would be the obligations for public bus operators to,  at

least,  help in supplementing or complementing the  funds

required?

<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I really would

not  want  to  pre-empt the discussion about  the  inter-agency report, which is led by MCDS, because they are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>



still  finalising their recommendations.  In due  course,

maybe  we  can have a discussion about it.  In any  case,

NCSS does not come under MOT.  It comes under MCDS.   But

the  key  point  is this.  Yes, I think for  a  dedicated

service, funding is one of the key elements that  has  to

be  resolved.   Let MCDS and this Working  Group  discuss

through on how they want to bring them about.  Obviously,

it  has  to  come from various parties.   The  Member  is

right.   He  quoted  the NCSS' annual report  about  they

setting aside a budget for transport needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current system is this. The various VWOs have

their  own individual systems to serve their own members.

It  is  highly unsatisfactory because there are a lot  of

duplication  and  wastages.  So I think what  the  inter-agency  Working Group is working towards is some sort  of

centralisation, so that it can be a shared  service  and,

hopefully, we can cut down on duplication and stretch our

limited  dollar longer.  We hope that they  can  succeed.

But,  I  think,  implicit  in the Member's  supplementary

question was, what is the role of the bus operator?   The

bus  operator's role is to operate.  It is  an  operator.

We have a big debate in this House not too long ago.  Let

us  acknowledge  that  different  people  play  different

roles.   There  is  a regulator, there  is  a  commercial

player,  and there will be NGOs with objectives  to  help

and,  of  course, the passengers themselves  who  can  be

means tested.  I think for a system to work properly,  we

need everyone to play his part.  I cannot play your part,

neither can you play my part.  But I think when all of us

play in harmony, we would have a marvellous system.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Just one point. The

arguments  that  were put forth by the Ministry  at  that

time  about three or four years ago, on whether to  allow

MRT   trains  to  become  disabled-friendly,  sound  very

similar  to  the  arguments that the Senior  Minister  of

State  is  presenting now.  For the public bus  companies

too, we are talking about productivity, etc.  But it  was

good news that finally the MRT opens its doors.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is your question, Ms Braema?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Yes, I am coming to it.

The  Ministry,  in  the  light of what  the  Ministry  of

Community  Development and Sports is proposing,  is  also

trying  to  look into flexi-hours.  And from these  PEC's

recommendations, would the Ministry perhaps align  itself

to  look into flexi-hours where maybe such provision will

not affect productivity when it comes to public buses  as

the rush is not as severe?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can I remind Members to make your

questions concise?  Please try to develop that skill,  so

that we can proceed with our Questions efficiently.

<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> I do not know what transpired

three or four years ago.  That time I was up there in the

gallery  happily as Permanent Secretary (MTI).  But  from

what  I  could gather from the Member's comment, she  was

saying  that the arguments used by MCIT then against  MRT

being   made   disabled-friendly   was   on   ground   of

productivity.  By that, I presume she meant fast loading,

boarding  and alighting.  As I explained, I think  trains

are  quite  different.  A train is not a  bus.   One  key

difference  is a train has many doors.  So, at  the  same

time,  you can admit and alight passengers easily.   Each

train  has  to  stop  at a station for  at  least  a  few

minutes.  So, even though a wheelchair-bound may take  up

to  two  minutes, it is all right.  It does not  hold  up

traffic.  But buses are quite different.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier I made the two implications - one is cost,

and  the  other is time.  These are serious implications.

These are not frivolous that we imagine out of thin  air.

The  problem, therefore, cuts two ways.  Either there are

a lot of such users who are on wheelchair, in which case,

the  cost will be better spread out.  But if there are  a

large  number of users, the problem of cumulative waiting

becomes a big one.  Or if the numbers are small, in which

case the impact on queuing or the productivity she talked

about  is marginal.  But in that case, the cost is  high.

So  it is no wonder that mature cities like New York  and

London have come to the conclusion that they still need a

dedicated  service.   Yes, they  will  try  to  make  the

routine bus service as friendly

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>



as  possible, but you have to override that, you have  to

supplement it.  In fact, more than supplement it, that is

the  dominant mode of travel.  It is a dedicated  service

for those on wheelchair.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest we get carried away, the disabled is a whole

spectrum  of people with different degrees of disability,

from  mild to severe, and wheelchair-bound.  I think  for

the bulk of the disabled population, they can make use of

our  public transport.  Years ago when I used to run more

regularly, 10 km each time, I ran from my house in  Upper

Thomson  to  Newton  Circus, and I would  then  pass  the

junction where the former Toa Payoh Hospital used to  be,

and  the  Association  of  the  Visually  Handicapped  is

located.  So, very often, I will encounter them alighting

from  buses,  crossing  the  overhead  bridge,  and   the

pedestrian crossings, and they can do so unaided.  But  I

think what is more heartwarming for me is that, every now

and  then,  I will see strangers who offer to  help  them

cross  the  bridge, or the pedestrian crossing.   I  have

played my part myself.  And I think this is what it ought

to  be.  We all want a user-friendly system for all,  but

everyone must play his part.  MOT will play its part.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>



space  shortage  at the previous office at  Bukit  Merah;

and,    finally,    to   facilitate   the   comprehensive

redevelopment of Toa Payoh.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB has appointed five marketing agents to lease out

the  premises at the previous office at Bukit Merah.   In

view  of the current economic situation, HDB expects  the

demand  in  the short term to be weak.  Nonetheless,  HDB

will continue to actively market the vacated premises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall HDB retail sector has not been spared

the  problems that the local retail sector has faced over

the  past  few  years.   These problems  include  a  weak

external  demand  due to the regional economic  slowdown,

leakage  of  spending by Singaporeans going overseas  and

keen  domestic  competition with  the  emergence  of  new

shopping  malls and hyper markets.  The business  of  the

eating establishments and the retail shops at Bukit Merah

had   also,  to  some  extent,  been  affected  by  HDB's

relocation  to Toa Payoh, although they are  still  quite

well   patronised  by  office  workers  from  the  nearby

Henderson Industrial Park, CMPB and SPRING.  HDB will try

to rent out the vacant retail premises to other retailers

who  complement  the  existing  trades  and  who  have  a

regional demand.  In this way, we hope to increase  human

traffic and therefore have a positive spillover effect on

the businesses of the existing shops.

<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Two

supplementary questions, please.  If one is to buy a  new

house,  it will be seen logical and prudent to make  sure

that the old existing house is either being rented out or

sold.   So  would  it be seen as illogical  and  not  too

prudent in this context?  The second question is what  is

the  loss in rental revenue where HDB is experiencing  at

the  moment  for the past two months as a result  of  the

vacancy?

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> The Member is quite correct

that, obviously, there is an interest on the part of  the

owner  of  the building to ensure that it is rented  out.

However, this is a free market economy and all of us  who

have ever been in a situation of having to rent out

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>



our  property  will  know that we cannot  guarantee  that

there will be uninterrupted stream of tenants queueing up

outside our door.  The decision to move was made in 1995,

seven  years  ago.  At that point, things were  obviously

different.   But  even now, the real  issue  is:  is  HDB

trying  to  lease  out  the  vacant  premises?   We  have

appointed  five marketing agents, and I am  sure  all  of

them  are  equally incentivised to find the right  tenant

mix  for these premises.  So it is not a question of  HDB

just  sitting back and leaving it vacant because  it  can

afford to leave it vacant.  That is not the case at all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have the figure that he is asking for as to

how  much  it is losing over the last few months.   In  a

sense,  he  also has to realise that, in  a  free  market

economy,  the rental yields will fluctuate from  time  to

time.   So  if you ask me, even if I were to give  him  a

figure now, it would be an entirely notional figure.  The

proof  of  the pudding ultimately is how much whoever  is

going  to  come in to these premises is willing  to  pay.

And  we hope that, over the next few months, we will find

a tenant, or several tenants, who will take up the vacant

premises.

<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew:</b> May I ask the Minister of

State  whether  the old HDB headquarters in  Bukit  Merah

Central has two towers and three podiums with an area  of

7,000 sq ft and looking at a rental rate of $1.50 per  sq

ft  per  month, and this works out to be almost a  rental

income  of  $1  million per month?   So  is  that  figure

worrisome when it is left vacant for the past few  months

and  we  do  not  know  what would happen  in  subsequent

months?

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, whether

that  figure is $1 million, or $1, it would  still  be  a

concern  on  the part of HDB and of the Government.   The

real  question  is:  are we trying  to  lease  out  these

premises?   And  the  answer to  that  question  is  yes.

Exactly how much it would be, the market will say.   When

someone will move in will depend also on the market.   So

there  is a limit to how much we can try to flog  a  dead

horse.  In this case, the premises are not dead.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>



premises, as he quite correctly pointed out, are  useable

premises.  And in due time, tenants will move in and they

will  pay  a  good market rate.  When that  happens,  the

shopkeepers who are in that vicinity will also experience

an increase in their business prospects.

<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew:</b> One final question. Has the

Ministry  explored the option of inviting GLCs,  or  even

other  Government authorities, such as the Land Transport

Authority, to house their headquarters there?

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> We have certainly explored

all  the options that he has mentioned.  Anyway, we  hope

this  will also be part of the advertisement.   Those  of

you, whether you are a GLC, private company, or any other

business,  who wish to use the premises at  the  old  HDB

headquarters, please apply.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like  to  take this opportunity to appeal  to  all

relevant  authorities, especially  statutory  boards  and

LTA,   that   when  they  want  to  vacate   such   large

developments or shift bus stops, they should consider the

impact  of  such action on the community.  Like  in  this

case  itself, HDB has two or three blocks and the  impact

on  the  shopkeepers  in  the community  is  really  very

serious.  In my case, they shifted a bus stop ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is your question, Mdm Phua?

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> They shifted the bus terminal

which has also an impact on the community around it.   So

<div align="center"><b>PRICE INCREASES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Monitoring and curbing)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister for

Trade  and Industry what actions are being taken  by  the

Government  to  monitor price trends and to  curb  wanton

price increases during this difficult economic period.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, MTI monitors price

trends  constantly  and publishes  such  data  regularly.

Inflationary  pressure  has been largely  absent  in  the

first  half  of 2002.  Inflation was -0.6% in  the  first

half of the year, with prices of most major items posting

declines.   Although the economy is picking up, inflation

for  the  year as a whole is expected to remain  weak  at

close to 0%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understandably, some people are concerned about

retailers  raising their prices when GST is increased  or

even  in  advance of the GST increase.  The  increase  in

prices due to the GST is expected to be less than 2% next

year, based on the experience in 1994.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, to prevent the possibility of wanton

price  increases,  we have set up the  Committee  Against

Profiteering,  headed by Mr Chan Soo  Sen,   Minister  of

State   for   MCDS  and  PMO.   The  committee  comprises

grassroots  leaders,  members of  merchant  associations,

CASE, unionists, and MPs, including Mr Steve Chia.  Local

committees have also been formed at every constituency to

address  complaints  by  residents against  opportunistic

price  increases.  If there is evidence that the retailer

is  seeking  to  profiteer, these committees  will  apply

moral suasion on them.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our basic approach to control inflation is to keep

the  Singapore dollar stable, and rely on competition and

market  forces  to generate efficiency and lower  prices.

Since most of what we consume in Singapore is imported, a

stable Singapore dollar will help to keep inflation under

control.   The  Government will also continue  to  ensure

that  there is an adequate supply of essential goods  and

services  so  that businesses will find it  difficult  to

profiteer.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,

does such monitoring services have the power to cover the

TLCs,  the  GLCs  and the statutory boards  that  provide

public services too?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

monitoring  by MTI covers all the goods and  services  in

the  composite  CPI basket.  Some of them are  utilities,

and  I  think the House has sat through many  debates  on

various   aspects   of  price  increases   in   different

utilities,  including transport fares,  which  we  had  a

debate on quite recently.  Not all goods and services are

under the purview of MTI.

hawker/canteen stall licences from 2000 till now; (b) how

many  of such applications have been successful and  what

are the criteria for success; and (c) what is the average

waiting time for the issue of such licences.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan (Minister of State for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for the Environment (Dr Balaji Sadasivan) (for the Minister for the Environment):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  National  Environment  Agency  (NEA)

issues  licences  for  stall  holders  to  operate  their

stalls.  This means a person has to secure a stall  first

before  he applies to NEA for a licence, be it  a  hawker

centre, canteen, coffee shop, or food court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between January 2000 and July 2002, a total of

16,458 new licences were issued

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>



for  stalls  in hawker centres, food courts,  coffeeshops

and  canteens.  788 licences were issued for cooked  food

stalls  and  1,060  licences for  market  stalls  in  the

various  ENV  and  HDB hawker centres  and  wet  markets.

Another  13,620 licences were issued to stall holders  in

food courts and coffeeshops, and another 990 licences for

school canteens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A licence to operate a stall is issued to the

applicant  after he has been inoculated against  typhoid,

passed  a TB screening test if he is above 45 years  old,

and  attended  and  passed a basic food  hygiene  course.

Licences are usually issued to the applicants within  the

same  day  if documents are produced to show satisfactory

compliance.  During the period January 2000 to July 2002,

only  two  out  of  16,460 applicants did  not  meet  the

Minister  for  Community  Development  and  Sports   what

actions  are  being taken by his Ministry to help  people

severely affected by this period of economic difficulties

from turning to petty crimes or suicide as a last resort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports (Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim): Mr Speaker,

Sir, the Government and the community have put in place a

wide  range  of  services and programmes to  help  people

affected  by the economic situation.  The services  range

from  short-term financial assistance to  counselling  to

help  Singaporeans  deal  with  the  difficulties.    The

Community  Development Councils' (CDCs) social assistance

schemes   are  able  to  relieve  families  in  financial

distress.   In the last financial year, the CDCs assisted

almost  15,000 households.  Many families had  short-term

financial  grants  to  tide  over  a  crisis,   such   as

retrenchment or unemployment.  Others received grants  to

help pay rent and utilities charges or subsidies

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>



for  child  care centres or student care centres.   Local

CDC  schemes supplement these schemes with such  help  as

NTUC  vouchers  for basic provisions and  bus  stamps  or

Transitlink cards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from financial help, the CDCs also provide job

search  and  job placement services.  The CDCs,  together

with  the  Ministry  of  Manpower,  organise  job  fairs.

Through the job fairs, job seekers can be better informed

of  various job opportunities and find out more about the

nature of work and skill sets required.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those in financial difficulties may need counselling

to  get back on their feet.  The CDCs will refer families

who find difficulties coping with their current situation

to the FSCs for counselling and support.  The FSCs, which

are  neighbourhood-based facilities, are manned by social

workers  who  are  best  placed to help  individuals  and

families  with  relationship or  emotional  difficulties.

The   FSCs  also  provide  a  range  of  family   support

programmes.  Those in genuine need should not hesitate to

come forward to either the CDCs or the FSCs for help.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like  to know whether there is a 1800 hotline number that

members of the public who are at a loss can turn  to  and

call for help, if required, and if there is, whether  the

number is well publicised.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, I know that

some  of the FSCs have such hotlines.  The CDCs also have

such  hotline numbers.  Even Town Councils  have  such  a

service.   These  are  made available  in  a  variety  of

places,  such as community clubs and Residents  Committee

Centres.  I am not sure whether they are on the websites,

but  if  the  Member  is interested I could  provide  the

information.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

referring  to  one national number that most  people  can

recognise and remember.  For example, if we need to  call

the  police, it is 999; if it is the fire brigade, it  is

995.  Is there a national number like

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>



these  that we can actually identify and call in case  we

need help?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> There is no one

national  number  that  one can use  in  case  one  needs

financial help, but there are numbers which are available

for  them with respect to the FSCs and the CDCs.  We have

found that such a scheme is adequate.

<div align="center"><b>PETTY CRIMES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Profile of offenders)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister for

Home  Affairs in view of the rise in petty crimes  during

this period of economic difficulties (a) what actions are

being  taken by his Ministry to tackle this problem;  and

(b)   whether  his  Ministry  has  undertaken  any  study

recently  to understand the profile of these petty  crime

offenders.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, in the first half of this year, there

were  7,130  cases  of petty crimes, an  increase  of  9%

compared  with the first half of last year.   Shoplifting

constituted  93%  of  this increase.   There  were  2,060

shoplifting  cases for the first half of  this  year,  an

increase   of  34%  compared  to  1,530  cases   in   the

corresponding period last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, petty crimes are minor and opportunistic. Most

could  have  been  prevented if  the  victims  had  taken

precaution.   To address this, Police has reinforced  its

public  education efforts through various channels,  such

as  the  popular  Crime  Watch series,  crime  prevention

exhibitions and talks.  In addition, Police works closely

with  representatives  of  the hotel,  retail  and  other

industries  where  these  petty  crimes  occur.   I  have

previously   stressed  in  this  House   that   community

involvement is critical if we are to continue to keep our

neighbourhoods safe and secure.  Police will continue  to

raise  the  level of community awareness and  involvement

through the Community Safety and Security Programme.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we have undertaken any study recently

to  understand the profile of petty crime offenders,  let

me assure the House that Police has a system of capturing

relevant data so that crime trends and behaviour  can  be

identified    early   and   corrective   actions    taken

expeditiously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general profile of petty crime offenders has

remained largely similar to that in previous years,  with

local  male offenders comprising the majority.  Of  note,

however,  is an increase in the proportion of  juveniles,

ie, those aged between 7 and below 16, arrested for petty

crimes  from  15% to 20% in the first half of  this  year

compared to the same period last year.  To address  this,

Police collaborated with the Ministry of Education on  an

anti-shoplifting education package prior  to  the  school

holidays.   Other on-going programmes, closely  monitored

by  the  Inter-Ministry Committee on Youth Crime which  I

chair,  include the Honorary Voluntary Special  Constable

Scheme  for teachers and the Guidance programme for  teen

shoplifters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite the increase in petty crimes in the

first  half  of this year, Singapore remains one  of  the

safest countries in the world.  We have been consistently

ranked  in the World Competitiveness Report published  by

Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC) as one  of

the  top  three  safest countries in the world  for  four

years  running.  Let me take this opportunity  to  assure

the  House that the Police will spare no effort  to  keep

Singapore a safe and secure home for all.

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Miss Penny Low</b> asked the Minister for National

Development, in view of the recent incidents of shattered

shower room tempered glass doors installed by the Housing

and  Development Board (HDB), what are (i)  the  measures

being taken to prevent such a recurrence and (ii) the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>



number and percentage of these incidences in HDB flats.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

HDB has identified three possible causes for the breakage

of tempered glass shower screens in HDB flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Rough usage and improper renovation works by

the  flat-owner, which may cause chipping of  the  glass.

Over time, the chips may develop into cracks, causing the

glass  to  break suddenly when they widen  to  a  certain

crack width;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Deterioration or damage of the fitting

accessories,  such  as the hinges or sliders,  which  may

cause the glass panel to detach and break; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Presence of minute impurities within the glass

that  render  the  glass  more susceptible  to  breakage.

Based  on  current  technology,  the  formation  of  such

impurities  during  the manufacturing process  cannot  be

totally eliminated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the causes of the breakage cannot be

ascertained conclusively, HDB's building contractors have

replaced,  and will replace, the glass doors  within  the

defects liability period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, as a precautionary measure, HDB contractors

have started to inspect all HDB flats that were installed

with  tempered glass shower screens. The glass doors  and

other fittings will be replaced, if necessary, at no cost

to  the lessees.   Lessees of these units have also  been

provided  with  a usage and maintenance guide  to  advise

them  on  the safe and proper usage of the shower screen.

In  addition,  they  are  given the  particulars  of  the

original  installer  of the shower screen  to  facilitate

future maintenance of their shower screen, if necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since May 2000, 58 incidents of shattered tempered

glass  shower  screens in HDB flats have  been  reported.

This  constitutes less than 0.2% of the total  number  of

sets of shower screens installed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  may  I ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary  what

are  the  tender specifications for this tempered  glass?

Are  the  specifications for HDB shower screens different

from those for private condominiums?  Why are there fewer

cases of shattered glass screens in private condominiums?

Secondly,  are  there  any safety standards  which  these

tempered  glass screens must comply with?  If there  are,

is  there a breach of these standards?  Thirdly, will the

HDB  replace  not  just  the  glass  screens  which  have

shattered but all those in the same batch of the contract

as well?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

hon.  Member asked three questions.  Let me take the last

one first.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB started putting in glass shower screens since

1999.   We  have  installed something like 30,000  shower

screens  in 15,000 flats.  Usually, there are two showers

in  each  flat.   We will inspect all the  30,000  shower

screens,  every single one - the fixtures and  the  glass

doors  -  before the end of October this year.   Improper

fixtures  will be replaced.  If we can detect  any  glass

impurities  within  the expertise of the  contractor,  we

will  replace the tempered glass doors at no cost to  the

lessee.   So, I hope Members are reassured of that.   And

we are replacing them expeditiously, as fast as we can.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I think the hon. Member is under the

misguided notion that private condominiums do not  suffer

the  same  fate.  They do.  In fact - without  mentioning

names   -   in  a  condominium  somewhere  in  north-east

Singapore,  we have a 1% breakage of glass doors;   HDB's

record  is 0.2%.  The contractors kept quiet.  Of course,

I can give Members the list of names, etc, privately.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shattering of glass screens is not uncommon. HDB is

late  in the game. It only started building glass  shower

curtains  in 1999, and tempered glass screen  doors  only

came  in  lately.   We did a search of the  Internet  and

found  that  this  subject  is something  that  has  been

published  in  the  New Scientist.  I will  circulate  it

later

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>



on.  It shows that such things happen.  Even high quality

tempered, hardened glass doors shatter in different parts

of the world randomly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there any standards imposed? HDB, of course,

has  the  specifications.  I do  not  have  the  detailed

specifications.   The specification  is  that  they  must

stand  up  to  a certain usage.  And the contractors  who

supply  these glass doors to HDB, supply the  same  glass

doors  to many of the condominiums in Singapore.   But  I

will give the hon. Member the specifications.

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, may I know

what  is the warranty period for these shower screens  in

HDB  flats?   If  the  residents prefer  not  to  install

tempered glass shower screens but prefer plastic  or  any

other  type of material because they have senior citizens

or  children at home, is that also permissible?  Will HDB

replace them, also at no cost?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> If the glass shatters

within  the defects liability period, ie, one year  after

taking possession, we will replace them with no questions

asked.   If it happens after the one-year period,  please

let  us know and we will see what we can do.  So far, all

the  shattered  glass screens have been  replaced  at  no

cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question was that if the lessees want a

different  kind of replacement, eg, a plastic door,  yes,

we  are  accommodating.  But sometimes there  is  a  cost

differential.  So, if it is cheaper than a glass door, of

course,  no charge - FOC.  If it is more expensive,  then

it is reasonable for the lessee to top up the difference.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Mr Speaker, tempered glass is not

supposed  to  shatter, that is why it is called  tempered

glass.   It has certain reinforcements in the glass.   It

is  supposed  to  just have a crack, unless  some  direct

force  is applied.  So, I do not understand what are  the

causes  for  the  shattering of tempered glass  in  those

units.   Also,  knowing  the  activities,  normally   the

specifications  will  specify the thickness  and  whether

armour-shield or tempered.  So, if the cause  is  due  to

impurities, that means that the whole

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>



30,000  glass  doors may shatter, and  that  could  be  a

safety problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, how can the HDB check the integrity of

these  glass  doors  for the shower rooms?   It  is  very

difficult to check the impurities in glass.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, as to the 1% breakage in private

condominiums, the private developer concerned may be  one

of  the  not-so-up-to-quality developers.  The HDB should

not use that as a benchmark.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do

not know which discipline the hon. Member comes from, but

he  does  not know much about tempered glass.  I hate  to

give a technical presentation on how tempered glass comes

about,  but  I  will just read a paragraph from  the  New

Scientist.  It reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tempered glass is found everywhere from cars and

bus shelters to the windows, walls and roofs of thousands

of  buildings around the world. It is easy  to  see  why.

This glass has five times the strength of standard glass,

and  when  it  does break, it shatters  into  tiny  cubes

rather than large razor-sharp shards.  Architects love it

because  large  panels  can be bolted  together  to  make

transparent  walls,  and turning  it  into  ceilings  and

floors is almost as easy."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is it made of?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is made of heating a sheet of ordinary glass to

about 620oC to soften it slightly, allowing its structure

to  expand, and then cooling it rapidly with jets of cold

air ..."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes on and on. I can give a copy of the article

to the hon. Member.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The problem starts when glass contains nickel

sulphide impurities.  Trace amounts of nickel and sulphur

are often present in the raw materials used to make glass

...."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is inherent in the glass. What is glass made of?

Nickel and sulphide.  And they are impurities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is how is it possible to detect

glass  doors  which might crack?  We do  our  best.   The

percentage  of  shattering is very  miniscule.   We  will

carefully check for fine cracks.  Many of the glass doors

shatter not because of impurities.  Some of them are  due

to wear and tear.  We do not know.  Once it is shattered,

we cannot trace whether it is wear and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>



tear or whether it is due to impurities.  So, we look for

fixtures - whether they are properly installed.  We  know

it  can.   The  contractors have  experienced  installing

hundreds   of   thousands  of  glass   doors   throughout

Singapore,  and  HDB is actually a small player  in  this

game.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the

Senior  Parliamentary Secretary what is  the  purpose  of

installing tempered glass in shower screens?  What is the

tempered glass supposed to perform in the shower screens?

He  still  has  not given the answer as to what  are  the

causes  of  the  glass shattering.  If you  look  at  the

photograph  in  the  Straits  Times,  they  were   really

shattered.  Maybe  he can explain how HDB  inspectors  or

contractors  inspect the rest of the shower  screens  and

give  an assurance to the residents that after inspection

or  testing by the checkers, they will be all  right  and

they will not shatter.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> My answer is: trust us.

We  have  to trust the contractors because they have  the

experience.    Will   the  glass   door   shatter   after

inspection?   Unlikely, but it can happen.  There  is  no

100%  assurance.   But  we will do  our  best.   We  must

remember that there are potentially thousands of  defects

in  a  building  due  to  wear and  tear  and  we  cannot

guarantee that none of these defects will occur at all.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, my question is: will tempered glass shatter? We have an engineer by

training  here  who says that tempered glass  should  not

shatter  but the fact is that it has shattered.  So  will

tempered glass shatter?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Tempered glass should not

shatter but because of the intrinsic traces of nickel and

sulphur,  it can shatter in a small number of cases.   It

does not happen just in HDB flats.  It happens in private

condominiums.  It happens all over the world, in Britain,

Australia and America.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, I think the Senior

Parliamentary Secretary has not answered my  question  on

what is the purpose of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>



tempered glass as shower screens.  What is it supposed to

do?  Why not ordinary glass?  Why tempered glass?  He has

not answered the question.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> In fact, tempered glass

is  safer than ordinary glass because when ordinary glass

cracks, it cracks in fairly huge pieces with sharp  razor

corners.  If you are not careful, when you lean on to it,

it cracks and it can pierce you.  In the case of tempered

glass,  when  it  cracks,  it cracks  into  thousands  of

pieces.  Of course, it can still hurt you once in a while

but  it  is safer.  It is hard, it is safe. When it  does

crack,  it  shatters into thousands of pieces, just  like

your  car  windscreen.  Why do the car manufacturers  not

use  ordinary glass?  Because in an accident,  they  will

shatter  and it will not pierce you.  You might still  be

hurt   by   the  shattered  pieces,  rather  than   sharp

triangular  pieces that will pierce your face.   That  is

the  answer.   In  fact, tempered  glass  is  safer  than

ordinary glass.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

view  of  what we have heard in the House now, would  the

HDB   reconsider  future  installation  and   use   other

alternative means until this issue can be resolved?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> For the new contracts,

we are using a new kind of glass called framed, laminated

safety glass. We will frame the outside so that the edges

will  not crack and we will laminate it.  So if  it  does

crack,  the thousands of pieces will be held together  by

the  lamination.  We are also reconsidering  the  use  of

glass  per  se.   We may move on to acrylic.  Acrylic  is

expensive, and also over time, it loses its transparency,

it   becomes  yellowish.  We  have  to  weigh  all  these

consequences.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, can I check whether HDB has

done  any  test  on  tempered glasses  before  they  were

actually  installed  at the units? Were  they  tested  by

SPRING or any other authorities?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> HDB's specification is

no   different   from   the  specification   of   private

contractors.  In view of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>



these incidents, HDB, as I have said, will review the use

of tempered glass altogether.

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> In view of the introduction of this

framed, laminated glass, is it possible to replace  those

glasses  in  the  30,000 units that have  been  mentioned

earlier  on with this framed, laminated glass instead  of

the usual tempered shower glass? The other question is  I

read  in  the Straits Times yesterday that they had  some

tests  for this kind of glass.  I think it is a  kind  of

stress test.  Does HDB also conduct stress tests on  some

of   these  products?   Because  it  appears  that   some

contractors,  to  reduce  costs,  actually  import   sub-standard products and some of these products may get into

the HDB flats.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Shattered glass screens

henceforth will now be replaced with heat-soaked tempered

glass.   We soak the plates in the water for a  few  days

and  those  containing even minute traces  of  impurities

will  crack. We will then know it is defective.   But  it

does not eliminate completely the presence of nickel  and

sulphur  altogether.  In other words, the possibility  of

cracking  will  be  reduced.  That is  the  test  she  is

talking  about.   That  is the  test  that  she  read  in

yesterday's papers - the heat soaked test.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Before this goes on and on, Dr Teo, can

you ask your last supplementary question?  After this, we

will go to the last Question.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> I know there are no known Singapore

standards  for  tempered glass shower screens.   I  still

would  like  to  find out what HDB has specified  in  the

contracts  for  these  shower  screens.   There   is   an

American,  Australian  or  Indian  standard  or  whatever

standards.  What sort of standard has HDB specified which

the contractor must comply in order to make sure that the

tempered  glass  can  perform?  What sort  of  compliance

standards were specified in the contract?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> I do not have the

details  of HDB's tempered glass specifications.   I  can

find that out for him.  But

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>



HDB  has  told me that the specification is the  same  as

those  specified for private condominiums.  I  will  find

out for him.

National  Development  whether his  Ministry  will  allow

divorcing  couples to remain as joint  tenants  of  their

flats  until  their  children turn 18  so  as  to  reduce

custody disputes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Under the HDB Home Ownership

Scheme,   having  a  family  nucleus  is   one   of   the

prerequisite eligibility conditions that applicants  need

to  satisfy  before they can qualify  for  an  HDB  flat.

Examples  of  such  a family nucleus  include  a  married

couple,  a single staying with his or her parents  and  a

divorced parent with legal custody of the children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a married couple divorces, the Family Court

usually  addresses  the issue of  legal  custody  of  the

children,  if  there are children, and  the  question  of

division of assets, including the HDB flat as this is the

matrimonial  home.   As  the  parent  who  obtains  legal

custody,  care and control of the children is  considered

to  form a family nucleus with the children, he or she is

allowed  to retain or take over the ownership of the  HDB

flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a couple who jointly owns the HDB flat is

divorced,  it would not be appropriate to allow  them  to

continue  to  jointly own the flat since that  couple  no

longer constitutes a family unit and is really not likely

to  be  living  in  the same flat.  It is  therefore  not

practical  for  outgoing divorcees to  retain  ownership,

since  this  would render them ineligible to buy  another

flat  in  the future.  And in any case, there is also  no

guarantee that granting such joint ownership of HDB flats

to  divorcees would really make any difference as far  as

the reduction of custody disputes is concerned.

[27th August, 2002],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House, taking into account the Report of

press  release by Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd on  the  new

GLCs,    urges   the   Government   to   implement    the

recommendations of the EISC which define  the  new  roles

and  positioning of the Government and GLCs  in  business

and,   in   so  doing,  support  the  growth  of  private

enterprise  and  entrepreneurship in Singapore.".  -  [Mr

Leong Horn Kee].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br>1.55 pm

<br><br><!-- Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, thank you for allowing me to join  in  the

debate  today.  I would like to declare my interests.   I

am  the  Group CEO and President of the Hyflux  Group  of

companies, established in 1989 as Hydrochem (S) Pte  Ltd.

Hyflux  has  progressed from being a small  establishment

providing  integrated  water  treatment  systems   to   a

membrane specialist company, listed on SESDAQ in  January

2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this perspective, I would like to share my

thoughts  as a Singaporean, as an entrepreneur and  as  a

business person. This debate, I feel, has focused  a  lot

on GLCs' predominance in the Singapore business scene.  I

would  like to offer some business perspectives of  GLCs.

Compared   with   the  average  stated-owned   enterprise

worldwide,  our GLCs are amongst the finest and  best-run

in  the  world.  They are highly organised,  transparent,

accountable  and profitable.  From our nation's  founding

years,  our  GLCs  were  part and  parcel  of  what  made

Singapore the success it is today.  Indeed, our GLCs were

originally the main engines of growth and development  in

many sectors, including infrastructure and industry. They

provided the much needed employment and stability for our

country and our citizens.  For all these reasons, we,  as

Singaporeans  should and must always be appreciative  and

grateful.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big question is not whether our GLCs were the

right  engines of Singapore's original growth  which,  in

many  ways,  I personally believe they were, but  whether

they  are still the right engines for Singapore's  future

economic  success  in an increasingly competitive  global

arena.   If  they are, we need to define in which  areas.

If   they  are  not,  again,  we  need  to  define  which

particular areas and how we should move forward.   If  we

sincerely  believe  that  one  of  the  most  significant

engines  of  growth  in  a  new age  economy  is  budding

entrepreneurship  and  private  enterprise,  we  need  to

examine whether our GLCs in various instances, are indeed

crowding  out  and  stifling these  engines  we  need  to

support and grow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact of the matter is that if truly provided

with  a  level playing field, and Singapore entrepreneurs

still cannot fight and beat the GLCs at contracts on home

ground,  and  in  their own field  of  expertise,  it  is

unlikely  that  they  would  succeed  against  far   more

aggressive  foreign players in a global market  and  vice

versa.  This same rule applies to our GLCs as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that in mind, we must still always remember the

war  is  out there, not here in Singapore.  We  need  the

Government  to provide a level playing field and  a  good

business  platform for all, not only SMEs but also  MNCs,

GLCs,  TLCs  and  NLCs.  This is  why  I  would  like  to

congratulate  the  EISC for having thoroughly  considered

and  completed  the  excellent report  on  Government  in

business.  The  recommendations are as  comprehensive  as

they  are  diverse, and they have left  almost  no  stone

unturned.  At the same time, they reflect a very  serious

grasp of the issues at stake, and propose solutions  that

are  both  practical and responsible. As  such,  I  fully

endorse  the  motion to implement the recommendations  of

the  EISC.   I would like to offer my compelling  reasons

why I fully support the motion, particularly at this time

in Singapore's history.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, there is an urgent need to quench the

thirst of the local SMEs and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>



private enterprises.  Let me elaborate on my first  point

with an analogy of the desert, thunder and rain.  We have

just  been  through  one  of the  worst  patches  in  our

economic  history.  The economic downturn  has  hit  many

enterprises in an unprecedented manner, especially  among

local  SMEs  and many are still hurting.  If  I  were  to

describe to you the Singapore business landscape  through

the  eyes  of  the  business community, particularly  the

private  sector, you will see a desert  -  a parched  and

dried  up  desert  in which many are  now  thirsting  for

something real, something concrete, something to  believe

in again, and then to move forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking my analogy further, the desert has been

caused   by  a  multitude  of  factors,  including   MNCs

following  the  exodus  to greener pastures  in  low-cost

manufacturing  countries such  as  China.   It  has  been

worsened by global cost cutting and consolidation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us move on to thunder before the rain. I would

really  describe  the  recommendations  of  the  EISC  as

thunder  before the long-awaited rainfall on our  parched

and  drying desert of private enterprises.  To the  weary

businessman  and  to  the  budding  entrepreneur,   these

recommendations are indeed like thunder.   I  choose  the

word "thunder" with much deliberation.  Thunder announces

the   onset  of  much  needed  rainfall  to  refresh  and

rejuvenate parched soil.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us move on to the rain. Unfortunately, to the

sceptics  and  cynics, thunder may  not  always  lead  to

rainfall  where  it  is needed.  Winds  of  change  could

indeed  sweep away the clouds of promise to other  areas.

Local  SMEs and the private sector in general are  hoping

and waiting for the rain.  The rain that they are longing

for  is  the implementation of the recommended  measures.

That  is all that is needed  - this window of opportunity

-  speaking as an entrepreneur, speaking for the  private

business community.  All true blue business persons  know

how  to  capture  the rain and to use it,  store  it  and

harness  its productivity, and maybe recycle it.   And  I

dare say, even bring some

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>



of  this  water in their journeys far and wide, searching

out new lands of promise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have often heard the following: "If you have a

good idea, a good product, or a good technology that  can

surely  make  money,  do not let the GLCs  and  statutory

boards  find out about it.  Or they will try to get  hold

of  your  technology  or idea and  compete  with  you  in

Singapore.  And how to compete with them?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I spoke to a friend to encourage him to

start  his  own business. But his father discouraged  him

saying that in Singapore, he would lose to the GLCs.   It

would be better for him to either be employed by them  or

join an MNC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above views reflect the general perception among

some  Singaporeans, even though they are  unjustified  in

many   cases.    In   Singapore's  drive   to   encourage

entrepreneurship,  this perception is counter  productive

but, unfortunately, real.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a rapidly changing global environment, the

private sector has a much bigger role to play in reacting

to  innovation and rapidly changing market  trends.   The

Temasek  Charter has refocused the role of our GLCs.   It

encourages the GLCs to focus on their core business,  and

expand globally.  This is a much awaited move.  This move

will  help convince the SMEs that GLCs would not encroach

into the already highly crowded domestic market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I endorse the Yellow Pages rule that Government

agencies  should not set up enterprises  in  areas  where

private sector players are able to play a part.  Instead,

the Government agencies should see these as opportunities

to provide business for the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An equally compelling reason for the speedy

implementation of the EISC recommendations is the  urgent

need  to  groom and grow our own local global  champions.

The  truth  is that in whatever global business  you  are

involved  in, you must be either number 1,  2  or  3,  by

sheer size and strength, or through agility and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>



superior  knowledge, failing which you have  to  redefine

your  niche  in  that sector and then  strive  to  become

number  1,  2  or  3 again.  Failing this,  you  have  to

redefine  or create a new sector in which you can  excel.

Failing  all of the above, you need to admit  defeat  and

bow out.  Your guess is probably as good as mine how many

and  which Singapore companies will eventually emerge  as

global winners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We honestly cannot predict whether it will be the

GLCs,  SMEs  or  larger  private corporations  that  will

emerge  as  champions.  But we do need winners  urgently,

and I believe we should cast our net as wide as possible.

Let the GLCs try, let the SMEs try, and let everyone try.

We  do  know  that market forces dictate that enterprises

which  respond the fastest to change, which can  continue

to  renew  themselves, will survive and  thrive  in  this

knowledge-based economy.  We have to move fast or we will

be  left behind.  We cannot afford to lose these few good

years  as  we either capture our share of the  market  or

risk losing our position.  As aptly put by journalist, Mr

Lee Han Shih, "Time is a luxury Singapore can't afford."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the city of Shanghai, for example. Anyone who

has been to Shanghai over the last 3-5 years will see how

rapid  the  development there has been.  Private  Chinese

enterprises are moving with equal speed and  resolve.   A

prime  example  is  China's Hai'er  Group.   One  of  the

largest  household domestic appliance vendors  in  China,

Hai'er  is  something  of  a local  hero  among  economic

reformers.   It is known for its dramatic revenue  growth

and  market-driven  approach through its  strong  service

network.   Even major foreign players such  as  Dell  and

Compaq have to reckon with Hai'er as a keen competitor in

the   huge  Chinese  PC  market.   Traditional  household

appliance  manufacturers  such as  General  Electric  and

Ariston  now  have  to sit up and take  heed  of  a  once

unheard  of brand, even in their home markets of the  USA

and Europe.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have a very limited base of

enterprises.  Besides having to compete with  established

names,  we  now  have to even compete  with  fast  rising

newcomers such as Hai'er.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have always done things the

Singapore  way,  and  rightly so,  simply  because  every

country's journey on the road to success is different and

unique.   Singaporeans  share an unusual  heritage  as  a

nation.  We always trust the Government to look after us,

do  the  best things for us and at the right time.   Many

have  criticised this over dependency on the  Government.

Though  most would not readily admit to it, we know  that

it  is  this relationship between the Government and  the

people that has made Singapore what it is today.   It  is

precisely because of this that the business community has

overwhelmingly  come forward to work with the  Government

on  the  remaking of our economic future.  What they  are

looking   for  is  not  simply  hand-outs  but  for   the

Government to create more opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the time has come for the private

sector  to  take on a more significant role  in  building

corporate Singapore.  I believe we are ready and we  have

to  be,  not only because private enterprise in Singapore

needs  this  but  perhaps,  more  importantly,  corporate

Singapore  urgently needs to be relevant  in  the  global

business  arena.   More  than ever  before,  the  private

sector  needs the space to grow and, in return, I believe

the  private sector will not disappoint in taking up  the

challenge.   The Singapore business community  is  urging

the  Government to implement the recommendations  of  the

EISC  speedily  in order to help quench the  dry  ground.

The  community surely does not want thunder  without  the

promise  of rain.  The rain which comes needs  to  be  in

sufficient volumes to penetrate the dry earth.  It cannot

be  a  passing drizzle.  It must be sustainable and  must

last long enough for the ground to absorb it, and for new

seeds of enterprise to germinate.  Therefore, I urge  the

Government to implement the measures recommended fast.  I

believe that if the rain comes, we will all look back  at

this milestone and, in its place, find an oasis that  has

moved us along in our nation's journey to success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Members of this House have debated

eloquently  on  the  two issues,  firstly,  the  role  of

Government in business and, secondly, supporting  private

enterprise and entrepreneurship, as reported by EISC  and

its  recommendations on Government in business.   Sir,  I

think this must be set against the bigger picture of  the

remaking  of  the  Singapore  economy,  and  as  we  face

squarely the challenges of the great uncertainty  of  the

world economy and fierce competition ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that many of us in the private sector

will  agree with EISC that the Government should only  be

involved  in  business  where it achieves  its  strategic

objectives,  such as managing critical resources,  public

policy objectives and developing new growth engines.  And

that  such  involvement  should cease  when  the  private

sector  has developed capability and is ready  to  assume

such role.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also believe that EISC has clearly defined what

type of business the Government should be in and what  it

should  keep out of, and therefore setting clear  markers

within  which  the GLCs should operate henceforth.   EISC

has  adequately  addressed the concern  of  crowding  out

private  enterprise by the over dominance of  GLCs.   The

private  sector will be relieved to note  that  EISC  has

stated  that  the Government no longer needs  to  take  a

hands on approach and should encourage private sector  to

be in the forefront of developing new business ideas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, several Members of the House have spoken with

passion  on  the considerable public unease and  concerns

over  GLCs.  Whilst some of these concerns are  based  on

facts  and  some  on perceptions, but  whether  facts  or

perceptions,  they  are  real  issues  with  the  private

sector,  as we have earlier heard from Ms Lum.  The  EISC

Report, if adopted by the Government, will certainly help

to  allay  the major concerns of the private sector.   It

will give a lot of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>



comfort  to the private sector to know that they  do  not

have to compete head on with GLCs in the domestic market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generic competition law to be introduced and an

independent Fair Competition Authority to be  set  up  by

the Government will go one step further to ensure a level

playing field and fair competition.  However, I think  we

must  all be aware, as businesses are aware, that a level

playing  field does not mean protection from  competition

-   domestic, foreign or from GLCs.  When there is  money

to  be  made, the Starbucks, the Ikeas, the 7-Elevens  of

the world will come in and compete against our home-grown

coffee  clubs,  furniture and provision shops  for  their

market  share.   The competition, whether  from  GLCs  or

others,  will  be  keen, and if our  private  enterprises

cannot stand up to this competition, they will perish.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, notwithstanding competition from

GLCs  and  overseas  investors, our  private  sector  has

proven  its  resilience  and  ability  to  stand  up   to

competition.  Today, the SMEs are providing  70%  of  the

jobs for our workforce.  The challenge for our Government

is  to  support  the  private sector  and  encourage  the

entrepreneurial spirit to flourish, so that  the  private

sector will continue to be the pillar of our economy  and

will succeed in their efforts to expand overseas.

At  the  end of May, Temasek's top seven listed companies

accounted  for  21%  or  $72  billion  of  the  Singapore

Exchange market capitalisation of $342 billion.  The  top

<br><br>22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GLCs, as we have heard several times, contributed 13%

to  Singapore's GDP in 1998.  Despite the many misgivings

over  GLCs,  I would like to see the GLCs as one  of  our

important  assets,  and  a very powerful  tool  that  the

Government  has, and can use and must use to  expand  our

external economy.  The Hai'er group in China that Ms  Lum

just mentioned is one of the state-owned enterprises that

has been privatised.  They are not only successful in the

Chinese market itself but they have since expanded  their

manufacturing base to America.  Sir, I think there

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>



are  many of these examples around, and our GLCs  can  be

the Hai'er of Singapore as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skills, core competency and financial muscle matter

most  in venturing overseas successfully.  It is a  tough

world  out  there,  and for those of  us  who  have  been

overseas,  we  all  know that there is  really  no  level

playing  field.   It is true that GLCs  have  their  fair

share  of failures expanding overseas in the past.  There

are  lessons learnt, and it is part of business.   If  we

expect  our  GLCs  to  be  the driver  for  our  external

economy,  we  must also expect a fair share  of  failures

from   them.    For   GLCs  to  successfully   lead   our

international  expansion, they also must  have  the  same

entrepreneurship  spirit and the ability  to  take  risk,

which means, to accept some failures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the publication of the EISC report, Temasek

Holdings has responded with a new Temasek Charter.   Some

have felt that this new charter may not fully reflect the

recommendations of the EISC.  In particular, it is silent

on  divestment of non-strategic business.  I am sure that

if  the  Government  accepts this report,  and  I  am  an

optimist,   it   would  then  become   the   Government's

responsibility  to  ensure  the  compliance  of  GLCs  to

operate within its new role.  I am also sure that Members

of  this House will make effective monitoring of the work

of  GLCs  and  also  of its divestment  of  non-strategic

business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, hon. Members have commented that there is a

need  for greater transparency for GLCs.  I believe  that

GLCs  do have a corporate image problem, as they seem  to

ring-fence  themselves.  I think perhaps it  would  help,

especially  for  listed  GLCs, to become  good  corporate

citizens,  to  be  more  involved  with  community,   for

example,  to  actively support sports, arts and  culture.

Maybe  it  is  a  good start with football or  badminton.

Senior  executives of GLCs can also follow the  footsteps

of  those in the private sector and become volunteers  in

community service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in January this year, as Chairman of Network

China,  I  led a business delegation to Beijing,  Qingdao

and Jinan to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>



explore   business  opportunities  arising  from  Beijing

hosting the 2008 Olympic Games.  The delegation consisted

of  72  companies, 100 businessmen and women  and  senior

executives  from both the private sector and  GLCs,  with

staff  support from IE Singapore.  Some of the  companies

went  belong  to  the ST Group.  Some of those  from  the

private  sector  were  BreadTalk,  Hyflux.   There   were

engineers,  there  were  construction  firms.   We   were

introduced  to  many  projects  and  potential,  eg,   in

infrastructure,  transport,  communication,   environment

protection.  While there are plenty of opportunities, the

delegation  also  found  that  many  of  these  potential

projects  require a huge capital investment or capability

and  skills  beyond that of a single company.   Delegates

themselves and, in some cases, with encouragement from IE

Singapore,   form  partnership  and  pool  resources   to

compete.   This  is  indeed a good example  of  GLCs  and

private  sector  companies  working  together,  with   IE

Singapore acting as a catalyst.  When I see them  working

together, I do not really see a great divide between  the

GLCs   and  the  private  sector.   I  see  a  group   of

Singaporeans   working  together,  sharing   the   common

objective of fighting for business opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that these companies continue to

network and work quite closely together, even after their

return to Singapore.  Sir, the culture of partnership  as

envisaged by EISC is important to Singapore companies  if

they wish to compete successfully overseas.  I agree with

EISC that IE Singapore and SPRING have important roles to

play to identify and catalyse the development of specific

industry classes for our international expansion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Motion.

<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,

thank  you for allowing me to participate in the  debate.

I  have  been  sitting  here in my corner  in  Parliament

listening to the debate as it goes along.  And I  am  not

sure that this debate about GLCs versus private sector is

really the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>



correct issue.  The Motion is that, having regard to  the

Temasek  Charter  and  the EISC  report,  the  Government

should  implement the recommendations in the EISC report.

The  way the debate has gone seems to suggest that  there

is some inconsistency between the two.  Frankly, I see no

inconsistency.  The EISC report recommends  that  Temasek

Holdings  scale up their core businesses, not enter  into

unrelated    business,   that    they    should    expand

internationally, explore divestment, attract  world-class

talent  into the GLCs, follow the Yellow Pages rules,  do

not  corporatise  or privatise the regulatory  functions,

conduct   mandatory   periodic  housekeeping,   outsource

Government's  functions  and define  specifications  more

broadly to provide opportunities for SMEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Temasek Charter, as far as I can see, is quite

consistent.   It talks about having Government  ownership

and  control for the critical or strategic businesses  or

areas.   It talks about going international and regional,

when  necessary,  to grow, and it is open  to  partnering

other  companies to regionalise or internationalise,  and

it  also  talks about divestment.  So, I do not  see  any

inconsistency between the two reports.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what is the fuss about GLCs versus private

sector?   As I understand it, the thrust of the arguments

appears  to  be that (1)  Government should  get  out  of

business; (2)  GLCs are squeezing out the local companies

because  they are bigger and have more financial muscles;

(3)   GLCs have more connections, they have the old boys'

network, and all things being equal, contracts will go to

them;  (4)  GLCs are sucking up all the talent;  and  (5)

GLCs  are  inefficient.  Now, when you make  an  argument

like that and you put forward suggestions to remedy these

evils,  you have to have an inherent consistency in  your

argument.  And I have some serious difficulties with  the

arguments that have been put forward in support of  these

arguments.   If you run through this list and you  wonder

why  its  sounds very familiar, that is basically because

it  has a Star War theme about it.  The GLCs are the evil

empire and the private sector is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1007</b></font><br><br>



the  struggling rebels, I suppose, fighting  against  the

evil empire.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just examine a few of these propositions that

have been put forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it was suggested that GLCs are sucking up the

talent.   If  we  did not create GLCs, we  would  have  a

larger pool of entrepreneurs and the rise of GLCs has led

to  the  death of the entrepreneurs and monopoly  of  top

brains  by  the civil service.  But I do not  know  about

you.   I refuse to believe that the only brains here  are

the  civil  service  and  that  the  private  sector   is

completely stupid.  It cannot be because half the time in

Parliament, we are always telling the civil service where

they  have gone wrong.  So it must be that on this  other

side  of  the House and in the private sector, there  are

some  smart  people.   I do not think  that  the  private

sector  should sit down, wring its hands and lament  that

the  other  side  is,  "They so smart."   You  should  be

sitting  down and saying to yourself, "I no stupid."   It

is  over  the question of attitude.  It is a question  of

approach  and  it  is  a question of  how  you  view  the

competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee suggested yesterday that perhaps

we should have more of the Government leaders in business

and  who  knows,  if some of them had gone  into  private

enterprise, where would we be now, he asked.  Perhaps, if

SM  had become a top lawyer, where would we be now?  I am

not  sure about the others, but I can tell you, we  would

not be a sovereign independent state and we would not  be

discussing  PSA  Corporation because it would  be  called

Tanjong Pelepas!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think what we really need is talent across the

board  - in Government, in GLCs, in private sector, SMEs,

wherever it is - but you need talent everywhere.   It  is

not  a  question of challenges being located in a certain

place.   The private sector should have faith  in  itself

and  believed in itself, and we do have a private  sector

that is good and intelligent, and it should not adopt the

attitude  that,  "Oh,  I  can't  compete",  just  because

somebody else has more strength.  Competition is all

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>



about  finding  out  how you can  go  ahead  and  compete

against others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other suggestion that was put forward was that

Government should help by, through existing GLCs,  taking

a  minority  stake in new firms and should sell  off  its

shares once the new business is on track.  I examine this

suggestion  rather carefully.  You want them  to  put  in

money or to take a minority stake, what you are basically

saying  is, we want Government money but you do not  want

them  to have any control.  You do not want them to  have

any  say.   And  you say that they should  sell  off  its

shares  once  the  new business is on  track.   In  other

words, give you the money, and once we are profitable, go

away.   I do not think that is very fair either.   It  is

definitely not the basis on which investors put in  money

through any company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than that, I think we have to realise that if

we  want  the  Government  to put  money  in  through  an

existing GLC and hold shares in the company, you become a

GLC  too, because you become a subsidiary.  So,  it  does

not quite work that way.  You have to go according to the

rules  of  how  business is conducted.  The next  comment

that  was  made was perhaps you should have more  private

sector representatives appointed to the GLC boards.  But,

then,  on  the  other hand, the argument  was  Government

should get out of business.  So I do not understand which

is it.  You want them in business or you want them out of

business.   You want them in business, then,  you  should

allow them to run the companies the way they want to.  If

you  are  saying that you should be appointed to the  GLC

board, that means you want the GLCs around.  What you are

really saying then is you want the GLCs, you want  to  be

on  their  boards,  and you want  part  of  the  old  boy

connection  or  network.  That is really  what  is  being

said.   Again, I have a certain problem with the  logical

consistency of that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, it was suggested that they were inefficient.

Mr  Inderjit Singh said that our GLCs are late  in  going

global  and  the consequences of it can be  seen  in  the

failure to compete successfully and in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>



being   taken   for  a  ride  in  certain  high   profile

acquisition  transactions.  On the other  hand,  we  have

also  heard that all the top talent is going to the GLCs.

So  all  the  top talent is working hard to produce  this

inefficient result, in which case I do not understand why

do we want them in the first place.  It cannot be right.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when you are going and competing, you have to

make  a  distinction  between the local  market  and  the

foreign  market.   When you are competing  in  a  foreign

market,  it  is  not a question anymore of  us  competing

against the GLCs.  It is a question of how all of us  can

compete  against  the foreign companies.   If  the  small

companies  in  Singapore  are  not  able  to  compete  by

themselves,  you cannot complain about the  GLCs  because

they  are  bigger, they have more financial muscles,  and

they are more likely to be able to compete globally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other suggestion made was that they should form

clusters  and bring local businesses along,  which  again

means  you  want the GLCs but you want them to bring  you

along.  And that means that there is a certain amount  of

good that they can bring to the economy.  You see, at the

end of the day, the local market is too small.  The local

market  is  too small for both the GLCs and  the  private

sector  to  be fighting over the limited market  that  we

have  here.  It is not a question of GLCs versus  private

sector.  It is about Singapore Inc versus the rest of the

world,  and it is something that we have to do  together.

There  is  a  role for the GLCs simply because  of  their

connections,  because  of their  financial  muscles,  but

there is also a role for the private sector and the SMEs.

It  is  a question of how each one can find its place  in

the  international market and make our  mark  regionally,

because the local market is just too small.  This is  not

to  say,  of course, that I do not have issues  with  the

EISC  Report.  What I am saying is that, as  far  as  the

Temasek  Charter and the EISC Report are concerned,  they

define a role for the GLCs and the way business should be

done in Singapore, and I heartily endorse that.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one thing that I did notice about the EISC

Report  which was not highlighted was the issue of  cost.

A  lot  of Singapore companies have complained that  they

have  difficulty in competing because of cost.   Some  of

the costs are necessary.  But I think that it is possible

for  the Government and Ministries to review their  rules

and  regulations to see how we can cut down the  cost  of

doing business in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two examples. One is the recent PTC regulations for

private bus operators.  When I looked at the news release

from the PTC, they said that SBS and TIBS have a duopoly.

They  felt that there should be more competition  in  bus

services.  And they said that, in introducing competition

to   feeder   services,  certain  principles  should   be

observed.   First, the new operator and incumbent  should

compete   on   equal  footing;   second,  the  regulatory

framework  would not be as tight, and, third, their  role

will  be one guarding against anti-competitive behaviour.

But,  of  course,  what  they do in  the  new  rules  and

regulations  is  that  they  stipulate  certain   minimum

standards  for the private bus operators, and,  that  is,

the  entrances and exits must have a minimum of 1.2 m and

installed  with safety device, and the first step  height

must be not more than 36 cm from the ground, whereas  for

most  private  buses, the first step is 42  cm  from  the

ground.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you make regulations like this, you immediately

make them uncompetitive.  Because in order to comply with

your  regulations,  they are going to  have  to  buy  new

buses,  or adapt the existing ones, which is not  such  a

good idea.  As I understand it, the ones that satisfy the

rules are the continental ones, such as the Volvos, which

cost  about $250,000, which are about $50,000 or $100,000

more than the Japanese models which are currently used.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are making a rule and you say that you want

somebody  to  be competitive, yet you make  a  rule  that

immediately makes them uncompetitive because they have to

buy these buses, what do you think will happen to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1011</b></font><br><br>



fares?   They have to pass the cost on to somewhere.   So

that is the first example.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second example is the SBF charges. I had asked

the  Minister previously what was the reason  for  making

such  charges  mandatory.  The answer  was  that  it  was

SFCCI's  recommendation as there was an earlier  practice

of  voluntary  membership and it had not been  effective,

and compulsory membership would ensure that the SBF had a

strong  membership  base and the mandate  of  the  entire

business community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read the Today paper on 22nd August 2002 which

said that about 8,000 business units had paid, but 16,600

businesses  are delaying payment and a few thousands  are

appealing  for  their fees to be waived.  That  does  not

look  like a mandate to me.  It looks an awful  lot  like

opposition.  That is because you are just adding cost  on

to  doing  business.   If you use  the  $500,000  paid-up

capital   criterion,  it  is  like  a  blunt  instrument.

Because  in  many  companies  which  do  not  do   active

business, like investment holding companies, they have to

pay.   I  imagine that the GLCs have to pay as well,  but

they  do not need the SBF.  So it is cost like that which

we  are  layering  on  and  we are  making  the  business

community  bear this cost and, at the same  time,  saying

that they have to be more competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Government and Ministries to review

their  rules  and regulations to see how  they  can  make

businesses  more competitive, in terms of cost.   And  at

the  end  of the day, it is not about GLCs versus private

sector.  It is about how we, Singapore as a whole, can go

out and get more of the  international pie.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> I want to

clarify  a point made by Ms Indranee.  I did not  suggest

that SM should become a top-notch lawyer.  I said that he

would  be, if he did.  In fact, he would give very  stiff

competition  to other lawyers, if he did.   Everybody  is

glad that SM had decided to become a political leader  to

lead Singapore to become what it is today.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I have the benefit of working in the  civil

service in the early years of my career.  And now,  I  am

working in a private sector company which was once upon a

time  a  GLC,  until  late 1980s, when  Temasek  divested

NatSteel.   Temasek's stake in NatSteel now is less  than

10%.   Therefore, I have the benefit of  looking  at  the

issues  from  many different angles, from the Government,

from  the  GLC's  point of view, and non-GLC's  point  of

view, as well as the process of the transition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of Government's direct involvement in

business  has  been a regular topic for  debate  in  this

House.  The question has been focused around whether  the

Government  should  play an active  role  in  owning  and

operating  businesses, or should it stay out of  business

and  focus instead on macro economic policies.  Many have

argued that the Government's presence, through the  GLCs,

may  have  an adverse impact on the ability of the  local

small and medium enterprises to develop and mature.   The

sheer  size of the GLCs meant greater economies of  scale

and  this  coupled  with the availability  of  Government

funding  may  have given them an advantage  in  competing

with  the SMEs which have to be run commercially and with

limited  resources.  Many even suggested  that  the  GLCs

have  scooped up whatever talent that was left after  the

Government  has  taken the first bite.  After  all,  they

take  up  a  big chunk of the capital market in Singapore

and contribute significantly to our GDP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must take a balanced view. We must first

recognise that Singapore's economy is somewhat unique  in

many aspects.  We do not have a huge domestic market.  We

do  not  have a large pool of talents.  There  is  little

room for error when it comes to economic development  and

industrialisation programmes.  In this respect, the  GLCs

have  played a pivotal role in spearheading our  economic

progress in the past.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the recent economic slowdown has put

additional pressure on our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>



SMEs and this has once again rekindled the debate on  the

role  of  GLCs.  It is therefore timely for the  EISC  to

release  its findings and recommendations on the role  of

GLCs.   Its report serves not only to remove some of  the

scepticism  and reservation people may have on  GLCs  but

also  as a guide post for Government's future involvement

in business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to share my views on three

specific  aspects in the report.  Firstly, I support  the

Committee's  recommendation that GLCs should  aim  to  be

international  players.  They must play  a  key  role  in

developing our economy's external wing.  I am not  saying

that  private  enterprises cannot become global  players.

In fact, there are many examples.  Creative Technology is

just one of them.  But given the size of GLCs, as well as

their  financial and management resources, they are  well

positioned to compete internationally and have  a  better

chance of eventually becoming global players.  We do have

some  success stories.  Singapore Airlines, for  example,

is  not  only a global player but a global leader in  the

airline  industry.  SingTel and DBS Bank,  on  the  other

hand,  are fast becoming regional players and, hopefully,

in  time  to  come, they too will attain the same  global

standing as SIA in their respective business sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important for us to develop our external wing

quickly.   As technology advances, the world is  becoming

smaller and more competitive.  Geographical distances and

national  boundaries  are no longer  effective  barriers.

Soon,   we   will   not  be  competing   with   immediate

neighbouring countries any more but, instead, all  of  us

will  be  competing against emerging economies,  such  as

China and India.  If we do not develop our external  wing

quickly,  we  may  miss  the  opportunities  that   these

fundamental shifts in world economies offer us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing an external wing will not only give us

access to global business opportunities but may also help

us in attracting foreign talents.  For example, I am sure

that, with SIA's international

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>



standing, it would have no problem attracting the world's

best  talents in the airline industry to work  for  them.

Even  if  they are not physically resident in  Singapore,

their  expertise  will be available  to  us  through  our

global  network.  Instead of directly recruiting  foreign

talents,  GLCs  can  consider partnering  global  players

through  mergers  and acquisitions, or through  strategic

partnership,  and  as  a  result bring  their  management

talents within its group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the urgency of developing an external wing for

Singapore,  we must impress upon the GLCs their  role  in

this respect and that they must set their sight on global

business in the long term.  In fact, I would like to urge

each  GLC  to  go beyond mere mission statements  and  to

formulate  a  clear  road-map  and  broad  timetable   to

transform  itself into global players over the next  5-10

years.   Granted that some of these things cannot  happen

overnight  and the timing may not be within our  control,

it  is  still  important to set our major  milestones  to

demonstrate our intent and commitment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I think GLCs must share in the

responsibility  of  helping the local  small  and  medium

enterprises.  I am glad the Committee has recommended the

encouragement  of  a culture of partnership  among  GLCs,

MNCs  and  SMEs.  However, I feel that GLCs must  go  one

step  further and go beyond mere partnership.  Given  its

dominant  position in our economy, they should adopt  the

leadership  role  by  showing the way  for  our  SMEs  to

upgrade  and transform themselves to remain relevant  and

competitive.   Furthermore, I would  urge  them  to  also

consider providing direct assistance to SMEs, whether  be

it  in  the  form of financial investment,  technological

know-how,   management  expertise,  or   otherwise.    In

particular, as they venture overseas, SMEs would  need  a

lot  of  hand holding in unfamiliar environment which  is

often  hostile.   GLCs  which  have  made  inroads   into

overseas markets will be in a good position to help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main concerns of the local SMEs is that

GLCs  tend  to  inadvertently squeeze them out  by  their

sheer size

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>



and might.  Such concerns may well be a perception issue.

It  will surely help to correct this adversarial approach

if GLCs can go the extra mile in helping SMEs, especially

those  which  have  the potential  of  becoming  a  major

international player one day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GLCs need not look upon this as national

service.   The  truth  is that many  of  these  SMEs  are

suppliers  or  contractors  of  GLCs.   It  is   in   the

commercial  interest  of GLCs to ensure  that  they  have

strong and competitive suppliers and contractors that can

support  them  in  their effort to globalise.   They  are

strategic  partners  and they are  interdependent.   They

will   play  a  crucial  role  in  the  GLCs'  successful

transformation into global players.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, while GLCs go through its restructuring and

repositioning  process,  they  must  do  so   cautiously.

Success  or failure of a good plan often depends  on  its

process.   While it may be inevitable that some  GLCs  or

their  subsidiaries need to be divested or, in the  worst

case, liquidated, the decision must take into account not

only  economic  factors, but also several other  factors,

including  its repercussion on the supporting  industries

that  may  depend  on it to survive, especially  in  this

difficult period.  Some of the restructuring process  may

also   entail   retrenchment  leading  to   even   higher

unemployment  rate.  Therefore, while  the  restructuring

process  is  necessary, the GLCs must manage the  process

carefully  to  minimise disruption.  This  is  especially

sensitive at this time when unemployment is still high.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important for GLCs to communicate the

process  carefully  to  the stakeholders,  not  just  the

shareholders, but also the employees, customers  as  well

as  suppliers, and use their best efforts  to  help  them

adjust  to  the  changes.  In this way, it will  minimise

misunderstanding and ill feelings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the recommendations of the EISC

have  been  very  comprehensive  and  I  must  take  this

opportunity  to congratulate the Minister  of  State,  Mr

Raymond Lim, for the Report.  Assuming

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>



that  the  Government  adopts  the  main  recommendations

perhaps after some refinements, I would like to urge  the

Government to implement them as soon as possible  and  to

take  great care in communicating to the affected parties

to minimise any adverse effect that may negate our effort

to restructure our GLCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I support the Motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

thank  you for giving me this opportunity to join in  the

debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the key point of our debate is whether the

Government should be involved in business, especially  in

areas  of  business where the private sector  is  already

capable  of  providing those services.  If  that  is  the

focus  of our debate, then I am utterly puzzled why  NTUC

cooperatives were brought into the discussion.   This  is

because   NTUC  cooperatives  are  not  Government-linked

companies.   The  NTUC  cooperatives  are  not  owned  or

managed by the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, this erroneous perception may have arisen

from  the  fact  that some NTUC leaders are  MPs  of  the

ruling  Party.  But if we go on this basis, then we  also

have  the  ruling Party MPs in this House  who  work  for

large  companies and business groups in various  sectors.

Surely,  we  will  consider  it  absurd  to  call   their

companies Government-linked.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel strongly that parliamentary debate must

be  based on correct facts.  Only then can we have proper

and  useful  debate.  If we know that a particular  view,

even if it is one that is widely held in the public mind,

is  an  erroneous one, then we must seek  to  correct  it

rather   than   to  repeat  it  and   to   add   to   the

misunderstanding.  Leadership is not about running  ahead

of the mob.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that NTUC cooperatives are not GLCs, then I

would  suppose that their inclusion for mention  in  this

debate  must be because of a perception that they can  be

big,  or  that  there are NTUC cooperatives in  different

areas, or that NTUC

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>



cooperatives may have unfair means of edging out  smaller

competitors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take each argument in turn. If we say that

the  problem with NTUC cooperatives is that some of  them

are big - as if bigness is itself a sin - then we have to

broaden  that to include all big players in all  economic

sectors.   For example, our property sector is  dominated

by  a small number of big players, TLC and private sector

alike.  So, what are we going to do to level that playing

field for the smaller developers?  But that discussion is

for  another time, because the Motion today is not  about

curtailing potential excesses by big business but on  the

role of GLCs in the Singapore economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, perhaps, the misgiving about NTUC cooperatives

is  that  they  are  present in  a  number  of  different

sectors.   We  make  no apology for  this,  because  NTUC

cooperatives  are set up in areas where  the  common  man

needs value-for-money services for everyday living.   And

wherever  NTUC  cooperatives are present, they  have  the

effect of moderating prices and improving quality through

providing benchmarking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By our sincerity and hard work, we have earned the

trust  and  patronage of our members and customers.   Our

cooperatives compete for the support and business of  our

customers  every business day, against strong competition

from  both  local and foreign players.  Our  members  and

customers know that NTUC and NTUC cooperatives care, that

we  do not take them for granted and that we are not some

cold,  opportunistic, profit-crazy outfit out to  squeeze

the  last dollar out of them.  As Mdm Halimah Yacob  said

yesterday,   for  several  years  now,  we  measure   the

performance  of  NTUC cooperatives by  a  set  of  social

indicators.  And the NTUC publishes this report card each

year.    Our  cooperatives  also  publish  their   social

indicators  in  their annual reports, and table  them  at

their annual general meetings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have seen the excesses of the free market,

in the wake of globalisation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>



It  is  not  just the Enrons or the barons of bankruptcy.

We  are seeing banks in free-market economies not wanting

to provide services to the low income, or those living in

small  villages in developed countries.  We see  tens  of

millions  not covered by medical insurance,  when  it  is

left  to  the  private sector.  In the drive to  maximise

shareholder   value,  millions  of  workers   have   been

retrenched around the world.  This has evoked a response,

a  backlash.  Workers are disenchanted.  Unions and  NGOs

campaign against globalisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should be our response? I believe we should

adopt the free market and embrace globalisation.  But  we

would   have  to  instill  a  greater  sense  of   social

responsibility.  How?  By encouraging the  small  men  to

fight  back  and compete well.  This they can do  through

cooperatives.    And  cooperatives   can   act   as   the

counterweight against unbridled greed.  This then is  the

big  difference  between  our cooperatives  and  private-sector  business.  Private-sector companies  are  profit-driven,   to   return   the  highest   value   to   their

shareholders.   This is their mission.  Our  cooperatives

are  driven by the goal of providing the best  value  for

the  customer.  That is our mission.  We do well in order

to do good.  Today, this role is growing in importance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent survey, 74% of Singaporeans surveyed

were  very satisfied with the role that NTUC cooperatives

play  to  moderate the cost of living  for  them.   These

Singaporeans  and  households  will  want  to  know   the

rationale  behind any proposal that seeks  to  deny  them

these  savings and the convenience that they enjoy.   So,

unless moderating prices and creating value for money for

the  common man is something objectionable, then I cannot

understand what the problem is.  In any case, if  we  say

NTUC  cooperatives are in different sectors, we must also

note  that it is not uncommon for business groups to have

businesses in different sectors.  For example, if we look

at   property  developers  again,  they  may  also   have

subsidiaries  that provide for finance, maybe  even  make

drinks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final possibility may be that there is a

perception that NTUC cooperatives

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>



have  special  privileges that guarantee them  choice  of

location  or other perks.  But the fact is that all  NTUC

cooperatives  have to compete for all the  business  that

they  get  and  all the business locations that  they  do

business in, just like all their competitors.  And,  just

as they have been successful in some bids, they have also

lost  other bids.  NTUC FairPrice, for example, lost  the

bid  for store space at Changi Airport's Terminal 2 to  a

competitor  during a recent re-tender exercise.   It  was

outbid.   The  lessons  are, firstly,  that  neither  the

Government  -  in this case, the CAAS - nor any  private-sector  property owner can be expected or will  give  any

special   consideration   to  NTUC   cooperatives;   and,

secondly,  that what replaces a NTUC FairPrice  store  is

not  going to be the mom-and-pop shop, but another retail

chain,  most possibly a foreign-owned one.   So,  let  us

face facts and not delude ourselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Members who spoke want to develop local

enterprise.   I share that same sentiment.   But  I  must

point  out  that NTUC cooperatives or - as  some  Members

have called them - NLCs, they are local enterprises,  and

they are successful local enterprises.  So, why do we not

support  them?  Some Members have bemoaned  the  lack  of

capital  for  local  enterprises.   Perhaps,  our   local

enterprises  can  look  at the  experience  of  the  NTUC

cooperatives and see how they have raised their  capital.

Let  me give some examples.  The early cooperatives faced

much   more  difficulties  than  SMEs  today  in  finding

capital.  So, union leaders aggregated the funds the hard

way  - persuading workers, one worker at a time, who have

very  low  incomes - to buy shares in these cooperatives.

That  was  how NTUC Welcome, the predecessor  of  today's

NTUC FairPrice, started.  Today, FairPrice is a household

name  in  Singapore, and perhaps it  is  the  only  local

supermarket chain that can withstand and compete  against

foreign  supermarket retailers.  NTUC Income was  started

the  same  way, collecting a few dollars from each  union

member.  So, too, NTUC Comfort, which is now divested and

listed on the stock exchange as the Comfort Group.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have called on NTUC cooperatives to

help  small businessmen.  And they have.  As Mdm  Halimah

Yacob  explained,  Denticare is indeed a  cooperative  of

dentists.   They  share  the  revenues.   NTUC   Foodfare

operates  food courts, but the people who run the  stalls

are  the  hawkers themselves, who rent the  space.   NTUC

Income  uses  its  website to provide a matching  service

between  handymen  and  homeowners,  between  tutors  and

school  children.  NTUC FairPrice, NTUC Healthcare,  NTUC

Childcare cooperatives operate franchise schemes in order

to share opportunities with the business community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the crux of today's debate is

about  fair  competition and how to  better  promote  it.

This is important.  This must be our focus, and we should

keep our focus.  Listening to some speakers, one may  get

the impression that behind the phalanx of accusations lie

local  businesses  scared of public-sector  GLCs  because

they  are  big,  angry with competition  in  the  private

sector  because they are big, and then suspicious of  one

another, not quite wanting to work together, just in case

the  other  one might grab the secret formula and  become

big.    This will not do us any good.  Singapore - if  we

look  at  our natural endowments - is indeed a SME  among

nations.  And we have no one to complain to.  But we  got

to where we are today not because the international stage

is a model of fair play, not because the big boys imposed

a  moratorium  on themselves to give us  a  leg  up,  but

because we as a country took the hard decisions -  and  I

would say some rather unconventional ones relative to the

received wisdom of their time - and worked hard to  build

the necessary capabilities, capacities and attractiveness

in order to compete well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the NTUC cooperatives, how did they

get  to do well?  By following the advice of Dr Goh  Keng

Swee, ie, employ good professional managers.  There is no

reason  why  our SMEs cannot follow that same  formula  - pool  resources  and employ professional managers.   That

was  very  good advice that local SMEs pooling  resources

can note.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that this debate can help focus

Singaporeans'  attention on what is fundamental,  namely,

on  how to help SMEs strengthen their leadership, vision,

competitiveness and resourcefulness, rather than  confuse

the  debate with red herring.  Life is not about avoiding

competition  or  defining away the competition.   And  to

reinforce any such tendency would indeed be the  ultimate

disservice to our SMEs and to all Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join  in  this

debate.   First  of  all,  I would  like  to  declare  my

interest  as a Director of the Energy Market  Company,  a

subsidiary of the Energy Market Authority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GLCs have provided much needed jobs and

supported  economic  growth during  the  early  years  of

Singapore's independence.  With a growing private  sector

today,  we  must now address the role of both  these  two

groups  of companies.  Much has been said about the  pros

and cons of GLCs during these two days of debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, allow me to make some

comments  on  a few of these points. The Entrepreneurship

and  Internationalisation Sub-Committee (EISC)  has  made

some  recommendations to the Government to  help  promote

private

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>



enterprises.  While this would be good for  Singapore  as

businesses  driven  by the private  sector  will  have  a

better  chance  of  meeting their challenges  in  today's

rapidly  changing environment, there is  still  room  for

GLCs and SMEs to co-exist.  I believe together, they will

be able to adapt to the different sectors of the economy,

thus  responding better and faster to market  changes  as

demands  from consumers would increasingly be a  constant

factor and businesses would have to cope with such short-lived  demands.  The constant factor will not be a factor

which  will be long-lived.  Some examples of short shelf-life   are  electronic  products  such  as   televisions,

cameras and some household products.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cultivating and strengthening the private sector are

critical  to the proposed restructuring efforts unleashed

by  the Government.  The success of Singapore economy to-date has been based on a pro-investment and export-growth

model.  A high level of savings has allowed such a policy

to  reap results.  It is based on the belief that  saving

is  the factor to wealth creation and that savers are the

impetus to wealth creation and the nation.  While  it  is

good to hold these values, we must however recognise that

today,  challenges are different.  It is the  risk-takers

and not savers who spawn wealth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Government to actively promote private

sector  initiatives  in  the  production  of  goods   and

services that are competitively healthy and can  be  done

effectively  by private enterprises.  It should  minimise

undue  influence of GLCs and big foreign players in  such

markets where the growing local companies will not  stand

a  chance  of  competing, for example,  in  the  building

construction industry.  That way, local companies get  to

grow,  be  stable  and  be able to provide  jobs  to  the

people.   The  Government may even wish to even  consider

providing  seed money and tax incentives to  the  private

sector to encourage the birth of new businesses that  may

require a long gestation period before profits are  seen,

as  in life sciences. I urge the Government to also  look

into  strategies  to sustain local businesses.   I  would

suggest a review of the cost of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>



doing  business by the private sector and, if  necessary,

for all of us to change our mindset.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many corporations face great difficulties in coping

with  hostile business conditions.  One major  factor  is

the rigidity of the local wage system.  Wage cost forms a

major  challenge of the total cost of a corporation.   If

we are able to allow corporations more leeway in shedding

costs,  we  will  end  up with a more  efficient  private

sector  that  will  be able to react  to  hostile  market

conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking beyond, local companies can and must be

encouraged  to  become multi-national  corporations.   As

world  globalisation takes off, small countries  will  be

able to ride on this wave to overcome the disadvantage of

its  limited domestic market.  Singapore is no different.

Local companies, which by nature are more entrepreneurial

in  character, may not necessarily follow the traditional

multi-national  structure, with a corporate  headquarters

in  Singapore controlling subsidiaries around the  world.

These companies have a network character that allows them

to  take advantage of the new opportunities presented  by

the  inter-linkages of the global economy.  Our corporate

governance   guidelines  may  not  also  necessarily   be

applicable.   For  example, with a  minimum  of  internal

bureaucratic  machinery, Acer, which started  out  as  an

assembler of IBM equipment, quickly moved to selling  its

own  computers.  It has been able to move quickly to take

advantage of opportunities.  This company's understanding

of local demands and developing markets overseas are good

because  of  their  network with locals  in  the  foreign

lands.   This example also suggests that it  may  not  be

advantageous  to  partner  a larger  GLC  when  venturing

overseas  as  the company culture to be adopted  may  not

suit  the GLCs.  The cluster approach, as recommended  by

the  EISC,  whereby GLCs, MNCs and SMEs together  venture

overseas  may not be a good idea where market  conditions

are volatile.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to efforts to nurture and strengthen

local companies, I feel that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>



levelling  the  playing field between the  GLCs  and  the

private sector is as important.  On the one hand,  as  we

spend  efforts to nurture new local businesses,  we  must

not  put  obstacles in its path that  will  lead  to  its

ultimate  demise.   I urge the Government  to  allow  the

private  sectors space in the local market  to  grow  and

excel.   Government policies on land and labour  must  be

cost-effective and should apply to GLCs as well.   For  a

start,  Government  agencies controlling  such  important

factors  contributing  to  the  success  or  failure   of

business  must  be  conscious of  not  pushing  up  costs

through  their  pricing policies.  Instead,  they  should

seek  only to service the public with a minimum  of  fees

necessary  to  cover  their  services.   It  is   equally

important  that GLCs should concentrate on  the  external

wings  of our economy and not be perceived by the  people

as  the big fish out to gobble up the market share or  to

take over the smaller fishes on their home turf.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, please allow me to highlight

the success of GLCs extending its external wings to build

global businesses. Keppel FELS, Energy and Infrastructure

is  a  world  leader in the building of harsh environment

jack-up  rigs.   It  designs,  builds  and  repairs   the

complete   range  of  mobile  offshore  drilling   units,

floating production systems and specialised vessels.   In

1996,  it  has  60%  of the world's  jack-ups  on  order.

Another example is SembCorp Logistics which has formed  a

strategic  alliance with Kuehne and  Nagel,  one  of  the

leading global freight forwarding and logistics providers

with  offices in 85 countries.  The success of these  two

companies  only serves to highlight the salient advantage

of  competing in the international arena.  It raises  the

overall value-added to the industry concerned and acts as

a  catalyst  to  other related trades and services.   The

Government  should, while seeking to remain in businesses

that are strategic to the country, such as the supply  of

water,   electricity,   banking,   aviation   and   other

facilities  and  services that are  low  in  competition,

continue to improve the performance of the GLC sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their business decisions, including acquisition or

divesting businesses,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>



should  be based on increasing the shareholder value  and

return  on assets.  But where economies of scale of  non-strategic  businesses can be harvested and  given  to  an

external service provider, GLCs should readily do  so  to

nurture the local sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, we need to enhance the value of our

private sector businesses by keeping them trim, efficient

and  focused  so that they can maintain their competitive

edge.   These  measures  are  necessary  antibodies   for

Singapore  to build up and have an immunity  against  the

ever  changing global economic conditions.  GLCs  have  a

national  role to play in building a robust  economy  for

Singapore.   And  since Star Wars was  mentioned,  may  I

borrow a phrase from it  -  may the force be with you?

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, I rise in general

support  of  the Motion.  I think there  are  a  few  key

elements  of  the  Motion  and  the  debate  which   have

particular   resonance  for  me.   First,    Government's

involvement  in  business ought  to  be  circumspect  and

carefully calibrated.  This is the recommendation of  the

EISC,  and  it is really difficult to have any  issue  or

quarrel  with  that.   It is a sound principle  to  guide

Government's decision-making going forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is supporting the growth of private

enterprise and entrepreneurship in Singapore.   Again,  I

think this would have little problems finding support  in

this House or elsewhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third element is, of course, greater symbiosis

between  big and small companies, whether they are  GLCs,

MNCs  and so on, on the one hand, and SMEs on the  other.

Ultimately,  all these principles are important  elements

in   guiding  the  way  Singapore  remakes  its  economy,

restructures  itself,  in order to  face  the  challenges

ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the course of the debate, the issues

that  struck  me the most was that I thought  there  were

some broad guiding principles that we ought to use,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>



not  just in the way we present ideas but in the  way  we

analyse them.  Allow me to illustrate that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is that we ought to be quite discerning in

the way we categorise the various entities we have in our

enterprise ecosystem.  We have used the term "GLCs" as  a

kind  of  catch-all,  and we have  put  in  there  labour

cooperatives,  the private companies under  the  care  of

Government,  the  listed  companies  under  the  care  of

Government,  etc,  etc.   Many speakers  before  me  have

pointed  out  the special nature of labour  cooperatives.

In  general,   the  DNA of all these  companies  is  very

different.   If  we compare a labour cooperative  with  a

private   or listed company, say, under Temasek  Holdings

-   and  here I must declare my interest because I am  an

employee  of Temasek Holdings  -  we will find  that  the

mission  and objectives vary.  Therefore, the  strategies

will  differ.   And  even  the  stakeholder  groups   are

different for each of these categories.  So we must guard

against  adopting a very generic broad brush approach  in

talking about these companies, because each faces its own

constraints and its own set of circumstances in  pursuing

its ultimate objectives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to make is that we

ought   to   guard  against  being  too  theological   or

doctrinaire  in  our approach to issues  of  business  or

management.   Markets and analysts are  always  given  to

fads.  If we just think back to a few years ago, dot-coms

were in.  All companies were being told either you "e" or

you would be eaten.  And now things are very different.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we also look at it from the angle of business

theory, there have been ebbs and flows.  And in a  sense,

we  can argue that unless there are these ebbs and flows,

management  gurus and business schools  will  be  out  of

work.   In  the history of companies, for example,  there

has  been  a  discussion  about whether  decision  making

should be centralised or decentralised, and the accordion

has  moved  in and out quite a few times.  And there  are

other examples like that in the area of business.  So the

key point here is that we ought to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>



keep our eye on the ball and take a pragmatic approach in

dealing with the issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the example of business models. Some of

our  Members talked with some disdain about the model  of

conglomerates.  It is true that in the 70s and  80s  when

businesses  in  the  US,  for  example,  were   expanding

horizontally and vertically, they were straying  quite  a

bit,  and becoming large, unwieldy conglomerates.   Then,

in the 90s, there was a move back to core competence, and

there  was  a stress on core competence.  If  I  want  to

summarise  the  point, it would be this way.   There  are

conglomerates  though  that remain extremely  successful.

General  Electric  is a good example,  one  of  the  most

admired  companies  in the US, but it  has  18  different

business groups.  There are also companies which have got

a  single focus, which also do very well.  Coca Cola is a

good example of that.   And we also have good examples of

companies,  both  conglomerates and single  focus,  which

have  failed.   Global Crossing is a good  example  of  a

single focus business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point is that we cannot be influenced by

just  general  trends and fads.  I think  the  underlying

value of a company is determined by many factors  -   its

corporate  culture and values, its strategy,  the  people

and, ultimately, the execution of the business.  There is

no  such thing as one size fits all.  And in this  House,

when we are discussing these issues, let us bear that  in

mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question that has been debated quite a bit

in  this  House is: should a company diversify  into  new

businesses?  Particularly, let us talk about  the  listed

companies.   In general, I think we would all agree  that

we  want companies to stick to their knitting.  You  know

the   business,  you  know  the  customers,  the  various

channels, and so your core competence lies in that  area.

And  I  think that is a very important guiding principle.

But citing old and hackneyed examples like roast duck,  I

think is a decoy.  Because we are highlighting an obvious

outlier and dodging the core question, which is whether a

company can diversify into new

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>



businesses successfully, leveraging on skills and  assets

it  has built up in perhaps other business areas.  And  I

think  this is worth thinking about.  I am not suggesting

that the company should stray and pepper its resources in

many  different  directions.  But  there  are  some  good

examples  of companies that have, over time, evolved  and

developed  some new areas, and we do not have to  go  too

far away to find out.  For example, look at CDL.  CDL  is

a listed company in Singapore.  Its primary core business

is  properties.   But  over time,  it  has  developed  an

excellent hotel business under the Millennium & Copthorne

label.   By  all  accounts,  it  is  attributed  to   the

entrepreneurial flair of Mr Kwek Leng Beng.  The question

to  ask  is:  do we want to encourage that or  discourage

that?   Is  that  good  or is that bad?   So,  again,  in

talking  about diversifying businesses, we need  to  have

some  level of measurement and not put all the  companies

that do so in the same basket.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point about size has been raised, and I

want  to make a few comments on that.  In my view,  there

are  really two inexorable forces that are compelling the

issue  of  size   -   globalisation,  which  is  reducing

barriers for the flow of goods and services, and  people,

to  a  large  extent, across countries.   The  second  is

technology.   Both  of  these  are  enablers.   They  are

enabling   companies  to  access  new   markets,   across

geographical barriers and to get into new areas.  But, at

the same time, both of these pose immense new challenges,

because  what  it  means now is that  companies  have  to

invest  quite  a lot in technology in building  up  their

infrastructure  to  deal  with  global  challenges,   and

therefore  they need the economies of scale in  order  to

achieve reasonable returns on their outlay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How big are our companies really? In Japan, an SME

would have a turnover that is in billions of not Yens but

US  dollars.  That is an SME in Japan.  And comparing our

GLCs  or  TLCs  to  local SMEs is  a  convenient  way  of

invoking  the David and Goliath imagery.  But  I  am  not

sure  it is actually a fair representation of the  facts.

Talking  about 21% of the market capitalisation  in  SGX,

yes, but let us look at the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>



broader   picture.   If  we  take  SingTel,  its   market

capitalisation is US$16 billion.  This is based  on  last

week's  numbers.  And if we compare SingTel with Deutsche

Telecom,  $48.3 billion.  That is more than  three  times

the size.  If we compare it with, say, Verizon, which  is

a  relatively more recent player, $88.2 billion.  That is

5-6  times.  The scale factors are immense, but they  are

playing in the same field.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about SIA, we are very proud of the

company because of its international success.  But if  we

want  to compare SIA, its turnover is about $5.1 billion.

Compare  that  with, say, Lufthansa or  British  Airways.

Lufthansa is about $11 billion and British Airways  about

$10  billion.  So the order of magnitude is two times  or

more,  and  that  is not even talking about  things  like

fleet size and how they cover the routes and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of size is a factor and we could say that

our  Temasek-linked companies or GLCs,  whilst  they  may

look  like very big fish in our small pond, once we  look

at  the  big  ocean, actually, they are, at best,  medium

size.  To grow, they have to do one of two things.   They

have  to  either grow organically or they  have  to  make

acquisitions, locally or internationally.  If we look  at

the   electronic   manufacturing   services   sector   in

Singapore, for example, many of our companies  have  been

acquired  by international players, precisely because  of

the scale.  Solectron acquired NatSteel Electronics about

two  years ago.  Celestica acquired JIT about a year ago.

All of these are driven by the same factors.  They needed

scale  in order to be able to leverage on the mass orders

they get and keep their overheads down to a bare minimum.

All  I  ask is that when we think about these issues,  we

talk  about level playing field, but let us give the GLCs

or  TLCs  a level playing field as well.  Let me give  an

example.     The   local   banking   sector   has    seen

consolidation.  UOB acquired OUB.  That would be cited as

a   good   example  of  private  sector   market   forces

consolidating in response to forces that are changing the

industry.  If the same transaction had

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>



occurred where DBS had acquired OUB, would that  be  seen

as  a  positive example of consolidation or a bad example

of crowding out?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take another example. Mr Inderjit Singh

pointed  out SingTel failed in its attempt to acquire  HK

Tel,  and he said that SingTel moved too slow.  Who moved

faster?  PCCW, and where are they today?  So, is that  an

example of the winner's curse?  If they had done it, they

would  be damned.  If they had not done it, which is  the

case,  they are being damned.  Let us give them  a  level

playing  field.  Let us treat this fairly.  Subsequently,

SingTel goes on to buy Optus.  Then the acquisitions  are

different.  I think we ought to take a fair line on these

matters,  and  not  just  take  the  line  that  is  most

convenient to our point of view.

<div align="center"><b>NEW CHARTER OF GOVERNMENT-LINKED COMPANIES</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> You may continue, Mr Iswaran.

<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, I also wanted to make some comments

on  the  issue  of divestment.  There have been  repeated

calls  by several Members that there should be a specific

timeframe for the Government to announce how it is  going

to  release or divest its interests in various companies.

I was thinking about this.  From whose point

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>



of  view is it desirable for the Government to commit  to

such a specific timeframe?  From the point of view of the

employees  of the company, who would then be filled  with

uncertainty about their future?  From the point  of  view

of  the customers of these companies, who will then  need

to  know  what  is going to happen to their  supplier  or

service  provider?   Or from the point  of  view  of  its

shareholders, who will then have to wonder  whether  this

company  they  have shares in is in play, and  what  they

would do about it?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect of divestment is who to divest to.

There  were some comments that maybe we should divest  it

to private equity houses or large pension funds.  I think

there may be some merits in that, but certainly not as  a

way to argue a case that this is superior necessarily  to

Government  shareholding.  I think  that  remains  to  be

proven.   Yesterday, Minister of State, Mr  Raymond  Lim,

made  an  eloquent point on this, and I do  not  wish  to

repeat that, other than to make the point that it is  not

an  axiom that when you privatise entirely a company, its

performance necessarily improves unambiguously.   If  you

look  at  the  history of privatisation,  in  Singapore's

case,   privatisation  was  not  the  result  of   under-performing  state-owned enterprises which were  put  into

the  private domain, in order to subject them to  greater

disciplines and, therefore, higher performance.   If  you

look  at  the  comparison with, say, UK,  a  lot  of  the

privatisation was because the state-run enterprises  were

not performing.  So we need to keep that in balance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who else can we divest to? Strategic partners? And

I  think that is a good idea, but it would take time, and

it  needs to be calibrated because you need to choose and

work out the issues, before it is done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, management. I thought this deserves

particular comment because this issue of MBOs was  raised

by several Members.  I thought it was interesting because

it  came from two points of view.  Some Members, like  Mr

Sin  Boon  Ann, said that MBO is perhaps not a very  good

idea, and he cited the fact that MBOs

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>



mean  that  management,  which  has  got  an  information

advantage, would be able to prevail and take advantage of

the  situation.   In  other words, there  is  information

asymmetry   which   works   to   the   disadvantage    of

shareholders.  The question to ask: is this not  true  of

all MBOs?  So, do we then say that all MBOs as a class of

transactions are a bad thing?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another group of our Members here have pointed out

that the MBOs should be encouraged because it is a way to

entrust some of these assets to local management in order

to  kick-start the local entrepreneurship drive.  Is that

really the basis on which we want to consider MBOs?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right approach really ought to be that an MBO is

one  way  of divesting, just as there are numerous  other

ways.   And  what we ought to be looking at,  if  we  are

going to debate such issues in this House, is how we  can

realise  the best value for the shareholders and  act  in

the  best  interest of the company.  I think that  really

ought to be the governing principle for these issues  and

as  a  result,  there would be a rigorous  evaluation  of

alternatives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in all these questions, I think the key point

is  ultimately,  who should be the judge of  a  company's

business strategy, its approach to divestment or  any  of

the   other  commercial  decisions.   Should  it  be  the

Government?   Should it be the employees?  Should  it  be

this  House?  I would submit that whilst all these groups

have   got   an  element  of  interest  as  stakeholders,

ultimately  the  only real point of  decision,  the  only

court  of  opinion, for listed companies is the community

of  shareholders.  Why?  Because they have  skin  in  the

game,  and  they are the ones who will make the  decision

whether to put money in, take it out, and so on.   So  we

have  to be mindful of that.  And I think Government,  no

matter  how  large or small shareholder  it  is,  in  any

enterprise,  cannot ride roughshod over the  interest  of

other shareholders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a final point, I just want to say that the debate

has  been perhaps cast as a zero sum if not negative  sum

game.  In other words, if the GLCs grow, the SMEs

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>



are  deprived.  And if we cut down on the GLCs, the  SMEs

will grow.  I think this is a little bit different to the

spirit  of  the  Motion which, when I first  read  it,  I

thought  it was very conciliatory and positive.  But  the

debate  itself has had a slightly different tone,  in  my

view.  What we ultimately want is an enterprise ecosystem

that affords the space and opportunity for all species of

companies.   If you take a rain forest, for example,  you

want  the giants who will reach for the sky and they will

compete  with  the  other giants.   We  also  want  other

companies  who will look at the slivers of  sunlight  and

other possible advantages in order to carve themselves  a

niche  and grow.  And then you will have others who  will

be  on  the forest bed, who will find their own  area  of

operation  and flourish.  And I think if this debate  can

set  that  mindset for us, so that we have a new  way  of

thinking  of  a relationship between all the elements  of

our  enterprise  ecosystem, then it  would  have  been  a

positive exercise.

<div align="center"><b>NEW CHARTER OF GOVERNMENT-LINKED COMPANIES</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br>3.51 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank

all  the  Members who have spoken.  It is now my pleasant

task  to  summarise the arguments which  they  have  very

eloquently made.  I do not feel like Darth Vader.   I  am

trying to look like Yoda.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story of how GLCs came about has been well told

by  all  the  MPs.   So,  I do not  have  to  repeat  the

historical background.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, today, the value-added of Temasek companies

accounts  for  some  13%  of  Singapore's  GDP.   If  the

Government  had  not got involved in  business,  most  of

these companies would not exist today.  If you allow  for

the  fact that the Government itself consumes 9%  of  the

GDP,  then  the non-GLC private sector, which  means  the

local  companies and the multi-nationals, makes  up  78%,

which is more than three-quarters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our objective is to expand this total pie, of which

the   larger  part  is  the  non-GLCs.   And  that  means

expanding the productive part of the economy, namely, the

sum  of both the GLCs and the non-GLCs, while keeping the

Government  share  as  small  as  possible,  because  the

Government  share  really is  a  consumption.   It  is  a

necessary  burden,  but it should  be  kept  small.   The

question is: do GLCs have a contribution to make in  this

process?  Will growing the GLCs be at the expense of  the

non-GLCs?   More  importantly, and a different  question,

will  growing the GLCs be at the expense of  the  overall

economy?   I  think those are the questions  we  have  to

consider.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone agrees that in our earlier phase of

economic development, the GLCs made a contribution.   But

now  that the GLCs have grown, now that they exist,  what

should we do with them?  Should the Government exit  from

all the businesses?  If so, how?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, we have had a long debate in the EISC,

chaired by Mr Raymond Lim, and also within the Government

on  the role of the Government as a shareholder in  these

companies,  and what the Government hopes the  GLCs  will

achieve.   The result, after extensive debate,  has  been

the Temasek Charter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Charter sets out Temasek's role - to nurture the

companies  with  the  potential to grow  into  successful

international  businesses.   It  defines  the  types   of

businesses which Temasek will hold and those that Temasek

will  exit and divest.  Temasek will have no interest  in

companies that will only serve the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>



domestic  market, unless these are strategic  industries,

for  example, broadcasting, the electricity grid  or  the

port.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GLCs are important players in the Singapore

economy.   There  are very few non-GLCs  with  the  size,

organisational  strength, or the technological  depth  of

Singapore  Telecom, SIA, Singapore Technologies  or  PSA.

The  closest would be the banks - UOB and OUB, or now UOB

and OCBC, and the property companies, eg, CDL.  But these

are  not technology companies.  We can argue whether  had

the  Government not built up these companies,  more  non-Government private enterprise would have grown,  and  the

Singapore  economy  would  have  been  more  dynamic  and

entrepreneurial.   But  the  Government  decided   on   a

strategy,  and it worked.  We are convinced it is  right.

Maybe you are right and we are wrong, but that is Monday-morning quarterbacking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the GLCs have been created, the Singapore

Government  has a responsibility to make sure  that  they

are  well run, grow their business, and contribute to the

economy.  This may mean tougher competition for the  non-GLCs.  But so long as the competition is fair, it is good

competition, it is good for the economy, it is  good  for

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy question is whether GLCs should continue

to  go  into new businesses.  Mr Leong Horn Kee wants  to

curb the proliferation of GLCs.  He asked that no new GLC

be  formed  without  the explicit  consent  of  MOF.   Mr

Leong's question has to be addressed at two levels.   For

the   listed  companies,  which  Mr  Iswaran   has   just

discussed,  the decision to enter into new businesses  is

for the respective board of directors to take.  The board

has  to  act  in  the interests of all the  shareholders,

including the minority shareholders.  We cannot forbid  a

listed  company  from  doing  certain  activities,   just

because the Government happens to own shares in  it.   It

is  wrong  both  legally, because the  directors  have  a

fiduciary  responsibility to all  the  shareholders,  and

also  from a policy point of view.  GLCs, especially  the

listed GLCs, have to operate commercially.  It does not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>



mean  that  DBS will go into manufacturing semi-conductor

chips, or PSA should start an airline business, or even a

shipping  business.   The decisions  must  make  business

sense,   and  they  must  fit  the  companies'   business

strategy.  But there is no original sin attached to being

born a GLC, which taints a GLC from birth and prevents it

from doing  certain types of business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for investments by Temasek itself, we are in a

different  situation from the early days.  There  is  now

less  need  and,  I  think, fewer opportunities  for  the

Government to go into new businesses on its own.  We  are

not  likely to start a new airline, or another bank.  But

we  cannot completely rule out the possibility  that  the

Government may need to invest directly in new businesses.

These  could be businesses which are exceptionally  risky

or  which  have  long  gestation periods,  or  where  the

private  sector  is not willing to go in.   Most  of  the

time,  if the private sector is not willing to go  in,  I

would say we should conclude that the business fails  the

market test, and should not be launched at all.  But once

in a while the Government may need to impose our judgment

and override the verdict of the market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One recent example is the Jurong Island project.

The Government felt that it makes sense for us to reclaim

seven islands, fill in the land, sell the land, develop a

petrochemical  complex,  not  by  building   the   plants

ourselves but by encouraging and persuading MNCs to  come

and   build  the  plants.   That  is  an  entrepreneurial

business decision, although in that case the decision was

made by JTC, and it was done through JTC with the help of

EDB,  rather than by forming a new Temasek company, which

we  could  have done.  Hence, the clause in  the  Temasek

Charter to allow Temasek, from time to time, to invest in

new businesses, in order to nurture new industry clusters

in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be other occasions when Temasek will need

to  go in.  On the one hand, Mr Leong Horn Kee wants  the

Government to stop forming new GLCs;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>



on  the other hand, he wants GLCs to help the SMEs by co-investing  in them.  Indeed, as Ms Indranee pointed  out,

there  is  a certain tension between these two arguments.

Temasek  will  indeed  invest in  SMEs,  where  it  makes

business sense.  But if we did this, please remember  and

accept that these SMEs, by definition, will become GLCs!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another hot issue which MPs have pressed on is the

divestment  of  GLCs.  The Government will  divest  those

which  do not have the potential for international growth

or  serve no strategic purpose, and these are mostly  the

smaller  ones.  Michael Fam's Report in 1987  recommended

divesting 41 GLCs over 10 years.  Mr Leong Horn Kee  said

only  two-thirds  of these have been divested,  fully  or

partially.  That is true.  But, at the same time, we also

divested  some 30 GLCs which were not listed  in  Michael

Fam's  Report.  So, overall, since the mid-80s,  we  have

divested some 60 Temasek companies, either completely  or

partially,   more   than   what  Michael   Fam's   Report

recommended.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temasek will continue to consolidate and rationalise

its  stable of companies.  It will divest those that  are

no  longer relevant to its mission, but this must  be  at

the  right time, at a fair price, in a way which does not

unsettle  the  market  and which ensures  that  the  GLCs

continue to be properly managed after divestment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh and Mdm Ho Geok Choo urged the

Government  to consider management buy-out  (MBO),  as  a

method  of  divestment.  An MBO is certainly one  of  the

methods  which  the Government will consider  and  which,

indeed,  we  have used on occasions to divest  companies.

But,   as   Mr  Sin  Boon  Ann  correctly  pointed   out,

information  is  not symmetrical in an  MBO.   Management

knows  more  about their company than the  board  or  the

shareholders.   Indeed, if they did not know  more  about

the  company,  something is wrong.   But  this  causes  a

problem.   So  it  is not so simple to  ensure  that  the

shareholders receive full and fair value for their shares

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>



in  an  MBO.  The purpose of the MBO is not to  sell  the

company   cheap,  but  to  derive  full  value  for   the

shareholders and act in the best interest of the company.

But  we  do not entirely rule out MBOs either,  and  each

case will be evaluated on its merits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no reason for the Government to sell off

GLCs   below  their  fair  value,  regardless  of  market

conditions,  by a specific deadline.  Why  should  we  do

that?   We  do  not need to raise revenue  through  asset

sales.  We are not selling off the family silver and  the

last  Canaletto  painting that MacMillan said  about  the

British government asset sales.  If we sold off the  GLCs

in  a  hurry, we will no doubt have a debate in the House

and  MPs  would rightly criticise us for not safeguarding

the   interests   of  Singaporeans,   and   rightly   so.

Therefore,  it  would  be unwise to  publish  a  list  of

companies   that  would  be  divested  within   a   fixed

timeframe.   The act itself would depress  values,  alarm

customers,   demoralise  employees   and   cause   viable

businesses to run to seed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people have argued that, since the GLCs are not

doing  well,  we should divest them in order  to  improve

their performance.  We do not agree.  Firstly, most  GLCs

are performing well.  Over the long term, GLCs have amply

returned   the  Government's  initial  investment.    For

example, DBS and SIA were transferred to Temasek in 1975.

At  that time, DBS was valued at $49 million, SIA at  $91

million.  Today, Temasek's share of DBS' and SIA's market

capitalisation is $2.3 billion for DBS and  $8.2  billion

for SIA.  So if we take a longer timeframe, the companies

have done very well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the nature of things, not all GLCs will do well

all  the  time.   Where  GLCs are  not  doing  well,  the

management  has to sort out the problems.  If  necessary,

the  board  may need to make management changes,  or  the

shareholders, including Temasek, may need to  make  board

changes.   Keeping  businesses in  good  health  requires

tough decisions and clear mindedness, and Temasek has  to

have that, and do that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I agree with Mdm Ho Geok Choo that most

fund managers do not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>



take  an  active role in building up the companies  which

they  hold  shares in.  They buy the shares as  portfolio

investments.   They  sell the shares when  they  see  the

company  doing badly, or even when the shares are  merely

under performing.  And if the company is doing well, they

may also sell the shares to make a good profit.  They are

trading, they are not long-term shareholders.  Therefore,

selling   GLCs   off  to  some  fund  manager,   or   new

shareholder,  will not magically solve the problem.   The

way  to  upgrade a business is to assemble an experienced

board, build a strong and cohesive management team and do

the  hard  work of improving systems, changing management

cultures,   developing  new  capabilities,  opening   new

markets.    Having  the  Singapore  Government   as   the

shareholder  does  not stop companies  from  doing  this,

provided  the  Government  takes  a  rigorous  commercial

approach, and entrusts the task to a capable team.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others have argued that the Government should simply

divest  all its GLCs regardless, because as a  matter  of

principle,  the Government should not own companies.   We

do  not  agree.  As Mr Raymond Lim highlighted yesterday,

despite the recommendation of the World Bank and the  IMF

to  privatise rapidly, the benefits of privatisation  are

not a given, especially if it is not done under the right

conditions.  For many of the GLCs, the Government is  the

major shareholder.  If we are to let the companies go, as

Prof.  Koo  Tsai  Kee  asked,  to  whom?   Which  private

companies  or individuals are in a position to take  over

SingTel,  SIA  or  PSA?  Not just financially,  which  is

difficult  enough, but in terms of management  oversight.

Can  we really just distribute the shares to Singaporeans

and expect the companies to naturally prosper?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the success stories of companies around

the  world, great companies are built by committed, long-term  shareholders  holding major or significant  stakes.

And  this is especially the experience in Asia.  But even

in the US, after Enron, it is not so clear that having  a

diversified   shareholding  and  no   major   shareholder

effectively in charge at all is a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>



good  formula.   Bill Gates still owns  a  big  share  of

Microsoft.   He  makes  sure  it  does  well.   A   major

shareholder has a substantial amount of his own money  at

stake.  He will take the trouble to find the right people

to  run the businesses, set the directions, and make sure

the business is run properly.  Without a major and active

shareholder,   it   is  much  harder   for   many   small

shareholders  to get together to do this, as  Mr  Raymond

Lim   pointed  out.   Hence,  the  Government   has   the

responsibility to promote and ensure good  governance  in

the GLCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, there are very few local individuals

or companies with the resources and the capability to buy

over  and  drive the performance of the large  GLCs.   In

Hong  Kong, there are tycoons, like Mr Li Ka Shing or  Mr

Robert  Kuok, who own and run major companies.  In  fact,

among  the tycoons, they own and run a large part of  the

Hong  Kong economy.  Perhaps, over time, such people  may

merge  in Singapore.  But remember, a Singapore in  which

the  commanding heights of the economy are controlled  by

powerful,  private shareholders will be quite a different

economy and quite a different society from one where  the

major  companies  are professionally-run  GLCs,  and  the

ownership ultimately comes back to all Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me reiterate that this does not mean that the

status  quo  is  frozen, and that the Government  is  not

going  to divest any GLC.  We will restructure the  GLCs,

we  will  sell off the pieces which do not fit.  We  will

consider mergers and acquisitions which make business and

commercial sense.  That is the way to make the most of  a

valuable asset and to realise the full value of the  GLCs

we have built up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me address the question of crowding out.

Mr  Inderjit  Singh  and  also  Mr  Leong  Horn  Kee  had

complained  that  the GLCs are entering businesses  which

the  private  sector is fully capable of doing.   Let  me

assure them that we have no intention of doing that.  For

example, the famous roast duck company, again recited  by

Mr Inderjit Singh, had been acquired incidentally as part

of a larger acquisition

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>



in  1991,  and  divested in 1994  purely  as  a  business

decision.   It is an immortal duck!  The Temasek  Charter

is oriented towards companies which have the potential to

grow internationally, or are strategic to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the EISC, Mr Raymond Lim proposed a 'Yellow

Pages'   rule.   Statutory  boards  should  not  set   up

companies  to do things which can be found in the  Yellow

Pages.  I agree in principle with this.  If you can  look

it  up in the book, why do you want to start a company to

go and compete with the private sector?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, applying the Yellow Pages rule will require

judgement.   We  must expect times when the  Ministry  or

statutory  board  judges the private  sector  not  to  be

adequate,  but  the private sector disagrees.   In  fact,

quite  understandably, the more competitive the  GLC  is,

the  more unhappy the private sector is going to be.   It

is in the nature of things.  And if the private sector is

not  up to the job, it is most unlikely that any of  them

will  stand up and say, "Sorry, I am not up to it, please

carry  on."    For example, PSB Corp which runs  training

programmes  and  certification  for  ISO  9000.   Private

training  service  providers protest at  this.   But  the

former  PSB Corp, which is now SPRING Singapore,  started

the  industry when there were no private providers.   The

industry  did  not  exist then.  PSB created  the  market

because  of the national reason that we wanted to promote

training,  upgrading,  productivity.   And  the   private

service  providers  then entered the  market.   Now,  the

private   service  providers  say,  "PSB   is   competing

unfairly."   But  now  that  there  are  private  service

providers, it is no longer necessary for SPRING Singapore

to  continue  to  do this.  And so SPRING  Singapore  has

hived  off  the  function to PSB Corp.   PSB  Corp  is  a

corporatised   entity   which   will   subsequently    be

privatised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give you another example. Hdbay, also

mentioned  in  the debate, was set up by  a  wholly-owned

subsidiary of HDB - CESMA International - as a web portal

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>



for  the  renovation industry in January 2001.   HDB  did

this  to help raise the standards of the interior  design

and renovation industry.  Because we get complaints, such

as  contractors  making a hole in the ceiling,   damaging

the  structural  pillar, so HDB set up Hdbay  to  try  to

upgrade standards in the industry.  HDB deals with  Hdbay

at   arms  length,  but  still  the  renovation  industry

questions  whether  HDB needed to create  Hdbay  at  all.

Well,  maybe  the renovation industry is  right.   It  is

arguable.   But far better for us to have civil  servants

and  officials who have the drive and enterprise to start

new activities than for civil servants to sit back and do

nothing.   Of  course, now Hdbay is up and  running,  HDB

will consider divesting its interest in the company.  But

that  is  a different matter.  At least, I have a company

and there is something which we can talk about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee says bliss to a businessman is a

business  world in Singapore without GLCs, because  there

will  be  less  competition and more room for  the  local

businessman  to  build up his business.   Would  that  be

worse?  If the local companies were not competing against

GLCs,  they  would  still be competing  against  powerful

multinationals,  or  large  local  companies  in  private

hands,  which is what happens in Hong Kong.   Life  would

not be easier.  As Mdm Halimah pointed out yesterday,  in

many  privately developed shopping malls, FairPrice  does

not get in because the private developers have brought in

their  own  partners, their own private companies,  their

own  friends, which are in the retail business,  and  not

SMEs,  nor  FairPrice.  So without GLCs, you would  still

have  competition.   And if we did  succeed  in  reducing

competition,  which is what Mr Leong really wishes,  this

would  result in a less competitive private  sector,  and

fewer  choices for consumers.  It is worse for consumers.

Far better to have keen competition in Singapore to build

strong SMEs which are internationally competitive.  And I

think  Mr  Leong  acknowledges this  because,  after  his

eloquent argument, finally he says he supports FairPrice.

Whatever the argument, the conclusion was not wrong.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And related to crowding out is the issue of unfair

competition.  There are different ways in which  you  can

interpret  the word "unfair".  It could be unfair  market

practices.   It  could be an insight  track,  an  unlevel

playing field.  It could be cheap financing.  It could be

size.   Let  me  take them one by one.  On unfair  market

practices, which means cartels, predatory pricing,  abuse

of  dominance,  the  Government does not  condone  these,

whether by GLCs or by private companies.  MTI intends  to

enact  a  competition  law and all  companies,  including

GLCs,  will be subject to this law.  There will  be  some

sensitive  activities which should be exempted  from  the

law,  as  in  all competition regimes around  the  world.

Enterprises  which  feel  that  they  are  facing  unfair

competition  can then take the matter to  an  independent

Competition  Commission and it will  be  adjudicated  and

there will be a redress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether GLCs enjoy an inside track, our policy

is  clear.  The Government will not tolerate this, we  do

not  do  this.   We  expect GLCs to compete  on  a  level

playing  field.   Ministries and  statutory  boards  will

maintain  an arms-length relationship with the GLCs,  and

the  GLCs must operate commercially and efficiently,  and

not receive special subsidies or favours.  Of course, the

corollary of this is that we must also not expect GLCs to

do  "national service", whether it is to do a  favour  to

SMEs, lower prices, or provide non-economic services.  To

favour  GLCs at the expense of other companies is  to  do

harm  to  the economy, and to encourage GLCs to  be  less

competitive  and efficient.  For example, MAS  supervises

the banks.  One of the banks is DBS.  But if you ask DBS,

they  will  tell you that they do not enjoy  any  special

privileges  or forbearance.  They are treated  just  like

any  other local bank.  In fact, DBS sometimes feel  they

are  treated  more than just like any other  local  bank.

But that is how we have to deal with it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Inderjit Singh is mistaken that SMEs will

similarly succeed if only the Government would give  them

the same special treatment it extends to GLCs.  The truth

is  that  GLCs enjoy no protectionist measures  from  the

Government.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, companies which have been spun off or set

up  by  statutory  boards still do  business  with  their

parent.   For example, Ascendas with JTC. In such  cases,

the  perception is harder to dispel, and we have  got  to

make  a  special effort to be transparent and above-board

in  the dealings.  For example, any asset transferred has

to  be  properly  priced, and if a company  competes  for

business with the parent, then it should be through  open

bidding or tender.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, we will need to corporatise a Government

department  or  statutory board with a  moratorium.   For

example,  CPG Corp, which used to be called PWD Corp,  or

Jurong    Consultants.    The   moratorium   helps    the

corporatised entity make the transition into  a  private-sector player and, in cases where the corporatised entity

was  the  sole supplier to the Government, it  gives  the

Ministries  time to adjust.  I fully agree  with  Members

that  moratoriums are not desirable, and they  should  be

avoided wherever possible.  They are messy, circumstances

change  and  you  wished you had  not  done  it.   But  a

moratorium  is no worse than the department or  statutory

board  remaining a Government agency.  To help  make  the

transition,  sometimes it cannot be  avoided,  because  a

cold turkey cut over may be neither practical nor wise to

ensure the retention of expertise and the continuance  of

service  to the Government in the transition.   In  other

words, it is not just the company which may not be  ready

if  you  cut  over  cold turkey, but the  customers,  the

clients  or the Government departments may not  be  ready

because,  all  of a sudden, instead of having  a  regular

contractor,  architect  or engineer,  they  have  got  to

prepare   specifications,  call  for  tenders,   evaluate

tenders,  and  supervise.   That  takes  time  to  learn.

Hence, what we did with PWD Corp.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the corporatisation of PWD in April 1999, CPG

Corp  has  been awarded only about $250 million worth  of

new  Government  projects.   In contrast,  private-sector

consultants received 118 Government projects  worth  $1.3

billion  during  the  same  period.   Had  PWD  not  been

corporatised,   these  118  projects  would   have   been

undertaken in-house by the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>



Government.   So,  by  corporatising,  we  have   created

business  for  the  private sector.   The  part  kept  to

facilitate this transition is a minority - one-quarter or

one-fifth  of  the business.  But because people  do  not

notice  this, they say PWD Corp, has a moratorium and  an

unfair advantage.  The facts speak for themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee says that GLCs enjoy cheap funding

because of their perceived links to the Government.   The

Government does not provide any guarantees to  the  GLCs.

The  banks  and  the  markets  have  to  make  their  own

assessment of the credit worthiness of the companies they

lend  to,  and  the  bigger and stronger  companies  will

generally enjoy better credit ratings and better spreads.

However,  it is not automatic that GLCs will enjoy  loans

at  lower  rates.   The  lenders and  analysts  rate  the

companies, and their credit ratings vary from company  to

company and from time to time.  For example, Moody's  put

a  negative  outlook on SingTel in June 2002,  fairly  or

unfairly.   SingTel  considers it  unfairly,  but  Moodys

makes its assessment and it has implications on SingTel's

borrowing  costs.  I do not know why the  bankers  in  Mr

Leong  Horn Kee's project in China preferred to  lend  to

the  three  GLCs  and not to the one  non-GLC  which  was

there.   But  Mr  Leong Horn Kee's explanation  that  the

bankers  were favouring the GLCs irrationally is not  the

only possible one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh claimed that GLCs succeeded

because  of the huge investments the Government had  made

in  them, and because they made use of their links to the

Government  to get ample cheap funding.  This  is  simply

not  true.  The GLCs were started with only seed capital.

The  rest was internally generated over the years through

the GLCs' own efforts.  I gave you the example of SIA and

DBS  just  now.   Let  me  cite another  example  -  also

recently    mentioned   in   despatches    -    Singapore

Technologies.   Mr Inderjit Singh mentioned  this  as  an

example of a company with "murky beginnings" - I think it

was his phrase.  Cloak-and-dagger.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> No. Not me.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Not you.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Someone else.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Someone else. He does not know

the  history of ST.  ST, in fact, is an excellent example

of  how  GLCs  have  grown and how we have  pragmatically

evolved our own solutions.  We are not like the US, where

the  defence industries are largely private-sector firms.

We  also  did not have economies of scale, especially  at

the  beginning.  Yet, we needed to build up  our  defence

industries,  for strategic reasons, to support  the  SAF.

We  did not do this by throwing money at the problem,  or

by using our muscles instead of our brains.  I think this

quote is from Mr Inderjit Singh.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF set up the defence industries as companies

instead of as Government arsenals, so that they would  be

subject to market discipline and would be able to operate

efficiently.  The defence industries did not get  a  free

ride.   They  had  to tender for MINDEF projects  against

foreign   competitors   -   often,   subsidised   foreign

competitors  - and match their prices.  Over  time,  they

built  up  their  capabilities  and  scale.   They   made

profits,  which  they reinvested in the  business.   They

grew,   using  internally-generated  funds,   not   cheap

Government  funding.   They diversified  into  non-MINDEF

business,  most of it abroad.  Today, many  of  them  are

listed,    including   ST   Engineering   and   Chartered

Semiconductor.  Could ST companies and managers have done

this,  if  indeed they had not used their brains  or  had

been  bereft  of  entrepreneurship?   Could  the  private

sector really have stepped forward and filled this  role,

if  MINDEF  had not set up CIS, ODE, Singapore  Aerospace

and so many other companies now in the ST Group?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the question of size. In some

industries,  the  advantage of size is, unfortunately,  a

fact of life.  For example, in banking and telecoms, size

is  critical.  Larger companies have more resources, more

capacity for risk and more staying power.  For Singapore

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>



companies  in  these industries to be  competitive,  they

must build up their size to enjoy the economies of scale,

build  up  the  depth  of management  expertise,  attract

talent  and grow the company.  As Mr Iswaran has  pointed

out  graphically with figures, our big companies are very

small  by international standards.  Small companies  will

have  a  much  tougher time competing against  the  large

players.   We  cannot  tilt the playing  field  in  these

industries in favour of the small players.  In  fact,  on

the  contrary,  sometimes we will need to  encourage  the

small  players, nudge and persuade them to merge  and  to

become bigger and stronger.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these industries, unhappiness with GLCs really is

unhappiness  at having to compete against  a  larger  and

more powerful player.  But that is the way the world  and

the   industries  are  evolving.   On  an   international

comparison,  we  know how small we are.   So,  we  cannot

solve  this  problem by shrinking the GLCs  or  divesting

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this is not the case in every industry,

and  SMEs form an important part of our economy.  In many

businesses, the small companies enjoy a nimbleness and an

entrepreneurial drive and flexibility which help them  to

develop new products and markets, and to exploit changing

conditions  faster than larger companies.   For  example,

Microsoft  started from scratch when IBM  was  already  a

giant,  and  swiftly overtook IBM.  Dell and Compaq  also

started  from scratch when IBM said the PC is a commodity

business,  and  they have built themselves  up  into  big

Fortune 500 companies.  So, I agree with Mr Wee Siew  Kim

that SMEs can act as "support firms" to GLCs in a cluster

approach  when pursuing overseas ventures.  This  is  why

Temasek  and  EDB  have  set aside  some  private  equity

funding  to  invest in promising local enterprises.   For

example, Temasek has a small stake in Osim International,

and  is  represented on the board.  When you rest in  the

Members' Room and sit on the Osim chair, please think  of

Temasek!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving forward, the issue for us, therefore, is not

so much managing the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>



competition  between the big and small companies  in  our

domestic economy but, as Ms Olivia Lum and several others

point  out, encouraging them to collaborate in  competing

internationally.  That is why the Government set  up  the

Local Industry Upgrading Programme (LIUP), as well  as  a

whole  series  of  assistance packages for  SMEs  offered

through  MTI,  eg, the Local Enterprise Financing  Scheme

(LEFS),  the  Business  Upgrading through  Inter-Linkages

Development (BUILD), and so forth.  There are almost more

schemes than there are SMEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EISC has recommended that the Government

oursource  more  Government  functions  to  the   private

sector.   We  agree.   Ministries  and  statutory  boards

already outsource certain services to the private sector.

These  include  IT  software  development,  systems   and

facilities maintenance, provision of medical services  in

prisons, provision of legal advice in certain specialised

areas, such as international trade law.  Our intention is

to  outsource as many functions as possible, provided  it

makes  economic  sense to outsource and  the  outsourcing

arrangement is sustainable.  However, remember that  this

does mean handing out cushy Government contracts to SMEs.

It  means  fiercer  competition for Government  business,

which  will  make  suppliers  more  efficient,  and  save

taxpayers money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public-sector agencies are already allowed to

contract start-up companies with no company track record,

for IT and technology projects of up to $5 million.  This

is  to  help  the SMEs have a chance and build  up  their

track  record.   In  addition, we  have  got  procurement

guidelines  which  allow Ministries to decide,  based  on

their   assessment  of  the  potential  market  and   the

attendant  risk, to lower the tender evaluation  criteria

in  terms  of  the financial status of tenderers.   Then,

SMEs can participate in larger Government tenders.

We  will continue to make it easy for SMEs to participate

in  Government contracts, but we should not give SMEs  an

explicit   advantage  over  larger  firms  in  Government

business,  or handicap large firms in order to  give  the

SMEs  business.   Some countries do  this,  eg,  Germany,

Japan, but

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>



the result is inefficiency and higher cost for taxpayers.

SMEs  have to be competitive to survive and prosper, just

as  GLCs and MNCs have to be competitive.  Otherwise,  we

will  wake up one morning and say, "Who stole my cheese?"

As  Ms  Olivia  Lum  said, SMEs want  opportunities,  not

handouts.    And   there  are  opportunities   and   many

successful  SMEs.  Examples include Qian Hu,  started  in

1985  from the conversion of a pig farm into a fish farm,

which  is  now  a  major exporter of ornamental  fish  in

Singapore,  with customers in more than 45  countries,  a

turnover of $41 million, and net profits of $3.4  million

last  year.  That is enterprise.  They gave me two  fish.

I  gave  them to my children, they took a liking  to  the

fish  and bought dozens more, some of which probably from

Qian  Hu.   There is Food Empire (Coffee) listed  on  the

main  board  of SGX.  It makes and markets more  than  90

instant   beverage  products,  frozen  finger  food   and

confectionery,  eg,  MacCoffee,  Klassno   and   MacCandy

amongst  others.  And they are in exciting parts  of  the

world,  not  just  the US, UK, China  or  Australia,  but

according  to  their  website, also  in  Russia,  Eastern

Europe  and  Central  Asia.  They are  not  depending  on

Government hand-outs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Chang Kee, a franchise owned by a Singapore

firm,  Ten & Han Trading, has outlets in eight countries,

including Malaysia, India, South Africa and China.   They

started off selling 300 curry puffs per day in 1956.  Now

they sell 18,000 per day just in Singapore alone.  It  is

now  looking  to  export Singapore-made  curry  puffs  to

countries  like the US and Britain.  The problem  is,  if

the  SMEs  are  successful, they grow big,  they  are  no

longer  SMEs, then you have to look at new SMEs  and  new

champions,  new entrepreneurs.  But they are there,  they

will come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee suggested that the Government and

Temasek  publish  an annual report of  GLCs  for  greater

transparency and to foster trust of the GLCs.  I  am  not

clear  why he should distrust GLCs.  GLCs do not  operate

under  a  cloak of secrecy.  Most of the major  companies

which are held directly by Temasek are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>



already  listed,  so  their annual  reports  are  readily

available  and,  in fact, GLCs regularly win  prizes  for

having   the  most  comprehensive  annual  reports.    ST

Engineering, which holds many of our defence  industries,

is  listed  and  so  is  subject to  market  demands  for

transparency. As for unlisted companies held directly  by

Temasek,  such as PSA Corp, Singapore Power or MediaCorp,

we have plans eventually to privatise them too.  In fact,

Singapore Power and PSA Corp already publish their annual

reports.   Accounts  for  the  smaller  statutory   board

companies  are  also  available  from  the  Registrar  of

Companies  and  Businesses.   There  is  no  need  for  a

consolidated report by the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of the public unhappiness has not been over the

major GLCs, like SIA, DBS, but the small ones, mostly the

statutory board companies.  We have considered preventing

statutory  boards from starting companies  without  MOF's

permission.   My staff put it up, we have  discussed  it.

We  concluded that it was not practical.  They may simply

provide  the  service  in-house,  which  is  not  better.

Identifying out-of-bound areas a priori is also difficult

because each statutory board's situation is different and

the circumstances themselves change with time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Government will review and cull the

list  of  statutory board companies regularly.   We  will

particularly consider the need to separate the  statutory

board  companies from their parent, especially where  the

parent  is  the  regulator,  while  the  statutory  board

companies  are regulatees or are somehow related  to  the

statutory  board business, thereby giving the  perception

that   the  statutory  board  companies  have  an  unfair

advantage, like in the case of HDB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will be happy to know that the Ministry of

Finance will be issuing a set of guidelines to Ministries

and  statutory  boards on the factors which  they  should

take  into  account when they are thinking of setting  up

statutory  boards.  They should only form companies  that

serve  a  strategic role integral to the mission  of  the

statutory board or that do not breach the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1051</b></font><br><br>



'Yellow Pages' rule.  Companies should also not be  given

names  that  bear relation to the parent or  predecessor,

thus  creating confusion.  I used to know what  PWD  Corp

was.  Now,  I  have  to remember CPG  Corp  and  so  will

Members.   But maybe that will be fairer.  But  overseas,

where  the names PWD Corp, HDB or JTC carry weight,  they

will  be  allowed to carry those brand names.   And  even

when  statutory boards set up companies which meet  these

criteria,  they  should do so with an  ultimate  view  to

divest them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now talk about talent, an important subject.

Mr  Leong Horn Kee attributed the dearth of entrepreneurs

in  Singapore  to  the  monopoly of  top  talent  by  the

Government.  Unfortunately or fortunately, the Government

does   not  monopolise  top  talent.   Every  year,   the

Government awards about 300 scholarships, which  is  less

than  one-third  of the top students in the  cohort  with

4As.   Many  of  these  scholarships  are  intended   for

economic  activities, such as those  given  out  by  EDB,

A*STAR  and  IDA.  They come in, they serve for  a  while

with  the  statutory board, they go out to the  industry.

If  we exclude them, then we are talking about even fewer

scholarships,  only  about 200  out  of  1,400-1,500  top

students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the scholars who have returned to serve their

bonds,  only 40% remain in service today.  Amongst  them,

about  half are young officers in their first four  years

of service.  Many of them will end up leaving the service

before  their  bonds are up.  Typically, a scholar  these

days  leaves after 3-5 years of service.  Those who  come

in  expecting to serve till they retire are  a  minority.

They  will  serve  their bonds.  They will  fulfil  their

obligations  but they do not see themselves  serving  one

lifetime career in the Government.  They want to  go  out

and  they  do  go out.  So we let them go  and  we  bring

others in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, there is no monopoly of top talent in the

Government.  If the Government stops giving scholarships,

the impact on the private sector talent pool will not  be

enormous because we are talking about 300 people  out  of

1,500, not for life but for 5-10 years.  In fact, not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>



giving  scholarships  may  make  things  worse.   Without

scholarships,  either many of our young  talented  people

cannot afford to study overseas, or if they pay their own

way,  they  may decide not to come back at all.  And  the

Government  must get its fair share of able people,  both

in  politics and in the civil service.  Mr Leong Horn Kee

suggested  that  Mr Lee Kuan Yew should have  remained  a

lawyer,  Mr Goh Chok Tong a shipping executive,  Dr  Tony

Tan a banker and I too should not have been in Parliament

and  then  Singapore  would have a more  vibrant  private

sector.  We thank him for the compliments but let us ask:

if   we  had  all  done  this,  who  would  then  be  the

Government?   Would  we  have  a  Singapore  today?    Ms

Indranee said that perhaps PSA would today be called PTP.

I would ask:  think, who might be the Prime Minister? So,

the "private sector not stupid".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key issue here is not whom we should favour in a

public  and private sector fight for talent, but  how  to

encourage  a  healthy circulation of talents between  the

public  and  private  sectors.  We need  to  develop  our

young,  including through scholarships,  to  provide  the

education   and   the  opportunities  to   fulfil   their

potential. We do not ban Government scholars from leaving

the Government service for the private sector if that  is

their inclination.  In fact, we have now introduced a gap-year  programme, so scholars who complete  their  courses

can hunt around for a 6-12 month attachment, either to  a

super-national, such as the UN, the World Bank, the  IMF,

or  to a merchant bank like J P Morgan Investment, Morgan

Stanley  or  to  a multi-national such as Intel,  British

Telecoms.   He  spends 6-12 months  to  learn  about  the

business  world and come back and be a better  Government

officer.   One day if he goes out, he will have  business

sense,  honed at a young and impressionable  age  and  he

will  be able to make a contribution.  The challenge  for

the civil service is to attract private sector talent  to

contribute to the civil service, and at the same time, to

adopt  forward-looking policies to manage and  groom  all

our talents so that a stint

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>



in  the  public service is a value-adding experience  for

the officers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various private sector companies which

also  offer scholarships or sign-on bonuses at the  point

of  graduation  to  attract talent.  But  the  companies,

having attracted talent, have to manage and develop them,

test  them out, give them opportunities and move them  up

as  rapidly as they deserve. Unfortunately, this  is  far

harder to do than just to bring in the talent and when it

is  not  done, the scholars get discouraged, demoralised,

leave,  and the organisation stagnates.  Sometimes,  they

also say that the Government took all their talent.   But

it  is  not a simple matter of giving fewer scholarships.

It  is a matter of managing the talent, bringing them  in

and  keeping  the organisation fresh and that  is  a  top

management or board responsibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Temasek Charter and the Government's attitude

towards  divesting  GLCs  are fully  consonant  with  the

recommendations  of the EISC on Government  in  business.

The  Government  fully supports in  principle  all  those

recommendations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee went beyond the EISC proposals to

make 10 recommendations of his own.  I have already dealt

with most of them but let me recap briefly:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) To curb proliferation of GLCs. I agree that

the GLCs' growth should be disciplined but I cannot agree

never to start or grow GLCs;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Government to set up a specific timeframe for

divestment.  We cannot agree;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Government to outsource any commercial

requirements.  I agree in principle;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Review of subsidiaries under the statutory

boards and Government agencies.  I agree;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) NTUC/SLF to review its stable of companies.

This  is for NTUC/SLF to decide.  Mdm Halimah and Mr Heng

Chee How have already explained eloquently

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>



NTUC's views.  There is nothing much I can add except  to

make an appointment to visit Denticare;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) Priority to enacting competition law. I agree;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii) GLCs to enlist more private sector persons

in  boards  and management.  GLCs need to seek  the  best

talent, whether it is the private or public sector;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(viii) Encourage more MBOs and divestment to

locals.    MBO  is  one  method  of  divestment   to   be

considered,  but whether it is the best approach  depends

on  particular circumstances of the GLC and the specifics

of the MBO proposals;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ix) More GLCs and private sector cooperation as

cluster or consortium.  We agree in principle; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(x) Regular study by the Department of Statistics

(DOS) on GLCs' share of GDP.  I agree.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I ought to thank Dr Wang Kai Yuen for

giving  us  a historical perspective on this subject  and

reminding us that these same issues were debated 20 years

ago  and  probably our successors will still be  debating

them 20 years from now. We need to try to rise above  the

situation.  Do not assume that the problem for SMEs  will

go away if we do not have GLCs.  As Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai

Kee  and Mdm Halimah Yacob pointed out, without them, the

vacuum would be filled by the large private companies  or

MNCs  and  the  SMEs  would still  have  to  face  fierce

competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EISC recommendations on the Government in

business  will  help  to  define the  Government's  role,

foster    the   growth   of   private   enterprise    and

entrepreneurship.   The Temasek Charter  will  guide  the

Temasek  companies  on what Government,  as  shareholder,

expects of them. As for the private sector's concerns  on

the  GLCs,  the  Government will  tackle  those  problems

whenever they arise.  As I have said before, and I  offer

it  again, if you know of specific problems, let me know,

e-mail me, I will look into it, after removing your  name

from the e-mail.  I have done so.  Sometimes, there is a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>



reason and it has to be put right; sometimes, there is an

explanation  and  that  has  to  be  conveyed.   But  the

Government will exit from businesses that are  no  longer

relevant although it cannot do this overnight.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution is not to dump the GLCs altogether or

to  handicap  the  GLCs and prevent them  from  competing

fairly  but  robustly against private  companies.   GLCs,

private  companies and SMEs all have  roles  to  play  in

growing  our  economy and developing our  external  wing.

They   will  sometimes  compete,  but  they  should  also

cooperate  with one another.  As Ms Indranee  and  others

have said, the issue is Singapore Inc. versus the rest of

the  world. Government's overall thrust is thus  to  grow

the  private sector as a whole, whether GLCs or non-GLCs.

And  as  Mrs Fang Ai Lian pointed out, the issue is  also

entrepreneurship, because it is the spirit of  enterprise

that will help us to adapt and grow as the world changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the economy grows, and as the private sector

expands,  the  shape of the Government in  business  will

change.  The  key  is  not  whether  the  companies   are

Government-owned,  but  whether  they   are   well   run,

entrepreneurial and profitable.  We have every  intention

of  ensuring  that GLCs are as well run,  entrepreneurial

and profitable as private companies.  That is the way  to

build an efficient and vibrant economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this spirit, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support

the motion.  [Applause.]

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Leong, do you want to wrap

up?

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to thank  all  the  24  Members,

including  the 22 PAP MPs and NMPs, MOS Raymond  Lim  and

DPM Lee Hsien Loong, for speaking on this motion.  I have

listened   very   carefully  to   all   their   speeches,

particularly by MOS Raymond Lim and DPM Lee Hsien  Loong.

They  have all made very good points.  I wonder why  none

of  the Opposition MPs and the NCMP spoke on this motion.

Perhaps, they thought that this motion is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>



not very important enough for them to debate on it. I  do

not agree with them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to thank the Minister of State, Mr

Raymond  Lim for his considered reply.  I am  pleased  to

hear from him and, as explained by him, there will be  no

"Great  GLC Sale".  As to the response by DPM  Lee  Hsien

Loong,  I would like to thank him specially for his  very

thorough  and  robust  reply.   He  has  set  down  clear

policies  on  GLCs  and  the  basis  for  Government   in

business.  He has put across the total picture in a  very

clear perspective.  I would like to especially thank  him

for the clarity of his reply and explanations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, just on a few points about the comments that I

have  made.   I want to clarify that in the case  of  the

joint venture with three GLCs and a local company, I  did

not  mean  to  say that the bank had made  an  irrational

decision.   In  fact, the bank had made a  very  rational

decision.  In contrast to the private company, the  three

GLCs  are  much  larger and stronger and therefore  given

lower  interest  rate.  As the DPM  has  said,  it  is  a

question  of  size.  For a smaller private  company,  our

corporate guarantee was deemed to be of lesser value.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other point I would like to clarify is that

the  annual  report  to be prepared by  the  Ministry  of

Finance  and Temasek Holdings is meant more for the  non-listed  companies,  and is meant as  an  avenue  for  the

Government to take stock, perhaps every year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point about Ministers in private practice or

professional business, I did not say that they should  go

into  private practice or into professional business.   I

said  that  if they had been, they would have  made  very

good  entrepreneurs or good businessmen  -  "if they  had

been".   I  agree that we are glad that they did  not  go

into private business.  For the sake of Singapore, we are

pleased  to have very good Ministers in charge.   I  just

want to make the point that because of being scholars, if

they  had  not taken up the scholarship, they  could,  on

their own

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>



merits,  have become great entrepreneurs.  That  was  the

point I was trying to make.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the 10 recommendations that I made to

the  DPM,  I  did not count because he was going  through

them  very quickly.  I think I got about 6-7 right.   So,

it is above the passing mark!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to say that much criticism had been

levied  on  the  GLCs.   I  wish therefore  to  put  into

perspective the values of GLCs.  I agree that  they  have

several  plus  factors.   They have  contributed  to  the

economy,   and   given  employment.   They   are   mostly

efficient,  well run, and they are clean and non-corrupt.

Of  course,  some  GLCs, like SIA,  have  helped  to  put

Singapore on the world map.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people actually asked me why am I knocking the

GLCs.   I would like to explain that I am not complaining

about  GLCs per se.   What I am debating is the  fairness

and  the  benefits  against the evils  of  Government  in

business.    All  of  us  have  friends,  relatives   and

constituents who are working in GLCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to emphasise the point on the need to reinvent

for  the  success of Singapore, a comparison can be  made

between  Korea  and  Japan.  During the  Asian  financial

crisis in 1997, Korea was badly affected and nearly  went

bankrupt.   But  now  they  are bouncing  back  strongly,

because they have changed everything.  They have  changed

their  constitution, changed their President and  changed

the  way  their  economy is run.   In  contrast,  Japan's

economy  was drifting for over a decade, because  it  was

unwilling  to make painful but necessary changes  to  its

economic structure.  Japan is still languishing today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the debate on this Motion, much has been

said  to  clear  the air and the smoke about  GLCs.   The

concerns started about 15 years ago which resulted

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>



in  the  Public  Sector  Divestment  Committee  under  Mr

Michael  Fam.   Fifteen years later, we are still  having

this debate on GLCs.  I do hope that with the EISC Report

and  the  Temasek Charter, and the explanations given  by

the  Deputy Prime Minister, there may not be a  need  for

debate 15 years later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to conclude by agreeing with the DPM

that  going forward, GLCs will coexist side by side  with

private  companies,  each  playing  a  vital  role,  each

helping  and supporting the other to grow.  The  ultimate

objective   is   to  create  world-class  companies   for

Singapore.  It does not matter really whether they should

be  GLCs or privately owned companies.  We should have  a

good  mix of both.  Above all, we want to have a  system,

an  economic and industrial model, which is the best  for

Singapore.   We want a model that can take  us  into  the

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I wish to thank the Speaker and you, Mr and

Mdm Deputy Speakers, for your patience and indulgence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House, taking into account the Report of

the   Entrepreneurship   and  Internationalisation   Sub-Committee (EISC) of the Economic Review Committee and the

press  release by Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd on  the  new

charter of the Government-linked companies (GLCs) and  in

view  of  the  concerns of the private  sector  regarding

GLCs,    urges   the   Government   to   implement    the

recommendations of the EISC which define  the  new  roles

and  positioning of the Government and GLCs  in  business

and,   in   so  doing,  support  the  growth  of  private

enterprise and entrepreneurship in Singapore.
