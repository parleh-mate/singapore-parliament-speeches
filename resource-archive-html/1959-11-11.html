Excellency  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara  dated  the

17th   October,  1959,  informing   me   that,   in

accordance with the provisions of section 55 (1) of

<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Cabinet Member vis-a-vis member of University of Malaya academic staff)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr A. P. Rajah</b> asked the Prime Minister

whether  he is aware that the Deputy Prime Minister

is still a member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>



of the University of Malaya academic staff, that he

occupies  University staff quarters at a subsidised

rent,  that  he  is  still  a  contributor  to  the

University  of  Malaya  Academic  Staff   Provident

Scheme at the rate of 5 per cent of the salary last

drawn  by  him  and  that the University  is  still

contributing for and on his behalf at the  rate  of

15  per  cent  on  his  said  salary  to  the  said

Provident  Scheme;  and whether,  in  view  of  the

position  the  Deputy Prime Minister holds  in  the

Cabinet,  he  will make a statement  and  say  what

action he will take in the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, the Deputy Prime

Minister  has  been  granted unpaid  leave  by  the

University  of Malaya for an indefinite period  not

exceeding  five  years. The University  has  agreed

that he should be allowed to continue his work,  in

particular  his  research work  as  Reader  in  the

University. He is not paid for this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continues to occupy his old quarters and the

rent  is  $115 a month with maintenance charges  of

$25 a month. Similar quarters are being let out  to

members  of  the  public at the same  rent.  It  is

incorrect  to imply that the Deputy Prime  Minister

is  being  subsidised  in his rent.  Moreover,  the

Deputy Prime Minister, if he so wished, could  have

occupied  official quarters whose rent  would  have

been  subsidised, but he has chosen to continue  to

stay in his old University quarters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister is not a contributor to the University Academic Staff Provident Fund, but

the University has on its own account continued its

contributions  as part of the terms of  the  unpaid

leave granted him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am satisfied that the work of the Deputy Prime

Minister  in  the  University does  not  cause  any

conflict  between his public duty and  his  private

interest. I am also satisfied that such work can be

carried  out  without prejudice to  his  duties  as

Deputy Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am advised by the State Advocate-General that

the  Deputy Prime Minister's position is  perfectly

constitutional and proper and I propose to take  no

action in the matter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the

practice  that  Ministers  should  not  derive  any

benefit  from their previous employment, would  the

Minister  issue  a directive to the  University  of

Malaya that they cease to contribute to the Fund?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I refer the Member for

Farrer   Park  to  a  simple  exposition   of   the

constitutional position which is contained  in  the

book   by   Sir   Ivor  Jennings  called   "Cabinet

Government"?  He  will  find  there  a  chapter  on

Cabinet and Ministerial responsibilities which sets

out the position clearly and succinctly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The State Advocate-General has been apprised of

the facts. The files have been referred to him.  He

has  advised me that the position is proper. If the

Member  for  Farrer Park considers it improper, he

knows what his legal remedies are.

<div align="center"><b>CIVIL SERVANTS (Voluntary service on Sundays)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b> asked the Prime

Minister,  with  reference  to  the  call  by   the

Minister  for  National Development  for  voluntary

service  on Sundays by civil servants and employees

of Local Government Authorities, whether any one is

compelled,  directly or indirectly,  to  volunteer;

whether  the terms of service of those who  do  not

volunteer  will be adversely affected; and  whether

disciplinary  action  will be  taken  against  such

persons.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, no

one  was compelled to volunteer either directly  or

indirectly. The terms of service of those  who  did

not  volunteer  cannot and will  not  be  adversely

affected. The question of disciplinary action  does

not arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps if the Member would ask any of the

thousands  who did volunteer he would discover  how

willingly they volunteered and how satisfying  they

found the day's outing at Changi beach.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of the Government, I would like to

express  our  warm  appreciation of  the  excellent

response to our call for voluntary labour on public

projects.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should be glad if the Member for Kampong

Kembangan  could bring out here in  the  House  any

instance  where  direct  or indirect  pressure  was

brought to bear on civil servants to volunteer  for

Sunday work, so that the offender could be suitably

dealt  with.  But if the Member knows  of  no  such

instance,  I  can  only say that  his  question  is

vexatious anti scandalous.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  it  is  not my intention to be vexatious  and

scandalous but merely to explain the matter to  the

public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I

hope  the  Member for Kampong Kembangan will  prove

his  allegations  to the Members  of  the  Assembly

here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> A supplementary question?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): We will co-operate

with the Government, Mr Speaker. If we know of any

instance,  we will bring it to the notice  of  this

Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It would appear that that was meant

to be an indirect supplementary question!

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE IMPROVEMENT TRUST</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Applications for erection of buildings)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr A. P. Rajah</b> asked the Minister for

National  Development  how  many  applications  for

written  permission for the erection  of  buildings

under  section  61  of  the  Singapore  Improvement

Ordinance (Chapter 259) have been submitted to  the

Singapore  Improvement Trust from the  1st  day  of

June,  1959,  up  to a latest convenient  date;  of

these  how many have been granted, refused  or  are

still  awaiting  decision;  and  what  the  present

policy  of the Singapore Improvement Trust is  with

regard to such applications.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, a total of 680

applications  under  section 61  of  the  Singapore

Improvement  Ordinance  were  received  during  the

period  1st  June to 9th November, 1959.  Of  these

applications,  177  have been withdrawn,  232  have

been approved and 151 disapproved. 120 applications

were  still under consideration at the end of  that

period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Member for Farrer Park is aware, all

applications  under  section 61  of  the  Singapore

Improvement  Ordinance  have  to  conform  to   the

general  improvement  plan in accordance  with  the

provisions of the Master Plan. Within these general

requirements, the Singapore Improvement  Trust  has

adopted  certain principles for controlling various

types  of development, for instance, terrace  house

development,  flat  development  in  the   suburban

areas, and the erection of petrol stations.  Up  to

the present, there has been no change in the policy

as  these  principles are still  being  applied.  A

review,  however,  is  being made  of  the  present

policy  with  a  view  to introducing  changes,  if

necessary, later.

<div align="center"><b>VALUATION LIST FOR 1960</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for National Development)</b></div>



<br><br>2.41 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Ong Eng Guan):</b> Mr Speaker, I wish to make a

ministerial  statement on the  valuation  list  for

1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has decided not to proceed with

the proposed revision of annual values as published

in the City Council Valuation List for 1960. It has

been  decided that for assessment purposes in  1960

the  Valuation Lists of both the City  Council  and

the  Rural Board should be based on the 1959 annual

values.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assessment is considered a tax on property-owners

to  benefit  the poorer people in order to  provide

more amenities like roads, standpipes, bus shelters

and  other such amenities. However, it has now been

decided  by Government that for 1960 we  shall  use

the 1959 assessment list and the rectification of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>



anomalies in the assessment of properties  will  be

deferred.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent revision of properties in the City

area  was  expected  to bring about  an  additional

revenue  of $6 million. It has been estimated  that

99  per cent of this additional revenue comes  from

these  property-owners and commercial  enterprises.

The  money  thus collected will be used to  provide

amenities  for the benefit of all other inhabitants

of  the  island. However, it is not practicable  to

bring in this additional revenue of $6 million  for

1960  because  of  certain misunderstandings  which

have  arisen  as  a result of the rectification  of

anomalies   in   the  assessments.   Although   the

Government knows that most of these properties  are

very  much  under-assessed, it is not  possible  at

this  juncture to proceed with the original  scheme

due   to  some  unscrupulous  landlords  of   rent-controlled houses who, although not affected by the

recent  revision,  thought it fit  to  exploit  the

situation  and  try  to raise the  rents  of  their

tenants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Government believes that until such time as sufficient information has been

effectively   disseminated  amongst  the   tenants,

action  should  be deferred. For equitable  reasons

and  administrative convenience, it has also at the

same time decided that in the City area as well  as

the  Rural Board area, the Valuation List for  1960

should be based on the 1959 annual values.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE STATE ARMS AND FLAG AND NATIONAL ANTHEM BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there is a Government motion coming up for

debate  later  on  on the State Flag  and  National

Anthem,  I  will  confine  my  remarks  to  matters

relating to the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objects of the Bill are quite simple and

straightforward.  It  provides  for  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara to make regulations for the control

of  the  use  of the State Arms, Flag  and  Anthem.

These  are  the  new symbols of  an  authority  and

loyalty and it is right that there should be  rules

to  ensure that they are accorded the respect  they

deserve.  These rules will cover matters  like  the

places and times at which the Arms and Flag of  the

State  may  be  publicly displayed  or  the  Anthem

played.  Some  of  the  rules  will  prescribe  the

correct way



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>



of flying the Flag and how the State Arms should be

displayed, or prescribe that the State Flag  should

be  flown  in Government buildings such as  Courts,

Secretariats, and so on. There will also have to be

rules  about the display of the State Flag by ships

in  harbour; but more important, there will have to

be  rules to prevent afront to or abuse of our  new

symbols  of loyalty. For example, some bright  free

enterpriser  might take it into his head  to  adopt

the  State Flag or the State Arms as a trade  mark.

Then  you might find the market flooded with under-clothing, toothpaste, hair lotion and goods of that

sort  using the State Flag or Arms as a trade mark.

Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  you  will  agree  that   such

misdirected patriotism must be discouraged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will also have to be rules to prohibit the

indiscriminate  playing of the National  Anthem  in

public places. It will not do for every bar in town

to open and close for the day to the strains of the

National Anthem; nor would it add to the dignity of

the State National Anthem if it were jazzed up into

a rhumba or a samba or a conga.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill, in other words, seeks

to  ensure  that  the  new State  symbols  are  not

wilfully  brought  into  contempt,  ridicule,   and

hatred.  These are symbols of national  pride,  and

there  should  be  rules to see that  there  is  no

affront to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Rajaratnam].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read the Third time and passed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Explanatory Statement to the Bill mentions

briefly   all  the  amendments  which   are   being

proposed. The main intention of the Bill is to give

members  of  the  public,  especially  the   poorer

classes who patronise the pawnshops, the benefit of

cheaper pawnshop facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is also taken to alter the

constitution of the Pawnbrokers Licensing Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill amends the membership of the

Board.  At present, of the six members who comprise

the  Board,  the Chairman and one other person  are

appointed  by  the  Minister.  One  member  is  the

Commissioner  of Police or his representative,  and

three persons are appointed by the Justices of  the

Peace from among their own number.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Government considers, however, that in

view  of  the constitutional changes, it  would  be

more  appropriate that all appointments other  than

those   of  the  Commissioner  of  Police  or   his

representative should be made by the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 extends the redemption period of the

pledge  from three months to six months. This  will

benefit  pawners, especially the poorer  ones,  who

would  have  a  better chance of not  losing  their

pledges to the pawnbrokers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 now makes it necessary for pawnbrokers

to  take out insurance cover, not only against fire

as at present, but also for loss by theft, robbery,

etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police have drawn attention to a case early

this  year  where a pawnshop was robbed of  $50,000

worth  of  pledges.  Pawners would  suffer  if  the

pledges were not insured against such loss.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 reduces the interest rate from the

present maximum rate of 2 per cent per mensem or 24

per  cent per annum to 1 per cent per mensem or  12

per  cent per annum on the amount of the loan. This

reduction  will bring the interest rate  into  line

with the new Moneylenders Ordinance in that 12  per

cent  per  annum has been fixed for secured  loans.

This   reduction  would  afford  financial   relief

especially  to the poorer classes of  pawners,  who

pawn their belongings, often belongings they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>



cannot afford to do without, in order to get  money

quickly for one urgent reason or another.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the fact that they have pledged their

belongings,  they still have to  pay  24  per  cent

interest for the money they get as against  12  per

cent  under the Moneylenders Ordinance for  seizure

of loans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their business, pawnshop owners do not depend

entirely   on  the  interest  payable  by  pawners.

Pawnbrokers also get the benefit from the  sale  of

unredeemable pledges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representations have been made by the Pawnbrokers

Association  that  the proposed  reduction  of  the

present  interest  rate  by  half  would  seriously

affect  the  pawnshop business  to  the  extent  of

virtually  having to run them at  a  loss,  leading

possibly to the closing down of the business.  They

pointed  out that the interest rate had  just  been

reduced  from  3 or 4 per cent to  2  per  cent  in

September 1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be pointed out, however, that the

purpose  of  abolishing the previous tender  system

and instituting the present licensing system was to

encourage more pawnbrokers into the field. However,

this  seemed  to  have failed, and  the  pawnbroker

business is very much of a monopoly in the hands of

four or five families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this and the representations made, I

shall, at the end of the Second Reading, move  that

the Bill be committed to a Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 makes the necessary amendments to those

sections and Schedules of the Ordinance where it is

proposed that all unredeemed articles exceeding $50

instead of $100 as at present should be disposed of

by  public  auction. At present, any pledge  pawned

for  $100 or under, if not redeemed within the time

allowed by the Ordinance, shall, at the end of  the

redemption period, become the pawnbroker's absolute

property.   Any  article  pawned  for   an   amount

exceeding  $50  must  be something  of  value,  and

disposal by public auction would at least give  the

pawner a last opportunity



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>



to get it back by bidding for it, though whether he

does it or not is another matter. Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 121 (2) of the Singapore (Constitution)

Order in Council, 1958, provides in effect that any

reference  in  any written law to the  Governor  in

Council  shall in relation to any period after  the

3rd  June, 1959, be construed as a reference to the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The references to the powers of the Governor in

Council  in  the Ordinance of Singapore  have  been

examined  and it is considered that some  of  these

powers  can  be more appropriately exercised  by  a

Minister. The Bill therefore seeks to transfer such

powers  to a Minister. I do not propose to deal  in

detail  with these transfers which are set  out  in

the  First Schedule to the Bill. They deal  in  the

main  with  the power to make rules or regulations,

the  hearing  and  determination  of  appeals,  the

appointment of statutory boards and the  making  of

executive  orders  for  the administration  of  the

Ordinance. The exercise of such powers does not, in

general,  raise  questions of  policy,  and  it  is

therefore unnecessary to refer such matters to  the

Cabinet so that the Cabinet can advise the Yang di-Pertuan Negara on the exercise of the powers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also makes consequential amendments to

the  Interpretation and General  Clauses  Ordinance

and to other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>



Ordinances, as set out in clause 2 of the Bill  and

in the Second Schedule to the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill seeks to repeal the Council of

Ministers  Powers Delegation Ordinance,  as  it  is

felt that it would be inappropriate to delegate the

powers of the Cabinet to any public officer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might add, Sir, that the provisions of the Bill

have   been  discussed  with  the  United   Kingdom

Commission, who have agreed to its provisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 121 (2) (a) of the Singapore

(Constitution) Order in Council, 1958, provides  in

effect  that any reference to the Governor  in  any

written law of Singapore shall in relation  to  any

period after the 3rd June, 1959, be construed as  a

reference to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The references to the Governor in the Ordinances

of  Singapore have been examined and in some  cases

it  is  considered  that the powers  given  to  the

Governor can be more appropriately exercised  by  a

Minister.  This Bill, therefore, seeks to  transfer

such powers to a Minister. I do not propose to deal

with  the  transfers in detail. They deal  for  the

most  part with appointments of public officers  to

statutory   posts,   the  making   of   rules   and

regulations, the hearing of appeals and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>



making   of   orders  for  the  administration   of

Ordinances. The exercise of these powers  does  not

raise  questions of policy and it is  felt  that  a

reference  to the Cabinet, in such cases to  enable

the Cabinet to advise the Yang di-Pertuan Negara is

unnecessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to make a number of

miscellaneous amendments rendered necessary by  the

transfer  of  powers  to  Ministers.  For  example,

whenever  the  Governor  was  required  to  act  by

proclamation, it is proposed that when the power is

to be exercised by a Minister, it should be done by

notification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the introduction of the Bill, its

provisions  have  been discussed  with  the  United

Kingdom  Commission, and I will  at  the  Committee

Stage  of this Bill move two amendments which  have

been suggested to the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, in accordance with subsection

(2)  of  section  1 of the Control of  Imports  and

Exports Ordinance (Chapter 214), resolves that  the

aforesaid Ordinance shall continue in force  for  a

further  period of one year commencing on  the  8th

day of December, 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Ordinance was first promulgated in 1950 and

had a life of only one year. Since then it has been

extended from year to year. I now move that  it  be

extended  for  a further period of  one  year.  The

Ordinance  empowers the Minister to make orders  to

regulate  or  prohibit  the import  and  export  of

goods. We impose as few restrictions as we can, and

in  the  case  of  imports, almost all  goods  from

almost  all  countries can be imported  under  open

general   licence.  That  is  to  say,  no  special

individual  licence need be obtained to import  any

particular article. Export controls are  also  very

few.  But in principle, we must have the powers  to

impose  these controls, so as to be able to  ensure

destinational  control over supplies  of  strategic

importance. If we abandon these powers, the  supply

countries  may  refuse to deliver  to  us  quite  a

number  of  goods of these types, since  we  cannot

guarantee that we can still control their re-export

from this State.

standing in the name of the Deputy Prime Minister,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (2) of

section  490  of  the  Merchant Shipping  Ordinance

(Chapter  207), resolves that the Merchant Shipping

(Fees) Rules, 1959, published as Notification No. S

(N.S.)  135 in the Gazette Supplement No. 27  dated

9th  October,  1959,  as contained  in  Paper  S.L.

(N.S.) 18 of 1959, be approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rules which are the subject of this motion

are  designed  to  increase to a small  extent  the

revenue   of   the   Marine  and   Marine   Surveys

Departments.   The   Merchant  Shipping   Ordinance

contains  many provisions designed to  ensure  that

ships should be fully equipped and their crew fully

qualified  to  perform their functions,  so  as  to

ensure efficiency and safety at sea.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ordinance imposes standards on both men and

ships. It also imposes a duty on the Government  to

enforce  these  standards.  This  latter  duty   is

discharged   by  the  Marine  and  Marine   Surveys

Departments.  These  departments  carry   out   the

necessary inspections and examination of ships  and

certify   that  standards  are  being   maintained.

Inspection  and examination entails expenditure  of

considerable sums of money by the State.  It  is  a

practice  in  most maritime states  to  recover  at

least  a  proportion of such expenditure by levying

fees for services rendered. This practice



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>



is given legislative sanction in the Ordinance, the

provisions of which I need not refer in detail.  If

hon.  Members would glance at the Sessional  Paper,

which is the subject of this motion, they will  see

the  many  and varied services which the Government

is  statutorily obliged to render.  The  scale  and

level of fees is revised from time to time in order

to  preserve  the  ratio between the  cost  of  the

services and the charges which are levied for them.

The  last revision took place in 1954. Since  then,

the  cost  of  the services has increased  and  the

rules  are  intended to raise  the  scale  of  fees

charged and thereby to increase the revenue derived

from them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not propose to launch into a

in  the  political  and social life  of  a  people.

Suffice  it to say that they are accepted  features

of any government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National flags, crests and anthems express

symbolically the hopes and ideals of a people.  The

symbols  by  themselves may  be  meaningless.  What

gives  them  meaning  are the  ideas  and  emotions

behind the symbols. We respect not the flag as such

or  the State arms or the anthem but the sentiments

and ideas they represent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The possession of a national flag, anthem and

crest  is,  for  a people, symbols of self-respect.

Through  these  a  people acquire  identity  and  a

personality of their own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The symbols we have had so far were symbols that

emphasised  our subjection to the will  of  others.

They   were  symbols  of  dominance,  of  authority

imposed from the outside.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that Singapore is a self-governing State, it

is  right  and proper that it should have  its  own

symbols  of  authority  and loyalty.  Only  through

these  new  symbols can we express the spirit  that

today moves our people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in designing the new symbols, the

Government  has  worked in close co-operation  with

Opposition Parties because we want these symbols to

express the sentiments and aspirations, not of  any

particular  group,  Party or section,  but  of  the

people of Singapore as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Mr Speaker, symbols are a very tricky

business.  They  can mean whatever a  person  wants

them  to  mean.  The same symbol  can  be  given  a

friendly or an unfriendly interpretation.  We  have

the  same  sort of difficulty over words which  are

far  more precise in their meaning than colours and

symbols.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This House, for example, Sir, is divided into a

Government  and an Opposition precisely because  we

cannot  get  a  unanimous  interpretation  on  such

seemingly    harmless   words   like   "democracy",

"socialism", and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in order to prevent any too free a

translation of the new symbols that we  have  taken

the  precaution  of  providing,  as  it  were,   an

authorised  translation of the  symbols  which  our

flag and State arms carry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colour red stands for universal brotherhood

and  equality  of man. Whatever the colour  of  our

skin,  the  shape of our nose and eyes,  the  blood

that  gives  us  life is of one  colour - even  among

those  who  claim  to have blue blood.  The  colour

white  signifies  purity and  virtue.  So  the  two

colours  combined signify that we hope  to  achieve

brotherhood and equality through purity and virtue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crescent moon signifies a country eternally

young.  This is expressive of one of the  essential

qualities  of  our  people, for not  only  are  our

people physically young but they are also young  in

spirit and outlook.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This refutes the traditional picture which

depicts  Asian  countries as countries  which  have

grown  senile, as countries burdened  with  ancient

and meaningless traditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This picture is not true of Asia today. It is a

youthful, restless Asia.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Singapore, like the new Asia, therefore,

finds  its inspirations in what it hopes to  do  in

the  future  rather than what it has  done  in  the

past. Only the old, grown weak and complacent, hark

nostalgically back to the past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only the youthful who are more conscious of

the future waiting to unfold before them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the five stars represent the ideals on which

the  new  State of Singapore is founded - democracy,

peace,  progress, justice and equality.  Those  who

would  destroy  these are our  enemies.  Those  who

would repudiate them are false prophets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These symbols are also incorporated in the State

arms  which also has a lion and a tiger.  The  lion

represents  Singapore and the tiger our links  with

the people of the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the State national anthem "Majulah

Singapura", it has already been tacitly accepted by

the  people  as  their song. It has been  sung  and

played  as Singapore's anthem unofficially on  many

occasions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would have liked so much to

end  this debate by getting the whole House to give

its  rendering  of  this  stirring  anthem,  but  I

gather, Sir, that the rules of debate would have to

be  completely relaxed for what, I am  sure,  would

have been a historic performance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flag, the State arms and the anthem are new

symbols  of national pride. They are expressive  of

the  new  spirit  of self-reliance  and  dedication

which inspires our people today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> I second the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.39 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Parties

on  the  Opposition side, I wholeheartedly  support

the motion before us and the opinions expressed  in

this Assembly today. Therefore, Mr Speaker, I wish

to congratulate particularly the Hon. the Prime



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>



Minister  who, I am of the opinion, has  been  very

compromising in accepting constructive suggestions.

What  we  have achieved today, by our  decision  to

give full support to the motion before us is indeed

historical, and history will show that what we have

fully supported today will also receive the support

and acclaim of our future posterity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we sit in opposition to the Hon. the

Prime Minister's Party, we do not hesitate here  to

make  known  our  appreciation of his  attitude  of

compromise   which  is  significant.   One   should

remember   that  in  the  history  of   the   Malay

Archipelago, if I am not mistaken it was  in  1292,

there  existed an emblem which our own State emblem

now  closely  resembles, in part if not  in  whole.

This  serves to remind us here in Singapore,  which

is one of the component islands of Malaysia, of the

solidarity  of  the  indigenous  people  of   these

islands.  Therefore, because of this, on behalf  of

U.M.N.O. particularly,  we  wish  to  support  the

Government   wholeheartedly   for   bringing   into

existence  a new State emblem with such a  historic

background dating back to 1292, to be the symbol of

our  joint  struggle on the road to full  political

independence - a thing we have yet to achieve  today.

For  that  reason,  I say that the  State  flag  is

welcomed by U.M.N.O. The State flag (upper half  in

red and the lower half in white with a crescent and

five  stars,  as  described  by  the  Minister  for

Culture   just   now)   has  a  true   significance

particularly  to  U.M.N.O. and  generally  to  the

people of Islam because we believe, as followers of

Islam,   that   the  five  stars - apart   from   the

interpretation given by the Minister - also symbolise

our  firm faith in our religious beliefs, for  they

could symbolise the five main pillars of Islam.  To

us  the State flag signifies the firm belief in God

of the people of Singapore. Mr Speaker, my remarks

about  the State flag similarly apply to the  State

crest. It can be said that the significance of  the

crest  is  a  matter which can be put  into  effect

because  it shows that a tiger and a lion can  meet

in  peace. This is a good omen for Singapore in its

approach  towards a progressive State for which  we

are all aiming.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, we know that the Tunku has

stated  that  the Australians should  learn  Malay.

Therefore,  it is indeed wise that the State  motto

and national anthem should be in Malay. I feel that

the  Government and the Opposition will unanimously

support  the idea that Malay should be  the  lingua

franca  of  Malaysia. If possible, the  Australians

too could learn the national language.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Leong Keng Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  regarding  our  State  flag,   the

Minister  for  Culture says the five  stars  on  it

symbolise  democracy,  peace, progress,  prosperity

and  justice. Democracy is signified  by  the  fact

that our State is a democratic State, and peace  by

the  fact  that the State wishes to have a peaceful

society.  We are opposed to a warlike society.  Our

State,  although  a youthful State,  must  progress

gradually.  Justice  in our present  society  means

that whether a thing is reasonable or unreasonable,

we must deal with it justly and with discipline. In

our  State  there is no class or race  division  or

religious   prejudice.  What   these   five   stars

symbolise is very appropriate to our State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crescent moon represents a rising and

youthful  State. At present we are still young;  we

are  a young people and energetic, and we will grow

stronger. The colour red symbolises that we are all

brothers,  irrespective of race  or  religion.  The

colour  white symbolises that in our new State  the

people  are pure and virtuous, unlike the  previous

colonial government where there were some evils. On

the  national crest, i.e. the State arms, the tiger

and the lion represent ultimate merger of Singapore

with   Malaya,  when  the  people  of  Malaya   and

Singapore  will  live together. The  title  of  our

national anthem is "Majulah Singapura" - meaning that

Singapore  is  progressing every day. Therefore,  I

fully  support our State flag, national anthem  and

State arms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students of this country are already learning

the score of the national anthem. Those who are  in

or  out of school must also be familiar with it.  I

also hope that all the people of Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>



will  be able to sing the national anthem.  I

support the the motion.



<br><br>3.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

first  of  all,  we  would  like  to  say  that  we

appreciate this new procedure of inviting  an  All-Party  Committee  to consider matters  of  national

importance  or matters which are controversial.  We

know,   Sir,   that  the  Government   side   could

unilaterally impose its ideas on the House, but  we

are glad that another procedure was adopted and  we

do  hope that in future whenever such matters arise

this procedure could also be adopted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, naturally different Parties have different

ideas  as to flag designs, and personally  I  would

have  liked it better if the public could have been

invited  initially to submit their own ideas.  But,

of  course, time did not permit that and  the  next

best thing was to have this All-Party Committee. We

are very glad that ultimately agreement was reached

and  although perhaps not one group could say  that

the State flag satisfies us in every respect yet it

should  symbolise the desires, the  hopes  and  the

aspirations  of  all  citizens  who  are  loyal  to

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture, Sir, has explained in

detail the significance of the various parts of the

State flag - that the red colour stands for universal

brotherhood, and the white colour represents purity

and  virtue.  These  two, Sir, are  high  standards

which we in politics find not easy to practise, but

we  do hope that since they are a part of our State

flag we should try to apply those standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five stars are indicated as signifying

democracy, peace, progress, justice and equality. I

notice  that  prosperity is not  mentioned,  but  I

suppose it is implied that when there are peace and

progress  in  the  country  then  there   must   be

prosperity, because there is no doubt that-



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> It is all within quotes!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> - the people of this country

desire a higher standard of living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the U.M.N.O. representatives conveyed the

opinion  of their Executive that one of  the  stars

should  stand for unity through godliness or  unity

under God.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>



Now,  we  know  that this country is  inhabited  by

people having different religions and there  is  an

impression -   I   am   glad   that   the   U.M.N.O.

representatives did say clearly that it was a wrong

impression - that  U.M.N.O. was trying  to  make  the

people  of Singapore believe in their one religion.

Their  idea  was that unity under God  means  unity

under  the  God of Muslims, Christians, Hindus  and

even all those who do not believe in God. Now, Sir,

that may be regarded as a controversial issue,  but

we would like to draw the attention of the House to

this new approach which helped to settle the war in

Cyprus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that in Cyprus the problem of communalism

or racialism is almost similar to that in this part

of  the  world.  And only last year,  there  was  a

shooting  war between the Muslim Cypriots  and  the

Greek Christian Cypriots and the British soldiers-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was just wondering how the

incidents in Cyprus could be incorporated into  our

flag!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the idea of

unity  and  the  fact that U.M.N.O. representatives

conveyed  that  idea  as  being  feasible;  and  in

Cyprus,  Archbishop  Makarios attributed  this  new

unity  to  the  fact that when both sides  regarded

this  as  practical, then they had a new  approach,

and these are his words, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Humanity fell into disaster and was involved in

hatred  and enmity, because she lost the right  way

which guides to brotherhood, solidarity and love."



<br><br>And he said that he hoped to create in Cyprus a new

pattern of unity under God.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have already heard it reported that in

Australia  the Prime Minister of our good neighbour

has  said  that  it  is difficult  to  have  merger

between  Singapore  and the Federation  because  of

certain  differences in outlook. I think that  this

new approach suggested by U.M.N.O. could be one  of

the  ways  that  could bring about  unity  in  this

country and between us.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in this spirit, Sir, I support the motion

before the House.



<br><br>3.56 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Bukit Timah)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, today is a historic day

and a most happy occasion, not only for me but also

for all Members of this Assembly as well as for all

the  people  of  Singapore, because in  this  House

today  all  Parties,  both the Opposition  and  the

Government,   have  been  able  to   forget   their

differences  of  opinion and unite  on  a  national

issue which we are discussing today. As a Member of

this  House, I am very proud because this is a good

example  of agreement on a national issue which  is

of common interest to us all. We are able to forget

our  divergent  policies  and  our  differences  of

opinion.  May the adoption of this motion  and  the

acceptance of the new flag for our new State with a

new status signify that the people of Singapore are

prepared  to live and fit themselves to live  as  a

people of a free, independent State!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who would interpret the colours

of  red and white with various connotations, as was

done  by  the  Hon. the Minister for  Culture,  the

member of U.M.N.O. and the member of S.P.A. It  has

been  said that the colours red and white had  been

the  emblem  of past Malay superiority  during  the

time of Hang Tuah or during the Sri Vijaya Kingdom.

This  is  a matter for the historians to ascertain.

But  for  us,  the  people of  Singapore,  who  are

members of a multi-racial society, I would say that

if  we  wound  a part of our body, red  blood  will

flow.  The red colour therefore signifies  that  we

are one, that we believe in unity, and that we live

in  unity  without  any discrimination  whatsoever;

whilst the white colour symbolises our sincerity of

purpose,   and  that  we  are  prepared   to   make

sacrifices in the interests of unity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the stars embodied in our emblem it

has  been said that they symbolise the five  tenets

of  Islam;  and  also that they signify  democracy,

peace, progress, justice and equality.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think all these interpretations can be accepted

by  posterity  according to the progress  of  their

ideas  and  their level of thought. But for  us  we

should feel proud because we have been able to base

our aspirations and sentiments on five precepts  of

life.  If  Indonesia  is well-known  for  its  five

precepts  of Panchasila and Afro-Asia for its  five

international  codes  of  behaviour,  we  too,   in

Singapore, as a new State, have brought  forth  our

five basic principles and call them Panchasila,  or

five  codes of behaviour. Panchasila is a  Sanskrit

word meaning five principles of behaviour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, concerning our State Arms - the lion and the tiger - it is generally accepted that the

lion  had been the symbol for Singapore since  Sang

Nila  Utama  first set foot in Singapore.  Likewise

the  tiger is also known for its strength,  and  is

incorporated in the State Arms of the Federation of

Malaya.  As  the Hon. the Minister for Culture  has

said,   this   signifies  the  unity  between   the

Federation of Malaya and Singapore. The lion is  an

animal which is only found in Africa, and the tiger

is  an animal well-known in Asia, equally noble and

strong.  This  can  also  therefore  mean  that  in

Singapore   the  spirit  of  Afro-Asia   has   been

assimilated as from now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the national anthem, this was composed

by  a  composer from among the people of Singapore,

in  an atmosphere where the people are imbued  with

the    spirit   and   determination   to    achieve

independence. It was thus that the national  anthem

was  composed and was accepted by the  people,  and

finally  accepted  by  this  Assembly  to  be   our

national anthem. Our pride is even greater  because

the    national   anthem   typifies   the   earnest

aspirations of the nation - the sincerity and loyalty

of  the  people. This expresses the  unity  of  the

nation,  the  singleness of purpose of the  people,

and  will  be a slogan which will unite the  people

together, irrespective of race, creed and beliefs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the three national emblems - the State Arms,

the  State  flag and the national anthem - have  been

accepted by all sections of the people through  all

their  representatives who are present today.  This

indeed is a very significant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>



beginning for us to unite ourselves in a spirit  of

self-sacrifice, and the struggle for  the  creation

of a fully-pledged independent and sovereign state.

Let us resolve then that we will defend these State

emblems to the utmost, so long as the waves of  the

sea  wash  our shores, the State flag of  Singapore

flutters   in  the  breeze,  the  national   anthem

resounds in the air, and the State Arms be seen  at

all times.



<br><br>4.06 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Ramaswamy (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  new  Yang  di-Pertuan   Negara

assumes  duty  on the 3rd December. Since  we  have

been liberated, we should have a national anthem, a

crest  and  a  flag  for  ourselves.  These  become

necessary.  Therefore, for our Singapore,  we  have

prepared    them.   These   are    acceptable    by

everyone - after  having consulted  all  the  Parties

represented in this Legislative Assembly.  Everyone

has agreed to all the three. The crest consists  of

a  red  shield on which are emblazoned  a  crescent

moon   and   five  stars  in  white.  The  crescent

represents  the growing Singapore. The  five  stars

stand for democracy, peace, progress, justice,  and

equality.  The red colour symbolises the  universal

brotherhood  and equality of man. The white  colour

signifies  purity and virtue. The whole  shield  is

supported by a lion on the left and a tiger on  the

right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parties have also agreed to all these things.

They  can  interpret the five stars as "Panchasila"

or  in any way they like. Coming to the flag, it is

red  on the upper half and white on the lower half.

Our  national  symbols are not based  on  creed  or

races. These symbols are acceptable to everyone.



<br><br>4.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the object

of  the  State flag, the State crest and the  State

anthem  is to evoke in the hearts and minds of  our

people,  feelings of loyalty and unity towards  the

State of which they are constituent members.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we set on this task of drawing up a symbol

which  would  receive universal acclamation,  there

were  certain  principles which  had  already  been

ordained by the rules of heraldry. I would like  to

pay  a tribute to the Deputy Prime Minister for the

thorough  and methodical manner in which he  delved

into  these rules of heraldry, and for having  done

the spade-work of the "dos" and "don'ts" of drawing

a  flag and a crest. Amongst other things, I learnt

of  the necessity of having supporting figures  and

balance,  and  lions  rampant  and  other  abstruse

things  connected  with animals.  But  surprisingly

enough,  if one looks at the book of flags and  the

book   of  crests,  there  is  a  limit  to   human

ingenuity. The number of basic symbols that one can

use  is  limited,  and the juxtaposition  of  these

symbols is also limited. The number of combinations

of  colours  which  would  strike  the  human  mind

vividly is also relatively limited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I think we have a great deal to

rejoice  over in having drawn up a simple  striking

symbol  which  has,  with the blessings  which  all

Parties have given it today, every reason to endure

as  the  emblems of the State and which will  evoke

loyalty  and unity in our people. We are glad  that

this  motion  will be passed without  a  dissenting

voice.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes. Mr Speaker, Sir, this is

one  of  the  Bills  which has obviously  universal

acclaim,  though I did warn that the interpretation

of  symbols is a very tricky business, and we  have

had  a  number of very striking interpretations  of

what  these symbols could mean. Generally they have

been  helpful,  and  I  hope  to  keep  within  the

framework of the spirit of the explanation provided

for  the  symbols,  because I am  quite  sure  that

somebody  could say that the colours red and  white

are  colours you find on a barber's pole. So I hope

that  in the future, any interpretation to be  made

of these symbols would be in keeping with,

<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the   section  in  the  Singapore  Telephone  Board

Ordinance which prescribes the constitution of  the

Singapore  Telephone  Board  is  section  5.   That

section reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"5.-(l) The Board shall consist of-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a Chairman;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) a Deputy Chairman; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) three other members,



<br><br>all  of whom shall be appointed by the Governor  in

Council."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Governor in Council" now, of course, Mr

Speaker, is the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On or before the 31st of August this year, the

composition of the Board was: a Chairman, a  Deputy

Chairman  and three other members. On the  31st  of

August this year, the period of appointment of  the

Chairman came to an end and his appointment as such

therefore lapsed. The period of appointment of  one

of  the  four other members also came to an end  on

the  31st  of August this year, and his appointment

therefore also lapsed, leaving three members on the

Board on the 1st of September this year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Gazette of Friday, 4th September, 1959,

there appeared on page 470 thereof the names of two

members of the Board. One was Mr Goh Kee Song, who

was gazetted as Chairman of the Singapore Telephone

Board for a term of one year, with effect from  1st

September,   1959.   The  other  appointment,   Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  which  immediately  followed   the

appointment  of the chairman, is that  of  Mr  Lui

Boon  Poh  as  a member of the Singapore  Telephone

Board for a term of one year, with effect from  1st

September,  1959.  So that,  as  from  the  1st  of

September,  these  two members,  it  would  appear,

became members of the Board. I understand that  the

other  three members of the Board have  since  then

sent   in   their  resignations.  I  have  searched

throughout  the Gazettes for further  notifications

as  to  the  names of other members who have  taken

their places, but, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am unable to

find  those names. That is the first point which  I

wish to raise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, Mr Speaker, Sir, is this. I

have  already  quoted  part of  section  5  of  the

Singapore  Telephone Board Ordinance to the  House.

Now, subsection (2) of section 5 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No person who is in the public service of the

Colony  shall  be  appointed to the  Board  by  the

Governor  in Council [now, of course, the Yang  di-Pertuan Negara]".



<br><br>So,  therefore, there is a group of persons who are

excluded  from service on this Board and  they  are

persons  who  are  in  the public  service  of  the

Colony.  There is a definition of "public  officer"

in  section  2  of  the Ordinance  which  reads  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"public officer" means a person holding any

office of emolument under the Crown in the Colony;'



<br><br>which means a Government servant, in other words. I

take it, Mr Speaker, Sir, that section 5 (2) takes

within  its  net a bigger group of persons  than  a

public  officer.  Had it only intended  to  exclude

Government  officers, section 5  (2)  quite  easily

could have read, "No person who is a public officer

shall be appointed to the Board by the Governor  in

Council." But the Legislature had seen fit to use a

different phrase, "who is in the public service  of

the Colony shall be appointed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>



...". Therefore, the expression "who is in the public

service of the Colony", as I understand it,  should

be  given  a  more extensive meaning  than  "public

officer".  If the House accepts that,  let  us  now

examine  the nature of the appointments which  have

appeared in the Gazette.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh Kee Song, I understand, is a young accountant who, until quite recently, was studying

accountancy  in the University of Melbourne.  After

having  passed  his  accountancy  examinations   he

returned to Singapore and found employment  in  the

City Council. After the advent of the P.A.P. in the

City  Council and under the Mayorship  of  the  now

Minister for National Development, Mr Goh Kee Song

was   appointed  Acting  Registrar   of   Vehicles.

Latterly, he was also appointed to the position  of

Acting  Assessor  of the City Council.  So  he  now

holds,  in so far as the City Council is concerned,

two  positions - Acting  Registrar  of  Vehicles  and

Acting  Assessor. And he has now been appointed  to

the  Singapore Telephone Board as its Chairman. The

first question that arises, therefore, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  is  this: is this appointment a correct  one?

Does it violate the provisions of section 5 (2)  of

the  Singapore Telephone Board Ordinance? It would,

I  suppose, be contended by the Minister that  City

Council   employees   are  not   public   officers.

Certainly  that would be correct because  a  public

officer is a person in the employment of the Crown.

But  section  5 (2) of the Ordinance  says  "public

service of the Colony". And if City Council service

is  not public service, Mr Speaker, Sir, then what

is  that  public service, beside that of Government

service  in  which a public officer finds  himself,

which  is public service within the meaning of  the

section?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phrase "public service" has received judicial

interpretation  and  that  interpretation  will  be

found,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir, in  Words  and  Phrases

Judicially  Defined,  volume  4,  page  436,   1944

edition.  May  I  read  under the  heading  "Public

Service":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A railway act provided that if at any time it

should  be made to appear to the Board of Trade  to

be  requisite for the public service,  the  company

should lay down additional rails."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>



The  question  that arose there, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

was, what is the meaning of public service? And the

quotation  which  I  am now  going  to  read  is  a

quotation  from  a  judgment  delivered   in   that

particular case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It was argued that the expression "requisite for

the  public service" means requisite for the public

service of the Government or of Her Majesty. But we

see  no reason for taking "public service" to  mean

no  more  than  Government public  service  or  the

service of Government acting for the public. And we

think any service which would supply wants felt  by

the public or which the public might reasonably  be

desirous of having on its own behalf is included.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the basis of that judgment, Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  submit,  with respect, that "public service"  as

defined in section 5 (2) of the Singapore Telephone

Board  Ordinance  takes in  the  category  of  City

Council   employees.  If  I  am  correct  in   that

submission,  then the appointment of  Mr  Goh  Kee

Song  as Chairman is certainly ultra vires. On  the

other  appointment - Mr Lui Boon Poh. He is  also  a

member  of the City Council. I understand  that  he

joined the City Council under the mayorship of  our

now  present  Minister  for  National  Development.

Prior  to  joining City Council service, he  was  a

salesman.   But   he   was  appointed   as   Acting

Superintendent,  Town Cleansing  Department.  Since

then  he has made such a good job of it that  I  am

now  told  he is Deputy Administrator of  the  City

Council.  What  I  said  with  reference   to   the

Chairman,  Sir,  in  so far as  the  illegality  is

concerned,  or,  shall  I  say,  the  ultra   vires

position is concerned, applies equally to  Mr  Lui

Boon  Poh. So that if the other three members  have

resigned and no other appointments have been  made,

it  appears  to  me  that there are  now  only  two

members  on  the  Board. Since  both  of  them  are

members in the public service of the Colony,  their

appointments are ultra vires.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also draw the attention of the House to

section   9   of  the  Singapore  Telephone   Board

Ordinance which reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The quorum at all meetings of the Board shall be

two members present in addition to the Chairman  or

Deputy Chairman, and, in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>



the  absence  of the Chairman, the Deputy  Chairman

shall preside at such meetings."



<br><br>I  read  that  to mean, Mr Speaker, Sir,  that  in

addition  to the Chairman, there must be two  other

members to form a quorum.



<br><br>4.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Ong Eng Guan):</b> Mr Speaker, I wish to describe in

detail  the  position  of the  Singapore  Telephone

Board, when I was first asked by the Prime Minister

to take over its functions, so that the public will

understand why we have these appointments.  When  I

first  took over the Singapore Telephone Board,  I

found,  to my horror, that the General Manager  was

paid  $4,150  a month, not including other  special

benefits  like leave pay, special housing allowance

and other various benefits; that the Deputy General

Manager is over 60 years of age, or nearing 60, and

getting  about $4,000 a month; and that there  were

many other anomalies which had to be rectified.  As

such,   we   felt   that  a   certain   amount   of

reorganisation work had to be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August this year, Mr Speaker, the retiring

Chairman of the Telephone Board, Mr Loke Wan  Tho,

came  to  see me and he indirectly asked me whether

he  would be granted permission to stay on. I  told

him  that the policy of the new Government  was  to

reorganise  all  statutory  Boards  so   that   the

interests  of the people could be looked  after.  I

further  requested him to do this, "If you will  be

kind  enough to ask the other three members of  the

Board   to   retire   on  their  own   initiative?"

Accordingly, the other three members of  the  Board

submitted their resignations. Mr Speaker,  we  had

nothing  personal against the members  of  the  old

Telephone Board as such, but we felt that  all  the

five  members  of  the  Board represented  business

interests.  In order to look into other aspects  of

telephone facilities - for instance, the rural  areas

have been completely ignored in the past: the trade

union world has also been completely ignored in the

past - we  set about the task of reorganisation.  Our

object   was   to  have  as  much  as  possible   a

representative   field  in  the   newly-constituted

Telephone Board.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 1st of September, Mr Goh Kee Song was

appointed Chairman of the Singapore Telephone Board

when Mr Loke Wan Tho's term of appointment lapsed.

I  must  clarify, Mr Speaker, what and who is  Mr

Goh  Kee Song. The Member for Farrer Park has  said

that  Mr  Goh Kee Song was from the University  of

Melbourne. That is not correct. I had never met Mr

Goh  Kee Song until he joined the City Council.  He

was  from the University of Tasmania, and, I think,

as  usual, the Member for Farrer Park's sources  of

information, or his informants, were wrong. Mr Goh

Kee  Song  studied accountancy, as the  Member  for

Farrer  Park said, not long ago. He has  not,  like

the Member for Farrer Park, taken up law before the

war.  But he is an expert in his trade. He  studied

accountancy  and,  I believe, got  his  accountancy

degree  as  far  back as eight or nine  years  ago.

Although he would not have the same amount of  grey

matter  as the Member for Farrer Park has, he  has,

however,  got  a  degree  in  commerce.  He  is   a

Chartered  Accountant and had worked  in  Australia

for  some  years before he joined the City Council.

From  what  I knew about him, Mr Speaker,  he  was

engaged   in   Australia  by  a  firm  of   English

accountants  in Singapore at the rate of  $1,400  a

month. He came to Singapore and worked in this firm

for  nearly  a  year. Because of the discrimination

against  local accountants in this particular  firm

and  the  fact  that he was not  willing  to  serve

expatriates and Europeans - as the Member for  Farrer

Park  would like him to serve - for whom he got  much

business, he got fed up with the job and he sent in

his  letter  of  resignation. Later,  there  was  a

vacancy  in  the  City Council to supervise  a  $30

million contract in Ulu Pandan in which the  Member

for Farrer Park had a hand - $30 million being handed

over   to   an  expatriate  firm  and  paying   the

consultants   $2  million  in  fees   without   any

accounting or engineering supervision from the City

Council. So Mr Goh Kee Song was asked to supervise

the  contract  which  the Member  for  Farrer  Park

during  his  time in the City Council  did  not  do

properly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true, Mr Speaker, that Mr Goh Kee Song

has  held  two  positions since the new  Government

came  into  power. First, he was made the Registrar

of  Vehicles  and then the City Assessor  but,  Mr

Speaker, this is because of the past policy in  the

City  Council in which the Member for  Farrer  Park

had a hand. There was no attempt made to malayanise

certain  departments  and when  the  City  Assessor

left-



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> On a point of order, Sir. The

question,   Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  is  the  Singapore

Telephone Board, not the City Council or Mr A.  P.

Rajah in the City Council.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It did occur to me that the Minister

for   National   Development   was   embarking   on

personalties  which  are quite  irrelevant  to  the

subject which we are discussing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, it is because the

Member for Farrer Park has indirectly hinted at the

relationship  between Mr Goh Kee Song  and  myself

and  about his education that I am forced in honour

bound  to  clarify the position. Although he  holds

two  positions  and has been made Chairman  of  the

Singapore  Telephone Board,  may  I  say  that  the

former  Chairman  of the Singapore Telephone  Board

was in charge of more than two establishments? I am

sure, Mr Speaker, you will agree that Mr Loke Wan

Tho  is in charge of about 100 establishments,  and

he  still  finds  time to attend an hourly  meeting

once  a  month,  leaving the  job  to  the  General

Manager.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, I hope you will allow me to

explain  the position of Mr Lui Boon Poh on  which

the  Member for Farrer Park also tried to cast some

remarks.  It  is  true that Mr Lui  Boon  Poh  who

recently  joined the City Council was  a  salesman.

There are many types of salesmen, as there are many

types  of  lawyers. Some lawyers are Q.Cs, standing

on  their  own rights without having to kow-tow  to

big  businessmen in order to eke out an  existence.

Some  lawyers make their living through means which

are  contemptible. We read in the Press in the last

few   days  how  some  of  them  chase  after   car

accidents. Now, Mr Lui



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>



Boon  Poh, as I have said, joined the City Council.

He  was  a  salesman  but he did  not  receive  any

additional financial benefit. Neither did  Mr  Goh

Kee Song who was paid $1,400 a month; he joined the

City  Council  and was also paid  $1,400  a  month.

These  persons  did not join the  City  Council  to

receive additional financial benefit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there are always persons in society belonging to the old school who judge persons by

the  education they have received. May I  add  that

Mr Lui Boon Poh's education was up to Standard VIII

level and so is the case with more than half of the

Assemblymen  in  the  P.A.P.?  I  remember   during

election  time  that  it  was  the  habit  of   the

Opposition Parties to cast aspersions on candidates

of my Party saying that they were either barbers or

hawkers   and   that  they  received  very   little

education.   Mr  Speaker,  we  judge  a   person's

standard  by  his contribution to society,  by  his

willingness to sacrifice and by his devotion  to  a

cause.  We  do not care how much education  he  has

received or what he was, whether he be a hawker,  a

salesman or even a petty trader.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other mistake which the Member for Farrer

Park  made was to mention that there are at present

two  members on the Telephone Board. There  are  at

present  three members on the Board and  I  believe

that  the  Deputy Prime Minister,  who  is  now  in

charge of the Singapore Telephone Board, will  fill

the  vacancies very soon. The third member  on  the

Board, in addition to Mr Goh Kee Song and Mr  Lui

Boon Poh, is Mr Tan Siak Kew who has been asked to

stay on because he also wants business interests to

be  represented  on the Singapore Telephone  Board.

There  are three persons and the Board has, in  the

short  course of two months, done much  to  rectify

certain of the anomalies which existed in the past.

One  of  the anomalies is that at present there  is

not   even  one  local  officer  in  the  Singapore

Telephone  Board  who has got the Senior  Cambridge

qualification,  so  that  the  expatriates,   whose

interests the Member for Farrer Park has at  heart,

will stay on forever.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I am not a lawyer and I am not in a position to argue with the Member for Farrer Park

as  to  whether Mr Goh Kee Song and Mr  Lui  Boon

Poh,  being  members  of  the  staff  of  the  City

Council,  come  under  the terminology  of  "public

officers".  But, Mr Speaker, I rely on  the  State

Advocate-General, Inche Ahmad Ibrahim, and  he  has

assured the Cabinet that these two persons  do  not

come  under  the  definition of the  words  "public

officers"  as  defined in the  Singapore  Telephone

Board.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Farrer

Park  just  now  tried  to persuade  the  House  to

believe that the expression "public service"  means

what he wanted it to mean, and for that purpose  he

referred  the House to Words and Phrases Judicially

Defined" by Roland Burrows at page 436 when he drew

the  attention of the House to the Report under the

caption  "Public  Service" in that  publication.  I

would like to draw the attention of the Member  for

Farrer  Park to the fact that that particular  case

dealt  with a requisition which the Board of  Trade

is  authorised to make on a railway company on  the

agreements  of  being  "requisite  for  the  public

service"  and  it  was held, in  the  case  of  the

Launceston Railway Acts reported in volume  III  of

the  Railway and Canal Traffic Cases at  page  139,

that  the  expression  "requisite  for  the  public

service"  is  not narrowed to the  service  of  the

Government, that it could include any service which

would supply wants felt by the public or which  the

public  might reasonably be desirous of  having  on

its own behalf.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Farrer Park has

not  drawn  the  attention  of  the  House  to  the

definition of "public service" in Stroud's Judicial

Dictionary  (Third  Edition) where  it  is  clearly

stated that the expression "public service" means:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"a service under the Government of the United

Kingdom  and  includes any service  of  the  Crown

anywhere".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>



That  is  the only meaning that there  is  in  that

expression. Now in Stroud's definition, there is  a

reference to a number of cases which all dealt with

Government  contracts, contracts  made  with,  say,

colonial governments or with the Government of  the

United Kingdom, and it was held in all those  cases

that  the  expression related to service under  the

Government  of  the  United Kingdom  or  under  the

government of any colony. This point, Mr  Speaker,

Sir,   was  specifically  referred  to  the   State

Advocate-General and he has advised the Cabinet



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>



that  the  two  officers named by  the  Member  for

Farrer  Park  are  employed by a  local  government

authority   and  that  they  are  therefore   fully

qualified   for   appointment  to   the   Singapore

Telephone Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.
