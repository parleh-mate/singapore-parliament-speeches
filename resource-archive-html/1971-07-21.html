<br><br>6.51 p.m.



<div align="center"><b>PRESIDENT'S SPEECH</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The President (Dr Benjamin Henry Sheares):</b> After

six  years of separate independence, we have shown

that Singapore is viable. She is less dependent on

the  traditional entrepot trade, She is developing

into   a   centre  for  manufacturing,  servicing,

transportation   and  communications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the

British Government announced in January 1968  that

they  were going to pull out their forces  by  the

end   of  1971,  there  was  widespread  fear   of

unemployment.   Unions,   management    and    the

government  worked hard to create  the  conditions

for rapid and massive investment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We succeeded. At present, there is a temporary

shortage  of  workers.  Work  permits  are  freely

issued to skilled and semi-skilled workers, and to

unskilled  workers  for heavy manual  jobs.  Block

permits are given to building contractors so  that

work  is not slowed down all over Singapore,  from

urban  renewal, to new satellite towns, factories,

roads, flyovers, canals and reservoirs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Married quarters and other accommodation formerly

used  by  the  civilians employed by the  British

Services, and not suitable for the Singapore Armed

Forces,  will soon be released. They  can  provide

accommodation  for  over 10,000  new  work  permit

holders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that our industrialisation

programme should not stall for lack of skilled, or

if   unskilled,  then  educated,  industrious  and

easily trainable, workers. The policy of free work

permits  will  continue until  the  re-cycling  of

national service recruits has evened out. In about

three years, the national service intake will  not

exceed  the numbers going into the reserves.  Then

we   should  have  reached  conditions   of   full

employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, my government has plans to

systematically mechanise laborious and  repetitive

work. The private sector will be encouraged to  do

the  same.  There  is a limit  to  the  inflow  of

unskilled



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>



non-citizen workers we can absorb if the fabric of

our  society  is  not  to  be  strained.  We  want

economic  growth to raise the standards of  living

of  our  people.  We want better schools  for  our

children,  better  homes,  with  playing   fields,

gardens, parks, and recreational amenities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must become viable in defence. Through the

Commonwealth   Five-Power  defence   arrangements,

stability  and  security are assured  for  several

years ahead. But we must make use of this time  to

consolidate our own defence capability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Defence has had to overcome many

problems.  They  are  the  result  of  very  rapid

expansion in the last few years. In the  next  few

years,  the heavy expenditure for the purchase  of

arms  and  equipment for defence will  level  off.

Then  a  greater share of our revenue can go  into

education, health and social services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the rapid pace of development is

making  land  more  scarce, and resettlement  more

difficult, especially for farmers. As our economic

position  is  now  stronger,  my  government   has

decided  to  give higher rates of compensation  to

tenants  and  ex gratia payments to squatters  for

resettlement. Shops and industries in  government-owned   or   acquired  premises   will   now   get

resettlement  ex gratia payments. Genuine  farmers

will be given more generous terms of resettlement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to continue our rapid growth, we have

to  import  part of the capital, and most  of  the

technology,    the   management   and    marketing

expertise.  A  considerable part  of  the  wealth,

increasingly evident since the last two years,  in

expensive   shopping  complexes,  hotels,   office

blocks and factories, represents imported capital.

It  will take time and experience to build up  our

own  corps  of  managers, engineers and  marketing

experts. With time, our people will increase their

participation in the owning and the running of the

new enterprises.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, for the present it is foolish not to admit

that however shrewd and wealthy our merchants are,

many  have  not yet learned how to  run  a  modern

corporation,  where  ownership  is  separate  from

management.  Our investors and entrepreneurs  have

to   develop  new  attitudes  necessary  for   the

management  of industries, and other  enterprises.

Recently,   a   British  group  of  stock   market

operators quietly bought the majority stocks of  a

Singapore  company,  and then sold  the  company's

holdings   in  a  bank  and  in  newspapers,   for

considerable  profits, all at no risk,  in  little

time,  and  without much effort. It is a  sad  and

painful example of how poorly we run some  of  our

limited companies listed on the stock exchange. We

have  to  acquire sophistication and expertise  to

run  large  corporate holding companies and  their

subsidiaries.  We must not allow  anyone  to  take

such   easy   pickings.  We  believe   our   young

executives  and  accountants have the  ability  to

acquire this expertise quickly in the next five to

ten  years. We shall the more rapidly develop this

expertise  if we increase the number  of  our  own

professionals  by attracting highly qualified  and

able  professionals, who will  come  not  just  to

work, but also to settle permanently in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our way forward is clear. Through land

reclamation,  effective  anti-pollution  measures,

good  zoning  and  planning,  we  can  develop   a

gracious environment. Through family planning  and

a  combination  of incentives for small  families,

and   disincentives  on  having  more  than  three

children,  we shall keep the population growth  in

check.  This  is the only way for the  quality  of

life  to go up. Food alone is not enough to  bring

up  a  good  citizen. Every child needs care,  and

years  of  education  and training.  In  many  new

countries,  the population explosion  has  brought

life  down to the dirty ditches of the countryside

or  the filth and squalor of the pavements in  the

cities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fortunate that most of our people have

accepted  the  realities of life  in  present  day

Singapore. Their approach to problems is generally

practical and tolerant.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to remain a cohesive people, we must

concentrate   on  the  factors,  which   bind   us

together, and not those, which will divide us.  We

cannot  allow anyone to work up heat  on  the  gut

issues   over  language,  culture  and   religion,

grating the raw nerves of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one, and especially anyone working in the

mass  media,  has  the  right  to  play  with  the

emotional  reflexes of our different  communities.

Partly as the result of recent politicking in  the

press  over language and culture, now even designs

of commemorative stamps, which were intended to be

light-hearted  and  quite  innocent,   have   been

convoluted and inflated into a serious issue about

cu1ture and religion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided we keep these sensitive issues of

language, culture and religion muted, we have  the

capacity  to transform our once disparate  peoples

into  a  modern  industrialised island-nation.  We

must not be deflected from our course towards this

goal.



<br><br>7.04 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conclusion of the President's speech, Mr

Speaker,  preceded by the Sergeant  at  Arms,  the

Clerk,  the  Clerk-Assistant and the Second  Clerk

Assistant, escorted the President (accompanied  by

two  A.D.C.s)  out of the Chamber, and  the  House

adjourned  without question put, pursuant  to  the

Standing Order.

<div align="center"><h4>PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE</h4></div>



<br><br><i>Anti-Pollution Unit</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rapid urbanisation, industrialisation and

increasing  numbers of motor vehicles  are  making

more acute the problems of air pollution. The Anti-Pollution  Unit, which was set up last  year,  has

undertaken    basic   air   pollution   monitoring

throughout Singapore. So far the monitoring  shows

that  air  pollution  levels are  not  yet  acute,

although  they  are increasing in  the  industrial

estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preventive and control measures include the

careful siting of industries. We have also to  see

that we do not `import' the very dirty industries,

where the industrialist will not or cannot install

antipollution  measures because  it  will  be  too

costly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laws and regulations for industrial air pollution

control have been drafted. When passed, these will

be  gradually  but systematically enforced.  Grace

periods  may  be given for existing  factories  to

comply with anti-pollution regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continual surveillance by the Traffic Police and

Registry  of Vehicles has resulted in fewer  smoky

exhausts.  New motor vehicles will be required  to

install a crankcase re-circulation device  to  cut

down   pollution.  This  will  help  to  cut  down

pollution by motor vehicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more important is the prevention of water

pollution. The whole of Singapore will be sewered,

in phases over a period of 10 years. All kitchens,

salvage  bath  and other polluted household  water

must  go into the sewers and not into open drains.

Industrial  wastewater must be treated  to  reduce

the pollution before being discharged into canals,

open drains or sewers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As these measures are implemented in phased

areas, our water resources will increase.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>PUBLIC UTILITIES BOARD</b></div>



<br><br><i>Electricity</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increased demand for power, because of the

rapid   pace   of  industrialization  and   better

housing,   has   made   it  necessary   to   start

construction  of  Stage II  of  the  Jurong  Power

Station,  immediately after Stage I was  completed

in  March  this year. Stage II will  be  completed

before the end of 1973.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In anticipation of more demand for power in the

middle  1970s, the P.U.B, has decided to  build  a

new power station operational before the end of

1974.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Efforts are constantly being made to ensure

reliable and efficient power supply system in  the

Republic. To this end, a load despatch centre  has

been developed at Pasir Panjang `A' Power Station.

This  centre  aims  at  ensuring  the  safety  and

reliability of power supplies at high voltages  as

well  as providing alternative supplies by  remote

control in the event of a power interruption at  a

substation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-seven new rural electrification schemes

were  completed  in 1970. Since  1963,  400  rural

schemes have been completed for 45,000 people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1973 every house in Singapore's rural areas

can have light and power.



<br><br><i>Water</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.U.B, is undertaking a comprehensive study

to  develop the water resources in Singapore. With

effective  anti-pollution  we  shall  be  able  to

extract one-third of the average daily rainfall of

750 million gallons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work on the Kranji-Pandan scheme will soon begin.

When   completed   in  1974,  it   will   increase

substantially  the  daily  yield  and  the   total

storage capacity of our impounding reservoirs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extension work on the service reservoir at Jalan

Eunos is in progress. The storage capacity of  the

reservoir will be doubled to 15 million gallons to

cater  for  the increasing demand in  the  eastern

part of the island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work will begin soon on a service reservoir of

eight million gallons capacity at Mount Faber.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All public standpipes will be gradually removed

and  meters installed. This will enable  rationing

during  a  drought period and avoid  squabbles  at

public  standpipes. More than 65  miles  of  pipes

were  laid in 1970 to supply water to the  housing

and  industrial  estates  at  Toa  Payoh,  Jurong,

Henderson Road and Kampong Tiong Bahru.



<br><br><i>Gas</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vickers-Zimmer Reformer, which is capable of

producing  three million cubic feet (85,000  cubic

metres) of gas daily was commissioned in 1970. The

Reformer  uses  naphtha as  feedstock.  This  will

minimise pollution of the atmosphere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another gas-making plant of similar capacity is

to  be  commissioned by the middle of  1973.  This

will  be  necessary to meet the demand,  which  is

expected to exceed 300 million units per annum  by 1973.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board has also been extending the use of its

gas to areas outside the city reticulation system.

Distribution  of  liquid  petroleum  gas  is  from

storage   tanks  and  can  reach  all   areas   in

Singapore.

<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The functions of the Ministry of Science and

Technology include, among others, the training  of

scientific   and   technological   manpower    for

professional    work   and   for   research    and

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following policies have been or are being

formulated:-



<br><br><i>1.   Gearing the tertiary education programme to

meet the increasing demand, of industrialisation

for the next decade</i>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) A Master Plan for the new campus of the

University of Singapore:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1971 total enrolment in the

University, including students  registered

for higher degrees, is approximately 4,800.

The   University  expansion  programme   is

geared   to   meet  the  forecast   student

population of about 8,000 in 1980.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phase I of the Master Plan for the new

University  at  Kent  Ridge  comprises  the

Faculty  of  Engineering,  the  School   of

Architecture and School of Accountancy  and

Business   Administration,   administration

building,   residential   facilities    and

general   students'   facilities.   It   is

scheduled  to  be completed  by  1975.  The

Government  has applied for  a  World  Bank

loan  to finance this project. An Appraisal

Mission  from the Bank was in Singapore  in

June  to  make an assessment of Singapore's

application.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Singapore Polytechnic Development:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At technician level, the Singapore

Polytechnic's  expansion  programme  is  to

meet  an  enrolment target of approximately

8,000  in  1980,  about  double  the   1971

enrolment of about 4,400,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Polytechnic's new site of 40 acres

is  at  Ayer  Rajah Road. Phase  I  of  the

development  programme is scheduled  to  be

completed  by October 1971. The  whole  new

complex will be ready by 1975-76.



<br><br><i>2. Encouragement of Research and Development and

Consultancy Activities</i>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total dependence on imported technological

expertise is undesirable. Singapore must build  up

an  "indigenous technological capability", related

particularly    to   hardware   engineering    and

consultancy services. The Ministry, together  with

the  Science Council, are studying measures needed

to   build  up  the  infrastructure  to  encourage

research    and   development   and    consultancy

activities.   An   incentive  for   research   and

development  efforts in the industrial  sector  is

being  considered  so that the industry  would  be

more  technically self-reliant. One method  is  to

provide  tax  relief for expenditure on  equipment

and technical manpower used for quality control or

research  and  development. The feasibility  of  a

centre   for  applied  research  and  a  technical

information centre is also being studied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For formulating governmental policies, it will

be  necessary  to undertake developmental  studies

and  fact-finding surveys. Some of them are multi-disciplinary. This Ministry can act  as  an  agent

for  Government  departments and statutory  bodies

requiring such studies.



<br><br><i>3. Promotion  of the understanding and appreciation

of  Science and Technology as tools for Economic

Development</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sustained interest in Science and Technology

must  be  the  basis for Singapore's industries.

It   is   the  keystone  to  Singapore's  future

economic development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Science Centre on a 16-acre site in Jurong

will  help  develop this interest.  The  Science

Centre  Board,  formed  in  November  1970,   is

planning  for  the project to  be  completed  in

1973.



<br><br><i>4. Metrication</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament, in December 1970, approved the

recommendation  of the Ministry of  Science  and

Technology that Singapore, with the majority  of

the world, adopt the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>



International  System  of weights  and  measures.

The  target  is  for all Government  departments,

statutory  bodies and 75 per cent  of  industries

with  external  trade to adopt the metric  system

by 1975.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excellent progress has been made. Considerable

experience  has  been gained  in  the  first  few

months   of   this   conversion  exercise.   With

increasing  goodwill  and  co-operation  of   the

various   economic  sectors  and  of  all   those

concerned,  the chances of going metric  by  1975

are very bright.



<br><br><i>5.    Industrial Liaison Unit</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has set up an Industrial Liaison

Unit,  which will undertake studies on scientific

and  technological aspects of industrial problems

that  are of special significance to the economic

development of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a problem involves several sectors, the

unit   will   bring  them  into   conference   to

determine  the  best way of handling  a  problem.

Straightforward studies are farmed out  to  local

experts through research contracts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Economic and Statistical Unit provides

information   on  the  stock  of   professional

manpower.  The  unit  works  closely  with  the

Economic  Research Centre of the University  of

Singapore.  It  will  also  collate   data   on

industries, which are science based,  or  which

have a high technological content.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past six years foreign policy was

concerned   primarily  with  aiding   Singapore's

economic  and industrial development. The  stress

was   on   developing  economic  relations   with

foreign countries. The aim of foreign policy  was

to   assist   Singapore  to   maintain   internal

political  stability and economic rationality  so

as  to  provide incentives for local and  foreign

investment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has also avoided adopting arresting

but futile postures towards cold war issues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the years ahead Singapore's foreign policy

will  have to be more outward looking than it  has

hitherto    been   if   only   because    external

developments  will  be  more  directly   felt   by

Singapore.  The  British military  run  down,  the

accelerated  American  dis-engagement  of   ground

forces  from Vietnam and other parts of South-east

Asia,  the  growing interest in our  region  of  a

great power like the People's Republic of China, a

developing Russian presence in the area and the re-emergence  of  Japan  as  a  major  power  suggest

potentialities  for new kinds of  competition  and

conflict  in the region. Where before the  Pacific

Ocean was the main arena of big power conflict, it

has  now  been  broadened to  include  the  Indian

Ocean.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Singapore serves as the gateway to both

these oceans its strategic value, in peace and  in

war, has been enhanced and not lessened by British

withdrawal.  So more than ever before  Singapore's

domestic  policies  will be  shaped  not  only  by

internal  needs and aspirations but  also  by  the

fact  of  competition  and conflict  not  among  a

larger   number   of  outside  powers   but   also

superpowers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these external developments will impose

heavy  strains  and great dangers.  They  may  put

unpleasant but necessary curbs on what we can  and

would like to do domestically. Some of the old and

comforting  assumptions of our foreign policy  may

have  to  be  modified and even discarded  in  the

light  of  new circumstances we may find ourselves

in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big powers themselves are reassessing, in

radical  ways,  policies  and  attitudes  to   one

another.  We  cannot foresee what new permutations

of  big  powers would be worked out. Whatever  the

nature  of  the new combinations and permutations,

their   undeviating   objective   would   be   the

furtherance   of   big   power   interests   under

conditions of competition and conflict.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Singapore, from the point of view of the big

powers, would be no more than a valuable piece  on

the chessboard. Singapore cannot halt the game the

big  powers  will play in the region. However,  we

can meet and overcome the problems outside nations

can create for us by basing our foreign policy  on

realities and not on wishful thinking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A prerequisite for our survival as a distinct

people is national cohesiveness. So any attempt to

weaken  this  solidarity by  appeals  to  contrary

chauvinistic pulls must be fought unflinchingly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present prosperity and stability in

Singapore  can  generate complacency  and  wishful

thinking that all is well and that if we mind  our

own business other nations will leave us alone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately the region in which we live is too

valuable  to  many nations for them  to  leave  us

alone. We will be affected more and more and often

in vital ways by what happens outside our shores.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF LABOUR</b></div>



<br><br><i>Review of wages</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our success in industrialisation and rapid

economic  growth has been paid for by  hard  work,

greater discipline and postponement of less urgent

consumption.   Much   of  the   visible   economic

affluence  is  imported capital and  technologies,

which will remain in Singapore only so long as the

conditions of political stability, reasonable wage

levels and disciplined workers, prevail. Until  we

are in a position to own and be able to manage and

operate a far greater share of this wealth in  the

next  decade, the conditions for such rapid influx

of  investment  and technology  will  have  to  he

maintained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is conscious of the sacrifices

and  contributions  made by labour  towards  rapid

economic  growth. Employers who have  been  making

exceptional profits have been urged to give better

bonuses    in   recognition   of   the    worker's

contribution to the present economic prosperity.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early next year, after the full effects of the

rundown of the British bases have been assessed, a

review of the present wage policy will be made.



<br><br><i>Central Provident Fund</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rate of contribution payable to the Central

Provident Fund has been increased from 5 per  cent

to  6k per cent in 1968, from 6k per cent to 8 per

cent  in  1970, and with effect from 1st  January,

1971,  from 8 per cent to 10 per cent so that  the

total rate payable by employees earning more  than

$200  per  month is now 20 per cent of  wages.  In

addition,   contributions  are  also  payable   on

bonuses without any limit. Thus, whilst the policy

of  wage  restraints still has to be  observed  in

this   early   stage  of  industrialisation,   the

Government,   by  enhancing  C.P.F, contributions

payable  by  employers and employees and  allowing

such  C.P.F, contributions to  be  used  for  the

purchase  of  Housing  and  Development  Board  or

Jurong  Town  Corporation flats, has ensured  more

adequate  provision for workers in their old  age,

and made home ownership possible for more and more

workers.  Today about 35,000 workers  own  or  are

paying  instalments  to own  their  flats, it  is

anticipated  that, as the Housing and  Development

Board   accelerates   its   building   programmes,

thousands  of  more workers will be  able  to  own

their flats for the first time.



<br><br><i>Work Permit Policy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our success in industrialisation has bro Light

about  an  acute  shortage of  skilled  and  semi-skilled  workers required for the  new  factories.

Unless  we  are  able to train skilled  and  semi-skilled labour for our factories, the pace of  our

industrialisation  will  falter.  To  solve   this

urgent  problem,  the  Ministry  has  issued  work

permits  liberally  for  the  type  of  skills  we

require. As on 30th June. 1971, a total of  55,800

work  permits  have been issued.  Also,  temporary

permits  on a month-to-month basis in the form  of

block permits have been issued to non-citizens who

are  engaged as construction workers. As  on  30th

June,  1971,  over 10,000 workers are  working  in

Singapore under such an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>



arrangement. In the next two years a  review  will

be  made on whether work permit holders should  be

given  permanent residence and later  citizenship.

It  is also proposed to further simplify the issue

of block permits for construction workers.



<br><br><i>Apprenticeship and in-plant training schemes</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This liberal work permit policy, however, is a

temporary  measure to meet a pressing problem.  In

the  long term, we are restructuring our education

system  to give technical and vocational education

the  proper  emphasis and recognition demanded  by

our  expanding  industrial and servicing  sectors.

More  intensive industrial training schemes,  such

as  apprenticeship training and in-plant training,

will   be  needed.  Eventually,  Singapore  should

supply   most  of  the  skills  required  by   our

industries from our schools.



<br><br><i>Protection of growing industrial work force</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greater industrialisation, however, has been

accompanied by an increasing number of  industrial

accidents.  Apart from the financial loss  to  the

economy estimated at $23,000,000 for 1969, this is

quite  unnecessary  and often avoidable  suffering

for  the  unfortunate victims and their  families.

The Ministry will be taking the following steps.



<br><br><i>(i) Reorganisation and expansion  of  the  Factory Inspectorate</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Factory Inspectorate will be expanded and

staffed  by  suitable officers to supervise  and

enforce  industrial  safety  regulations.  These

safety  regulations  will be  strictly  enforced

and  recalcitrant employers wilfully  neglecting

the  safety  and  health  of  workers  will   be

punished.



<br><br><i>(ii) Amendments to the Factories Act</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Bill to amend the Factories Act will be

introduced  in  Parliament. The main  objectives

of  the  Bill  are  to improve  the  health  and

safety  measures and the welfare  facilities  in

the interests of persons employed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>



in  factories.  It  will also  encourage  a  more

stringent observance of the safety provisions  in

the  Factories Act by giving the Chief  Inspector

of  Factories  greater powers and increasing  the

maximum  penalty under the Act. These  provisions

will  undoubtedly  help to  reduce  the  rate  of

industrial accidents.



<br><br><i>(iii) Building  Operations  and  Works of Engineering Construction Regulations</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has also gazetted in March 1971

the    Building   Operations   and   Works    of

Engineering   Construction  Regulations,   1971,

which   would   provide,  among  other   things,

comprehensive    measures    and    requirements

designed  to safeguard the health and safety  of

workers   in   the   building  and   engineering

construction  worksites,  which  have  accounted

for  the  highest number of industrial accidents

in  recent  times. These Regulations  will  come

into   operation  after  their  adoption  by   a

resolution in Parliament in the coming session.



<br><br><i>(iv) Amendments to the Workmen's Compensation Act</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reinforce the above measures, the Ministry

will   also  introduce  a  Bill  to  amend   the

Workmen's  Compensation Act. The Bill  seeks  to

extend  the  scope of workmen's compensation  to

cover  non-manual workers who earn  up  to  $750

per   month  (as  against  $400  per  month   at

present),  to  treble the quantum  of  workmen's

compensation payable at present and  to  provide

for  a  more  detailed list  of  injuries  which

would result in permanent partial incapacity  so

that  a more accurate assessment of compensation

may  be  made.  Also, two new diseases,  namely,

silicosis  and asbestosis, will be  included  in

the   schedule  of  occupational  diseases.  The

Amendment  Bill is designed not only  to  ensure

that  workmen who sustain injuries in the course

of   their   employment  are   more   adequately

compensated, but also, with the increased



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>



quantum of compensation,  to  induce  the

employers   to  institute  adequate  measures   to

safeguard  the  interest  and  welfare  of   their

workers.



<br><br><i>Protection of non-unionised workers</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large, most employers have come to

observe  the  letter and spirit of the  Employment

Act,  and  accord to their employees their  rights

and  privileges as stipulated in the Act. However,

there  is a need to protect the interest of  large

numbers  of  the  non-unionised  workers,   mainly

Chinese-educated   employees,   in   the   smaller

establishments,   from   exploitation   by    some

unscrupulous  employers.  For  this  purpose,  the

Ministry  will expand the Labour Inspectorate  and

also  set up regional offices so that the  working

conditions in these smaller establishments can  he

inspected more frequently.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF COMMUNICATIONS</b></div>



<br><br><i>Civil aviation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growth rates of air traffic through Singapore

have  exceeded average international growth levels

expected  at 15 per cent a year. In the  past  two

years, passenger traffic at Paya Lebar Airport has

been  growing at an average annual rate of 21  per

cent.  Growth  of  air cargo is  more  rapid  with

average  annual increase of 42 per cent. Passenger

traffic  is  expected to grow  from  1.57  million

passengers  in 1970 to 3.64 million passengers  in

1975, to 15.6 million passengers in 1985 - a  ten-fold  increase. Air cargo will rise  faster;  from

25,600  metric tons in 1970 to 94,900 metric  tons

in 1975, to 1.309,000 metric tons in 1985-a fifty-fold increase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet this extremely rapid rate of growth and

the   operational  requirements   of   wide-bodied

aircraft  such as the Boeing-747, as well  as  the

supersonic's, a second runway has to be  built  by

1980, if  not earlier. Land is already  earmarked

for the second runway at Paya Lebar. But as Changi

would  be handed back to Singapore at the  end  of

the  year,  the  Ministry  of  Communications   is

studying the feasibility of building the second



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>



runway  at Changi, which can then be developed  as

Singapore's second international airport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides first-class hotels by international

standards, and scenic recreational centres such as

S-ento-sa, the growth of

tourism in Singapore will depend in

rapid

begin by the Pro-large   measure   on  easy  air  connections   and

inexpensive  fares. The Government  will,  therefore,

enter  into  more  bilateral  air  services

agreements  to  enable  not  only  the   scheduled

airlines of other countries, but also their  non-scheduled carriers to o-perate regular and full-load  charter  services to and beyond  Singapore.

The  Singapore national airline and Saber Air will

in   turn   exploit  the  opportunities   which

bilateral  air services agreements will open  to

them.  Singapore's  national air-line  is  considering  the pu-rc-h-ase of the wide-bodied  jet

aircraft for operations in the near future.

Encouragement   will   be   given   to   leading

international aircraft manufacturing companies  to

set up aerospace industries at Seletar and Changi,

to  which  added racilities are being  considered.

The  establishnient of an Air  Academy  to  train

flight  crew and technicians on a proper  co-ordinated  basis,  probably at  Seletar,  is  under

consideration  to  help the matipower  requirements  of  Singapore's airlines and the  aerospace

industries.



<br><br><i>Public transportation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major overhaul of the public bus

transportation  system was successfully  completed

after some initial teething difficulties. 542 new

buses  were added, making a total of 1,816  public

buses. Ten Chinese bus companies were amalgamated

into  three larger ones. Direct services now  link

the rural areas, the

suburbs,  the satellite towns, to Jurong,  and  to

the City.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School buses increased by 900 after

reorganisation.  This  rapid  build-up  of  public

buses  has made the eradication of illegal  pirate

taxi operations possible

--  a  traffic hazard which has plagued  Singapore

for the last 15 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1980's, Singapore's public bus tiansport

will  have  to  be complemented by  a  mass  rapid

transit  system.  A  rigorous evaluation  of  the

financial and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>



technical feasibility of a mass transit system for

Singapore  will  early  next  year.  It  will   be

assisted United Nations Development gramme and the

World Bank.



<br><br><i>Telecommunications</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's communication satellite earth

station  at  Sentosa  will become  operational  in

August this year. The earth station will link up

with  the Indian Ocean intelsat III Satellite,

enabling  Singapore to communicate  directly  with

countries as far east as Japan, and as far west as

Britain.  The  Telecommunications  Department  is

planning  to  build another antenna  to  face  the

Pacific  Ocean.  The two satellite  earth  station

antennae  will  put Singapore into  direct  space

communication  with more than  two-thirds  of  the

world.    They    will   complement   Singapore's

communication links by land and sea.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first 600 lines of the 1,200-line National

Automatic  Telex Exchange will be commissioned  in

September  this  year.  The  International   Telex

Service  will  become  fully  automatic  by  1973,

initially with 150 lines. When ready, telex  calls

need not go through operators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cater for the off-shore oil explorers, a high

frequency radio network will soon be installed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An approach control radar system for Singapore

International Airport of 70-80 miles' range will

be comissioned next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all these developments, organisational changes have become necessary. The

Telecommunications Department  will  be  converted

into  a  statutory authority in April 1972.  This

will  allow more speedy response to the  rapidly

changing and highly complex space age communication systems.



<br><br><i>Telephones</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The telephone network in Singapore has to grow

by 16 per cent per annum in the next five years to

cope   with  demand.  The  five-year  development

programme,  1971-1975, will  cost  $212  million.

Only   a  part  of  this  can  be  financed   from

operational surpluses



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>



averaging $12 million a year on existing rentals.

Not all of the balance of about $160 million can

be borrowed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World Bank has given a loan of $33 million to

the  Singapore Telephone Board (S.T.B.) to finance

its  current  capital  development  programme.  To

finance this vast expansion programme, it will  be

necessary for the S.T.B, to raise its rentals. The

expansion programme, when completed, will  provide

15 telephones per 100 population by 1975, compared

with 7.7 per 100 population in 1970.



<br><br><i>Postal services</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry's most traditional department, the

Postal Services Department, is in the midst  of  a

re-organisation     exercise.     The     National

Productivity  Centre  is helping.  The  number  of

postal articles handled has been growing by 10 per

cent  a  year.  It is expected to rise  even  more

sharply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Post Office would be decentralised

into  several  regional or district  general  post

offices, for speedier processing and delivery. The

facing, cancelling and sorting of letters will  be

mechanised  as  much as possible. More  deliveries

will  be  made  by  postmen  on  motorcycles   and

scooters, instead of on bicycles or on foot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislation was introduced on 1st March 1971

requiring all high-rise residential and commercial

buildings,  including Government  buildings,  with

more than four storeys to provide letterboxes at a

central point on the ground or first floor for the

delivery  of  letters  and  other  mail  to  their

tenants.  Owners, or developers of existing  high-rise  buildings will be allowed up to  1st  March,

i973   to  provide  such  letter-boxes  on   their

premises. This is a necessary adjustment in a city

rapidly urbanised and growing literally upwards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditionally, the Post Office Savings Bank

business  is  handled at Post Offices  with  other

postal  and non-postal transactions. In  order  to

provide more retail outlets for the convenience of

depositors,  the Bank will be setting up  separate

branches,    which   are   fully   air-conditioned

providing solely Savings Bank business



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>



in  various parts of Singapore. The Bank's  first

air-conditioned branch was set up at  the  General

Post  Office  in Fullerton Building recently.  The

Bank   will  be  reconstituted  as  an  autonomous

statutory  corporation by 1st January  1972.  This

will  give the Bank greater flexibility to provide

better   and  more  efficient  services   to   its

depositors.



<br><br><i>Port and shipping</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shipping and cargo tonnages in 1960 were 68.9

million  net  registered  tons  and  14.9  million

freight tons respectively. In 1970 they had  grown

to  148.7  million net registered  tons  and  42.2

million freight tons, increases of 115.82 per cent

and  183.22  per cent respectively.  New  policies

were  adopted in 1970 to ensure the continued  use

of  Singapore as a trading and transhipment centre

and to cater for the revolutionary changes in sea-borne  transportation. Current  major  development

projects  such as the container port project,  the

provision   of   more  warehousing  and   berthing

facilities, were re-examined. Several changes  had

to  be  made.  For  example, the coming  of  third

generation   container  vessels  has  necessitated

several  changes  to the existing container  berth

design. Plans to develop an inland container depot

were  mapped out. The Port of Singapore  Authority

began  acquiring land for the purpose. At  Jardine

Steps  an ocean terminal to accommodate facilities

such as ferry services, as well as a cable car  to

link Sentosa, is being developed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cargo handling was streamlined to enable a faster

turn-round.  A reorganised labour force,  and  24-hour   service,  plus  better  use  of  equipment,

improved  efficiency, and increased  earnings  of

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seamen training facilities are to be expanded to

provide for better quality training. Multi-purpose

training of crew is now necessary to man the  more

modern  ships  and give them higher  pay.  Present

seamen will be given special retraining to upgrade

their skills and pay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A National Maritime Board is being formed to co-ordinate, promote and develop maritime employment,

training and welfare. The proposed Maritime'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>



Board will replace the four existing marine

statutory bodies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 30-6-71, there were 521 ships totalling

742,894 gross tons flying the Singapore Flag. This

compares  with  377 ships totalling 319,675  gross

tons  as on 30-6-69, an increase of 38.19 per cent

and  132.39  per cent respectively. The  Singapore

Registry   offers  various  incentives,  including

exemption from income tax.



<br><br><i>Pollution</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Environmental pollution is being checked. During

the year ended 31-3-71, a total of 32,680 vehicles

were  booked  for  excessive emission  of  exhaust

smoke.  The  campaign will continue. On  the  sea,

stringent  measures were adopted by  the  Port  of

Singapore  Authority (P.S.A.) to control pollution

of   our   waters.  New  harbour  safety  measures

combined with better surveillance were introduced.

The   P.S.A, will  be  setting  up  oil  disposal

facilities where ships may discharge slop. As  the

Airport expands and the number of planes using  it

increases,  noise  pollution  becomes  more  of  a

problem.   It   is  not  possible  to   completely

eliminate noise. But measures are being  taken  to

minimise   the  noise  pollution.  The   Singapore

International  Airport runway  is  being  extended

northwards  instead of southwards  so  that  noise

nuisance  can be reduced. The possibility  of  re-routing  the landing and take-off paths  is  being

studied  to lower the noise problem for  the  more

populated areas of the city.



<br><br><i>Meteorology</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 10 cm, weather radar costing $500,000 was

installed  at the Airport Operations  Building  of

Paya  Lebar Airport to replace an older equipment.

This  high  performance  radar  will  enable   the

location  and tracking of storms and thunderclouds

within  a radius of 250 miles. It also allows  the

study  of  the  vertical structure  of  individual

storms. This radar is indispensable for short-term

weather  forecasting and for quantitative rainfall

measurements,  particularly during  the  Northeast

monsoon season.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An automatic picture read-out station to obtain

cloud photographs from weather satellites was  set

up   at   the  Airport  in  December  1970.  These

photographs,  transmitted by orbiting  satellites,

give  an accurate pictorial description of weather

and  details  of cloud distribution  and  patterns

over  Asia and South-West Pacific. Satellite  data

is   a  new  meteorological  aid.  It  supplements

conventional weather analysis. It has also  proved

to be invaluable for long-range forecasting.

<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF EDUCATION</b></div>



<br><br><i>General Education</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main objective now is to improve the quality

of education at all levels.



<br><br><i>Curriculum development</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A review of the curriculum has begun. A new

combined  curriculum for the first  two  years  of

primary school has been introduced. A revision  of

the rest of the primary school curriculum will  be

implemented in stages. The aim is a more  flexible

education system to enable a child to learn  at  a

pace  suited to his individual needs and his  rate

of maturing.



<br><br><i>Language teaching</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Language teaching in both the first and second

languages  will  be increased and  improved.  More

time for the teaching of language will be allotted

in  the  primary years and fewer periods  for  the

transmission  of knowledge, so that students  will

become  effectively articulate in  the  first  and

second  languages before they go on  to  secondary

school.  This may mean fewer periods  for  history

and  geography, which can be made up  for  in  the

secondary  school. Teacher training is  undergoing

overall  review,  to  provide better  teaching  of

bilingual  students.  It is planned  in  the  next

decade   that  nearly  all  teachers   should   be

bilingual.



<br><br><i>Technical education and industrial training</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technical education and industrial training

programmes  will continue to expand  and  develop.

Eventually,  most secondary schools  will  have  a

technical stream up to G.C.E. level.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restructuring of the secondary school

syllabus  and  training programme  at  vocational

institutes  is nearly completed. The emphasis  in

the next phase will be on the upgrading of skills

through apprenticeship schemes and joint training

programmes with industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present shortage of skilled workers can only

be  met  by  in-plant training. In the next  five

years,  the enrolment of technical students  will

be  substantially increased to meet the needs  of

industry.   The  schools  can  give   the   basic

grounding so that they can be easily trained  for

the special skills required in each industry.



<br><br><i>Apprenticeship training</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urgent consideration is being given to

apprenticeship systems. A comprehensive range  of

schemes   will  be  initiated  to  regulate   and

formalise   training   in  respect   of   certain

industries,  particularly  those  with   advanced

production    methods    requiring    specialised

technical  skills.  The schemes  will  provide  a

framework  for effective control and  supervision

to  maintain  minimum standards. Inducements  are

being worked out to encourage industries to offer

apprenticeship  facilities. A  proper  system  of

grading     and     award    of    apprenticeship

qualifications will be introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will intensify its joint training

programme   with   industries,   especially    in

precision   skills.  Industries  will   also   be

encouraged  to operate jointly with the  Ministry

schemes   for  off-the-job  industrial   training

(O.J.I.T.).



<br><br><i>Industrial Training Board</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of a statutory board is being

considered  to undertake responsibility  for  all

matters related to industrial training, including

apprenticeship,  off-the-job industrial  training

and     administration    of    the    industrial

institutions. The industrial sector will be  well

represented   on   this  board.  More   extensive

involvement  by  industries can  lead  to  closer

collaboration with the board and ensure that  the

training  provided  is relevant  to  our  rapidly

expanding industrial needs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Administration</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the administration of industrial training

is separated from technical education, there will

be a reorganisation of the Ministry headquarters.

The  policy  is  to  integrate  the  General  and

Technical     Education     Departments.     This

reorganisation began in 1970 with the division of

the  administrative and professional  aspects  of

the  work of the General Education Department and

the  creation  of  a  second  post  of  Permanent

Secretary     (Administration).      A      sound

administrative  structure  can  more  effectively

meet  the changing needs of education, which must

anticipate  and  respond  more  rapidly  to   the

manpower needs of our fast changing economy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF CULTURE</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mass media exert an immense impact on the

lives  of the people. The influence they have  on

our young in their formative years makes scrutiny

and  regular  review of our mass  media  policies

crucial. The Ministry of Culture's responsibility

in inculcating values and attitudes necessary for

a  robust  and  sturdy  society  is  particularly

difficult, because a significant bulk of  TV  and

radio  programmes from the west tend to undermine

our  efforts  to  counter  the  drug  and  hippie

culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More local productions with the main focus on

our  youth  and their future responsibility  will

feature  more  regularly on Radio and  Television

programmes.   The  Ministry  will   continue   to

encourage  creative  effort and  nurture  talent.

Monthly art exhibitions at the community centres,

and helping the Singapore Arts Council to set  up

a  modest  Art Gallery are steps forward  in  the

right direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our library facilities have to be expanded to

cope  with the needs of an increasingly  literate

society. A full-time branch library in Toa  Payoh

will be ready in early 1973. Another for the next

satellite  town by 1974. These libraries  provide

an  oasis of quiet and congenial environment  for

recreational and serious reading in our high-rise

satellite towns.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Printing Office has now been reorganised to

run  along  commercial  lines.  The  technique  of

offset  printing  is  rapidly  improving.  It   is

expected  that the Printing Office will ultimately

be a cost-effective unit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The People's Association will provide better

facilities  and new activities to  meet  the  more

demanding  needs of a better-educated  generation.

The  younger generation expects more sophisticated

facilities for their recreation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF SOCIAL AFFAIRS</b></div>



<br><br><i>Sports</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our youth population need to grow up healthy and

competitive and participation in sports is one way

of achieving this aim. The facilities and finances

for  more systematic promotion of sports have been

improved   and  increased.  The  National   Sports

Promotion  Board has already been established.  It

will  be considering the long-term programmes  and

requirements  of  sports. The present  facilities,

including  those  coming up  in  the  new  housing

estates, should be adequate. Improvements will  be

made  to  the Jalan Besar Stadium and the  British

Dover  Road  Sports Complex. Given  the  necessary

public support and leadership and direction by the

National Sports Promotion Board, the standards  of

sports can be improved.



<br><br><i>Social welfare</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are plans to strengthen the existing

system   of  social  welfare  services.   Existing

welfare   institutions  are  being   restructured,

whilst   new  facilities  and  services  will   be

provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing social welfare programmes for

preventive,  remedial and developmental  functions

in  social  welfare  will be further  improved  by

effective  community participation.  Some  of  the

existing services will be decentralized,  so  that

welfare  services will be provided  in  all  major

residential areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of volunteers participating in

welfare  and probation work is increasing.  It  is

encouraging to note that more men and  women  have

come forward as volunteer welfare workers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The probation and aftercare service for the

rehabilitation of offenders while they  remain  at

work  or  at  school  under supervision  is  being

strengthened. Plans for a prison social service to

devise a system of parole and aftercare suited  to

conditions in Singapore are being worked out.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF LAW AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT</b></div>



<br><br><i>Public housing</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 125,000 units of public housing have

been completed. More than 700,000 people (about 35

per  cent  of  the population) now occupy  Housing

Board flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The target is 100,000 units for the period 1971

to 1975, one flat every 26 minutes. Another half a

million  people  will  be accommodated  in  public

housing by the end of 1975.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's policy of allowing the use of

Central Provident Fund credits for the purchase of

flats  has  made it possible for more citizens  in

the  Republic  to  own their flats.  Today  34,812

families own the flats they occupy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from 1st July 1971, the family income limit

for  the purchase of H.D.B, flats was raised  from

$1,200  per month to $1,500 per month. For them  a

larger  type  of  5-room flat is  being  built  to

improve the quality of public housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Costs of land have gone up and will now go up

further  by  the  increased  compensation  and  ex

gratia  payment  rates for resettlement.  Building

material prices have also gone up. The H.D.B, has

so  far  managed to maintain rentals  and  selling

prices  of public housing fixed many years ago  by

increasing   the  subsidies.  The   provision   of

children's   playgrounds,  sports  complexes   and

planting  of  shrubs  and  trees  within   housing

estates  have not led to any increase  in  service

and  conservancy  charges. Again  this  has  meant

increasing the subsidy for public housing.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>East Coast Reclamation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the East Coast Reclamation, 1,125 acres of

land  have so far been reclaimed. Work has already

begun  to  reclaim another 165 acres of land  from

Tanjong  Rhu along Nicoll Highway to the mouth  of

the  Singapore River, and 1,350 acres of land from

Bedok to the foreshore of Nicoll Drve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reclaimed area is magnificently sited. It

will  make  residential and commercial development

by   both  the  public  and  the  private  sectors

possible   on  a  comprehensive  basis   under   a

development master plan. It will give Singapore  a

new  skyline viewed from the sea and open up miles

of  beaches and acres of parkland for our  people.

Hence  we  must fight pollution from  the  rivers,

canals, and oil and other spillage from ships.



<br><br><i>Urban renewal</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three sales of 41 urban renewal sites have been

successfully  launched. The  projects  range  from

office  buildings, shops, hotels and entertainment

centres to housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important aspect of urban renewal is

environmental improvement. The provision of roads,

drainage,  car  parks,  modern  sanitation,   open

spaces  and  landscaping of the  city  centre  are

necessary   for   a   gracious  environment.   The

possibilities in this direction can be seen in the

development  programme in Precinct South  I  where

New  Bridge  Road, Outram Road and  Havelock  Road

have  been widened and a large and attractive city

park at Pearl's Hill is nearing completion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many large projects now under construction or

recently  completed,  in  the  city  centre,  have

benefited    from   the   basic    planning    and

architectural  concepts under  the  urban  renewal

programme.  Our aim is to build not  only  a  more

functional  but  also  a  beautiful  and  gracious

metropolis.



<br><br><i>Public works</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Works Department completed projects

costing about $64 million, between August 1970 and

July 1971,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>



compared  to  $53  million for  the  corresponding

period the year before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development included construction and

improvement  of  roads, bridges, sewers,  drainage

and   flood   alleviation   schemes,   parks   and

playgrounds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>Roads</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's first flyover, across Clemenceau

Avenue, was opened to traffic in mid-1970. By  the

end  of the year, another two flyovers were opened

for use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work on the Pan-Island Expressway has been

started.  Sections of the Expressway from  Whitley

Road  to  the Turf Club, from Paya Lebar to  Jalan

Eunos,  and  the  extension  to  Sims  Avenue  are

nearing completion.



<br><br><i>Drinage</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bukit Timah Flood Alleviation Scheme, a

major    drainage    project,    has    progressed

satisfactorily.  The diversion canal,  which  will

carry storm water runoff from the 2,670.acre Upper

Bukit  Timah  Catchment, is already in  operation.

The  whole  length  of  Sungei  Whampoa  has  been

concrete-lined.  The lining  of  the  Bukit  Timah

Canal  is  progressing. Stamford  Canal  has  been

chosen as the pilot project for antipollution  and

purification  of  river  and  canal  waters.   The

results will begin to be seen by 1972.



<br><br><i>Sewerage</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our sewerage network at present covers 447 miles

of  sewers  serving over one million people.  This

network must in 10 years be extended so that every

home   on  the  island  can  reach  a  main  sewer

economically.   All  bath,  kitchen,   and   dirty

household  or industrial wastewater must  go  into

the  sewers. Then we shall be able to extract more

and  more of our average of 750 million gallons  a

day.



<br><br><i>Parks and trees</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pace of planting and landscaping has been

accelerated.  Twenty-three gardens  and  23  small

roadside parks have been created since the "Garden

City"  campaign got under way 18 months  ago.  One

major project was the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>



completion  of Orchard Park in the  heart  of  the

city.  The  existing Mount Faber Scenic  Park  has

been  extended  and  will be further  improved  to

provide  more  walks  and  recreation  in   scenic

surroundings for our people.



<br><br><i>City planning</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A comprehensive physical development plan has

been  drawn  up  by  the State and  City  Planning

Office.  It  provides policy guide lines  for  the

location  and phasing of major projects in  public

housing,  industrial estate development, transport

and  public works. The plan has been prepared with

assistance  from  the  United Nations  Development

Programme.  The  recommendations of  the  U.N.D.P.

/S.C.P, study are expected to be submitted by  the

U.N, to the Government by the end of the year.



<br><br><i>Primary production</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of limited land resources, good

progress has been made in primary production. With

help  and advice from Primary Production officers,

farms  have  been  modernised and production  made

more  efficient.  Singapore is now self-sufficient

in  pork,  poultry meat and eggs, which  are  also

exported.  The thriving export trade in ornamental

fish and orchids has further increased.



<br><br><i>Legislation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six volumes of the 1970 Revised Edition of the

Statutes  of Singapore have already been published

and  brought into force; the two remaining volumes

will  come  into operation shortly. On completion,

we  shall  have a new Manual of Laws, consolidated

and  amended,  and  brought up to  date,  so  that

looking up the law will be a simpler process.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF HEALTH</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee on Medical Specialisation was

formed in 1970, so that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>



specialist treatment could reach international

standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has accepted in full the

recommendations of the Committee for the  priority

development   of   five   specialities*.   Further

comprehensive development to upgrade the whole  of

the medical services is being undertaken.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* Neurosurgery, Cardiac-thoracic Surgery, Plastics

and Reconstructive Surgery, Paediatric Surgery and Nephrology.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A planning adviser will soon be engaged+ at a

cost of $750,000. This expansion programme will be

costly.  It will modernise the existing  hospitals

and build new hospitals. The programme may include

a re-building of Singapore's main General Hospital

at   Outram   Road  to  house  the   new   medical

specialities, and also the building  of  four  new

hospitals  in  Changi (Bedok), Jurong.  Woodlands,

Seletar/Nee Soon on sites reserved in  the  Master

Plan.





<hr size="2" noshade>

+ At the time of writing Selection Committee has met

and made its recommendations of the appointment.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British Services hospitals at Alexandra and

Sembawang  will  be taken over  later  this  year.

These hospitals will cost over $5� million in  the

first year. Another $540,000 have been approved to

implement  the  interim plans of establishing  the

recommended specialities with immediate effect.  A

further $800,000 will have to be approved  for  up

dating of hospital equipment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rapidly expanding service will require a

large number of trained medical personnel. Trained

officers  for the specialities must be found  from

within  and outside the services. Since last  year

the School of Post-Graduate Medical Studies in the

University has held courses leading to the  degree

of   Master  of  Medicine  in  surgery,  medicine,

paediatrics   and   obstetrics  and   gynaecology.

However, overseas training awards will continue to

be   given  for  specialist  training  in  eminent

medical institutes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since not all our requirements for the entire

range  of  services can be manned by Singaporeans,

we  shall  continue  to allow  non-nationals  with

suitable  qualifications and expertise to practise

in Singapore. The registration laws for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>



various   medical  professions   -   for   medical

practitioners, dental surgeons and others  -  will

be  amended  to  allow the professionally  trained

persons  with non-Commonwealth qualifications  but

of comparable standards and experience to practise

in Singapore.



<br><br><i>Public health</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems of over-population, pollution of

the  environment and the growing use of  chemicals

in everyday life have to be watched and preventive

measures  taken. A clean Singapore has to  a  fair

extent  been achieved. The next phase is to  raise

the  overall  standards of  our  environment  with

effective antipollution control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development of our water resources to its

maximum is crucial. It will be necessary to  clean

up  our  rivers  and  canals. Wastewater,  whether

domestic  or industrial, must go into  the  sewers

and not into open drains, canals or rivers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This waste water from factories must be treated

to acceptable limits before it is allowed into our

drains and our watercourses. A period of grace  is

being given before the Government will enforce the

measures  under  the Environmental  Public  Health

(Prohibition on Discharge of Trade Effluents  into

Water Courses) Regulations, 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also necessary to change over to "soft"

detergents.  Other countries have found  that  the

present  "hard"  detergents  give  rise  to  water

treatment problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family planning is in its second five-year

operation.  It is being complemented by  the  laws

liberalising   abortions  and  on  the   voluntary

sterilisation  of persons. It has  been  estimated

that  about 50 per cent of the fertility  decline*

in  Singapore in the last five years has been  due

to the efforts of family planning.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first year of experience of the operation

of  the Abortion Act, 1969. (which came into force

on  20th March, 1970) the number of abortions  was

less than the original estimates of 10 per cent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>



of  births.  It  is lower than the  experience  of

other  countries which had liberalised their  laws

on   abortions.  Further,  the  vast  majority  of

abortions  done were on married women  with  large

families  and  who  could  not  afford  any   more

children.  Only 5 per cent of the applicants  were

unmarried as compared to 46 per cent in the United

Kingdom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the control of chemicals and drugs, the

various  laws  relating to their control  will  be

amended  to  ensure that the quality of  chemicals

and  drugs  is  maintained. We must  also  prevent

abuse and suppress trafficking.



<br><br><i>Hawker resettlement</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has spent, and is planning to

spend, more money to subsidise and build clean and

attractive   food  stall  complexes   for   hawker

resettlement. For the second half of this year, we

have  provided a sum of $5 million for the  Public

Health Division to acquire land as a pilot scheme.

The  Housing  and  Development  Board  will  build

hawker  complexes on these sites. The stalls  will

then  be let out at subsidised rentals. This  will

be  a subsidy not only to stallholders, but to our

workers who take their meals at these stalls.  The

Hawker  Department  has found that  when  economic

rents  are charged for these stalls, the price  of

food  goes up or less food is given for  the  same

price. In the next few years, we shall reside  all

the  hawkers  into  cleaner  and  more  attractive

surroundings, and remove one of the blots  on  our

clean and green environment.

<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF FINANCE</b></div>



<br><br><i>Treasury Division</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total revenue for the financial year

1970-1971  (actual) was $1,266.46 million,  giving

an  increase  of 20.0 per cent over  the  previous

financial  year. This increase is largely  due  to

the  buoyancy  of  the  economy  and  to  specific

measures that have been taken during the year  for

more   efficient  tax  collection.  The   budgeted

revenue estimate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>



for the current year is $1,307.2 million, which is

an  increase  of 25.5 per cent over the  estimated

revenue for 1970-1971. Revenue collection for  the

first  two months of this financial year  amounted

to $223.0 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ordinary recurrent expenditure for the

financial  year  1970-1971  was  $1,206.5  million

(actual),  an  increase of24.2 per cent  over  the

expenditure in the previous year. For the  current

financial   year  the  estimated  expenditure   is

$1,306.8  million. This is an increase  of  $266.0

million  or  25.5  per  cent  over  the  estimated

expenditure last year, or $100.3 million  or  8.31

per cent over actual expenditure. This has largely

been  due  to increases in expenditure on  defence

(33.3 per cent), economic services (71.0 per cent)

and  social services (7.1 per cent). The increased

expenditure  on  economic  services  reflects  the

policy of further expanding the infrastructure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage further foreign investment, double

taxation  agreements have been entered  into  with

eight   countries  Norway,  the  United   Kingdom,

Sweden,  Denmark, Malaysia, Australia,  Japan  and

the Netherlands. The agreements with Japan and the

Netherlands have been signed but have  yet  to  be

ratified   by   their   Parliaments   before   the

agreements are deemed to have come into  operation

with  retrospective effect from 1st  January  1971

and 1st January, 1969 respectively.



<br><br><i>Economic Development Division</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time is now opportune for Singapore to

review its overall economic strategy in the  light

of  experience gained during the past few years as

well  as  of  the changing economic and  political

conditions,  which will face the Republic  in  the

1970s.  It  has  become obvious  that  whilst  the

traditional  entrepot activities will continue  to

sustain  to  some extent the economy of Singapore,

the  diversification of the economy  commenced  in

the  last decade will have to be further extended.

Industrialisation,  which  for  purely  short-term

considerations  emphasised the  need  to  take  up

large numbers of unemployed persons,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>



will  now have to be re-examined in order  to  get

the  maximum advantage from our already  stretched

resources,  especially those of skilled  manpower.

Also, an optimum investment policy with regard  to

foreign   investment   and  industrialisation   is

necessary.  This  will involve  the  promotion  of

those   industrial  undertakings  with   worldwide

markets and high technological content. Again,  to

maintain the momentum of economic growth, a  large

reservoir  of  skills will have to be established,

especially of managerial and technical staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the new growth centres of tourism,

finance  and  communications, maximum effort  will

have  to be concentrated to develop these so  that

they  play  a more significant role in Singapore's

economic  development.  A  comprehensive  plan  is

being  prepared  for the establishment,  promotion

and  marketing  of tourist facilities  in  Sentosa

over  the  next  few years. A Corporation  charged

with  the development of Sentosa is being  formed,

and  work  has  commenced  on  the  infrastructure

facilities  on  the island. To  handle  the  large

number of aircraft and ships that will be arriving

in  Singapore  for  trade, commerce,  tourism  and

other purposes, the present air and seaports  will

be  greatly  expanded, and already a  Master  Plan

team is studying the long-term development of  the

port  facilities of Singapore to meet requirements

in  the 1990s. Decisions on the second runway  and

future  airport development will also have  to  be

taken soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To develop Singapore into the banking and

financial  centre  of  South-east  Asia,   it   is

intended  to  develop  a modern  money  market  in

Singapore which will not only serve the  needs  of

the  Republic but also assist in the economic  and

financial    development   of   our    neighbours.

Regulations   regarding   the   establishment   of

financial   organisations  and   institutions   in

Singapore  are  being liberalised to  encourage  a

more  efficient banking system and the development

in  due course of secondary markets for commercial

paper, securities, bonds, etc. In this connection,

it  is  intended  to encourage the  use  of  Asian

Dollars to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>



enable the many viable projects in Southeast Asian

countries  to  have a cheap and  ready  source  of

external  financing. It may become  necessary  for

Singapore  to  study the changes in store  in  our

traditional  relationships with the Sterling  area

as  a  result of Britain's entry into the European

Economic Community. We must expedite the growth of

the Republic as a centre for investment capital in

the  region. Already Singapore is developing as  a

gold and capital market for the region and, with a

sound  and  stable  currency and  growing  foreign

exchange   reserves,  it  will  be  possible   for

Singapore  to become a major financial centre  for

South-east Asia in the coming decade.

<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the separation of the Ministry of Home

Affairs  from  the  Ministry of the  Interior  and

Defence, the modernization of the Police Force has

dominated the attention of the new Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an increasingly industrialized, urbanized,

and  literate  Singapore, the  Police  Force  must

adjust  and introduce new methods to maintain  law

and order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has identified the long-term and

short-term needs of the Police Force. On  a  ratio

of  every 250.000 to 300,000 people to one  police

division  for optimum operational efficiency,  the

Police  Force  requires, within the  next  decade,

four  more  divisions in addition to  the  present

eight.   This   estimate  is  based   on   current

projections  of  population growth.  The  existing

eight  divisional boundaries were  drawn  up  more

than  two  decades ago. The location of divisional

headquarters     and     the     boundaries     of

responsibilities  between  them  will  take   into

account  the  redistribution  of  population  from

urban   renewal,  new  private  and  Housing   and

Development Board housing estates, and  industrial

centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The programme of reorganisation and

modernization   is   to  achieve   the   following

objectives: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Improved management techniques to enhance

administrative efficiency;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) More economical utilization of manpower to

secure maximum efficiency in police work;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Greater and more effective use of

science  and  technology in police  work  in

those   areas   for   the   prevention   and

detection  of crimes where innovations  have

proved     cost-effective    in     advanced

countries;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Better training of the rank and file

and   the  officer  corps,  to  become  more

efficient in a changing environment; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) Better relations with and more co-operation

from  the public, without whose support  and

confidence the Police Force cannot discharge

its responsibilities adequately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future of the Force will depend on the

recruitment of better-qualified personnel  in  the

rank  and  file. It is recognised  that  the  work

conditions, emoluments, and prospects  for  career

advancement  require examination. A  Committee  of

Inquiry,  headed  by Dr Lee  Soo  Ann,  made  its

report  to  the Ministry of Home Affairs  on  18th

June  this  year.  The Ministry  is  studying  the

recommendations and decisions on them will be made

in the next few months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take the drudgery and monotony out of the

traditional labour-intensive system of  beats  and

patrols,  a new system of mobile team policing  is

being tried out in two divisions. This system will

give  the  men  on  patrol  greater  mobility  and

constant  radio contact with one another and  with

the divisional headquarters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police has begun studying the pros and cons

of  computerization of those areas of police  work

which   have   been   computerized   in   advanced

countries.  With  the  assistance  of   the   Data

Processing  Department of MINDEF  the  Police  has

embarked  on  a  programme no computerize  traffic

records.  A  feasibility study  will  be  made  to

computerize  the  processing of  traffic  records,

summonses,  warrants, and records in the  Criminal

Records Office.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has approached a friendly

government for experts to assist the Government in

reorganizing and upgrading the Police Academy  and

the  C.I.D. The burgeoning economy and more better

educated  criminally disposed youths have resulted

in   a   higher   number  of   crimes   and   more

sophistication  in the perpetration  of  them.  To

cope  with this new situation, the police must  be

equal  to the criminal in prevention and detection

methods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No amount of investigative aids, scientific

equipment  and  gadgetry can be  effectively  used

unless we have the right qualities in the officers

who make careers in the Police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The C.I.D, will also have to be re-equipped to

improve  their  capacity for crime  investigation.

The  rudiments of a criminal intelligence  service

will   be   expanded  into  a  fully   operational

organization.  The  feasibility  of   a   forensic

laboratory  in the Home Ministry is  under  study.

So,  too,  a  Narcotics Bureau to co-ordinate  the

efforts  of the Police and Customs to prevent  the

inflow of dangerous drugs into the Republic or the

use of the port as transhipment centre.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>



Its  first objective, however, must be to  nip  in

the  bud  any possibility of the spread  of  drug

addiction in Singapore.



<br><br><i>Vigilante Corps</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An additional role of civil defence has been

assigned to the Vigilante Corps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-time national service in the Vigilante

Corps  has been re-scheduled into three phases  of

four  years  each  to provide  for  civil  defence

service  in the second four-year phase. The  third

phase will be a reserve service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Civil Defence Training School will be set up

at the Vigilante Corps Leaders' Training Centre at

Buona  Vista. The centre is scheduled to  take  in

the  first  unit of: he second intake of  national

servicemen  in  November 1971. The  Civil  Defence

School will train members for a national emergency

or   civil  disaster.  The  school  will  instruct

members   in  fire  fighting,  rescue  techniques,

mechanical  aids,  first aid  and  other  training

relevant to civil defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first intake of national servicemen,

comprising 2,171 members, will flow directly  into

the civil defence service and serve as wardens.
