<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House takes note of the Report of the

Constitutional  Commission, 1966,  presented  to  this

House  as  Command Paper No. 29 of 1966, and  endorses

Statement  by  the  Minister  for  Law  and   National

Development made at the sitting of this House on  21st

December, 1966". --[Mr E. W. Barker]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1330</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Inche A. Rahim Ishak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the fact that the Report has

been  received  with acclaim by all  sections  of  the

population  speaks for itself, and the  fact  that  no

minority group has expressed dissatisfaction  with  it

speaks   volumes   for  the  wise  coverage   of   the

fundamental rights of individuals which the Commission

feels    adequately   safeguard   the    rights    and

opportunities of minority communities. The  Commission

has  done the right thing - to recommend the retention

of Article 89 of the present Constitution of Singapore

which provides that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Government shall exercise its functions in such

manner  as  to recognise the special position  of  the

Malays,  who  are the indigenous people of  Singapore,

and  accordingly it shall be the responsibility of the

Government to protect, safeguard, support, foster  and

promote   their  political,  educational,   religious,

economic, social and cultural interests and the  Malay

language.'



<br><br>It  is  my view and that of my colleagues of all races

in  the  People's  Action Party  that  the  indigenous

people  of  Singapore,  now that  Singapore  has  been

separated from Malaysia and has become a sovereign and

independent Republic, should continue at all times  to

be  accorded  the  special position  which  they  have

enjoyed in the present Constitution and in the Federal

Constitution when Singapore joined Malaysia in 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel that this special position of the Malays will

in  no way infringe upon the fundamental opportunities

and   human  rights  which  the  Constitution  of  the

Republic of Singapore will accord to citizens  of  all

races,  religions, and classes. In  other  words,  the

right  to freedom of speech, thought, expression,  and

assembly, and the right to form associations  will  in

no  way  be  affected by the extension of the  special

position  to  the Malays as the indigenous  people  of

Singapore. Every person or citizen, regardless of  his

race, religion, or class, is equal before the law  and

the necessity for recognising the special position  of

the   Malays  has,  in  fact,  no  racial   basis   or

connotation other than the fact that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1331</b></font><br><br>



this recognition is based on the reality that, as  the

indigenous people, the Malays as a group are  in  most

need of assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malays realise that they need to catch up in the

fields of education and economy with other peoples  of

Singapore. With this in view, it shall, of course,  be

the  responsibility of the Government to encourage and

instill  the  spirit of competition among Malays  with

peoples   of  other  races  and  communal  groups   in

Singapore  with a view to fostering the principles  of

equality  and justice, and with the ultimate aim  that

the  situation will be brought about where Malays,  as

Singaporeans,  will feel as one with  Singaporeans  of

other  races;  and  whereas the  Prime  Minister  said

yesterday  that the Malays, as a minority group,  were

no  longer  conscious of the fact  that  they  were  a

minority.  This means that it shall be the  deliberate

and  conscious  policy of the Singapore Government  to

continue to recognise and take concrete steps to  give

meaning  to  the  special position of  the  Malays  by

extending effective and adequate assistance  to  them.

And in extending this assistance, I know that the non-Malays   in  Singapore  are  broad-minded  enough   to

sympathise  with their Malay brethren and  big-hearted

enough not to grudge them this assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent address to a gathering of Singaporeans, I

addressed  them that the type of assistance which  the

Malays  are  in most need of is the general upliftment

in  the  field of education and economy, without  such

assistance  being  limited to a  particular  class  or

group   of  Malays,  or  to  create  under  cover   of

assistance  a  privileged minority of  Malays  working

hand-in-glove with those of other races, while leaving

the  vast majority of Malays to continue suffering  in

their  state  of  poverty and  backwardness.  In  this

matter,  I know that any superficial attempt to  solve

the  problems  of Malay economic poverty by  promoting

and   creating  a  new  class  of  Malays   comprising

businessmen, company directors, shareholders,  holders

of  free  shares, for example, will at best amount  to

self-deception  and  which, in fact,  is  an  economic

fallacy and is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1332</b></font><br><br>



bound  to fail. I think any racialist approach to  the

solution  of  the  backward economic position  of  the

Malays will fail, so long as it is not based on  sound

economic   basis.  The  alleviation  of  the  economic

poverty  of  the Malays, as of Singaporeans  of  other

races,   is  to  be  measured  by  the  increase   and

improvement of their real earnings or consumption  and

not  by the concentration of wealth in the bands of  a

few  of them. The poverty of the Malays has little  or

nothing  to  do with the absence of a Malay capitalist

class  or  the smallness of members or the absence  of

Malay  businessmen or capitalists. The creation  of  a

Malay  capitalist  class to exist side  by  side  with

capitalists of other races will not solve the economic

problem  of the Malays, because the causes which  lead

to  their state of poverty will then still remain  the

same.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government's views, as set out

in  the Statement by the Minister for Law and National

Development  made  at  the December  1966  sitting  of

Parliament  in  regard  to all the  clauses  which  it

accepts,  will be incorporated in the new Constitution

of  the Republic of Singapore when it is finally drawn

up. We accept the recommendation of the Constitutional

Commission, which is very wisely stated, that it  will

not  alter  the status quo in respect of  the  special

position  of the Malays. The P.A.P. Government  agrees

with the recommendation regarding the special position

of the Malays, and it will see to it that the relevant

provisions  and  clauses  will  be  embodied  in   the

Constitution  in  perpetuity.  Only  a   group   which

controls two-thirds of Members of Parliament  who  are

so  inclined can remove this special position  of  the

Malays  and  it is in our interests to see  that  this

never comes to pass.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malays of Singapore need not, therefore, fear

that  the  special position which they enjoy  will  be

taken away from them. In fact, they do not harbour any

fears  except  that certain sinister elements  in  our

otherwise peaceful society from time to time, in order

to  make political capital and perhaps to recover lost

ground, deliberately raise the fear that the Singapore

Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>



oppresses  the Malays, deprives them of their  special

position,  and generally are out to do  them  in.  The

people  of  Singapore are by now quite  familiar  with

these foul tactics of bankrupt politicians, whose only

hope  of  getting political support is the  appeal  to

racial  and  religious sentiments based  on  lies  and

distortions of the facts of the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is not right for any political Party,

particularly communal or racial Parties,  to  arrogate

to itself the right that only that Party can represent

a  particular  community or race, and that  only  that

Party  can  safeguard the religion of those whom  they

represent. The leaders of U.M.N.O, have from  time  to

time  made utterances to the effect that only U.M.N.O.

can  safeguard the rights of the Malays and Islam, the

religion of the Malays. Apart from the fact that  this

is  not  true and not at all logical, as Muslims  they

know  that  this  is  takbur  ---something  bombastic,

arrogant  and excessive in a claim. Special rights  or

the   special  position  extended  to  any  particular

minority  community certainly does not mean the  right

for  leaders  to  utter abuse and  for  newspapers  to

distort  and misrepresent facts in their news reports.

These  abuses, distortions and lies are bound to  show

up  sooner  or  later  in a sophisticated  and  highly

literate  society such as we have in Singapore.  These

campaigns of half-truths and lies will not impress the

people  imbued with ideals of democracy,  justice  and

fair  play.  In  fact,  the people  will  increasingly

despise  and  reject these perpetrators  of  foul  and

unfair methods of political practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In paragraph 35 of the Report the Commission mentions

that  a  Malay political organisation which, in  fact,

was  the  U.M.N.O.,  had urged  upon  it  to  consider

recommending  a  definition  for  the  word  "Malays",

suggesting that a definition should be similar to that

found  in  the Constitution of Malaysia but  conceding

that  it  should  be  limited to  citizens  only.  The

definition in the Constitution of Malaysia describes a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1334</b></font><br><br>



Malay  as  being  a person "who professes  the  Muslim

religion,  habitually speaks the Malay  language,  and

conforms to Malay custom." Mr Speaker, Sir, ten legal

luminaries  who sat on the Commission have judiciously

felt  that having regard to the description of  Malays

as the indigenous people of Singapore in Article 89 of

the Constitution of Singapore, two objections could be

made to the definition suggested by U.M.N.O. The first

was that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Certain citizens of Singapore who were not of the

Malay  race  and were not born in Singapore  would  be

accorded  "the  special position" by virtue  of  their

profession of Islam, their observance of Malay  custom

and their habitual speaking of the Malay language.'



<br><br>In  other words, Sir, by no stretch of the imagination

would  the Malays, for example, consider Mr Tan  Siew

Sin  a  Malay  because he does not speak  any  Chinese

dialect, because he follows Malay customs, and because

he becomes a Muslim if he chooses to be one day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the eleventh Member of the

Commission,  a very wise man, endorsed this  view.  He

also  happens to belong to a minority racial group  -

the  Arabs - and he is at the same time the Secretary-General of U.M.N.O., the organisation which sought  to

have the name "Malays" defined in the Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other objection of the Commission was that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'All those Malays,... who choose to renounce Islam

(admittedly  very  few) would  be  excluded  from  the

benefit of "the special position."'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position is that the Government does not intend

to  define  the  term "Malay" in the  Constitution  or

anywhere  else, except that by usage the term  "Malay"

is  widely understood to mean people of the Malay race

who inhabit Malaya, Singapore, Sabah, Sarawak, Brunei,

Indonesia and other parts of the Malay Archipelago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are in Singapore about

300,000  people of the Malay race born and brought  up

in the multiracial, multi-cultural and multi-religious

environment of our Republic, with a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>



sprinkling  from  Malaya, and possibly  slightly  more

from  Indonesia. They know of no other social  milieu.

As  Malays,  it  is,  of course, true  that  they  are

indigenous  to the whole region covered by  the  Malay

Archipelago.  But  as  citizens they  belong  only  to

Singapore. They must remain to be part and  parcel  of

the  growth  and development of every  aspect  of  the

social,  political  and economic  life  of  Singapore.

Recently, despite tantalising offers of many acres  of

free land in a neighbouring State, the Malays have  of

their own free choice, free will, chosen to remain  in

Singapore.  Must they be taken away from  the  general

state  of  progress  and prosperity  to  some  unknown

future?  Must  we allow them to be misled  by  selfish

politicians acting at the bidding of others who do not

like  to  see  Singapore Malays flourish in  a  multi-racial  State  and  enjoy the  ideal  of  increasingly

successful  experiment of multi-racial policies  which

benefit them and all others alike as never before, for

fear that their ideals will fail in the shadow of  our

success?  No.  The Malays of Singapore  have  a  stake

here, and they should not be allowed to fall victim to

the  empty  promises of people acting  as  agents  for

outsiders. The Malays of Singapore have a contribution

to  make to the success of a multi-racial society  and

the  greater  success  of the ideology  of  democratic

socialism in Singapore. We do not desire to be  bogged

down  and  be  impeded by 16th century traditions  and

ideas. They will not do us and our children any  good.

in  this  age  of  science and  technology  we  cannot

progress and advance with them, however glorious  they

be  in  our history, however proud we might be of  the

past.  Of  course, the Malays are proud of their  past

golden age, but the point is that we want to make  the

present era our golden age so that we can live in  and

be proud of the present and the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, race does not solve problems. After

almost  twenty-two years of rule, after almost twenty-two  sears in the position of leadership in Indonesia,

Dr  Soekarno has ended in the way he has because  105

million



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>



other Malays decided that he should go in that manner.

His  colleagues.  Dr Subandrio, Omar Dani,  Supardjo,

and  others are Malays, and Malays sitting in judgment

have not hesitated to pass the death sentence on them,

because, in the last analysis, it is what leaders  and

men  do for their own people which matters. It is  the

crimes  and  the things which they have  failed  their

people which will be used against them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you come from a minority community,

the  Ceylon Tamil community. Incidentally, I  saw  the

smile on your face when One of the Members across  the

Floor  yesterday described the Speaker as  an  Indian.

When  the  first Ceylon Tamils came to  this  country,

they  did  not bring much wealth with them.  But  they

brought  the  mental  attitude  to  the  question   of

education, which is wealth indeed in the richest sense

of  the  word. I have been told that in your community

mothers   often  vie  with  one  another  over   their

children's  progress at school. A  Ceylonese  told  me

that  in  their gossips some mothers even tell  a  lie

that  their  children  are top  boys  in  their  class

examinations when they are not, in fact. This is  good

competition, when mothers feel proud to say that their

children  are  doing  well at school.  It  reveals  an

attitude  in  life. It shows the premium they  put  on

their  children's education. The result,  among  other

factors, is that despite a small community of  20,000,

if  I  am  not  mistaken, Sir, there are  many  Ceylon

Tamils  in  all  the  professions - lawyers,  doctors,

engineers, scientists, university teachers and so on -

and  through  education the Ceylon.  Tamil  community,

small as it is, has emerged and their sons flourish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We Malays must also do the same. Diligence, industry,

perseverance, patience and grit are not  the  monopoly

of  any  one race. It is open to members of all  races

and all communities. The important thing, Mr Speaker,

Sir, is that the Malays of Singapore will realise  and

find ways and means to see to what good and beneficial

use  they  put  the special position  which  has  been

accorded  them.  In the years ahead,  if  the  special

position is not exploited and put



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1337</b></font><br><br>



to maximum use by them, then there can be no progress.

The special position of the Malays can be written into

the Constitution a million times, but there will he no

progress   if  realisation  and  the  correct   mental

attitude  towards this special position  and  what  it

offers is not exploited.



<br><br>2.51 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  having  read  the Report of  the  Constitutional

Commission,  1966,  I  must congratulate  the  various

members  of  the Commission on performing  a  thorough

job.   Two  recommendations  of  the  Commission,   in

particular,   attract  my  attention.   One   is   the

recommendation of the Commission to set up  a  Council

of  State. I appreciate the Commission went  into  the

matter carefully and exhaustively before it decided to

make  its recommendation for such a Council. But I  do

not  agree  with this recommendation in  view  of  the

other recommendation made by the Commission in respect

of  an  Ombudsman,  or Parliamentary Commissioner  for

Administration.  As I see it, the two proposals,  that

is,   the  Council  of  State  and  the  Parliamentary

Commissioner for Administration, are designed to serve

as  a check on Parliament. In my view, the Council  of

State  is  superfluous  to the need  of  Singapore  at

present  and  in the foreseeable future. Singapore  is

physically  a  small Republic which does  not  require

such  a  Council  of  State  to  oversee  or  restrain

Parliament.   However,   I  am   influenced   by   the

restrictions  the  Commission has  recommended  to  be

placed  on  the functions and powers of  the  proposed

Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the proposal relating to the

Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration is  more

suitable  for  the  need  of  Singapore,  for  in   my

experience  as  Member  of Parliament  for  the  Telok

Blangah   Constituency,  I  have  come   across   many

grievances  and  complaints  for  which  there  is  no

appropriate or effective



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1338</b></font><br><br>



redress by the existing machinery of administration in

Singapore. That is why I am very much impressed by the

recommendation  of  the Commission  to  recommend  the

creation of the post of Parliamentary Commissioner for

Administration  and  to  give  suitable   redress   to

citizens  in  the  event of any  maladministration  or

anomaly  arising  out of loopholes in  the  prevailing

legislation   in  Singapore.  While  I  support   such

recommendation  for  the  creation  of  the  post   of

Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, I  must

also  emphasise  my agreement with the declaration  of

the  Commission  that  it  has  high  regard  for  the

traditions   of   the  integrity,   impartiality   and

competence  of the public administration in Singapore.

in  my  view,  the creation of the post  of  Ombudsman

would  not  serve  as  an implicit  criticism  of  the

existing system of administration, but rather it would

serve  as an affirmation of the sincere desire of  the

Government  to ensure that every citizen of  Singapore

would not have his rights as a, citizen prejudiced  in

any way that is within the power of this Government to

prevent  or  remedy. I can say this  with  confidence,

because  in our Republic we have already an  efficient

and  competent  machinery to prevent or  restrain  the

deliberate  abuse of power or deliberate  omission  to

carry out the duties by various public officers in the

service  of Singapore. I support the creation  of  the

post  of Ombudsman, because it is his obvious function

to  give  redress  to  citizens who  are  in  any  way

aggrieved by Unintentional oversights in the course of

the  execution  of duties by various public  officers.

Reading  through the recommendation of the  Commission

on  the creation of the post of Ombudsman. I can  find

nothing to indicate that the reason for the Commission

to make such a recommendation is otherwise than I have

stated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In concluding, I would like to say that the existence

of  the  Ombudsman would serve to add  to  the  public

confidence  in the public administration of  Singapore

or the execution of duties by public officers.

<br><br>2.56 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

volumes have been spoken on almost every aspect of the

Report of the Constitutional Commission. I will merely

devote   my   time   to  the  consideration   of   two

institutions that the Commission has recommended.  The

first  one is the creation of an Ombudsman. The second

one  is the Council of State. This institution of  the

Ombudsman is such a novel idea, so far as Singapore is

concerned,  that I would like to consider its  history

as  it  has evolved in other countries in considerable

detail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The institution of Ombudsman has existed in Sweden

for about 150 years. It was established in Finland  in

1919  and  in  Denmark in 1954. It was as recently  as

1963  that Norway set up an Ombudsman on Danish lines.

The  jurisdiction of the Ombudsman varies from country

to  country, even in Scandinavia. In Sweden, where the

institution  has its roots going back  to  the  Middle

Ages,  the  Ombudsman is, in theory,  not  unlike  the

Chancellor  in  medieval England,  with  as  wide  and

extensive jurisdiction ---



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Selvadurai, while I am familiar with

your  speaking  speed, I think the Reporters  and  the

Interpreters are having difficulty. Could you  try  to

speak   a   little  slower?  The  Reporters  and   the

Interpreters  will appreciate it if you will  speak  a

little slower.



<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> I will try my level best. In Sweden,

where the institution has its roots going back to  the

Middle  Ages, the Ombudsman is, in theory, not  unlike

the  Chancellor in medieval England, with as wide  and

extensive  jurisdiction as he had when  the  Court  of

Equity  was  a  separate branch of the  English  legal

system. He is there essentially to help those who have

no  redress in the law. Hence the term "Ombudsman" or,

translated literally, "a man of the people", a man  to

whom  a  citizen, who is dissatisfied  with  decisions

taken by administrative authority, may appeal. Indeed,

to this day the Ombudsman in Sweden has so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1340</b></font><br><br>



wide jurisdiction that he may even review judicial  as

well as administrative decisions. But, in practice, it

is  only  where  there is no possibility  of  bringing

these  grievances before an ordinary court for review,

or  for  the  purpose of reviewing  an  administrative

decision  with  which  he  is dissatisfied,  that  the

citizens could complain to the Ombudsman.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Finland, the Swedish system has been followed to a

certain degree, but there the Ombudsman is but one  of

two  institutions who are the supreme guardians of the

law, the Chancellor of Justice and the Ombudsman.  The

reason  for  this  close affinity between  Sweden  and

Finland  is that in both these Scandinavian  countries

there  are administrative courts that are distinct  in

their   jurisdiction  and  powers  from  the  ordinary

courts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Denmark and Norway there are no administrative

courts.  The ordinary courts generally have  competent

control  and authority over administrative  decisions.

Like  the United Kingdom, the Ministers are answerable

to  Parliament for the conduct of administration.  The

Danish Ombudsman's jurisdiction extends not only to  a

review  of  the  decisions of the lower administrative

authorities, but also those of Ministers  as  well  as

military authorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ombudsman in Scandinavia was established as an

instrument  of  Parliament  for  the  supervision  and

control of administration. It is for this reason  that

those  Commonwealth countries that have  adopted  this

institution  call him the Parliamentary  Commissioner.

He  is,  in  practice,  however,  independent  of  the

Government.  In  fact,  he  is  also  independent   of

Parliament   in   the  performance  of   his   duties.

Parliament  only  lays  down  general  rules  for  his

activities. His position is equivalent to  that  of  a

people's  tribunal drawing authority from the people's

elected  representatives who  invest  him  with  great

authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ombudsman would perhaps function properly only

where   the   population  is,  to   a   large   extent

homogeneous. I doubt whether in a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1341</b></font><br><br>



large  country  where the population is heterogeneous,

the institution might work as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons why the former United Kingdom

Government had rejected the Whyatt Report recommending

the  creation of a Parliamentary Commissioner, who was

to  work  through  Parliament,  was  that  there  were

already  650-odd Ombudsmen (Members of Parliament)  in

England  who  could  receive  complaints  from   their

constituents  and  bring these  matters  to  light  in

Parliament during Question Time. However, in  view  of

the  fact that an Ombudsman in the United Kingdom  was

appointed  last year in October, it would appear  that

these  objections have been rejected  by  the  present

United  Kingdom Government. It might be  pertinent  to

note that since his appointment, little has been heard

of the Ombudsman in England, and I have been told that

the  very reason that gave rise to the clamour for  an

Ombudsman in England, namely, to check the excesses of

local government - you will remember the Critchel-Down

case  that  led to this clamour for an Ombudsman,  Mr

Speaker, Sir - has now been excluded from the area  of

jurisdiction of the Ombudsman in the United Kingdom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October 1962 the New Zealand Parliamentary

Commissioner, the first Ombudsman in the Commonwealth,

was appointed. He had roughly the same jurisdiction as

the  Ombudsman in Scandinavia, but did not have powers

of  investigation  extended to local  authorities.  He

was,  however,  unlike the Scandinavian Ombudsman,  to

act  through  Parliament  as it  were.  His  principal

function was to investigate complaints made to him  or

referred  to  him by anyone, including Ministers,  any

decision  or recommendation, including recommendations

made  to a Minister, acts done or omitted relating  to

administration ---



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am sorry to have to interrupt

you  once  again, but could you try to speak a  little

slower?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> As I was saying, the principal

function of the New Zealand Parliamentary Commissioner

was  to investigate complaints made to him or referred

to him by anyone, including Ministers, any decision or

recommendation, including recommendations  made  to  a

Minister,   acts   done   or   omitted   relating   to

administration  and affecting any person  or  body  of

persons in his or her personal capacity, in any of the

departments  or organisations set out in the  Schedule

to  the  Act. In the Schedule have been listed various

Government  departments as well as the various  boards

of  the  Armed Services and Public Service Commission.

But  then  there was a proviso to the effect that  the

Parliamentary Commissioner shall not be authorised  to

investigate any judicial decision, nor was he to touch

on  matters relating to terms of service in the  Armed

Forces  or  orders,  commands,  decisions,  penalties,

punishments given to members of the Armed Forces.  And

if  any  question shall arise as to the extent of  the

jurisdiction,  the Supreme Court shall  be  the  final

arbiter. The Parliamentary Commissioner was also given

absolute  discretion  to  refuse  to  investigate  the

facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from New Zealand and the United Kingdom, there

are no other Parliamentary Commissioners appointed  in

the  Commonwealth. There is provision  in  the  Guyana

Constitution  for the appointment of an Ombudsman  who

is  to have more or less the same jurisdiction as  the

Parliamentary Commissioner of New Zealand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United Kingdom the Parliamentary Commissioner

has powers to investigate where a written complaint is

duly  made, first to a Member of the House of  Commons

by a member of the public who claims to have sustained

injustice  in  consequence  of  maladministration   in

connection  with the action so taken;  and,  secondly,

the   complaint   is  referred  to  the  Parliamentary

Commissioner, with the consent of the person who  made

it, by a Member of the House with a request to conduct

an investigation into it. But he is not to investigate

into  any  action  in  respect  of  which  the  person

aggrieved has or had the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>



right  of  appeal, reference or review to or before  a

tribunal constituted by or under any enactment, or  by

virtue of Her Majesty's prerogative; and any action in

respect  of which the person aggrieved has  or  had  a

remedy by way of proceedings in any court of law.  The

Commissioner  may, however, conduct an  investigation,

notwithstanding that the person aggrieved has or had a

remedy by way of proceedings in a court of law, if  he

is  satisfied that in the particular circumstances  it

is  not  reasonable to expect the aggrieved person  to

take or to have taken such proceedings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for the Ombudsman, Mr Speaker, Sir,It is my

view  that Singapore, being a heterogeneous community,

future  constitutional commissions will have to  think

very  deeply  and carefully before it  recommends  the

institution  of an Ombudsman in Singapore.  I  do  not

have anything against it in principle. I think it is a

very  good  institution, but before it can  introduced

into  a  developing country - Singapore  being  one  -

great  care should be taken as to whether it will  fit

into   the   social  circumstances  that   obtain   in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second institution recommended by the Commission

which  I would like to consider, Mr Speaker, Sir,  is

the  Council  of State. I would, if I  may  take  some

time, like to quote fairly extensively from the Report

itself. The idea is first referred to in the Report in

paragraph 16 which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We recommend the creation of a non-elected advisory

body  to be called "the Council of State" with a small

membership,  not subject to dissolution  but  renewing

itself  at  regular  intervals by the  retirement  and

replacement  of  a  proportion  of  its   members   in

rotation.  The  members should  be  appointed  by  the

President  after consultation with the Prime  Minister

but  in the President's discretion from amongst  able,

mature citizens irrespective of race, colour or  creed

who have attained eminence or responsible positions in

their respective walks of life but who are not members

of  any  political party. We believe such a  body  can

play an effective and vital part in the affairs of the

nation in many ways. It will be able in its debates to

focus  the  attention  of the  public  on  any  matter

originating from Parliament which may adversely affect

the  interests of any minority group. It will also  be

able   to  serve  as  an  additional  check   on   new

legislation and this would be particularly useful on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1344</b></font><br><br>



matters  of  great public importance  and  on  matters

which  might affect the minorities. Also, it  will  be

able,  especially  where there is  no  responsible  or

effective  Opposition in Parliament,  to  put  forward

where it considers it necessary in the public interest

to  do so, constructive and well-informed criticism or

amendments of measures proposed in Parliament. We have

not  been  unmindful of the cost  of  having  such  an

advisory   body,   and  our  detailed  recommendations

contain  proposals  which we think  will  to  a  great

extent,  if  accepted, reduce the cost to a  sum  well

within the economy of the country to sustain.'



<br><br>Now, this idea is further adumberated in paragraphs 51

to  54  of  the Report, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am  really

interested in paragraphs 52 and 54. Paragraph 52 says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The functions and powers of the Council of State

will  be to consider all proposed legislation,  except

all  Supply Bills or a Bill presented on a Certificate

of  Urgency,  and to report thereon to Parliament.  We

consider it is essential that the public must have con

fidence  that the members of this body are independent

of the Executive and can publicly express their views,

criticisms and suggestions in respect of any  proposed

legislation. To achieve this we think it is  desirable

that  the  members should be appointed to hold  office

for a substantially long period by the President after

consultation  with  the  Prime  Minister  but  in  the

President's  discretion, that  the  Council  of  State

should  not  be  subject to dissolution  hut  renewing

itself  at  regular  intervals by the  retirement  and

replacement  of  its  members in  rotation,  that  the

proceedings of the Council of State shall be conducted

in  public  as  in  Parliament and  finally  that  the

Council  and the members thereof shall have  the  same

immunities   and  privileges  mutatis   ,mutandis   as

Parliament and the members thereof.'



<br><br>This is a very novel recommendation, Mr Speaker, Sir,

because as everyone knows and as many members  of  the

Constitutional Commission themselves must  have  known

as  lawyers,  it cannot be justified on  any  accepted

constitutional theory. Having created a creature  like

this in this Report, in paragraph 54 they seem to have

had second thoughts about the constitutional propriety

of having a House like this which is not elective. And

they go on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It will be seen that this body has many of the

attributes commonly associated with an Upper House  of

Parliament   and  we  have  given  long  and   anxious

consideration to the important question whether,  this

being so, we should recommend that it should be a part

of  Parliament.  We think we should  not,  because  we

envisage it as a purely advisory



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1345</b></font><br><br>



body not as part of the Legislature. It will be a body

separate  from Parliament but to which Parliament  can

look  for serious and weighty advice and while  having

no control over legislation, it will, to the extent of

having  given  its advice, share with  Parliament  the

responsibility for any legislation passed pursuant  to

such  advice.  We think the continued  practice  of  a

sound  democratic  system of government  in  Singapore

will  best  be  achieved if our recommendations  leave

untouched  a unicameral legislature which we  have  at

present,  where all Members of Parliament are  elected

by  the  people  by secret vote at elections  held  at

regular  intervals of years. En this way the many  and

grave  responsibilities which  Members  of  Parliament

take upon as the elected representatives of the people

will rest solely on them.'



<br><br>They cannot have it both ways. If they want to have  a

Council   of  State  in  terms  of  what   they   have

recommended,  it  must  be  based  upon  the  elective

principle.  If  they are not interested  in  having  a

House  based  upon  the elective principle,  then,  of

course,  if we must have an Upper Chamber at  all,  we

can  have a Committee, like the Privy Council  in  the

United  Kingdom, which will have its deliberations  in

private and make its recommendations to the President.

What  I  am really concerned with is this. The problem

that  we in this House face is the simple one  of  not

having the intellectuals of Singapore participating in

parliamentary  life.  If we create  a  body  like  the

Council of State, as recommended by this Report,  what

will  actually  happen is that the intellectuals  will

walk off from the parliamentary arena and will not  go

into  the constituencies and meet the people in  their

homes,  but  they will try to get into the Council  of

State   by  being  appointed  by  the  President.   In

principle, Mr Speaker, Sir, this would be detrimental

to  public  life  in Singapore, and I would  recommend

that this recommendation be not accepted at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this, I would commend the way in which the

Report  has been written. It is an exquisite document,

and after having read it. I was really sad that it was

not  a  longer document with the complete Constitution

written  out  which could be used as a prototype  when

the   final  Constitution  comes  to  be  written  for

Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1346</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion standing in

the   name  of  the  Minister  for  Law  and  National

Development.



<br><br>3.16 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, many of

my  colleagues have spoken in support of the Report of

the  Constitutional Commission, 1966, but I am  unable

to share the views of all of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I never read law and never had I the chance to

do  so. I wish to leave the legal aspects to the  more

highly educated Members of this House to deal with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I go through the Report of the Commission, I

ask  myself whether I am stupid or the Commission  has

gone  out  of its way. May I refer to page  1  of  the

Report - the terms of reference of the Commission?  In

short  -  to  give recommendations and  consider  the

question of the minorities as to how best their rights

can  be adequately safeguarded in the Constitution  of

the  Republic. Sir, this House is supposed to  have  a

Report  on minority rights, but it has become a Report

of  the  whole Constitution, as the very title  itself

shows. Mr Speaker, Sir, with the greatest respect  to

the  legal  luminaries who signed the Constitution,  I

say  that  the correct title should be "The Report  of

the  Constitutional Commission on Minority Rights".  I

repeat, Sir, " . . . on Minority Rights" alone. If the

Minister for Law and National Development had required

advice on how to write the Constitution, he would have

appointed a special Commission for that very  purpose.

But,  Sir, he did not, and I am sure that between him,

the  Attorney-General  and some  of  the  legal  Back-benchers, we are well armed to write the Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what the Government wants to know is how the

minorities should be protected - however, I  stand  to

be corrected - because in our cosmopolitan city, there

are   several   racial,   religious   and   linguistic

minorities  and  we are, therefore, concerned  to  see

that  the  majority will not bully the minorities,  or

vice versa. That having been said,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1347</b></font><br><br>



let us look at and examine the contents of the Report.

The quickest way is to look at the last page where the

conclusions should be. What do we see on pages 26  and

27?  On page 26 is "The Judiciary" and on page  27  is

"The  Public Service Commission". I would like to  ask

the Minister, are the Judiciary and the Public Service

Commission minority groups? Sir, I dare not  criticise

the  Judges. In fact, the Standing Orders  prevent  me

from doing so. So I will not say more. But if you  put

the  Public Service Commission in the Report, why  not

the  Port of Singapore Authority, the Public Utilities

Board  or,  last  but not least, the  National  Trades

Union Congress? Surely, they should be included too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to pay

tribute   to   the  Minister  for  Law  and   National

Development  for his -reasonableness in  having  taken

the   trouble   to  read  and  accept  many   of   the

recommendations  of the Commission on matters  outside

the actual terms of reference of the Commission.



<br><br>3.23 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I would like to congratulate the  eleven

Members  of  the Constitutional Commission  on  having

done  a good job. They have prepared a Report after  a

period  of eight months during which they were engaged

in  private  investigations and -public hearings  with

individuals   and   organisations   representing   the

minority races. The members of the Commission included

eminent  lawyers of various races and,  after  careful

scrutiny and study, they have put up this weighty  and

perfect  Report  on the safeguards of the  rights  and

interests  of the minority races. I believe that  this

Report not only provides constitutional safeguards for

the rights and interests of the minority races, but it

also   lays  down  a  permanent  foundation  for   the

development  of  Singapore  as  a  model  multi-racial

country.   The   recommendations  of  the   Commission

providing  for the basic rights of the minority  races

should  be  effectively safeguarded and entrenched  in

the Constitution so that the minorities may not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>



be  discriminated against. Thus, all the races will be

able to live harmoniously together and play their part

as   citizens   of  the  country.  The  Constitutional

Commission was appointed to investigate the problem of

safeguarding the interests and rights of the  minority

races. This action on the part of the Government  goes

to show that it is very judicious and far-sighted. The

Government  took  this move on its own  volition  only

four months after Singapore attained its independence.

It  shows that the Government is really concerned with

the  interests and rights of the minority races,  that

it is conscious of its duty and obligations to all the

races, and that it is very keen on building a Republic

in  which  all  races are equal and  can  enjoy  equal

rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is encouraging to see that when

the  Report  was published, it received  warm  support

from  people  in  all  walks of  life,  including  all

political  parties  and  Chambers  of  Commerce.  They

consider  it  to be very constructive  and  they  also

support  the  Government for  its  acceptance  of  the

recommendations  on the setting up  of  a  Council  of

State,   although   they  do  not   agree   with   the

recommendation  that  the  Council  should  hold   its

sittings   in   private.   They   also   praise    the

recommendation that safeguards for the basic rights of

the minorities should be provided in the Constitution.

One question that interests us is, "Why is the Barisan

Sosialis  still keeping quiet on this Report?"  Is  it

because it is ashamed of itself for not being able  to

represent the people any more?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission has recommended the adoption of

certain provisions of the Malaysian Constitution which

relate  to  basic human rights. Let me  quote  briefly

these  provisions in the Malaysian Constitution.  They

appear   in   Appendix  III  on   page   34   of   the

Constitutional Report. Article 5 is entitled  "Liberty

of the person." It reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No person shall be deprived of his life or personal

liberty save in accordance with law.'



<br><br>Article  6  is  entitled "Slavery  and  Forced  labour

prohibited." It reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) No person shall be held in slavery.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1349</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) All forms of forced labour are prohibited,...'.



<br><br>Article    7    is   entitled   "Protection    against

retrospective criminal laws and repeated  trials."  It

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) No person shall be punished for an act or

omission which was not punishable by law when  it  was

done or made,.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A person who has been acquitted or convicted of

an  offence  shall  not be tried again  for  the  same

offence...'.



<br><br>Article 8 is entitled "Equality" and it reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) All persons are equal before the law and

entitled to the equal protection of the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) ...there shall be no discrimination against

citizens on the ground only of religion, race, descent

or place of birth...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 9 is entitled "Prohibition of banishment, and

freedom of movement.' Article 10 relates to freedom of

speech, assembly and association. Article 11 is  about

freedom of religion. So these two articles provide the

freedoms  in  regard to speech, assembly,  association

and  religion. There is a provision in Article 13  for

the right of property; it says that no person shall be

deprived of property save in accordance with the  law.

So  all  these provisions which I have quoted  are  in

keeping  with the principle and spirit of the  Charter

of  the United Nations on basic human rights, and  the

Government  has  also accepted the recommendations  of

the Commission relating to such provisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, about the provision on the acquisition of

property, the Government's intention is to delete  the

phrase, "except upon just terms". I have a doubt about

this.  I  am  not  sure whether this  will  raise  any

suspicion  or  anxiety on the part of members  of  the

public.  I would like the Minister to clarify this  to

this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission also recommends the inclusion in the

Constitution of three new provisions, namely:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) No person shall be subjected to torture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) It should be granted to the citizens of Singapore the right



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1350</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to elect a government of their own choice by

secret ballot periodically.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) All citizens should be given the right to apply

to  the  court  for the enforcement  of  those

provisions  relating to fundamental rights  and

liberties.



<br><br>These are very appropriate provisions, because we  are

a  democratic country. For the sake of the country and

the  people, we must ensure that no law is  abused  by

anybody.  Any  criminal  punishment  or  any   penalty

imposed  should be carried out in accordance with  the

spirit  of  humanitarianism. Only in this way  can  we

clearly   distinguish   the  differences   between   a

democratic country and a Fascist and dictatorial one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding periodical general elections, this is a

unique  characteristic of the democratic system.  Only

with  this  provision can we safeguard the fundamental

spirit of the democratic system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the right of the citizens to apply to the court

for  the  enforcement of those-provisions relating  to

fundamental  rights and liberties, this also  goes  to

show that it is a unique manifestation of the rule  of

law  of  a  democratic country where the judiciary  is

independent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to talk about the setting up of the

Council   of  State  which  is  recommended   by   the

Commission.  I  feel that this is a very  constructive

and   valuable  recommendation.  The  Government   has

accepted this in principle and has announced that  the

Council of State will only be a consultative body  and

that  its sittings be best held in private. There  are

two  categories of members. One category  consists  of

permanent  members  and the other, removable  members.

Permanent  members will only include those people  who

have  contributed to public service. Such people  will

include  the  Chief  Justice, Cabinet  Ministers,  the

Chairman of the Public Service Commission, and others.

Removable  members will be appointed  for  a  term  of

three  years  and  they  will be-those  citizens  with

mature  minds  who have rendered distinguished  public

service or attained eminence in their respective walks

of life.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1351</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I would like to touch upon the nature of the

sittings of the Council in private. I agree with  what

the  Prime  Minister has said - that  the  holding  of

sittings in private would ensure that all opinions can

be  frankly  and  openly expressed, that  it  will  be

easier  to arrive at constructive conclusions  on  any

matter,  and that it will also enable any Bill  to  be

more in keeping with the aspirations and needs of  the

country and the interests of the people after  it  has

gone  through  the  careful scrutiny  of  the  Council

members.  On  this  point, I  am  aware  that  certain

political  parties have criticised the Government  for

wanting  the Council to hold its sittings in  private.

They  say that it is because the Government is  afraid

of  open  criticism. I feel that this kind of argument

is  incorrect. In fact, in a democratic  country  like

ours  and  in  an  open society such  as  we  have  in

Singapore,  every policy and measure of the Government

has  to  withstand the test of criticism and  we  have

been  engaged  in a series of open argument  with  the

Barisan Sosialis for a period of more than two  years.

They  have  accused us of being Fascists,  dictatorial

and  undemocratic. But in the end it has been  proved,

as a result of this open argument, that the truth lies

in  the  hands of the masses. Therefore, in  the  1963

general elections they gave us their support and voted

us into power. Thus, to say that the Government wishes

to  see  that  the Council of State hold  sittings  in

private because it is afraid of public criticism is  a

wrong accusation and is very unconvincing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission also recommends that the present

Article   89   should  be  retained  in   the   future

Constitution,  namely,  that  the  Government   should

recognize  the  special position  of  the  Malays  and

should take all steps to promote, safeguard and foster

the    various   interests   of   the   Malays.   This

recommendation is most appropriate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ever since my election as a representative of

the  Sembawang  Constituency, I have  always  been  in

close  touch with my constituents, and so I  can  very

well  understand the living conditions of the  Malays.

That  is  why  I agree that this provision  should  be

retained in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>



future Constitution. We know that compared with  other

races,  in many aspects the Malays have much room  for

improving  their  situation. So they  should  get  the

assistance  and  protection as  provided  for  in  the

Constitution   and  they  should  have  this   special

position.  Ever  since the P.A.P. Government  came  to

power, we have given every possible assistance to  the

Malays,  such as the provision of free education  from

primary  to  university level and  the  allocation  of

lands to the Malays for resettlement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Commission has also recommended three

methods   to   entrench   the   provisions   in    the

Constitution.   The  Minister  has   said   that   the

Government  wants  to  adopt  the  second  method   of

entrenchment, namely:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That the Bill for an Act of Parliament altering

certain named provisions of the Constitution shall not

be  passed  by Parliament unless the Bill is supported

at  the final voting in Parliament by the votes of not

less  than  two-thirds of all the elected  Members  of

Parliament.'



<br><br>This  method is only applicable to certain  provisions

and   institutions  stipulated  in  the   Constitution

relating to the P.S.C., the Judiciary, the Council  of

State, citizenship, etc., and only when Parliament has

approved  any  such Bill by a two-thirds majority  can

such a Bill be put into effect. I feel that on such an

important  question as amendment of the  Constitution,

the  Government's adoption of this method is  correct.

This  attitude of the Government is wise,  because  on

this  important  matter of amending the  Constitution,

the  Government should weigh the matter carefully, and

it  is  only  right for it to give this right  to  the

elected representatives of the people to consider  any

such amendment in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the office of the Ombudsman, in principle,

I  feel  that  this  suggestion is very  good  as  the

Ombudsman  will  take part in the task of  supervising

our democratic system. But I am also aware that as our

country  has been independent for less than two  years

and  has  only a few years of experience in democratic

politics,  our  people  are  still  in  the  stage  of

learning the democratic system. So the setting  up  of

an Ombudsman is an innovation, and it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1353</b></font><br><br>



is  better to wait for a time before setting it up. So

I  agree with the Prime Minister's explanation why the

Government  should delay adopting this  recommendation

until  we know the results of the experiments  in  New

Zealand and other countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I very much appreciate this steady and mature

attitude  of  the Minister. Generally  speaking,  this

Constitutional Report is very progressive  and  highly

constructive.   I  believe  that  it   will   play   a

substantial part in contributing towards the  drafting

of  our  future  Constitution. It will  safeguard  the

basic rights and interests of the minorities and  will

lay the foundation stone for our democratic system and

help  build  a  multi-racial and equal society  and  a

model Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.



<br><br>3.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, though this Commission was set up to

deliberate  upon  and  make  recommendations  on   the

question  of minority rights. There is, oddly  enough,

very little reference to or discussion of the specific

questions of minorities in the Report. The bulk of the

86 paragraphs in the 37-page Report are concerned, not

with  minority  rights  and  freedoms,  but  with  the

fundamental  rights  and  freedoms  of  the   citizens

generally. In fact, Mr Speaker, Sir, the question  of

minority  rights which the Commission was  set  up  to

inquire into is referred to in less than half a  dozen

paragraphs in Chapter II of the Report. Moreover,  the

heading   to   this  Chapter  II  is   entitled,   not

"Protection of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms of  the

Minorities," but "Protection of Fundamental Rights and

Freedoms  of the individual." Mr Speaker,  I  do  not

think  the  Commission  misunderstood  its  terms   of

reference.  If you look at the Report, Sir,  you  will

find  that  all  its  four terms  of  reference  refer

explicitly to the specific question of minority rights

and  how  these could be constitutionally safeguarded.

Perhaps  it  will be helpful to refer  to  these  four

terms of reference:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1354</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(a) To receive and consider representations on how

the  rights  of  the racial, linguistic and  religious

minorities  can  be  adequately  safeguarded  in   the

Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) To consider what provisions should be made to

ensure  that  no legislation, which by  its  practical

application  is considered likely to be discriminatory

against members of any racial, linguistic or religious

group, should be enacted before adequate opportunities

have been given for representation from parties likely

to be aggrieved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) To consider what remedies should be provided for

any citizen or group of citizens who claim that he  or

they  have  been discriminated against by any  act  or

decision  of  the Government or the administration  or

any statutory board or public body constituted by law,

and  to recommend the machinery for the redress of any

complaints.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) To consider how such provisions can be entrenched

in the Constitution.'



<br><br>Therefore, in the context it is quite clear that  what

the Commission was asked to look into was the question

of  minority rights. But even more pertinent  is  that

the  public was clear in its mind, and understood that

the  Commission was set up to inquire into the  rights

of  minorities  and  not  the  general  constitutional

rights of the citizens. And this is brought up clearly

in  Appendix  I of the Report, listing the individuals

and  organisations  who  submitted  memoranda  to  the

Commission.  With one or two possible  exceptions,  if

you  look  through  the list, all the  memoranda  came

either   from   religious   groups   associated   with

minorities   or   from   organisations   of   minority

communities. There were 83 of these. In  fact,  it  is

significant  that  there  was no  representation  from

organisations representing the majority community, nor

for  that  matter,  which is equally significant,  was

there    any    representation    from    non-communal

organisations  such as multi-racial political  parties

or multi-racial organisations like the trade unions or

civic  organisations.  It does  not  mean  that  these

organisations  representing  the  majority   or   non-communal    organisations   were   disinterested    in

constitutional matters, or that they were  indifferent

to  the questions which are raised in this Report. The

reason,  I  think, is that the majority community  and

non-communal  organisations regarded the  Commission's

work  as  relating  specifically to  the  question  of

minority rights and not to the general



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1355</b></font><br><br>



constitutional   rights  relating  to   the   citizens

generally.  So  why  then, it may be  asked,  has  the

Commission, which was set up to look into the question

of minority rights, appear - I say appear - to have paid

very  scant  attention  to  the  problem  of  minority

rights? Is it possible that the Commission has  evaded

grappling  with  the  tricky and  complex  problem  of

minority  rights by focusing attention on the  broader

and  more general aspects of constitutional rights and

freedoms?  I think this appearance of evasion  of  the

problem  arises  from  the  particular  approach   the

Commission   made   to  the  minority   question.   It

approached  it  purely  as  a constitutional  problem

when,  in  fact, as we all know, there are  many  more

facets  to  this  problem, many more  complicated  and

perhaps  far more relevant aspects to the  problem  of

minorities. But having decided to tackle the  minority

question purely as a constitutional and legal problem,

it  was  inevitable that the Commission should discuss

the   issue   in  general  constitutional  terms   and

principles. This being so, within the limits  of  this

particular and narrow approach to the subject, I think

the  Commission has very ably and succinctly said  all

that could be said on the subject in a few paragraphs.

It  has,  for  all  practical purposes,  resolved  the

problem  of  minorities in terms of  constitutional  -

rights  and  safeguards. True, there could  have  been

more  detailed  elaboration  and  discussion  of   the

minority  question  in terms of the Constitution,  but

the  relevant  and pertinent point on the  subject,  I

think,  has  been  amply and succinctly  made  by  the

Commission.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock in the Chair]</b></div>

<br><br>3.55 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essence of the matter is that, as the Commission

sees  it,  in  a democracy there can be no distinction

between majority rights and minority rights. Once  you

tackle this as a constitutional problem, there  is  no

getting  away  from  the fact  that  there  cannot  be

majority  and  minority  rights.  There  can  only  be

equality of rights, the same rights for all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1356</b></font><br><br>



without  regard to race, colour, religion or language.

In fact, the Report says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No one citizen has or ought to have less or more

rights  than  another  citizen and  similarly  no  one

individual  has or ought to have less or  more  rights

than another individual in a democratic nation.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, in a democratic society it is futile,

impractical  and dangerous for minorities  to  try  to

find  security  in  so-called  minority  rights,   for

minority  rights mean rights different from  those  or

additional to those enjoyed by the majority.  If  that

is  the way the minorities try to resolve the problem,

I  say  it is not only impractical, but worse,  it  is

dangerous  for  the  minorities.  According   to   the

Commission, it would appear that minority rights  were

sought  after  not  because the  minorities  fear  the

majority, but because they wanted more rights than the

majority. You will note, Sir, it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`...the bulk of the representations, both oral and

written,  made  to  us by the minority  racial  groups

consisted  of  requests for preferential treatment  in

some  matters  rather  than allegations  of  or  fears

regarding  discriminatory treatment on the grounds  of

race, language or religion.'



<br><br>In   other  words,  those  minority  groups  who  want

minority  rights  are  not  asking  for  these  rights

because they are afraid of the majority - because they

genuinely  believe that the majority was denying  them

equal rights - but because they want more rights  than

the  others.  If this is true, then, as I  have  said,

what the minorities are asking for is not equality  of

rights  but  unequal rights in a democracy.  They  are

trying to safeguard themselves - at least they believe

they  are  safeguarding themselves - against  possible

discrimination by the majority by asking for  favoured

constitutional  treatment, by  seeking  constitutional

provisions  which, in fact, discriminate  against  the

majority. In a democracy, as I have said, it is futile

and  impractical  for  the  minorities  to  strive  to

safeguard their rights in terms of minority rights. It

is impossible in a democracy, because I cannot imagine

under  the system of one man one vote, which  is  what

democracy  means,  the majority willingly  and  freely

agreeing  to be discriminated against in this fashion:

that is, to ask the majority to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1357</b></font><br><br>



say, "Please vote for more rights for the minorities."

This is impossible in a democracy, unless the majority

happens to be all saints. In other words, to quote the

famous  English novelist, George Orwell, who  wrote  a

novel  called "Animal Farm", "All men are  equal,  but

some  men are more equal than others." If that is  the

basis on which minority rights are pursued, then I say

it  is impractical. The only way a minority can ensure

preferential  treatment, unequal  treatment  in  their

favour  is  by  scrapping democracy altogether  or  by

ruling  over  the majority by force or the  threat  of

force.  That is the only way the minority  can  compel

the  majority  to give it minority rights,  which  are

defined as rights over and above those enjoyed by  the

majority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from the futility of trying to secure for

themselves  minority rights, there is also the  danger

in  minorities  seeking to buy security  in  terms  of

minority  rights  and what are often  termed  "special

rights"  and  preferential treatment  for  themselves.

Because  once you start defining "minority rights"  as

special rights or preferential treatment, then you are

breaching  an essential principle of democracy,  which

is  the  principle of equal rights. Once the principle

of  equal rights for all citizens is denied as a valid

principle,   even  in  theory:  once  the   minorities

propound  the theory that minority rights is a  breach

of principle of equality of rights, even in theory let

alone  in practice, then the minorities are, in  fact,

encouraging  the growth of the very danger  that  they

fear, i.e., tyranny by the majority. Because once  the

minorities  repudiate the principle of  equal  rights,

they automatically free the majority from adherence to

the  democratic principle of equal rights. They cannot

expect  the  majority  to  adhere  to  the  belief  in

equality  of  rights  when they demand  inequality  of

rights.  Once  equality of rights is  breached  or  is

qualified,  then  the  path is  readily  open  to  the

majority to pursue constitutionally its own interests;

and, worse still, without regard to the rights of  the

minority. Because once you say there is such  a  thing

as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1358</b></font><br><br>



minority  rights, the majority can say that  there  is

such  a  thing as majority rights. It is  quite  self-evident,  Sir, that if such a situation arises  -  the

conflict between minority rights and majority rights - then in a democracy I have not the slightest doubt who

is  going to win: the majority can win hands down over

the  minority who believe in minority rights. And this

the  majority can do quite constitutionally, by  sheer

weight   of  numbers.  That  is  why  I  believe   the

minorities  are  being short-sighted and  suicidal  in

upholding  the  theory that so-called minority  rights

defined  as  "special rights" are the best  safeguards

against  oppression by the majority, against injustice

by  the  majority.  I believe that  in  Singapore  the

greatest  danger to the minority today is not  tyranny

by  the  majority, but the attempt by certain minority

leaders  to  pursue the futile and  illusory  goal  of

minority rights. This is a dangerous illusion bred  by

panic, emotion, ignorance or opportunism. It is  based

on   ignorance   of   the   realities   underlying   a

constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the real objective of the minorities

should not be to run after the will-o'-the-wisp called

"minority rights", but to make certain that they  will

always enjoy equal rights. Their real problem is,  not

of  safeguarding minority rights, but whether they can

always  make sure that the principle of' equal  rights

is  safeguarded  in the constitution, i.e.,  the  same

rights  as  those  enjoyed by the majority.  In  other

words, the real safeguard for the minorities is not to

seek special rights written into the constitution, hut

the  sustenance  and safeguarding of the  constitution

based  on  the  principle of equal  rights.  What  the

minority should strive for is to ensure always that no

one  citizen,  regardless of his  race  or  colour  or

creed,  enjoys more rights than himself. If that  kind

of  constitution  can  be drawn up,  the  minority  is

always  safeguarded.  The real safeguard  is  equality

always  and  not  special  rights  written  into   the

constitution. In fact, Sir, I would say that more than

the  majority community, the-minorities have a  vested

and vital interest in preserving the constitution



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1359</b></font><br><br>



based  on  the fundamental rights and freedom  of  the

individual based on the principle of equality. That is

their  greatest  safeguard. Whether  they  survive  or

perish  will  depend on their ability to preserve  the

constitution  which recognises equality always.  Equal

rights   for  the  majority,  equal  rights  for   the

minority,    and    a   member   of    the    minority

constitutionally  is the equal  of  a  member  of  the

majority  community.  That  is  the  important  point.

Because  what the minority should always  remember  is

that  once a community, either based on race, language

or  religion, confers special rights on itself and  if

it  happens  to  be a minority, then in  no  time  the

majority  will  say, "Well, since  you  can  ask  for

special  rights,  I too will vote special  rights  for

myself.  I am in a better position to do so because  I

can  always win in an election." So I can see why  the

Commission  dismissed  minority  rights   in   a   few

paragraphs and concentrated on the real safeguard  for

the minorities, which is the protection of fundamental

rights and freedom of the individual. That is the only

safeguard  - a true democratic constitution.  In  fact,

the  minority  leader  or the  member  of  a  minority

community  should be the most ardent  supporter  of  a

democratic constitution and of the equality of rights.

He should never depart from that principle. The moment

he  talks in terms of minority rights, he is lost  and

his community is lost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said, all this may explain why the

Commission  has  concerned itself not  with  so-called

minority   rights   but  with   inquiring   into   the

fundamental rights and freedom of every citizen and it

is  within  the wider framework of fundamental  rights

and  liberties,  suggests  the  Commission,  that  the

minorities  can  really find the  security  that  they

crave  for. This. I submit, is sound practical advice.

Once  the  minorities  always and everywhere  dedicate

themselves  single-mindedly to  the  preservation  and

defence  of fundamental rights and freedom, they  will

discover that they are not fighting alone, because the

overwhelming  bulk  of  the members  of  the  majority

community too are interested in basic freedoms, and in

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1360</b></font><br><br>



desirability  of equal rights. But the  majority  will

never  be  interested in defending minority rights.  I

cannot  imagine  a  member of the  minority  community

going  to  a  constituency and  telling  the  majority

community,  "Please vote me in because I am  going  to

defend minority rights." They will say, "Well, try  to

get  a  member of the minority to come and stand  here

and  see  whether he will be voted in." Therefore,  by

the  minority identifying its rights with those of the

majority  and  getting the majority  to  identify  its

rights with those of the minority, that is, when  both

enjoy equal rights, the same rights, the majority will

always be prepared to defend equal rights because  its

own  rights  are involved. Therefore, so long  as  the

minority seeks equal rights with the majority, it  can

always  rely on the support of the majority to  defend

its  rights, because injustice or the denial of  equal

rights to the minority must eventually mean denial and

withdrawal of equal rights from the majority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, when we view the minority question purely

from   the  constitutional  angle,  we  come  to   the

irresistible conclusion that the rights and freedom of

citizens in a democratic society cannot be classified,

defined  and distinguished in terms of race,  language

or  religion. They must be the same for all  citizens.

They  must  transcend racial, linguistic and religious

differences.  Therefore, in so far  as  constitutional

safeguards  are  concerned,  the  most  sensible   and

practical course for the minorities to take is to lend

their   support  to  a  democratic  constitution   not

postulated  either  on  minority  rights  or  majority

rights  but  on  equality of rights for all  citizens.

Even   if   the  Commission,  for  some  reason,   had

recommended minority rights in this Constitution  -  I

as  a member of one of the smallest minorities - I for

one would have opposed it. If the minorities are fools

enough  to  fall into what would really be a  trap  by

accepting  special rights, then I say  that  they  are

goners  because  any  constitutional  provision  which

confers  extra  rights on the minorities,  as  I  said

earlier, precludes the majority from adhering to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1361</b></font><br><br>



the  principle  of  equal rights. The  majority  could

perhaps  set up a Commission. That is quite  possible.

Once  you have a Minorities Commission to inquire into

minority  rights,  there  is nothing  to  prevent  the

majority  from setting up a Commission  to  look  into

majority  rights.  Therefore, the best  constitutional

safeguard  is  really a constitution  which  makes  no

reference to minority rights or special rights, but to

equal  rights.  Insofar  as  it  is  a  constitutional

problem  and so long as there is a constitution  based

on  equal  rights,  I  say  that  the  future  of  the

minorities,   constitutionally,  is  permanently   and

adequately safeguarded, because even if, for  example,

we  decided  to  write  into the Constitution  special

minority  rights,  that would not guarantee  that  the

rights  would  be  safeguarded,  for,  we  all   know,

constitutions  can  be  modified,  changed  overnight,

manipulated  or  scrapped  altogether.  We   know   of

countries around us where major constitutional changes

are  made in a matter of minutes or hours - or rights

are sometimes ignored completely. This can be done  by

legal  chicanery or even by the express  will  of  the

majority  in  Parliament;  and  the  only  way  for  a

minority to dispense with the constitution is to seize

power  by  violent  means or by  intimidation  of  the

majority.  A  constitution is,  after  all,  a  formal

document  expressing  an  orderly  way  of  exercising

political  power by the community as  a  whole  or  by

those  who  have constituted themselves as the  ruling

class.  If  the  government or  the  ruling  class  is

dedicated to and really believes in democratic ideals,

then  the  constitution will be democratic.  In  fact,

even without a constitution, it will be democratic, as

this   Parliament  is  at  the  moment.  We  have   no

Constitution in the real sense of the word, but  there

is  democracy, because it is the spirit of  the  thing

that   counts.  You  can  have  the  most   democratic

constitution  in  the  world  -  and  there  are  many

totalitarian and tyrannical governments which have the

most democratic constitutions on paper - but there  is

no  democracy. There are other governments which  have

no constitutions at all; for example, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1362</b></font><br><br>



British Government, and yet it is one of the most

democratic governments in the world.



<br><br>4.20 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the nature of a constitution is not as it is

expressed  on a piece of paper but as it  works  in  a

country  -  which is the most important thing.  It  is

ultimately  determined  by the  political  temper  and

ideals of the community and the government in power or

the kind of interest that the ruling party represents.

That   is   the   best  safeguard  for  a   democratic

constitution - not a piece of paper. But if the  party

in   power   or  if  the  community  as  a  whole   is

undemocratic,  racialist or communal in outlook,  then

whatever   safeguards  might  be  written   into   the

constitution  against the evils of discrimination  and

inequality,  these  can  be  brushed  aside  and  real

tyranny  exercised  over  the people.  Therefore,  the

minorities  would  be  kidding  themselves   if   they

believed  that they could find permanent and  reliable

safeguards   against  discrimination,  injustice   and

oppression by an unreasonable majority simply  because

such   safeguards   have   been   written   into   the

constitution.  Even  if  they  are  written  into  the

constitution, my advice to the minorities is that they

must   reinforce  them  and  make  sure   that   these

constitutional provisions are sustained  by  political

action  all  the  time.  In the  final  analysis,  the

minorities   can   and   must  find   safeguards   for

themselves,  not  merely in pursuit of  constitutional

guarantees  on  nicely  written  documents,   but   in

political and economic solutions to reinforce whatever

may be written into the constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that the Commission did not touch on the

important  and  what  I consider to  be  the  relevant

aspects of the so-called minority problem. This may be

because  it  thought that this really was outside  its

terms  of  reference  or  it may  be  because  it  was

reluctant  to venture into spheres fraught with  great

complexity  and  delicacy.  But  I  believe  that  the

political, economic and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1363</b></font><br><br>



psychological   aspects  of  the  so-called   minority

problem  are more relevant and decisive to the problem

which the Commission was called upon to investigate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like, Mr Speaker, Sir, with your

permission, to supplement the admirable Report of  the

Constitutional Commission by touching briefly  on  the

political aspects of the minority question.  The  main

point  I  would  like  to make is that  the  so-called

minority problem is but a particular aspect of what is

generally  referred  to as the communal  problem.  The

minority  problem  arises only when psychologically  a

minority  feels itself to be a minority. That  is  the

psychological aspects of the problem.  So  long  as  a

minority feels that it is a minority, then it  becomes

aware of the majority as somebody outside itself,  and

therefore  a minority problem, a minority attitude,  a

minority  complex is created. If you were to read  the

history  of  modern nations, for example Britain  -  I

used  to  read English history when I was a  boy  - you

will discover that once upon a time, there was no such

thing as "Britain". There were "English", "Saxons" and

"Normans".  They  thought of  themselves  as  minority

groups. Only 100 years ago, there was no such thing as

a German nation; there was no such thing as an Italian

nation.  In  fact,  there was  no  such  thing  as  an

American  nation when Malacca was founded. There  were

Poles,  immigrants of all kinds - just like  us.  Then

over   a  period  of  years,  the  Americans  had   to

constitute themselves into a nation. It was necessary.

For example, the early settlers of America thought  of

themselves  as  Dutch,  French,  German,  English  and

Irish,  and  over a period of 100 years or more,  they

had  learned to think of themselves as Americans. They

have  not  yet  completed the process,  but  today,  a

Dutchman  or even a Japanese or Chinese or Negro  from

America will tell you that he is an American.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the problem of minorities is partly - not

altogether  - a psychological problem created  by  the

minorities.  So the first step for the  minorities  to

take  is  to stop thinking of themselves as minorities

and, more important, to stop



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1364</b></font><br><br>



acting politically as minorities. Unless they can make

that  mental  leap, there will always  be  a  minority

problem.  In some countries where there is a  minority

problem,  the  minorities  become  a  problem  to  the

majority  because they keep apart from the  rest.  The

more  you act and think like a minority, the more  you

create  a  problem with tension and conflict  and,  in

fact, you encourage the majority to think of you as  a

problem to them too. Once the majority begin to  think

of  you not as a citizen, not as part of themselves or

as  part of the nation or the community, then you  are

really  storing up trouble, because once the  majority

somehow fix in their minds that you, the minority, are

a  problem, then they will have an insoluble  minority

problem on their hands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in a multi-racial, multi-lingual and multi-cultural society like ours, the communal problem,

which  is what the minority problem is at the  present

stage of our political and social development, must be

and  will  always  remain one of  the  major  problems

which, if we do not resolve intelligently, could break

our  society, especially of an independent  Singapore.

We   all   know  what  has  happened  in  neighbouring

countries  which had allowed the communal  problem  to

get  out of hand. We are fortunate because we are  one

of  the  last countries in Asia to become independent.

Twenty  years after the decolonisation process  began,

we  are  in  the fortunate position of being  able  to

learn   from  the  mistakes  and  illusions  of  other

countries   which  acquired  their  independence   two

decades or so ago. In countries like India and Ceylon,

20  years  ago when the people were talking about  the

communal  problem, they genuinely believed  that  this

problem was wholly the creation of the imperial  power

and that it was the result or consequence wholly of  a

divide and rule policy - playing one community against

the  other.  Perhaps there is some  truth  in  this  -

colonial  powers did keep the communities divided  and

play one community against the other. And so in India,

when the people were fighting for their freedom, there

was communal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1365</b></font><br><br>



harmony  and racial unity based on nothing  more  than

common hatred of the imperial power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another good example is Ceylon. I remember when I was

a student the articles that were being written. Ceylon

was  pointed to as a success story of British colonial

policy  because in Ceylon the British had deliberately

refused  to  allow  a communal Parliament-no  communal

representation, a high literacy rate, a sound economy.

So here was one place where you could really create  a

united  nation  out of Tamils, Singhalese,  Christians

and Buddhists over a period of 10 years. And it looked

as if communalism was not a problem in Ceylon and that

somehow  they had broken through this prejudice  based

on race, language or religion. But, unfortunately, the

leaders  assumed  that the communal problem  had  been

solved  because  they subscribed to  the  thesis  that

communalism  was really the creation of  the  colonial

power  and  that once colonialism was out the  problem

was  solved. So they thought, "Yes, that is  true  -

once  the  British  are out, there would  he  communal

harmony."  But we know, Sir, that that is not  so  and

that  today  the country is torn asunder; that  people

who  have lived together for centuries and who  really

are  of  the same racial group are now bitter enemies,

and  their economy is ruined. And it will be  a  long,

long  time  before  the  problem,  based  largely   on

linguistic  differences, is resolved. I do  not  think

that  in  India or Ceylon, the leaders who fought  for

freedom  really studied the communal problem intensely

and in depth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, we in Singapore should not delude

ourselves  into  believing that once the  imperialists

are out, there would be no communal or racial problem,

or  that  because  there is harmony now  there  is  no

racial  problem.  Fortunately, the  problem  is  under

control. Nevertheless, it is necessary for us to  bear

in mind that if the communal problem is allowed to get

out  of hand because of ignorance or because we do not

understand  it  or  because we do  not  take  adequate

measures now to control



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1366</b></font><br><br>



it,  then the consequence must be violence of  a  most

barbaric  kind,  accompanied  by  economic  chaos  and

smouldering unrelenting hatreds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the point which is often overlooked by those

who  play with communal fire. There are those who play

with  communal  fire. They may just think  of  scaring

people by raising the communal bogey or by playing  on

communal   passions,  but  they   must   realise   the

inevitable  consequences that  must  follow  once  the

communal  problem is allowed to get  out  of  control.

Once you start playing with fire and the spark sets up

some conflagration, then we get a situation even worse

than what has happened either in Ceylon, India or  any

other  part  of  this world, because in  the  case  of

Singapore  the consequences of communal conflict  will

be  far  more total and far more disastrous than  they

have  been  in  some  of  the  other  countries  where

communal   violence  was  allowed  to  overwhelm   the

society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in other countries the sources of communal

conflict have been either religion, language, race, or

culture.  For  example,  in  India  it  was  primarily

religion  that was the basis of conflict. Because  the

Hindus  and Muslims are racially alike, speak more  or

less  the  same language depending on what  area  they

come from, and more or less share the same history and

culture. Again in Ceylon the Tamils and Singhalese are

culturally and racially alike. The dividing line - the

point of conflict - was just language. In fact, Sir, I

was  told that both in Ceylon and in India during  the

communal  conflict there was no way for  a  Muslim  to

know  that  the other man was a Hindu. A Muslim  might

look  like a Hindu. There was no way of distinguishing

except  by rather devious means as to who was a  Hindu

or a Muslim. Similarly it was difficult to distinguish

between a Tamil and a Singhalese.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in Singapore the communities are divided in every

conceivable way. The criteria include all the  factors

which  make  for  communal conflict - race,  language,

religion  and  culture. Each community is  divided  on

every one of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1367</b></font><br><br>



these  points. The situation is not like that  of  the

other  countries  where  only one  factor  making  for

communal  conflict  is  present.  Here  all  the  four

factors - race, language, religion and culture  -  are

present.  If  we  have a conflict, we  will  know  who

belongs to which community. So once you precipitate  a

conflict,  I  say, Sir, it must be a  total  conflict.

Therefore, unlike some of the other countries,  it  is

more  than  ever  necessary for those here  who  start

playing  around with language or religion in the  hope

of  arousing support for themselves to be cautious  of

saying,  "Oh,  so-and-so is anti-Malay;  so-and-so  is

anti-Chinese." They might think that they  are  making

these  statements  purely to get short-term  benefits,

but  once  these statements spark off a conflagration,

then  the  consequences will be far more horrible  and

terrible  than has been the case in some of the  other

countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that communal politicians and communal

parties  in  Singapore are well  aware  of  all  these

factors  that  make  for possible  communal  conflict.

Therefore,  they  make  deliberate  appeals  to  race,

language, religion and culture. I have yet  to  see  a

man  or a leader of a Party, which claims to represent

a particular minority community, making appeals to all

on the basis of general ideology. He talks in terms of

specialised  appeals - language,  race,  religion  and

culture.  One day the appeal may be to race solidarity

or  blood  brotherhood.  On other  occasions  he  will

appear  as  the defender of language or religion,  and

for a change may come forward as the champion of their

culture.  And  in  moments of desperation,  especially

just before an election or during an election, all the

four instruments may be played simultaneously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These appeals to communal factors are resorted to by

both   the   majority  community  and   the   minority

communities, i.e, all those who believe that  communal

solidarity or racial solidarity is the soundest  basis

for political action. I can well understand, though  I

deplore, those communal leaders who strive to  advance

themselves  politically by appealing to  the  communal

sentiments of the majority. I can understand a member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1368</b></font><br><br>



of the majority community wanting to play communalism.

Such  leaders  at least have a fairly good  chance  of

success  for  the  simple  reason  that  the  majority

community  can  always win hands down  in  a  communal

political contest.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Rajaratnam, you have just reached

one  hour.  Would  you like me to obtain  the  general

assent of the House for you to proceed a little beyond

that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> If it please you, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it the general assent of the House

that the Minister be permitted to proceed?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Aye.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, this being so, I cannot

understand why minority leaders should become  fervent

advocates  of communal parties and communal  politics,

because  in  Singapore  there  is  not  the  slightest

prospect of minority communal parties getting anywhere

politically   by   either  constitutional   means   or

otherwise.  Sir, if I were a communal politician  from

the majority community, the first thing I would do  is

to   subsidise  communal  politicians  from   minority

communities.  I  would  encourage  communal  political

parties  from  the  minorities.  This  would  be   the

quickest  and  easiest  way to  assure  permanent  and

unbridled  dominance by the majority community.  If  I

were  a Chinese communalist in Singapore, what I would

do  is not only to encourage communal parties but even

pass  legislation  to  say that  minority  communities

should  only  belong to minority parties or  that  one

racial community should belong to a specific political

party  and  ban  multi-racial parties.  If  I  were  a

Chinese  communal leader, that is what I would  do.  I

would encourage minorities to form their own political

parties.  I  would  be  generous  enough  to  write  a

constitution  granting a few seats for the  minorities

in  Parliament.  Five or ten seats do  not  matter.  I

would  give them that because I have nothing  to  lose

and everything



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1369</b></font><br><br>



to  gain  as  a  Chinese communalist  by  doing  this,

because  then  the minorities would forever  remain  a

minority in Parliament - an ineffective minority - and

forever  play  the  role  of  just  a  permanent   but

ineffective opposition in the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I were a Chinese communalist in Singapore, I would

see  another advantage in encouraging communal parties

among  the  minorities. I would pretend to  take  very

seriously  the  claims  of  communal  political  party

leaders  that only communal or racial parties  can  be

trusted to look after the interests and welfare of the

community  concerned.  I  would  say  that  is   quite

correct.  This  would suit the majority leaders  fine.

They  could  then  with  a  clear  conscience  confine

themselves to looking after the interests only of  the

majority  on the same principle that only a particular

race  can  look after the interest of that  particular

race.  They  could further disavow any  responsibility

for  the  welfare of the minorities, if the minorities

should  complain,  the leaders of the  majority  could

quite logically maintain that this responsibility  has

been transferred to the leaders and representatives of

minority  political parties. After all,  the  minority

communal leaders justify communal parties on the basis

that  only members of a particular race can look after

the interest of that particular race.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, worse of all is that once minority communalists

turn  to communal politics as the only solution,  then

the  majority  community is also free  to  go  in  for

uninhibited communal politics themselves. It would  be

illogical  for  the  minority  leaders  to  object  to

communal politics on the part of the majority while at

the   same   time  extolling  communal  politics   for

themselves.  The  minorities cannot  insist  that  the

majority   community  should  adhere  to  multi-racial

parties  and  make a multi-racial approach  while  the

minorities  should  go  in for communal  politics  and

racial politics. In any case, if the minority communal

leaders  were successful in getting support for  their

communal parties, if they could really mobilise all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1370</b></font><br><br>



Malays,  all Chinese, all Ceylonese, all Eurasians  to

join only communal parties, then unwittingly, even  if

the  majority  were multi-racial-minded, non-communal-minded,  they would organisationally become a communal

party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Singapore, where there is a vast

majority - in fact, almost totally - of Chinese, if  a

Malay  communal  party succeeds in rallying  only  the

Malays  around  them, there would  be  no  Malays,  no

Indians and no Ceylonese inside the majority party; so

the  Chinese  party  organisationally,  in  terms   of

membership,  must  become communal.  If  the  majority

party  happens,  because  of  the  stupidity  of   the

minorities, to be a party only of Chinese, then it  is

inevitable   that   one  day  it   must   drift   into

communalism.  So it would appear to me that  the  more

minority  communities turn to communal  politics,  the

more  certain they make the advent of what they  fear,

and  that  is communalism of the majority.  Therefore,

Sir, minority communalism is all the more foolish  and

suicidal  in Singapore, because as of today there  are

no  effective  Chinese communal parties.  That  is  an

interesting fact. The majority has not resorted to the

formation  of  communal parties. There was  some  time

ago,  it is true, the M.C.A., but it has vanished from

political life simply because it could not get support

from  the majority community. Therefore, today we  are

in  the fortunate position that the majority community

in Singapore is expressing itself through multi-racial

parties  and  this  has acted as  a  brake-on  Chinese

communalism which undoubtedly exists as a latent force

and  will continue to do so for some time. But so long

as  the Chinese express-themselves politically through

multi-racial  parties,  the  communalists  among   the

majority will always be under check.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, as we see it, the best guarantee against

communalism  by  the  majority is  the  emergence  and

consolidation  of multi-racial parties.  Only  through

multi-racial  parties  can  the  minorities  get   the

majority   to  reach  accommodation  with   them,   by

compelling the majority to pay regard to the interests

of all, the majority as well



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1371</b></font><br><br>



as  the minorities. Any minority leader who tells  his

people  that the united strength of his community  can

prevail  over the united strength of the  majority  is

leading  his people to perdition. The truth that  must

be  got across to the minority communities as soon  as

possible is this. The majority community has  more  to

gain  from communal politics. That is fact number one.

Somehow  we must drive into the minds of the  minority

communities  that  if  they  want  to  play   communal

politics,  then  victory  would  go  to  the  majority

community.  Make  no mistake about  it.  And  for  the

minorities, the day that multi-racial parties  decline

in Singapore, that is their day of doom. More than the

majority community, therefore, the minorities  have  a

vital  interest in the growth and dominance of  multi-racial parties whether of the Right or of the Left. So

when  I  hear  leaders  from the minority  communities

mouthing  communal slogans day in and day out,  hoping

to  succeed in deluding the minorities into taking the

communal road, I am convinced that they will turn  out

to  be, historically and objectively, the men who have

betrayed  and  destroyed the race,  the  language  and

religion  which  they now profess to  defend,  because

every  time a minority leader talks of "Malays unite,"

or "Indians unite," or "Eurasians unite," or Ceylonese

unite,"  I  know the day will come when somebody  will

get  up  and  say, "Chinese unite." If the  minorities

keep  on  talking about Malays unite,  Indians  unite,

then  there must come a day when the Chinese will say,

"All  right,  now  I  will say what  you  people  say.

Chinese  unite." And when that day comes, then  I  say

whatever  might be written into the constitution,  the

minorities  are lost. The other way, as I  have  said,

which  constitutionally is the best safeguard for  the

minorities,  is  to ask for equal rights  politically.

The  best guarantee for minorities is to fight  always

and  everywhere for multi-racial parties. And the best

way  to do that is for them to get out from their  own

communal   parties.  Then  I  say,   politically   and

constitutionally the future for the minorities will be

bright, safe and secure.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise

to  thank  the Constitutional Commission for the  very

speedy  Report  which is fundamentally  well-conceived

and  clearly expressed. Like any other piece of  work,

there are shortcomings, and if I appear to touch  only

on  them,  I  wish to emphasise that it  is  only  the

pressure  of  time  that compels  me  to  by-pass  its

virtues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Commission was appointed to consider and advise

on  ways and means to safeguard minority interests. It

has  recommended  a Council of State to  consider  all

Bills other than Supply and urgent ones. Not all Bills

impinge  or  infringe minority interests. I  feel  the

Commission should have recommended a Council that will

only consider Bills certified by the Speaker as likely

to affect minority interests. This Commission has also

recommended  that the Council, consisting of  nominees

of  the President, should publicly debate Bills before

Parliament does so. This may give rise to bad effects.

Firstly,  the focus of the spotlight will be  switched

adversely from Parliament to the Council. The House of

Lords  in  the  United Kingdom, the Senate  and  Upper

House  in other countries debate Bills after  and  not

before  Parliament. The spotlight  must  be  on  those

answerable to the people and not on those who  do  not

have  to  face the electorate. Secondly, friction  may

arise  between Parliament and the Council.  Parliament

generally is composed of people educated in the  rough

and tumble of life. Their education is a strenuous one

which  the  electorate has endorsed.  Members  of  the

Council, on the other hand, will consist



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1373</b></font><br><br>



of  eminent  men  who are very likely  to  be  learned

professionals. After the Council has publicly  debated

on the proposed legislation, Members of Parliament can

either  repeat their wisdom and apt phrases, in  which

case their public image will be tarnished. Or they can

try to unearth something new for the sake of being new

and run the risk of more damage to their public image.

The   germs  of  friction  are  abundant  in  such   a

situation.  The  Council  is  not  answerable  to  the

electorate  and  there is no basic reason  for  it  to

debate  in public. It is far better that it  does  its

work  without  casting anxious glances at  the  Public

Gallery.  Thus  I  feel  the  Commission  should  have

recommended a Council that will debate Bills certified

by  the Speaker as likely to affect minority interests

after and not before Parliament does so, privately and

not publicly. Of course, with this suggestion must  go

the further suggestion that the Council should be able

to  refer the Bills back to Parliament once again  for

further  consideration. In our  present  structure  of

elected representative government, Parliament  is  the

supreme  legislative institution second  to  none  and

answerable to none except the electorate. This must be

so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendation of the Commission for an Ombudsman

really exceeds its terms of reference, although it  is

obvious  that  it has been done so with  the  best  of

intentions.  The  Ombudsman does not really  look  for

infringement  of minority interests. His  task  is  to

ensure  that  with  the  increasing  need  for   wider

discretionary   powers   in   the   Executive,    such

discretions  are not to be abused. The  need  for  his

services  is to be debated in the context of the  good

of the whole society and not in the limited context of

how minority interests can be safeguarded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I sit down, Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish, with

your  permission, to touch on a lighter point of view.

I  refer  you  to  paragraph 84  of  the  Commission's

Report.  May  I  draw  the  attention  of  the   trade

unionists in this House to this new method of taking a

wage claim?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1374</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>5.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, looking at the Report of the Commission

as  a  whole,  we  can  clearly  understand  that  the

position  of  the  minorities in  Singapore  is  being

respected   and   protected.  There   is   no   racial

discrimination or prejudice in this country as can  be

seen  in  this Report, and most of the recommendations

are  very  enlightened. All this can make Singapore  a

model to other countries. But there is still room  for

improvement  to  perfect  the Republic  of  Singapore.

Therefore,  I  would like to touch  upon  the  various

recommendations  of  the Report in  order  to  air  my

views.  First  of  all, we can see  clearly  from  the

Report that the special position and the privileges of

the  Malays  are specially stressed. I would  like  to

draw  your  attention  to the rights  of  one  of  the

minorities.  Paragraph 34 refers  to  Article  89  (2)

which provides that the Government shall exercise  its

functions  in such manner as to recognise the  special

position  of the Malays, and to protect their  various

interests, etc. In other provisions, we can also  find

the  same  kind  of  special  care  and  emphasis   on

safeguarding the interest of the Malays without seeing

any  mention  about  the  same  safeguards  for  other

minority  races.  In principle, I  support  the  above

protection  for the Malays. But obviously  the  Malays

are  not  the only minority race in our Republic.  The

Report   also  points  out  that  in  the  June   1963

censorship of Singapore, the Chinese comprised 75  per

cent,  the  Malays 14 per cent, the  Indians  and  the

Pakistanis 8 per cent, and the rest 3 per cent of  the

total  population. So from this we can see that  there

are other minority races besides the Malay race. These

other minority races should also have their rights and

interests protected in the same way by the Government.

The provisions relating to the rights and interests of

the  minority Malays should also cover them. Only then

can it be in keeping with the spirit and principle  of

the  multi-racial society of Singapore where there are

also multi-lingual, multi-cultural and multi-religious

forms and systems.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1375</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 36 recommends that Article 9 of the

Malaysian Constitution be amended to provide  that  no

citizen  shall be banished or excluded from  Singapore

and it is recommended by the Commission to be included

in the Singapore Constitution. If we accept this, then

by  this provision we will be able to lessen any worry

among  people not born here who want to be or have  be

come citizens of Singapore and they can be assured  of

their freedom of movement and human rights. This is  a

necessary human right to be accorded to the people  by

an  elected responsible government and a Parliamentary

democracy. But on this point I would point out that it

is  not  mentioned  whether such  citizenship  can  be

cancelled. Therefore, I would like the Minister to pay

attention  to  this  and say whether  citizenship  can

still  be  deprived  when this provision  s  accepted,

namely,  the  provision  that  no  citizen  shall   be

banished or excluded from Singapore. If this point  is

not  made clear in the provision and a person who  has

received citizenship has had it cancelled, he will  no

longer become a citizen of Singapore and may be liable

to  be  banished  from  Singapore.  This  is  somewhat

inconsistent  with  the  provisions  in  the   Report.

Therefore,  with  reference to  paragraph  36  of  the

Report. I suggest in the provision which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`9. -(I) No citizen shall be banished or excluded

from Singapore;'



<br><br>there should also be added a stipulation that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No citizen shall be deprived of his citizenship;'



<br><br>in  order  to assuage any fear or doubt of  those  who

have  acquired citizenship. But I must stress that  in

the  interest of the Republic we should not apply this

safeguard  to traitors or spies. At the same  time,  I

would suggest that the Minister should be empowered to

take  appropriate action against such people.  If  the

provision  can  be  amended to take  in  what  I  have

suggested,   it   will   be  less   contradictory   or

inconsistent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in paragraph 59 (i) of the Report,

it  is suggested that a small advisory body called the

Council  of State consisting of 21 members  should  be

set up. If it is to be set up on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1376</b></font><br><br>



a  very small scale as a consultative advisory body to

the  Government, the number of members should  not  be

too large; say, between five and nine members would be

more  ideal. This will reduce expenditure and increase

the  possibility of members coming to  agreement  more

easily on any matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, various opinions have been expressed by Members

of  Parliament on this Report. I would like to express

my support for the motion.



<br><br>5.49 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  every  citizen should be entitled to his  rights

and  this  Constitutional Commission  has  accordingly

submitted its recommendations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we trace the political changes or recent times, in

1954 the Rendel Commission's Report was put up and, as

a  result,  a minority was able to rule this  country.

Those who were registered voters at that time were the

only  ones  entitled to vote. The people, to  a  large

extent,  did not come forward to claim their right  to

vote,  because  they realised that  they  were  living

under  minority rule. In 1959, compulsory  voting  was

introduced and all adults were given the franchise  to

vote.  Therefore,  every  one  of  them  was  able  to

exercise his right to vote and a democratic government

was made possible. The People's Action Party then came

to power with a two-thirds majority in the Legislative

Assembly.  The reason for this victory was that  their

policies  were  multi-lingual,  multi-racial,   multi-religious and multi-cultural. They are still  carrying

out  these  policies. But one section  of  the  people

broke   away  from  the  People's  Action  Party   and

attempted to set up their own Party and form their own

government.  They brought their views to  the  people,

but  in  1963  the  People's Action  Party  was  again

returned  to power with a two-thirds majority  in  the

Legislative Assembly. The main reason for its  success

was its belief in multi-racial policies and democratic

socialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1965, when we broke away from Malaysia and

Singapore  became independent, the minority groups  in

this country wondered whether they would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1377</b></font><br><br>



get  equal rights and status. In order to remove  such

fears,  the  Government appointed  the  Constitutional

Commission   in   1966.  About   50   individuals   or

representatives  of  associations  and, groups   gave

evidence   before  this  Commission.  The   Commission

studied  the evidence carefully and then prepared  its

Report. Even so, it appears that the evidence given to

the  Commission  has not been cited  anywhere  in  the

Report.  Did the evidence ask for special  rights  and

equal  status? We do not quite know what the  evidence

was.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Report of the Constitutional Commission

deals   with  equal  rights  and  status  for  various

sections  of  the people. A Council of  State  with  a

membership of 21 has been proposed' by the Commission,

but  I  would  regard  this  number  as  too  big.   A

membership  of 15 would be appropriate.  It  does  not

appear  right  to me that the Council of State  should

function for a period of nine years, because elections

take  place once every five years. Therefore, I  would

suggest that the nine-year period should be reduced to

a  five-year  period  and that the  Council  of  State

should be formed with due cognisance of the membership

of Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the office of Ombudsman. In principle,

the  suggestion  of such an office may be  acceptable,

but  I  do not think it is appropriate in the  present

circumstances of our country, because we are now  just

progressing in the political field and the people have

not  yet acquired sufficient political experience. But

when  their political knowledge advances and they feel

that an Ombudsman is necessary, then the matter can be

reviewed. Members of Parliament are representatives of

the  people  and  they should strive  to  rectify  the

grievances  of  the  people. The office  of  Ombudsman

raises  another  doubt.  Is  it  possible  to  get  an

individual with a sense of real purpose to  fill  such

an  office?  There are many races, many religions  and

many  cultures in this country and, therefore. I  feel

that  the question of appointing an Ombudsman  is  not

quite appropriate at this juncture.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1378</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain opinions have been expressed about ballot

papers.  It has been suggested that serial numbers  on

ballot  papers are not quite right and perhaps not  in

keeping  with democratic procedures, that the  secrecy

of  the  vote will be preserved if serial  numbers  on

ballot  papers  are  removed, and that  it  should  be

possible  to  do  away with serial numbers  on  ballot

papers  if the administration is efficient.  If  there

are no serial numbers on ballot papers, there will  be

forged  ballot  papers. That is why I  feel  that  the

serialisation  of  ballot  papers  is  an  appropriate

measure.  Nobody  will be taken for a ride.  Otherwise

one  voter can take four or five ballot papers to  the

polls  and nobody will be the wiser. Therefore,  I  am

unable  to accept the' suggestion that serial  numbers

on ballot papers should be removed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Foreign Affairs

spoke  at  length  on  the status of  minorities.  The

minorities  should have equal rights and  status  with

the majority. This would be the right attitude to take

to ensure that the rights and status of the minorities

are  safeguarded. It was with this in  mind  that  the

Commission  has made certain recommendations.  It  has

not  been  made-explicitly clear in  the  Report  that

equal  rights will be given to the minorities. In  any

country where there are minorities and a majority, the

seeds of destruction are ever present. If the fears of

minorities are to be removed by the majority,  such  a

Report would not have been necessary. This Report,  as

far  as  possible, has made provision for equal rights

for  minorities  and, therefore, we  should  be  in  a

position to accept the recommendations wholeheartedly.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the   main

contribution  of  the  Report  of  the  Constitutional

Commission  is  not the suggestion  of  a  Council  of

State.  On  this particular recommendation  we  should

apply our minds, because this institution would affect

the supreme law of our State



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1379</b></font><br><br>



touching    directly   on   the   implementation    of

parliamentary democracy in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I must point out that there is some

inconsistency  in the logic behind the  recommendation

to  set  up  the  Council.  There  are  flaws  in  the

reasoning.  In  paragraph 47  of  the  Report,  it  is

stressed that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Commission feels that the elected chamber should

not  be diluted by the presence of any member who  has

not been elected on a general franchise.'



<br><br>Yet in paragraph 59, it is suggested that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(viii) the Council of State shall have power to

consider  all  proposed legislation  except  all

Supply   Bills   or  a  Bill  presented   on   a

Certificate of Urgency;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ix) every Bill except all Supply Bills or an

"Urgent" Bill shall after its First reading  and

after  the  Minister  in  charge  has  made  his

opening  speech  during the Second  reading  but

before  any debate takes place on the  principle

of  the  Bill  be  submitted to the  Council  of

State.'



<br><br>This will more or less affect what the Commission  has

said in paragraph 47 above, that is to say, there  is,

in  actual  fact, the necessary channel  for  all  the

Bills,  except those Bills presented on a  Certificate

of  Urgency  or  Supply  Bills,  to  go  through  this

Council, an advisory body outside Parliament, and  the

Bills will be affected by the consideration of members

who are not elected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as mentioned in paragraph 54, the

Commission has also recognised that there are  certain

similarities  between the Council  of  State  and  the

Upper  House,  and the Commission has no intention  of

making  the  Council an Upper House  and  it  has  not

directly suggested the setting up of an Upper House in

Parliament  because  an Upper  House  in  our  present

situation is really a retrogressive step and  also  it

cannot  be  truly representative of the views  of  the

electorate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to give an example. In 1909 the Budget

introduced by Mr David Lloyd George on behalf of  the

Liberal Government was defeated in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1380</b></font><br><br>



the  Upper  House. In the end a constitutional  crisis

ensued resulting in the holding of a general election.

Finally  the  Liberal Party got  the  support  of  the

people and it led to the decline of power of the Upper

House.  So this has a very great significance  in  the

justification of an Upper House. From 1948 the  Labour

Party  also  began to reduce the power  of  the  Upper

House.  The  decline  of  the  Upper  House  and   the

ascendancy of the Lower House can be said to show that

the life of the democratic system depends on the basis

of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Switzerland, apart from the representative chamber

called  Kantonsgemeinde, there is also  a  Council  or

Senate  with  mainly elected members. The  Senate  can

also  prepare  Bills  for discussion  by  the  elected

chamber  and  can,  on behalf of the elected  chamber,

supervise  administrative and judicial  organisations.

Thus  it  also  inherits the powers of  the  Ombudsman

which   has  been  suggested  by  this  Constitutional

Commission.  It  is only because the  Senate  is  also

elected  that  there  is some justification  for  that

institution  to  be part and parcel of  the  political

system in Switzerland.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the situation here in Singapore is different.

Members  of  the  Council are to be appointed  by  the

President  after consultation with the Prime Minister.

With  this provision, perhaps we can feel somewhat  at

ease. Although we know that the President is the  Head

of State and the Prime Minister himself is elected, it

does  not  mean  that  because  of  this  the  members

appointed  would,  of  course,  represent  the   Prime

Minister. Also we cannot say that the Councillors  are

representatives of the people. In the final  analysis,

this   Council   of   State  is  not   an   absolutely

representative   organisation.   It   is    only    an

organisation  which  has many  similarities  with  the

Upper  House. It is not an Upper House, and if  we  do

not deal with it properly, it may become a twin of the

Upper House. That is the second point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that the Council of State, as

suggested,   may   not  be  able  to   take   up   the

responsibilities and duties of the Opposition. At  the

moment,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>



although  we  do not have an Opposition Party  in  the

House,   this  Council  cannot  act  on  their  behalf

because,   according   to  the   suggestion   of   the

Commission,  the Council of State will be composed  of

members  who  are not members of any political  Party.

With such limitation the Council of State will tend to

become  something like a consultative body outside  of

party  politics. I would have thought that the  Report

should  have  stressed the importance  of  checks  and

balances  to be exercised by the Council of  State  in

party politics in order to ensure that the Council  of

State will have a more clearly defined position in the

democratic  system. If it is so, then at  the  present

juncture  when  there is no Opposition in  the  House,

although  the  Party in power is  not  faced  with  an

Opposition,  the  House  can  still  get  some  active

assistance  from the non-partisan advisory body  known

as  the  Council of State. If this is set up  on  this

basis,  then it may be that such an establishment  may

be  justified. But the Commission was vague about  its

purpose in paragraph 51:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We are however convinced it would be in the best

interests of the many peoples within our small  island

Republic and for their future well-being and  that  of

the  Republic ... that an advisory body to  be  called

"the Council of State" be created ...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus it may give people a vague impression that

without such an institution like the Council of  State

and even with an elected Parliament, the interests and

welfare of the people would not be well taken care  of

or  safeguarded. Such a concept may well be  construed

as a lack of confidence in the elected Parliament, and

it   may   benefit  the  propaganda  of  anti-national

elements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in view of the above analysis, I feel that

among  the  merits  of the Council of  State  one  can

mention  that when it is uplifted, it can become  some

kind of assistant or supplement to Parliament and  can

exercise the checking and balancing function in  party

politics  as  a non-party organisation. But  regarding

the demerits, one can say that it may in future change

its nature and become an Upper House. Because of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1382</b></font><br><br>



this, I suggest that it should be given a trial period

of  five  years,  at the end of which  Parliament  can

review  its position. Then, if it is thought  that  it

would  be  proper  and  necessary  to  have  such   an

institution,  we can provide for it to be  perpetuated

in  our Constitution. But, at the moment, we are still

short  of  facts  which may merit  its  establishment.

Therefore, I feel that it is not justified for us  now

to set up this institution permanently. So only with a

trial period will it be safer all round.



<br><br>6.13 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajoo (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish

to speak in Tamil. (In Tamil) On the 9th August, 1965,

Singapore   separated   from   Malaysia   and   became

independent.  At  that time, in the administration  of

the  welfare  of the' people and in the protection  of

the  interests  of  the  minority,  a  Commission  was

appointed  to look into constitutional matters.  There

are  people  of  many  races in Singapore  and  it  is

important  that the rights of the minority  should  be

looked  into.  But  the people of  the  various  races

should  not  look after their own interests  only.  If

they look after the interests of the whole' community,

then this problem will not arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look into the history of any country of the

world, we will see that no country is evolved with one

separate race. We can take America, Britain, or Russia

as  examples. These are countries far from  us.  There

are  countries nearer to us, such as Burma,  Thailand,

Indo-China, Indonesia, and the Philippines, and we can

take  the  histories of these countries  as  examples.

These  countries did not have one single race  at  any

one time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The negroes and the whites in America consider

themselves as Americans. In New Zealand the Maoris and

the  immigrant Englishmen consider themselves  as  New

Zealanders.   In   Australia  the  natives   and   the

Englishmen who were banished from England as criminals

think themselves as Australians. When they think  like

that, there is no reason why the minority people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1383</b></font><br><br>



in  Singapore,  the  Indians and  Malays,  should  not

consider themselves as Singaporeans. From the  science

of  geography, we know that the world is a  satellite.

At  the  beginning,  there was no territory  known  as

America. The Chinese, Indians and Malays did not  join

their territories and made this world round. There  is

no history, geography or social science to prove this.

According  to Darwin's theory, human development  took

place  in  stages.  It  took the shapes  of  reptiles,

birds, animals, and monkeys, and from the monkeys, men

finally  came  out.  This  is  the  science  of  human

development.  Even those people who say that  man  was

created  by God, or Adam and Eve were created by  God,

the  present human race never says for any reason that

men  came into being with different races or cultures.

Therefore,  the world in which we live  is  the  world

around  us, and the people who live in this world  are

one.  We cannot say that you are different from us,  I

am  different from you, and he is different  from  us.

There is no place for such differences. Even the sects

created  by  religion have mentioned God by  different

names.  They never say that your God and  my  God  are

different.  They have never created such  differences.

The  Christians call the Son of God Jesus. The Muslims

have no image of God, but they think that Mohammed was

their  God's messenger. The Hindus believe that  their

gods  have  gone through different incarnations.  Like

the  Christians  and  Muslims, they  also  believe  in

incarnation.  They think Siva, Rama and  Krishna  were

different  incarnations of God. Buddha  and  Confucius

were human beings and they lived as human beings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the basis of land, man and religion, all are

equal.  They  are not different. This we can  see  for

ourselves.  When  we  realise  that,  no  one  can  be

differentiated. Though men were created  on  the  same

basis,  because of certain changes in different  parts

of   the   world,  and  because  of  the  geographical

divisions due to mountains, jungles, rivers, seas  and

distances,  people who live near to  one  another  are

closer   to  each  other,  and  because  such   people

understand



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1384</b></font><br><br>



each other better through signs and signals, they have

more or less the same living habits. So the human race

has   been  divided  into  Chinese,  Malays,  Indians,

Europeans,  Africans, etc. Mankind did not  evolve  at

the  beginning  into many races. It is  wrong  to  say

that.  I  can call my Malay and Chinese colleagues  as

members of the same human race to which I belong.  You

may  be  surprised  by that. But we may  be  different

because  of habits. I come from the southern  part  of

India, where it is very hot. I may be different due to

my  living  habits and speaking a different  language.

But  all of us belong to the same human race. We  have

differences  in  appearance, but it  is  difficult  to

change  immediately. In spite of that, we  can  always

change  our habits, languages, and opinions, and  when

we  co-ordinate  all  these things  together,  we  can

become  as  one  race. We have to give time  for  such

changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the days go by, history will change. The multi-racial links which we are going to forge now will

become  stronger in the next two or three generations.

Then  there  will  be  no  place  for  minorities  and

majorities. There will be no differences at  all.  But

till that time comes, some protection may be given  to

the  minorities or one section of the people. In  this

country, if we live in goodwill with one another,  the

social  links will be forged automatically  and  there

will be no necessity for any rules and laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning, men live in caves and satisfied

their  hunger by killing animals for food. Later  they

matured  in  intelligence  and  founded  cities.  They

developed themselves in various fields. Men progressed

in  different  ways.  At first, it  was  thought  that

floods,  storms  and earthquakes  were  due  to  God's

anger. Now men are beginning to go nearer to the moon.

We  are  not  bothered  whether the  Russians  or  the

Americans are going to land on the moon first. Whoever

get  there  first belong to the same human  race,  and

their victory is a victory for the human race.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way, we have to condemn atrocities

committed  by one human being on another human  being.

In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1385</b></font><br><br>



Vietnam, whether the Vietnamese kill the Americans

or  the Americans kill the Vietnamese, whoever  is

the  cause of such atrocities should be condemned.

What  is  the thing that has led people along  the

path  of destruction? It is the law practised  and

the  policies adopted by human beings. It is  said

that  man is a creature of habit. Man has to adopt

certain principles even in his daily affairs.  One

should know what time one should get up from  bed,

what  time one should go to the office,  and  what

time  one should go back to one's house. Naturally

man  will adopt these habits. When he does so,  he

will  gradually  get  into  the  habit  of  living

together  with  other people as a  community,  and

finally  he will decide that he will do such  anti

such  a  thing. This is how man devised  laws  for

himself and started to live according to the  law.

Rousseau  had  said  that man is  born  free,  but

everywhere  he is in chains. Therefore,  the  laws

drafted  by experts may at times be repressive  to

the   peace   of  mankind.  And  when   they   are

repressive, they may be compared to an  ass  which

bites  in front and kicks from the back. I am  not

opposing any passing of laws, but the laws  should

help to advance mankind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to point out one or two points in the

Report. At first, I wish to mention the Council of

State.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am afraid I must ask you to read

from the Report, as translated into Tamil, but  if

you  will refer to the paragraph, it will help  us

to identify it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): It is page 13, paragraph

46. I consider the proposals mentioned therein are

not   necessary  at  all.  Parliament   has   been

established by popular vote, and if it is not in a

position  to protect the people, then  the  people

have  the  right to change it. So the  people  who

elect  their representatives to Parliament  should

be very careful in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1386</b></font><br><br>



their choice. Parliament is based on popular vote,

and if we are going to doubt its integrity, then I

consider  the proposals mentioned in paragraph  46

are not efficient at all. I support paragraphs 47,

48 and 49 of the Report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I wish to touch on the Ombudsman. It

is  page  18, Chapter IV, paragraph 60.  At  times

there  may be circumstances in which the  people's

complaints may not be attended to. In such  cases,

the people concerned should go to their Members of

Parliament and explain things to them if they want

to  find solutions to their problems. Should  this

fail, then I say that even the Ombudsman will be a

failure.  I  do  not  know  how  much  power  this

Ombudsman will have to find solutions to problems.

Will he have more powers than Parliament? In which

case,  will he have more powers than the  Head  of

State? If he is going to have less powers than the

Head  of  State, then people can always appeal  to

the  Head of State. Will the Ombudsman be of  help

to  the people? We will have to consider all these

points.  If Parliament, which has been elected  on

popular vote, is not going to be effective, then I

will  have  to give the same reason  that  I  have

given  before.  The only thing we  can  do  is  to

improve upon the present system. That will help us

a lot.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Rajoo, was it a coincidence

that you finished at the stroke of the clock?
