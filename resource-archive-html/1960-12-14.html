<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 56 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

yesterday just before the House adjourned, we  were

discussing the duties of Inspectors of Schools. The

Minister,  in  his reply, stated that  the  primary

role  of  Inspectors  of  Schools  was  to  inspect

schools in order to advise and assist them.  I  was

very  glad to be able to agree wholeheartedly  with

him  on  that. Unfortunately, Sir, in the  carrying

out  of  the policy and in the working out  of  the

details,  things  have  gone  amiss.  I  drew   his

attention to one main function that has been  added

on, that is, to investigate into complaints sent in

by  writers of anonymous letters. I felt, Sir, that

the procedure was wrong, that the anonymous letters

should have been put into the wastepaper basket  or

sent  to  the Ministry of Home Affairs for  further

investigation.  Or if any action was  needed,  such

letters  should  have been sent  to  the  heads  of

schools  in  order not to give the impression  that

the   Ministry  assumes,  on  the  basis  of  these

complaints, that the heads and the teachers have to

prove their innocence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, just after the school closed for the

vacation, a 13-page circular was sent out-



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Thirteen - or was it 20?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> The first circular was 13

pages.  There  was  an additional second  circular.

Principals of all Government and aided schools were

asked to attend to the list of instructions so that

they could become effective from 1st January, 1961.

Sir,  perhaps  the people in the  Ministry  do  not

realise  that  even  heads  of  schools  are  human

beings, and if it is a school vacation after a

six-day   week,  surely  they  are  entitled  to   some

vacation, although we all know that in most  cases,

heads of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>



schools do not have much rest even during vacation,

because  they have to clear up arrears of work  and

prepare for the coming term.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this circular illustrates the widening gulf

that  is  now taking place, separating the Ministry

officials  from the principals and the teachers  in

the  various  schools.  Certain  relationships  are

developing  which are not desirable. Those  in  the

Ministry  somehow  act as if  they  belong  to  the

ruling  class, and those in the schools  feel  that

they belong to the subject working class.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to read out a few extracts to

illustrate my point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`School Tuck-shop Committee



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Government and aided school which has a

tuck-shop shall set up a school tuck-shop committee

comprising the following:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principal of school, Chairman;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a representative of the teachers of the school;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a representative of the hawkers of the school;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an Inspector of Schools from the Ministry of Education;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a representative of students for a secondary or

a full school; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a representative of either old boys or parents

or pupils for a primary school.



<br><br>The  School Tuck-shop Committee shall meet at least

twice a year. Other meetings should however be held

as and where necessary.'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I am just wondering whether

this  is  not  a  matter of general policy  of  the

Ministry which ought to be debated when we come  to

the  last amendment. So far the item pinpointed  is

the  item in connection with Inspectors of Schools,

and  they, I take it, perform duties laid  down  by

the Ministry. If it is part of their duty merely to

send a notice of this nature to headmasters, then I

suppose  they are just carrying out the  policy  of

the  Ministry. So that perhaps we are getting  away

from  the motion before the House, and that is,  an

amendment in connection with Inspectors of  Schools

only.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, my point here is that if

Inspectors of Schools have to be involved in  these

duties,  they will not be able to carry  out  their

duties as Inspectors of Schools. It is not in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>



connection  with  their  duties  as  Inspectors  of

Schools in this particular case-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. In that event, I suppose the

hon. Member has made his point. But if he goes into

detail  about  what a headmaster has  to  do  about

tuckshops,  then  I think perhaps  he  is  going  a

little further and dealing with the policy of  the

Ministry in connection with tuckshops.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I would like to prove here

that  in  the  procedure adopted by  Inspectors  of

Schools  towards  teachers  and  principals,  their

approach is wrong. It is pertinent to the duties of

Inspectors  of  Schools,  not  the  policy  of  the

Ministry, I think, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Is the Member then alleging

that  the  contents of that circular in  regard  to

tuckshops  were  prepared  by  the  Inspectors   of

Schools,  as  part of their duties,  and  that  the

contents  of the circular have not had the  general

approval  of the Ministry, and, therefore,  do  not

represent the policy of the Ministry? Is  that  the

allegation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I do not think that the

Minister  is  aware that the approach and  all  the

instructions  are  going  against  the  Ministerial

policy, and that if they were carried out, then the

Inspectors  of  Schools could not carry  out  their

proper  duties  as Inspectors of  Schools  if  they

become inspectors of tuckshops.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Perhaps the Minister will be

able  to  assist  us  on this  point;  whether  the

contents of this circular about tuckshops represent

Ministerial policy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard

to  the alleged circular, I am glad the Member  for

Tanglin has since corrected his statement. I  think

last  evening  he  said it was a 20-page  circular.

This  afternoon he has corrected his statement  and

said  that it was a 13-page circular. This circular

was issued with my approval. In fact, soon after we

came into office, it was important-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. That is exactly what I wish

to know. I think it is now quite clear that that is

the   general  policy  of  the  Government  in  the

Ministry  of  Education.  Therefore,  I  think,  in

fairness  to  the other Members who  have  in  fact

given notice of amendments, this matter of the

tuckshop  ought  to be discussed when we  come  to  the

final  amendment. It is, of course, a  question  of

time  available, and I am trying to be fair to  the

other Members who have given notices of amendments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, then I will proceed to the

other  answers  given  by  the  Minister.  He  says

applicants  for the 20 posts are available  but  it

takes  time  to get them approved. We have  noticed

that there seems to be more red-tape developing  in

the  Ministry,  and  it is more  difficult  to  get

approval  for appointments of teachers  and  clerks

than previously. I do not know where the fault  is,

because the Minister himself now complains that  he

is  facing  the  same  difficulty  -that  there  is

difficulty  in getting approval of appointments  to

the posts of Inspectors of Schools.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, therefore, he had to resort to the

appointment   of   heads  of  schools   as   acting

Inspectors of Schools. Sir, the result of that  has

been that heads of schools have been pulled out  of

their schools to perform duties in the Ministry  as

Inspectors of Schools, to the neglect of their  own

duties  in the schools. No doubt, senior assistants

were  appointed  in the schools to  carry  out  the

functions  of  the  heads,  but  since  the  senior

assistants   are   not  given  any   responsibility

allowance, one cannot expect them to carry out  all

their  responsibilities fully, because if  anything

goes  wrong they have to take the blame. So usually

when  it comes to important issues, they will  wait

for  the  head, who is now working in the Ministry,

to  come  along  and carry the baby himself.  Also,

Sir, in the matter of pay, if a major in an army is

asked  to do the duty of a colonel, he is given  an

acting allowance. But if he is made to do that duty

for  months, Sir, surely something must be done  to

speed up



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>



things and reduce the red tape in the Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

arising out of what the Minister said yesterday, if

I  understood him aright, he said that applications

to  fill up the vacancies in these posts were  sent

to  the P.S.C. in June and July this year. If  that

is  correct, it is now nearly six months since  the

applications  were  sent.  It  disclosed   a   very

unsatisfactory  state  of  affairs  in  so  far  as

staffing is concerned in the Education Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Leong Keng Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, just now the Member for Tanglin  said

something  regarding the matter of  principals.  We

know that the Member for Tanglin has always been  a

principal.  What he has said is for the benefit  of

principals. He does not pay attention to and has no

regard  for the interests of the parents,  students

and-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not know how those preliminary

remarks  have any relevance at all to the  question

raised  by the Member for Tanglin. Let us  come  to

the point of Inspectors of Schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  as regards the Inspectors of Schools, we know

that  in the past, the relevant department  was  in

the  hands  of the old officials. It was not  taken

proper  care  of by the Government. After  our  new

Government  came into office, we have had  to  make

some adjustments. We had to transfer some people to

the  Inspectorate. When these Inspectors go out  to

inspect  the schools, of course, this will directly

affect  the  interests  of  the  principals.  Those

principals  who in the past had been  irresponsible

and corrupted, of course, would not like this. They

wanted to carry on their old attitude under the old

Government. Of course, we do not say that  all  the

principals  are  like  this. There  are  also  many

responsible principals. When our school  inspectors

go  to visit the schools, they gather many valuable

views from the parents and the students. Since  the

Government  took  office,  we  have  established  a

Complaints Branch,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>



and  under  its direction we have dealt  with  many

cases  of  complaints. Some of the complaints  were

signed  and  some  were not.  Of  those  that  were

unsigned, we cannot, of course, say that  they  had

all  been fabricated. Of these unsigned complaints,

at  least more than 50 per cent of them were  true.

Because  it  was  a  rule  that  when  there  were

complaints  the  complainants must go  through  the

principals, it was therefore difficult for them  to

go  direct  to  the Ministry of Education  to  make

their  complaints.  We handed  these  over  to  the

Inspectors  to  investigate. It is  but  right  and

proper  because  the job of the Inspectors  is  to

investigate  the relevant matters and to  see  that

the schools are properly carried on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some examples here. Last year, there were

three  primary school principals who pocketed money

from  the  sale of books and building  funds.  They

were  properly dealt with after being called up  by

the  Inspectors.  Another primary school  principal

had, under the old Government, fabricated a diploma

to the effect that he was a University graduate. So

after due investigation, he was also properly dealt

with.  Another  example was  of  a  primary  school

principal  who signed the form of a teacher  saying

that   this   particular   teacher   was   properly

qualified,  when  it  was not  so.  This  case  was

investigated  by an Inspector and the  teacher  was

also properly dealt with. Another case was this.  A

middle  school principal appointed his own relative

to  an  important post in his school  and  also  to

control the management of the school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without these investigations by Inspectors, how

could we have found out all these anomalies in  the

schools? The Member for Tanglin must know  that  we

must accept the criticisms of parents, students and

the  public. If the principals have done no wrong,

then,  of course, they will not incur any criticism

from  anybody.  We know of a Chinese  saying  which

says,  "True  gold  will not  dread  fire."  So  if

principals carry out their functions properly, they

will  have  no fear at all. I am only mentioning  a

few  examples  here. I believe most principals  are

very responsible people and are seriously carrying



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>



out their jobs. I think only a few of them have had

complaints made against them by the people  because

they  had  already  been corrupted  under  the  old

Government. But then the Government in  those  days

had   not  carried  out  their  responsibility   of

investigating  all  these  cases.  Since  the   new

Government  took office, it has started  on  a  new

line.  Of course, there are many people who do  not

feel  satisfied.  I think all the  Inspectors  have

properly carried out their responsibilities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Parliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

Education  seems to have misunderstood my  argument

in  that  he thought that I was firstly criticizing

the  appointments of Inspectors of Schools. Sir,  I

have said that I agree completely with the Minister

regarding   the  primary  role  of  Inspectors   of

Schools.  But what the Parliamentary Secretary  has

said  has  now confirmed that although the Minister

considers the primary role of Inspectors of Schools

is  to  inspect and advise and assist, it  has  now

become  their  primary role  to  inspect  and  seek

evidence to incriminate and to punish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, rarely have I heard of Inspectors of Schools

nowadays coming with this question, "Have  you  got

any  complaints?  Is there anything  where  we  can

help?"  Sir, that is the primary role of Inspectors

of  Schools,  or should be. I hope you will  pardon

me, Sir, for having to explain in answer to what  I

have  been  accused of, that I have always  been  a

principal.  Sir,  for  nearly  31  years  I  was  a

teacher.  I  began  my  teaching  profession  as  a

teacher in a primary school.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the

Member  for  Tanglin inquired as to the  duties  of

Inspectors of Schools in the Ministry of Education,

I  did  say that the primary function of Inspectors

would   be   to   advise   on   organisation    and

administration   of   schools;   to   ensure   that

syllabuses  are  being  complied  with,  also,   of

course,  when  it comes to a teacher  crossing  the

bar, they will drop in to see whether he should  be

recommended to cross the bar, and so forth.  But  I

did add that there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>



were  other  multifarious duties, not,  of  course,

being  able  to  anticipate  what  the  Member  for

Tanglin  would want to proceed thereafter. But  the

multifarious  duties  would  include  investigation

where  complaints have been lodged.  Unfortunately,

the  Member for Tanglin keeps insisting as  if  the

only  function of the Ministry of Education or even

the   Inspectorate   is  just   in   pursuance   of

complaints.  It is part and parcel of a  change  of

government  that  there would be a  reorganisation,

not only in the Ministry of Education, but in other

Ministries.  Therefore, letters of  complaints  are

addressed to the Ministry, and sometimes personally

to  the Minister himself. Well, anyone who has  not

done  any  wrong  should  not  be  afraid  of   any

complaint,  whether  it is anonymous  or  a  signed

letter  of  complaint, because  it  can  be  safely

assumed  that if action is to be taken,  the  party

who  is  aggrieved would be given a chance  to  say

something  for  himself, and I can put  it  to  the

Member  for Tanglin, Sir, to provide any  evidence

that  harsh  treatment had been meted  out  to  any

particular  teacher or principal. In  fact,  I  can

truthfully say, Sir, that after investigations have

been  made, I do not remember a single instance  in

which I have rejected the professional advice  that

has  been  offered  by  the Inspectors  of  Schools

themselves.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr G. Kandasamy) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is a complaint of a nature which affects a

principal of a school, I invite him to have a  chat

to  discuss  the  mater. At first, some  principals

took  it  as  if it was going to be  a  black  mark

against  them,  and they hurriedly  tendered  their

resignations. I think the Member for  Tanglin  will

be  able  to find out that some of them have  since

regretted  their  move  or  have  withdrawn   their

resignations. Because all that was required was  to

say  to  them, "Look here, there is now a  complete

change   in   government.  It   is   the   people's

Government."  The  Minister is not  sitting  in  an

office segregated from the people. He is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>



an  Assemblyman who has to face the public at least

once   a   week   when   he  goes   down   to   his

constituency - like last night I did not come back to

my  home till midnight in order to meet the  people

in  my constituency to try and solve their problems

as  an Assemblyman. We listen to their problems and

try  to  do  what  we can, not just on  educational

matters but on matters embracing citizenship and on

other  matters which for some reason or other  they

feel they have to see their Assemblyman. Of course,

we  get verbal complaints, "So and so is a  wicked

man. So and so is a wicked teacher." But I am never

prepared to work on verbal complaints. If they have

a  complaint, they are expected to put it  down  in

writing.  These  complaints can  be  put  into  two

categories. When complaints are received by  me,  I

send  them  to the Chief Inspector of Schools  with

this comment, "Please investigate, or please deal."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must say that the Member for Tanglin has

been somewhat erratic in trying to infer as if  the

Inspectors of Schools in the Ministry of  Education

are  such  wicked people. After all, most of  them,

including  those  who  have been  seconded  to  the

Ministry,  have  been teachers themselves  with  as

many years of experience as the Member for Tanglin.

They have also been principals. I am confident that

when    these    officials   proceed    with    the

investigations they know exactly how to talk to the

principal or to the teacher, and how to conduct the

investigations  to  the  best  of  their   ability.

Therefore,  I  must  say that  if  the  Member  for

Tanglin  is  able to give me evidence and  tell  me

exactly  which particular official has been lacking

in  courtesy or in finesse, I will be the first  to

take  it  up  with the official concerned,  not  to

punish  him  but  to  advise him  that  times  have

changed and that they have got to go to the schools

to  find  out for themselves whether the complaints

stated  are true and, if so, what they can  suggest

should be done in the circumstances.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last evening, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Member for

Tanglin  suggested  that  he  heard  it  said  that

complaints had to be investigated within 48  hours.

I  must  say  that  this  statement  is  completely

untrue.  My colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary,

has   already  explained  how,  as  a   result   of

complaints, we have been able to follow up  to  put

right    serious   discrepancies:   for    example,

unauthorised  collections, false certificates,  and

so  forth.  Some  complaints  were  in  respect  of

reports  that  principals or  teachers  were  doing

additional  work,  perhaps  as  pianists  in  night

clubs.  Now there is a ruling in the Ministry  that

the  principals or teachers concerned  could  apply

for  permission to undertake additional  employment

not  exceeding six hours per week, and the Ministry

of   Education   very   rarely   turn   down   such

applications.   But  if  the  teachers   concerned,

knowing of the existence of such a circular, do not

ask for permission, then I think they are not being

fair. If a teacher, who should be conscientious and

fair  to  his  students, accepts  employment  as  a

pianist  in  a night club, he has got to  be  told,

"Are  you  going  to  be fair to  the  children  at

school?"  If  he  thinks that he  is  a  very  good

pianist in a night club, then perhaps he should  be

a   full-time  performer  and  withdraw  from   the

teaching service. There are other teachers who give

private tuition on the sly. Here again, we  do  not

object to a teacher wanting to give private tuition

within  limits, but his first duty is to the school

and  to  the Ministry which give him a good  living

wage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we also have complaints about the

immoral  conduct of certain teachers which  extends

even   to  the  islands.  It  is  not  for  me   to

investigate into the private life of an  individual

teacher, but it interests me, as a Minister, if his

moral  conduct affects his teaching  or  if  he  is

guilty  of  such conduct as to be a danger  to  the

morals  of  young  children. Only  then  should  an

investigation  be carried out and adequate  justice

meted out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the courses which were conducted in

the Political Study Centre



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>



for  principals  of schools and in  my  discussions

with them, I was a little surprised that principals

were   not   quite  aware  of  their   rights   and

responsibilities. In fact, some principals  appear'

not  to  have any sense of discretion. That  was  a

very   unfortunate   impression   I   gained   and,

therefore, I decided that our Inspectors should get

to  know  more about the principals of schools.  So

during the third term of this year, that is to say,

during  the  last  few months, I gave  instructions

that  Inspectors of Schools should meet  principals

in  their  various  groups once a  term.  This  has

already  taken  place, not due to  the  Member  for

Tanglin  taking  up  the  case  on  behalf  of  the

principals, but because this is a matter which  has

already exercised the minds of the Inspectorate.  I

read the minutes of these meetings and I think  the

tone   has  considerably  improved  vis-a-vis   the

principals and the inspectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking on this subject of principals, you will

remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that the  Member

for  Tanglin  asserted that he very bravely  defied

certain  requests of the Ministry to call there  to

collect  documents and cheques. This is  exactly  a

case  where  if  a principal of a  school  is  that

fearful he should not be a principal. After all,  a

principal  is  paid  a  charge  and  responsibility

allowance. Far from the principal becoming  a  peon

and   a  messenger  boy  collecting  documents  and

cheques from the Ministry, what does the Member for

Tanglin  expect the Ministry to do? Does he  expect

the  Ministry to write to the messenger boy of  the

Anglo-Chinese School - for example - to come to collect

certificates, cheques, and so forth? Naturally, the

letter  must be addressed from either the  Director

of  Education or the Accountant of the Ministry  to

the  principal, who is the officer responsible  for

the  administration of his school, and it is up  to

him   to  decide.  If  it  were  a  case  of,  say,

examinations where secrecy is important,  then  the

principal  himself should call at the Ministry  for

the   question   papers  to   be   taken   by   him

personally - that is, if the memorandum does  suggest

that  the principal should personally call  at  the

Ministry. But if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>



stereotyped letters are sent to him saying, "Please

call  at  the  Finance Section with  this  chit  to

collect  a cheque in respect of this or that",  or,

"Would you please call at the Establishment Section

when  you next visit the Ministry?" - mind the  word

"please";   we   are   being  very   courteous - or,

"Whenever  you  call  at this Ministry,  would  you

please  see  the Office Superintendent and  collect

certificates, etc.?", therefore whether he is to be

a  peon or a principal depends upon himself. So the

Member  for Tanglin has not been a very brave  man

when  he  said  that  he  defied  the  Ministry  of

Education circular and sent somebody else,  because

most principals have done that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin brought up the subject of

asking  for permission to leave the State.  Surely,

that is normal procedure.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Johore Bahru.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I myself go to Johore Bahru

for satay. I do not ask permission for that. Surely

this is a question of discretion on the part of  an

individual. It is not a question of principle. If a

person chooses to be so literal about a circular or

an instruction, I am sorry for him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the question of the bulky circular for

tuckshops - 20  pages reduced to 13 pages  within  24

hours -  this is another case where Members  of  the

Opposition  always overstate their  case  and  then

decide to check up and get cold feet, resulting  in

the  circular shrinking to 13 pages. This  circular

is  actually six pages of contents and six pages of

appendices.  This  is actually a  consolidation  of

previous  circulars. It is not  something  entirely

new  which is being sprung on principals. All  that

it  tries  to effect are standard rates of tuckshop

fees  which, on the whole, have been reduced  after

the  experience of one year based on profit and not

on  arbitrary  charges. The number of stall-holders

allowed  in each tuckshop is clearly defined.  Also

limitation  in the range of food to be  sold  by  a

stall-holder and a specimen application form.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, however, a little disappointed in the Member

for  Tanglin when he suggested, "Are not principals

expected to have their holidays?" Of course!  I  am

one of those who believe in compulsory leave, and I

think  it is good for any individual in service  to

have  his leave - of course, at the right time.  The

circular  that went round to principals of  schools

was  dated 6th December, 1960. Everybody knows that

the  next school year begins on 3rd January,  1961.

Well,  we would like to see that all tuckshops  and

stall-holders get things started properly  for  the

full  year. So a circular went out suggesting  that

principals  of English schools should meet  on  the

12th   December - that  is,  more  or  less  a   week

later - those  of Chinese schools on the  14th  (that

is,  today) and those of Malay schools on the 16th,

to  explain, if necessary, anything in the circular

which may not be quite clear. As explained earlier,

the  circulars  have to be addressed to  principals

and there is this sentence which says, "Please send

your  senior assistant to the meeting  if  you  are

unable to attend." Surely somebody responsible must

turn  up  to be able to interpret the instructions,

to ask questions, and be assured about the contents

of the circular.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the acting allowances for officers

seconded  to the Ministry, it is true that  in  the

past   there   had  been  considerable  frustration

because officers who were performing the duties  of

officers with higher responsibilities were known as

officiating and not acting. I think that  has  been

put  right.  We have recommended that all  officers

who  were  seconded or have been acting in  certain

capacities would draw acting allowances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Member for

Cairnhill  suggested  that  because  the  names  of

principals or senior teachers who have applied  for

appointments as Inspectors were sent to the  Public

Service Commission in June and July, therefore, the

position in the Ministry is unsatisfactory.  It  is

not  exactly unsatisfactory. The staffing  position

remains  like this: they are already doing the  job

in  an  acting capacity as seconded members of  the

staff.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>



Whether they will be permanent holders would depend

upon the decision of the Public Service Commission.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Kandasamy, Sir, I am afraid

the  Minister has got me wrong. I did not say  that

it  was  unsatisfactory - the fact that these  people

kept  on acting. I said that the applications  were

sent  in  June  and July, and surely some  decision

should   have  been  made  by  the  Public  Service

Commission  after  a lapse of  six  months.  If  no

decision had been made, the position therefore must

be  unsatisfactory  vis-a-vis  the  Public  Service

Commission.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Surely, Mr Deputy Speaker, we

are   not   talking   about  the   Public   Service

Commission.  We are talking about the  Ministry  of

Education.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, would the Minister not

consider  it unsatisfactory that applications  were

sent in June or July and that nothing definite  has

been  done  about  it? Is this  not  making  things

difficult for his Ministry? Fortunately for him, he

has  people  acting. If he had nobody  acting,  and

suppose  he  wanted new teachers - and it would  take

six  months  for the Public Service  Commission  to

recommend   appointments  for  the   thousands   of

teachers  who  have to come into the  service  next

year - would  that  not  be  unsatisfactory  to   the

Department?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I am not

here  to  defend the Public Service Commission.  It

may  happen  that the particulars  that  have  been

forwarded  to  the Public Service  Commission  have

been  vetted, and they have had to be  pushed  back

for  further queries, and that is where  the

ding-dong  takes  some time. That is as  far  as  I  can

really say.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Kandasamy, Sir, I am

glad  to  hear the Hon, the Minister for  Education

say   that  principals  are  expected  to  exercise

discretion, because this is something that has  not

been made clear in the past. It all depends on  how

far   the   principal   is  allowed   to   exercise

discretion. I remember being told by a very  senior

officer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>



in  the  Department, who is still there, that  when

circulars are sent round, every principal or person

concerned   must  first  put  them  into  practice.

Whether  he  or she objects to them or thinks  that

they  are  wrong,  they must be put  into  practice

first, and then the complaint or argument about  it

could  be made to the Ministry. And probably  there

was  some sense in the argument when he said,  "Can

you  imagine. Mrs Seow, if a circular goes out and

the  Ministry is not able to say that that circular

will  be implemented by everyone? That the Ministry

has to guess how many principals might think it  is

good  or how many principals might think it is  bad

and should not be implemented? It has been shown to

me,   and  insistence  has  been  made,  that   the

circulars  must  be  implemented  first.  Then  any

complaints  or  opinions as to  the  circulars  not

being  workable  should come later."  Therefore,  I

would be grateful to the Minister if he could  make

it  very  clear whether that is not so  or  whether

principals can exercise discretion. Even on  little

things  like this: sometime ago a principal sent  a

circular round the school saying, "Please send your

record  books  to  the  office."  Unfortunately  it

happened to be a European principal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> When was that?



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sometime ago, but it just -

[Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr G. Kandasamy):</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> - it just shows that this

exercising  of discretion can go a little  bit  too

far.  And  when the principal said, "Please  send",

some   teachers,   for  reasons   best   known   to

themselves,  brought  their books  to  the  office,

either  to  explain something to the  principal  or

because   the  teachers  were  free.  Then  another

circular  went round, "Teachers in this  school  do

not understand English. Please note the word `send'

and  not `bring'." Sir, things like that do happen.

And  the principals are worried as to how and  when

they  should  exercise discretion. There  are  some

people who insist on things, which go to show  that

when they exercise their discretion, they are being

told off.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing I would like to touch on is when the

Minister said that if a principal is not guilty  he

should  not be worried about complaints,  not  even

from anonymous letters, not even being investigated

into. I would like to point out, Sir, that a person

does  worry - just like the Hon. the  Prime  Minister

when  he felt that the Member for Hong Lim has  not

made  true accusations or statements about him,  he

was  very worried; so worried that he went  outside

and  challenged  him. You do feel worried  because,

when  a  statement is made against your  character,

even if you succeed in proving it in court that  it

is  not true, a smear has already been made, and to

some  people it sticks in their minds. So  that  is

why we feel that complaints should not be taken  up

unless the Minister feels that there is some  truth

and  that  they should be taken up. I  myself  have

received  complaints - after I had  stopped  teaching

and  not  when I was teaching - complaints about  the

immoral  conduct  of  teachers  in  all  sorts   of

schools,  not only the school in which  I  used  to

teach. These were anonymous and typewritten so that

it  could not be established who sent them. I  just

threw  them into the wastepaper basket. At first  I

thought this was a Ministry of Education affair and

should  be  sent there, but, on second thoughts,  I

thought that, if a man is not brave enough  to  put

down  his  signature and tries to hide his identity

by even typing out his letter, it is not worthwhile

and  so  I threw the complaints into the wastepaper

basket.   If  the  Minister  is  going  to   accept

complaints like that in anonymous letters,  then  I

must  say  that he is going to encourage scoundrels

or people who try to have their own back by writing

to him.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>3.23 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he is going to be swamped with such letters if

he gives this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>



encouragement and takes up such anonymous  letters.

However, I am very glad that the Minister did  give

us  an  assurance that he would not take up  verbal

complaints.  I  feel  that if he  does  not  accept

verbal  complaints, then much less should he accept

complaints  when he does not know where  they  come

from.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the way the Minister and his Parliamentary

Secretary  spoke  about Inspectors  of  Schools,  I

gather  that they have a high opinion of Inspectors

of Schools, and I wholeheartedly agree with them. I

do not think the Member for Tanglin intended to say

that  Inspectors of Schools are not  efficient  and

are  not doing their duty. If the Minister and  his

Parliamentary  Secretary admit that the  Inspectors

are so efficient, I wonder why there is a number of

principals  who have been seconded to the  Ministry

and   who   have  been  working  there,  I   think,

immediately after the P.A.P. came into power. I  am

not  in a position to say exactly when, but  it  is

soon  after the P.A.P. took office. I went  to  the

Department  and met some principals. I  found  that

they  had  been  seconded and were  acting  in  the

capacity  of  Inspectors of Schools.  Although  the

Minister  said  that they would be paid  an  acting

allowance, would they be paid retrospectively  from

the   time  they  were  seconded?  If  not,  I  was

wondering whether it is fair to them, since it  has

been admitted that they are efficient and that they

have done a good job, to penalise them because they

have not been put before the P.S.C., or because the

Government  have  not  decided  to  give  them  the

allowance for their work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the tuckshop, Sir,-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think "tuck-shops" have

been postponed to amendment (18)*.

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Amendment (18) reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 56 be reduced by $100.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Tucked away!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I note with

regret   that   replies  are  often   turned   into

accusations.  Sir,  I never inferred  at  all  that

Inspectors of Schools were wicked fellows. I  never

said that. And I am sorry if that was the belief of

the  Government  side. What I felt was  that  their

primary  role, as stated by the Minister,  was  not

being carried out. And if he assures me now that it

will  be  carried out, I will only be too  glad  to

withdraw this amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on the question of complaints, I was not

against  complaints.  But I am  against  complaints

sent  in  by  anonymous writers, and  action  being

taken on the strength of anonymous letters. Sir,  I

am against that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I think I have to reply to the

Member  for  Mountbatten  first - this  question   of

discretion  on  the  part of individuals,  more  so

principals  of schools. It is not really  difficult

to  draw  a line for some people who accept  powers

and  act  responsibly  and know  when  to  exercise

discretion;  others  just have  to  take  an  order

before   they  move.  My  opinion,  which  I   have

expressed to officials in my Ministry, is that what

I  would  like to see is the spirit,  and  not  the

letter of the law or the circular, to be adopted by

themselves and also principals of schools. I do not

think  it  is possible to draw very neatly  a  line

indicating just what a principal may or may not do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member for Mountbatten proceeded to say

that  during the period of the previous government,

she  was told by a very important official  of  the

Ministry, who is still an important official,  that

certain  things  had to be done as  stated  in  the

circular.  I have already indicated my  views,  and

this particular official, who may have carried  out

the  policy of the last government in that  spirit,

would  not, I think, find it very convenient  under

my  direction at the moment. Sir, should  there  be

any instances of such rigid interpretation, then  I

will not be behind it. She followed on by trying to

give  an  example of an expatriate principal  of  a

school.  I  can  assure the Member for  Mountbatten

that  it  could not have happened under the present

Government, because there is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>



no  expatriate who is a principal of  a  school  in

Singapore  today. So if these are all  frustrations

and  irritations of the past, I am  not  answerable

for  the activities of the last government,  but  I

shall be fully responsible for what has taken place

since June 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She further enquired whether officers who have

been  seconded to the Ministry would be in  receipt

of acting pay from the time of their appointment. I

have  already indicated that it would be  effective

from  1st  January,  1960,  because - this  is  still

1960 - we do not go backwards to 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 56 be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (16) of sub-head 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may we know the respective duties of these

Staff Officers, and who amongst them is responsible

for   drafting  staffing  formulas  for  the  final

approval of the Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, there is in

existence a Commission of Inquiry to look into  the

expenditure  of Government. I think  the  questions

which  the Member for Tanglin has put forward would

have   been  very  suitable  questions   for   that

Commission  of Inquiry. I will, however,  endeavour

to answer to the best of my ability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the name implies, a Staff Officer is one who is

responsible  for the appointment, distribution  and

transfer of the staff. We have, as everybody knows,

something like 11,000 teachers and, say.  2,000  to

3,000  other  staff  - perhaps one  of  the  largest

Ministries in the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the staffing formula, there is actually

really  nothing new about it. This is  the  formula

which existed in the past, except that there was  a

slight  amendment  to  it recently.  This  is,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, one of detail which I am  attempting

to  answer  as  best I can. In the past,  when  the

staffing  quota  was  mentioned,  and  before   the

Ministry of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>



Education  decided  to  emphasise  the   study   of

languages, language teachers were excluded from the

staffing quota. Whereas in the case of the  Chinese

schools,  they were included. So in order to  bring

about integration and a single system of education,

and  in trying to bring about a common formula,  it

would appear that difficulties have arisen. On  the

other  hand,  I wish to say that the circular  that

went  out  was  discussed by the officials  in  the

Ministry,  and  ultimately  came  up  to   me   for

approval.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the staffing

formulas  applied  by the staff officers,  Sir,  as

explained  by the Minister, were agreed  to  inside

the   Ministry   between  the  Minister   and   his

officials. I wonder whether the Minister  is  aware

that   when  this  question  was  taken  up  by   a

professional   body   like   the   Head   Teachers'

Conference,   which  was  made  up  of   heads   of

Government  and  aided  English  schools,  it   was

pointed  out that these formulas were not workable.

At least one of them was riot workable, and because

of continued frustration, we regret to say that the

Head  Teachers' Conference decided to  close  down.

Sir,  I am not sure whether this is the proper time

to  debate  this  matter of staffing  formulas,  or

whether  you would rather wish that I wait until  I

come to the general Head.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I can only say that if it is a

matter  of Government policy, I think we  ought  to

wait  until  we  come  to  amendment  (18)  on  the

Supplementary  Order Paper. If it is  to  pin-point

something  which  is connected  directly  with  the

staff  officers, then, of course, the  hon.  Member

may  carry on. But if it is a matter of policy,  it

is convenient to wait.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, sometimes there

are  borderline cases. So I will try  to  touch  on

those  that are nearer the right side, as it  were.

Sir, in the implementation of policy, of course, if

the  staff  officers  are not  made  aware  of  the

policy, they would naturally take the wrong action.

I wonder whether the staff officers have been fully

briefed and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>



in  detail by the Minister regarding the policy  of

the Ministry so that they will not fall into error,

not  because they are against the Government policy

but because of ignorance of the finer details.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no

question that the officers in my Ministry  are  not

aware of Government policy. It is not possible  for

the  Minister to be interested in the details  when

it  comes  to the execution of policy. The Minister

has  a  monthly meeting, at which about  14  senior

officials  meet - Grade G and above - and we  discuss

problems  that arise from the respective  sections.

They,  in  turn, hold monthly meetings  with  their

staff,  the  minutes of which I regularly  read.  I

think  it  has taken sometime for the  Ministry  to

perform  this  difficult task of reorganisation.  I

am,  in fact, very pleased that in the Ministry the

administration have pulled their weight despite the

volume of work that they have had to cope with, and

the  considerable  changes that have  been  brought

about within the last one and a half years. I think

all  of  us  now are able to sit back a  little  to

consolidate  all  the  reorganisation  and  changes

which have taken place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin mentioned the views of the

Head  Teachers' Conference comprising,  I  presume,

teachers of the English-aided school stream-



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Government and aided.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Government and aided. But he

also  explained that that particular body had since

closed  down.  It  comes to me as a  disappointment

that  they are so easily frustrated that they could

not exist long enough to put forward their views so

that  we  could  resuscitate this  organisation  in

order that they can give the benefit of their views

for the future.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps it would be more convenient

to  deal  with  the whole problem of this  staffing

formula  at  this stage. It is only a  question  of

convenience.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Is that possible, Sir?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If it is convenient, perhaps we can

deal  with this matter of staffing formula. I  have

been  trying  to  save time for  Members  who  come

after.  That is all there is to it. Perhaps  it  is

convenient. Shall we deal with it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, the staffing formulas are

very   vital  in  maintaining  efficiency  in   our

schools, and in the primary schools today  we  find

that  there is a gradual loss of efficiency because

the  staffing  formula  being  implemented  is  not

workable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formula is now as follows. For every ten

classes, there can be only one relief teacher.  Now

if there were twelve classes, 12 x 11/10; and there

is a fraction, the fraction is cancelled, and there

is  still only one relief teacher. Then, of course,

comes the Principal. There is one teacher per class

up to about 14 classes, plus one relief teacher and

the head or the senior assistant. Sir, in the past,

extra  language teachers were regarded  as  outside

the  quota.  But  now extra language  teachers  are

included  as  within the quota. So primary  schools

have  to  organise themselves into one teacher  per

class  in  the  English medium, if teaching  is  in

English,   plus   the  relief  teacher - he   is   an

additional  language  medium teacher - and  then  the

Head.  At  the  moment, if one  teacher  is  absent

because   of  sickness,  then  the  extra  language

teacher, say, in the Chinese medium, if he  or  she

is  in  an English-medium school, has to substitute

for  the  absent  teacher - maybe a teacher  of  the

English language - and he or she must go round  class

by  class, and usually he or she knows only how  to

teach  in  Chinese or in Malay. So that means  that

for  most of the period, there is no lesson because

of  language difficulty. And if one teacher  is  on

maternity   leave,  the  situation   becomes   more

difficult,  and the poor Head must not  only  teach

but  sometimes  he has to combine classes.  Parents

have  complained to the Head, saying  that  certain

classes were not manned. But what could the Head do

when the staffing formula is so tight that when one

teacher  is  absent, things become disorganised?  I

feel strongly that if the efficiency in the primary

schools  has  to be maintained, then  the  staffing

formula must be revised until



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>



it  becomes  workable. I am glad of  the  assurance

given  by  the Minister that he would  welcome  the

resuscitation  of  the  Head Teachers'  Conference,

because he now values opinions expressed by such  a

body.  I  was  against  the  closure  of  the  Head

Teachers'  Conference, but the fact that  they  did

close down shows how frustrated they must have felt

at that time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the application of the staffing

formula - the manning of schools - sometimes the  poor

Staff  Officers get rather confused, maybe  because

of some other directives, and in their hurry to get

teachers  for  Government schools, they  forget  to

implement  the first aim of Government - equality  of

treatment  of all streams of education and  of  all

schools.  I  believe, Sir, that that is a  cardinal

point  in their policy. And I agree wholeheartedly,

because  I  have been fighting for  this  for  many

years. But what do you find, Sir? A young would  be

teacher  applied for a job, and naturally he  would

apply  to  as many schools as possible.  There  are

several  teachers that I know of. But we will  just

take   one  case.  This  teacher  applied  to   the

Government  and to an aided school. The  Government

machinery takes a long time to operate, and by  the

time  the  Government  decided  to  interview  this

particular applicant, she had already been employed

and  was teaching in an aided school for some time.

She  was  told  that unless she resigned  from  the

aided  school and joined a Government  school,  she

would not be given an opportunity in the next batch

to  go in for teacher training. In other words, she

would  be put far behind. Sir, this is not equality

of treatment. Naturally the teacher was in tears. I

could  not  believe it. I spoke  to  the  Permanent

Secretary  and  he  assured me that  it  could  not

happen.   Then  I  was  shown  a  letter  to   this

particular applicant:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`With reference to your letter of [such and such

a  date] and my reply of [of such and such a  date]

to  your  Principal, I am to inform you  that  your

application  is  hereby  cancelled,  as  you   have

declined  the offer of appointment as a teacher  in

training in the English-language medium.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. I am to remind you that this Ministry cannot

guarantee your admission to the Teachers'  Training

College in 1961, and in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>



future  any  correspondence from you pertaining  to

this  appointment  and admission to  the  Teachers'

Training College will not be entertained.'



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, Sir, the poor girl was in tears. I

assured  her  that this could not be  because  this

went against the cardinal point in the policy, i.e.

equal treatment in all streams and for all schools.

How  could there be discrimination against teachers

in aided schools?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, a Ministry official approached

aided-school  heads asking for vacant classrooms so  that

they  could use them for their students. I am  glad

to  say,  Sir, that aided-school principals,  after

consulting their Boards, agreed to help.  But  they

wanted  this point to be clarified. Would  they  be

assisted in getting teachers for the classes? Would

Government  allow teachers from Government  schools

to  be  transferred: specially to man these classes

in  the aided schools? Of course, one official said

it was not in his section, so he could not give any

guarantee.  Sir, we thought it was reasonable,  and

all of us applied. Then we were given an indication

that something had gone wrong. These teachers going

to  an  aided school must resign. Well, it was  all

right. But the important point was - would they  draw

their last drawn salary? Would they continue to  be

on  the  old salary scheme? That, the Staff Officer

said,  he could not say. Sir, if he knew that  this

policy  must  be implemented, surely it  was  quite

easy.  Because when the Government wanted a trained

sportsman,  a star athlete, from one aided  school,

the  poor aided school head would not stand in  the

way   of   that  man's  transfer.  The   man   was,

transferred  on  the same terms  and  on  the  same

salary   scheme.  When  they  wanted   a,   science

specialist,   the  man  was  also  transferred   or

released  on  that  basis.  But  when  it  came  to

Government teachers who wanted to come to the aided

school  system,  the  Staff Officer  had  no  clear

indication.  It  has come to a  stage  where  aided

schools are feeling that this is a one-way traffic.

Teachers   from   aided   to  Government   schools?

"Welcome, you



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>



can  have everything." Teachers from Government  to

aided  schools?  "No  we have certain  Conditions."

Sir,  I  have not yet received any definite  reply.

Before  the  reply comes, I hope the Minister  will

look  into  it  and  ensure  that  there  is  equal

treatment of teachers in the different scales-aided

schools and Government schools. We only want  that,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we come to the staffing of graduate

teachers.  There  is a great shortage  of  graduate

teachers,  we  know that, Sir. Hitherto,  at  least

until  the  new  Government came  into  power,  the

ruling  was  that  Government  bursaries  were  for

students  in all schools - Government and  aided.  It

was  based on this fact - that the children  of  the

people are being educated in Government schools  as

well  as  in aided schools. The people of Singapore

contributed money, through taxes, to the revenue of

the  country.  Therefore, the  bursaries,  although

called   Government  bursaries,  were   meant   for

students  from schools of any category.  When  they

graduated,  the understanding was,  and  they  were

told,  that they could choose to serve their

five-year bond in any school - either Government or aided.

That  was  the understanding, Sir. We assumed  that

the  policy  of  equality  of  treatment  would  be

implemented.  Naturally, Sir, when we expanded  our

secondary  classes, we were quite willing.  We  had

their  applications.  They came  willingly  because

some  of  them wanted to teach in their old schools

and some because of religious connections. This was

what I got from one of the applicants:



<br><br>`Dear Sir,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for your letter of the third instant

with application forms enclosed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I received a reply from the Ministry only three

days ago telling me that I cannot be posted to  ...

(name of an aided school)... as I asked for, as I would be properly posted

to  a Government  school. Needless to  say,  I  am  quite

disappointed as I had hoped to be allowed to choose

the school I would like to teach in.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if there is equality of treatment for all

schools and freedom of choice, surely, this  should

not  be  taking place in the Staff Section  of  the

Ministry.  Perhaps, Sir, they were not quite  aware

of  it,  and  I do hope the Minister will  make  it

clear that aided schools are really trying their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>



best  to co-operate with the Government. Since they

are  short  of  staff in their new  classes,  there

should  be  no difficulty put in their  way.  Their

transfers  could be allowed; or if not allowed,  at

least,  they could be allowed to resign and  rejoin

on  the  old  salary scheme and on the old  salary.

Graduate teachers should be allowed to have  their

choice  and  serve their period of bond  either  in

Government or aided schools. Then, Sir, people will

believe  that there is really equality of treatment

in  all streams of education and in all schools  in

Singapore.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr G. Kandasamy) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>3.50 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in closing, I would say this. That this

principle  was applied wrongly by one  Director  of

Education in colonial days. I am glad to  say  that

it  was in the presence of myself that the Governor

told  that Director of Education that it was  wrong

for  him  to say that Government schools  were  his

schools and aided Chinese and aided English schools

were not his schools. He was told roundly that they

were all his schools and that the students were all

his  children.  There should be  no  partiality.  I

hope,  Sir, this is going to be the policy in  this

country,  and I would welcome from the  Government

side an assurance that this will be carried out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Kandasamy,

Sir,  we know that everytime the Member for Tanglin

says  something,  he says it for his  own  personal

benefit. If it is not for his own personal benefit,

then  his standpoint will be based on one  side  of

the facts only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the teachers' quota, that is, the 1.1

quota,  I  wish  to say that this was  carried  out

under  the  Lim Yew Hock Government. We  have  been

carrying  this out. Why did the Member for  Tanglin

not say this? We know that this 1.1 system has been

adopted  for  a long time. We did not  include  the

second language teachers in schools only after  the

1.1   system  was  adopted.  The  so-called  second

language  teacher was not included in this  quota'.

But  the  Chinese schools did not do this. Why  did

the old Government not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>



reform  this?  Since  the Member  for  Tanglin  was

speaking  for the English schools, why did  he  not

point out this difference? We know that the Chinese

schools  have  been  carrying on  as  they  are  at

present  because  of  the  Government's  policy  in

giving  preference and privileges  to  the  English

schools.  They  did  not  include  second  language

teachers  in  their `teachers' quota,  whereas  the

Chinese  schools did include language  teachers  in

their quota. Why did he not point this out? When we

want  to  carry  out  equal treatment  for  English

schools  and  Chinese schools, we  do  not  include

second  language  teachers  in  the  quota.  It  is

because  it  affects the Member's personal  benefit

that he raised this point. Now mentioning-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr G. Kandasamy):</b> Order. I think it

is  out  of order to make reference to, a  Member's

personal  benefit.  Will the Member  withdraw  that

remark?



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Kandasamy,   Sir,  if  you   deem   this   to   be

undesirable, then I will withdraw.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the hon. Member please

withdraw?



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I will now

withdraw my remark. Talking about teachers in aided

schools  joining Government schools, it is  because

of  the  good  conditions of service in  Government

schools  that they voluntarily join the  Government

schools.  In  the  aided school regulations,  if  a

teacher  has  given his notice a month earlier,  he

can  resign  from the school. I can point  out  one

instance  where  one  teacher voluntarily  resigned

from  an  aided  school  and  joined  a  Government

school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about bursaries, we know that if a

student  receives  money from  the  Government  for

further  studies, he must serve the Government  for

five  years  after finishing his studies.  This  is

right  and  proper. To serve the Government  is  to

serve the people. If he serves the Government, that

means he serves the people. This is right.

<br><br>3.55 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I can now understand some of the

problems  that the Ministry of Education  is  faced

with.  One  of  its  problems is the  Parliamentary

Secretary   who   does  not  seem   to   understand

educational matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary

seems  to  be  very offended with  the  Member  for

Tanglin, because all his efforts were on behalf  of

the English schools and he had done nothing for the

Chinese  schools.  The Parliamentary  Secretary  is

very angry. Might I ask the Parliamentary Secretary

what he had done for the Tamil schools or the Malay

schools?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I should like, Mr Speaker,

first to disabuse the mind of the Member for Farrer

Park  that my Parliamentary Secretary is a problem.

He is one of my greatest assets.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> That is what you think!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> What my Parliamentary Secretary

said  about  the Member for Tanglin was  this - that,

unfortunately,  everytime the  Member  for  Tanglin

says  a  thing, it is only from the English stream,

and it is only one half of the educational-



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> So what?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> -problems of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> So what?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> So what? It is that the

formula which was acceptable for the Chinese stream

is not acceptable to the English stream-



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Of course!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Simply that. Therefore, if it

could be applied to one section, why keep on saying

that  it  cannot be applied to another?  It  is  in

order to arrive at a satisfactory solution that  we

have to put our heads together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the staffing formula, as I have said,

Mr  Speaker,  it is a very professional  question.

However, we have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>



since  decided that for next year, if  there  is  a

fraction of .6, then the school will be entitled to

one  additional teacher. They could not really have

.6 of a teacher for a particular school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry for the case mentioned by the Member

for Tanglin, about the poor girl teacher who cried.

Why  could  that not have been put  to  me  in  my

official capacity? I would like to take the  matter

up  if  he  would be good enough to  let  me  have

particulars of the case. Speaking off-hand, I think

it  is  most harsh indeed for the official to write

in   that  manner,  and  it  will  not  receive  my

blessing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question was in respect of the movement

of   teachers  from  aided  schools  to  Government

schools. I think, in this respect, it is again from

the  English  stream  where the  majority  of  the

teachers  are in Government schools. I  think  they

always feel that if there are any promotions or any

movement, they would like to restrict it  to  those

within the service. I personally feel that I  would

prefer  everything to be thrown  wide  open.  There

should  be  fair competition. Why  I  say  this  is

because I have to think of the Chinese stream where

the  majority  of  the teachers are  in  the  aided

schools,  and if we want to get the best  material,

then  we must open the gates wide to get the cream

from the Chinese aided schools. So our reasons  are

different.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, in the award of bursaries to students to

universities,  if  the  Member  for   Tanglin   has

followed  closely  the  statement  issued  by   the

Ministry,  we  do say that we bind bursary  holders

for  Government  or  quasi-Government  service.  So

there  is  no  distinction really. We feel  that  a

graduate  in receipt of public funds to enable  him

to  complete  his  studies should  be  prepared  to

render  service to the State, be it in a Government

Ministry or in a Government aided school. There  is

therefore  no  question  of reserving  all  bursary

holders for service in Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to

express  my  thanks to the Minister for  giving  an

assurance  that he is going to attend to  the  case

that  I  have  just brought up. In fact,  there  is

another case - the case of a trainee teacher who  was

told  that  he would not be allowed any facilities.

The  Minister  has  also given his  assurance  that

Government bursary holders would have the option of

service in either Government or aided schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary unfortunately - I

notice it every time I speak - takes the line that  I

represent only the English schools. Sir, my  record

of    service    during   the   British    Military

Administration period can testify that when  I  was

responsible, I was fair to all the schools  of  all

streams.  An  attempt was made  by  my  subordinate

officers to confine the issue of chocolate  rations

to  only  Government schools, but I  insisted  that

they  should be distributed to all schools - English,

Chinese  and Malay media. I believe there was  only

one  Tamil school, and I am sure that it  also  got

the  rations. So it is wrong to say that I  do  not

speak for the Chinese schools. When I spoke on  the

staffing formula, it applied to all schools. It  is

wrong  for the Parliamentary Secretary to say  that

the  Chinese  schools are quite satisfied,  for  in

today's  Free Press appears this heading,  "Chinese

primary school hours should be cut, Minister told".

The report reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The request was made in a memorandum submitted

by   the   conference  [Singapore  Chinese  Schools

Conference which comprises in its membership  heads

and teachers of Chinese schools] ... sought:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional teachers for large schools;'.



<br><br>"Additional teachers". This shows that the  formula

is not satisfactory:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Transport allowances for teachers living far

from their schools.'



<br><br>In  fact, Sir, what they are asking for is that the

formula  is  such  that the  load  falling  on  the

individual  teacher  in  the  Chinese  schools   is

heavier, than he should really bear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another thing is that blame was put on the

Lim Yew Hock Government. Let us compare the formula

of the Lim Yew Hock Government with the formula



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>



that  is  implemented now. The then primary  school

formula  stated that a student teacher was regarded

as  being half a point. That is to say, two student

teachers  were equal to one qualified  teacher,  so

that for 11 trained teachers in those days we could

have 22 student teachers for ten classes. But today

the student teacher is regarded as being equivalent

to  the  trained teacher. How can we then say  that

the  Lim Yew Hock Government formula was the  same?

In  those days, the additional language teacher was

outside the formula. Now, it is inside the formula,

I  should  say that the staffing formula under  the

Lim Yew Hock Government was more generous.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> We come back again to the

question  of  outlook:  this  question  of  student

teachers again - in the past during the Lim Yew  Hock

Government,  a Chinese stream trainee  teacher  was

one  unit;  English stream, half a unit.  Again  in

order to bring about a single integrated system  of

education,  difficulties  arise.  These  are   the

problems which the Ministry of Education faces. All

I  can say is this. Let us try to approach it  with

an  element of goodwill and understanding - a  little

of give and take. If in the past the English stream

had been fortunate in that the formulae had been to

their  advantage, and in trying to  bring  about  a

single system they have to strain a little bit, now

we   do   not   ask  that  they  should   sacrifice

themselves,  but  we  are  trying  to  bring  about

something which will be the same for all  the  four

streams.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I quite

appreciate  the  fact that the Minister  is  facing

difficulties  in  trying to bring  about  a  single

system.  I  am  glad to hear that the  Minister  is

prepared  to disabuse any abuse that is brought  to

his  notice about his department, but I  am  really

surprised  that  the arguments put forward  by  the

Member  for  Tanglin, which were  on  a  matter  of

policy  and  principle, should  be  termed  by  the

Parliamentary Secretary as "personal  benefits".  I

would  like  to add two points to what has  already

been said by the Member for Tanglin.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In primary schools, as the children in Primary I

to  Primary  II are very small, it is the  sensible

inclination of the principals to make the  sessions

not more than 30 minutes. Then from Primary III, IV

and  upwards, it is the inclination to make  it  40

minutes.  And as it goes up, 45 minutes. Therefore,

the  timetables of the three different sections  of

the  school do not coincide with one another.  They

do  not start and finish at the same time. So  when

the language teacher has to go from class to class,

there  is usually a space of 15 minutes in  between

that  is void. That is one difficulty where a class

goes  without  a teacher during the 15  minutes  in

between the sessions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing is this. A class that is put under

the  charge  of a vernacular language  teacher  has

anything  from  9,  10 to 16 teachers  taking  that

class,  because while the vernacular  teacher  goes

round   to   the  different  classes   taking   the

vernacular   language,  the  teachers  from   those

classes have to come round to teach that class.  So

if  a  school  has  16 classes and this  vernacular

language teacher goes round to those 16 classes and

the  16 teachers come round to that class to teach,

you  can  imagine  the plight of  that  class.  The

children  are at a loss as to who is their teacher,

and if the teaching is not correlated, they are  at

sea  as to what they are learning and what they are

not learning.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I hate to enter into a debate where

experts  are taking part in it. But looking  at  it

from outside, perhaps the problem as it strikes  an

outsider might interest the Minister for Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been talking about staffing

formulae.  It  would  appear that  in  the  English

stream  the  staffing formula is not - at least  this

side  of  the House thinks - conducive to  efficiency

and  good  teaching,  and therefore  we  might  not

produce the men we think we should produce. If  the

Chinese  stream  thinks that its  staffing  formula

should be different, it should be different.  Maybe

their  teaching problems are entirely different  to

the English teaching problems. So the Minister said

that his problem



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>



is  to  apply one formula to all the four  streams.

Sir,  could  I  suggest  to him  that  perhaps  the

problems  in  each stream are such  that  different

formulae should be applied?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the

discussion  on the staffing formulae, I  think  the

case of the school children has been lost sight of.

It  has happened in many schools and in many

class-rooms.  It has happened to my own daughter. Because

of  the  shortage of teachers as a  result  of  the

formulae   that  are  being  implemented   by   the

Education Department now, children are asked to  go

home  and  stay  away for two or three  days  as  a

teacher  is  sick. When I asked my daughter,  "What

has  gone  wrong?", she said, "There is no teacher.

So  it is better for us not to go to the school. We

can stay at home and have some fun. Why should  we

go  to  school, daddy?" Let us tackle this  problem

from  the point of view of the school children.  It

has  happened. I am sure it cannot be denied  that,

because  of the absence of a teacher on sick  leave

and  because of a shortage of relief teachers, many

classes in schools have been left without teachers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for  Mountbatten has raised professional  questions

which I think really should be better dealt with by

a conference of teachers and head teachers, and not

by  ex-principals and the Minister  for  Education,

although  ultimately the general  policy  would  be

within my purview.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is great danger in the suggestion put

forward  by  the Member for Farrer  Park  that  the

different streams would require different formulae.

I  think one should think in terms of the long-term

aim,  which  is  a  single  integrated  system   of

education.  There  are initial  difficulties  which

will  take time to solve and, as I have said, there

should   be  some  give  and  take  on  all  sides.

Therefore,   I  feel  that  in, implementing   any

formulae in the scheme of things we should  attempt

gradually to bring them together rather than permit

different  formulae to apply, because a start  must

be  made  at  some time. It is expected that  there

will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>



be  difficulties at the beginning, but they  an  be

overcome and we hope that, with good grace from all

sides, we will be able to achieve our end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill said certain classes

have  had to be dismissed. Well, it happens in  any

school  anywhere. It is an isolated  instance.  One

swallow does not make a summer.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Surely the Minister should not

brush  it  off  so  conveniently.  There  are  many

classes  in  many  schools  today  which  are  left

unattended  because of the absence of teachers  and

the  shortage of relief teachers. For him  to  say,

"Well,  it has happened elsewhere", I do not  think

this  has happened here before, because there were

enough relief teachers to take over. But now if  a

teacher  is absent and there is no relief  teacher,

the children are deprived of their education.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of

the  assurance  given  by the  Minister  that  they

realise and appreciate the difficulties-

<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> That is the point, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps the hon. Member could just

delay begging leave to withdraw. I understand  that

the  Member for Mountbatten wishes to join  in  the

fray.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, the Minister said just

now  that  I  raised  questions of  a  professional

nature.  That is the advantage of having  a  person

with professional experience, and I am using it  to

show  him that the 1.1 formula is not satisfactory.

I  am  appealing to him to change that  formula  so

that  the  school children do not have  to  suffer.

According   to   the  Member  for  Cairnhill,   the

principals  have even had to go to  the  extent  of

dismissing their schools because of the shortage of

teachers.  I  was  only  trying  to  prove  to  the

Minister  how  the  shortage is brought  about.  In

addition, I mentioned the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>



daily  difficulties experienced in schools. I  hope

he  will  take heed of what he called "professional

experience"  and  try  to  formulate   a   staffing

situation   that   will   not   meet   with   those

difficulties.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Minister wish to answer

that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, I hope I have not given

an impression to the Member for Mountbatten that  I

accept her professional advice. All I said is these

are   professional  intricacies  which  should   be

thrashed  out by my officials, because, after  all,

they  provide  professional  advice  and  I  either

accept or reject or amend it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want, however, to explain away what the Member

for  Cairnhill attempted to put in - as if things are

chaotic  in  schools because certain  classes  have

been  dismissed.  We have to look on  Education  in

general, not on one or two classrooms or one or two

schools.  Never have there been so many pupils  who

have  been  given the opportunity to be  placed  in

schools. Thousands are in Post Primary Classes, and

there   is  a  fantastic  increase  in  places   in

secondary  schools.  That  with  the  teacher/pupil

ratio  of 1 to 33 or 1 to 34. If one were to listen

to the Members from the Opposition, one would think

that  there  were  no schools and  there  were  no

buildings at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am always

because  we  want  to  see to the  welfare  of  our

students and schools, for the good of this country,

I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is convenient. Mr Thio.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, in the Estimates there

are  three  posts that are regarded  as  superscale

posts - principal,  Raffles Institution,  $1,520  per

month;  principal of Victoria School, same  salary,

and  principal  of  Raffles  Girls'  School,  at  a

slightly  lower  salary. Sir, these are  superscale

posts   and  they  are  all  pensionable   in   the

Government school system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been asked by people from the Chinese

medium schools as to why there are no such posts in

the   aided   school  system.  In  view   of   the

declaration  that  there  should  be  equality   of

treatment, then, Sir, it is only logical that  they

expect  similar  superscale posts in  the

Chinese-medium  aided  school system and  in  the

English-medium  aided  school system. In the  case  of  the

aided English schools, there are no such superscale

posts.  But what happens is this: if the holder  of

the  principalship  of  a very  big  school  is  an

Honours graduate, then together with the allowance,

his  total  salary  is  the same  as  that  of  the

Principal of Raffles Institution. But if he is  not

an Honours graduate, then he gets less. In the case

of   the   principalship  of  Raffles  Institution,

regardless of whether he is an Honours graduate  or

otherwise, he gets straightaway that full salary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question, Sir, is this: would Government

consider having in the aided school media the  same

sort  of superscale posts in order that there might

be  a  true implementation of the policy  of  equal

treatment in all schools?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Chinese school system, we know that

there  are at least three big schools, maybe  more,

where  the heads should be on this scale.  I  would

not  mention the names, Sir, but we all  know  that

there  are at least three or four big schools which

deserve  to be in the same category as these  three

big English schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, in the case of principals of secondary

schools, there are certain allowances, and they are

all   pensionable.  In  the  case  of  the  Chinese

schools,   the   allowances  are  not  pensionable,

and - this is another thing, Sir - they find that  when

it  comes  to contributing to the Central Provident

Fund,  they  are limited to a maximum of  $25  p.m.

only. Sir, they ask for equality, and I feel it  is

only  right that they should get it in view of  the

declared  policy that there should be  equality  in

all streams.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is, "That the sum to

be  allocated  for  Head 56 be reduced  by  $10  in

respect of item (37) of sub-head 1." The debate may

range  over the next three amendments, items  (38),

(39)  and  (40) -  Principal,  Raffles  Institution;

Principal,  Victoria  School;  Principal,   Raffles

Girls' School; and Principals of Secondary Schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

principle  raised  by  the Member  for  Tanglin  is

purely  one of being in the Government service  and

in  the  aided school. This perennial  question  is

really  difficult to equate. For example, a teacher

or  principal in the Government Service is  subject

to General Orders. He is not permitted to take part

in   political  activities,  like  the  Member  for

Tanglin or any hon. Member of the Assembly; whereas

a  Government  officer would have to  resign  first

before  contesting  the  elections,  in  the  aided

schools  a  particular teacher or  principal  could

hazard an election and, if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>



returned, become a Member of the Assembly.  Another

difference  is  that  a  Government  officer   will

receive a pension after a long period of service in

the  Ministry. But for the aided school teacher  or

principal,  he  contributes to the  Provident  Fund

and,  at the time of retirement, collects the whole

sum  back from the Provident Fund if he reaches the

age  of  55. So, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is  a  little

difficult to try and say that both are equal. It is

difficult to equate two separate things. We try to

bring  about equality as close as possible  in  the

circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three posts mentioned by the Member for

Tanglin - Principal of Raffles Institution, Principal

of Victoria School, and Principal of Raffles Girls'

School - are  known  as Superscale appointments.  For

those   who  have  what  are  known  as   Grade   G

appointments,  the  salary scales  are  $1,520  for

males  and  $1,260 for females. This is actually  a

relic  of the past. We in the Ministry of education

have  not  endeavoured to monkey  around  with  the

salary scales because we could discuss them for  10

or 20 years and there would still be bad blood. But

I  can  say  this:  in the past  the  Principal  of

Raffles  Institution  was a Grade  F  post  with  a

substantive salary of $1,620. I brought  this  down

to  G  level because I do feel that this post  need

not  be  at such a high rung in the service of  the

Ministry.  Principals  of aided  schools  would  be

entitled to responsibility allowances, which  could

be  $420  if it happens to be a five-stream school,

according  to  the  scheme of the  higher  service.

Unfortunately, this question of streams in  schools

is  again  a typical English tradition and  is  not

found  in  the other streams. I would like  to  see

principals' allowances based not on streams but  on

enrolment.  In fact, for 1961 I have  decided  that

schools with an enrolment of more than 2,000  could

appoint  a  Vice-Principal.  This  Vice-  Principal

could  then  be  in receipt of half  the  allowance

applicable to the principal. From memory,  I  think

most of the larger Chinese schools will come within

this scheme, and only a few schools in the, English

stream will benefit from the appointment of

Vice-Principals.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I take it

that  the answer is in the negative. Sir, the Chung

Cheng High School, the Chinese High School and  the

Nanyang Girls' High School would be regarded as the

three  schools  equivalent  to  the  three  schools

mentioned  here  in the Government  school  system.

Sir,  if the policy is one of equality of treatment

as  regards  pay  scales, I see  no  difficulty  in

giving the heads of the three major schools in  the

Chinese  stream the same salaries as the three  big

schools  in  the Government Stream, As regards  the

difficulty  about  the  aided  school  system,  the

difference between the two systems, Sir, is because

of  the history of education in this country. Aided

schools were the ones who pioneered first, although

Sir Stamford Raffles started the first school.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But gradually, Sir, advantages have been given

more  and more to the Government schools, and aided

school  people  are  feeling  sore.  If  the   only

obstacle  to equality of treatment is the privilege

of  participation in politics, I am sure the  aided

school  teachers will say gladly, "We renounce  our

right to participate in politics if"-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> For money!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> We want to be the same. We

have  to  be  fair. At the moment,  the  Government

school   employees  are  already  in   a   superior

position,  with  pension rights and hospitalization

at special rates, so that, materially speaking, the

Government schools would have greater pulling power

when  it comes to recruitment. People know that  if

they  go  to the aided school system, they have  to

sacrifice financially. If Government's answer is in

the  negative, I regret, Sir, that we on this  side

cannot agree nor can we believe that implementation

of equality of treatment is being done here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> It is, rather amusing, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, to find the Member for  Tanglin  now

taking  up  the cudgels for Chinese education.  The

position  is  just  the  opposite  of  the  English

stream. 80 per cent of the English stream



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>



is  in Government service, and 15 to 20 per cent is

aided. And it is a complete reverse for the Chinese

stream, where 80 per cent is aided and 15 to 20 per

cent  Government. As explained, all these top posts

are   in  the  English  stream.  If  and  when  the

Government Chinese stream is also 80 per cent, then

I think it would be the right time to consider such

super-scale appointments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sorry

to  say that the Minister is beginning to think  in

terms  of the pre-war colonial educationists:  that

the  Government system must be in a majority before

we can implement that kind of policy. But I thought

that  he was looking forward to the idea that since

the  children, of the people are the same,  whether

they  are in Government schools or in aided schools

and  in  every stream - Chinese stream, Malay stream,

Tamil stream - the aim is to treat them equally.  Why

then  should  we  wait until the  Government  group

becomes  larger and so on? In that  case  then,  it

would  mean  that  the children in  the  Government

schools  are superior to the children in the  aided

schools.  Surely, Sir, that is not the  assumption,

and  that  the people of Singapore, when  they  pay

their   taxes,  pay  taxes  to  finance  only   the

Government  schools? Surely that is  not  so.  When

people  pay money, it means they pay money  to  the

Government  to  serve  the  people.  I   agree   in

principle with the Minister when he said previously

that  there  will be equality of treatment  of  all

streams of education. I feel, Sir, that it  can  be

done in such a way that the biggest schools - in  the

Chinese  stream or the English aided school stream,

or  the  Government school stream - could be regarded

as  the  plum posts. And, of course, the Government

teachers  will draw their pensions and  have  their

special hospitalization rights, whereas in the case

of  others, they should have the same emoluments as

those  for  their  counterparts in  the  Government

schools.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The principle of equality is

the  basis of our educational policy, Mr  Speaker.

In  the  past, unfortunately, Government had failed

to assume its full responsibility for educating all

the  people  in  the  State. That  is  why  we  are

embarking  on  a building programme of  19  schools

each  year  so that ultimately most of  the  school

children,   in  whatever  stream,   would   be   in

Government schools. It is only a question  of  time

when,   we   think,  this  question  of  superscale

appointments  would  be  made  applicable  to   the

Chinese schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendments stood in the name of Mr

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 56 be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (42) of sub-head

1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the Government has decided that

there  should be no more specialist allowances  for

specialist teachers, but that there should only  be

professional  allowances for certain categories  of

teachers, such as science teachers. When the salary

schemes   for   the  education  service   and   the

administrative  service were drawn  up,  they  were

done in such a way that the educational service was

not  to  be penalised to the point where graduates,

Honours graduates in particular, would not want  to

become  teachers,  because it  was  felt  that  the

education  service deserved to have  good  material

just as much as the administrative service. And  so

a  device was made, with the agreement of the  then

Secretary-General of the Singapore Teachers' Union,

who  was until recently the Political Secretary  in

the Ministry of Education under this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>



Government,  that there should be these  specialist

allowances; so that ultimately an Honours  graduate

going  into the teaching profession would still  be

not    far   behind   his   counterpart   in    the

administrative  service. With the  removal  of  the

specialist allowances, of course, there is no  more

chance  for  an  Honours graduate  going  into  the

education  service  ever coming  near  his  college

mates who took and passed the same examinations and

who  went to the Government administrative service.

The result, Sir, is that schools are now unable  to

get  graduate  teachers of high calibre.  Time  and

again  we have lost them. Some of them are  honest,

and they tell the schools that they will join as  a

stop-gap  measure, but the moment they get  another

job  in  the administrative service, then  we  must

allow  them  to leave. With that kind  of  graduate

staff   in  the  secondary  schools,  it  is   very

difficult   to   maintain  a   high   standard   of

efficiency,  because once in every few months,  the

Honours  graduates leave us and we have to  recruit

stop-gap replacements. I hope the Minister will find

a  way  out  during  this  period  of  shortage  of

graduate  teachers.  I  wonder  whether  he   would

agree - most  certainly he would not,  Sir - if  for  a

special  purpose,  certain schools  which  wish  to

acquire  the  services  of  Honours  graduates  are

willing  to pay extra out of school funds - our  own

funds. Would the Minister agree?



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the secondary school specialist teachers  are

approved  by  the  Public Service Commission.  With

regard   to   these   specialist  teachers,   their

allowances  are  pensionable  allowances  and   are

personal to themselves only. That is why we  cannot

abolish  this  sort of allowances.  Regarding  this

system  of specialist teachers this was stopped  in

May 1958, but we have to start it again. As regards

using  the school funds to pay for these specialist

teachers,  this  is not the correct method  because

the  appointment  of every specialist  teacher  was

approved by the Public Service Commission.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wanted to

shout   "Hurray!"  just  now  when  I   heard   the

Parliamentary  Secretary say  that  the  specialist

allowances



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>



should  not  be  abolished,  that  they  should  be

continued,  because I was wanting that  to  happen.

Without   the   continuation  of   the   specialist

allowances,  we will never be able to get  the  top

graduates.  If  the  Government  is  going  to

re-introduce the specialist allowances, then  I  would

beg leave to withdraw this motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am afraid the Member for

specialist appointments were discontinued since May

1958,  and  we have decided that for new appointees

we  would  not  consider the payment of  specialist

allowances.  That  was made clear,  I  think,  last

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin then talked about the

desirability   of  recruiting  Honours   graduates.

Unfortunately,  our  University  is  not  producing

enough graduates to serve the needs of the country.

That,  unfortunately,  is also  the  cry  in  every

country, not just Singapore. My view is that a pass

degree  graduate is perhaps of more use to schools.

We  do need some Honours graduates to teach in  the

Sixth  Form or for pre-university classes. I should

like  to  see  our  University  produce  more  Pass

graduates  to man our schools. A way out  would  be

perhaps  to  introduce what is  now  known  as  the

Bachelor  for  Education course in  the  University

itself. The University of Sydney has made a  start,

and  I  think British universities which have  been

most  traditional and have avoided the teaching  of

education  as an under-graduate course  are  slowly

coming  round.  So  we are hoping that  discussions

with the University of Malaya authorities will take

place  in  the  near future for the institution  of

such  a course, because our secondary schools would

need  hundreds of graduates each year  to  man  the

classes which we have in mind, because in the  next

few  years,  our greatest need is an  expansion  in

secondary education, where the ideal is to  have  a

graduate to be a teacher in a secondary class.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But like most other countries, even advanced

countries, they are not able to have a graduate for

every class in a secondary school. However, that is

an  ideal which we will strive for, and we hope  we

will  be  able  to  attain it  in  the  foreseeable

future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sorry

the  translation was not quite correct.  I  thought

the  Minister  had  agreed to the  continuation  of

specialist allowances. My own conviction,  Sir,  is

that the question of supply and demand is such that

if  we cannot get our science teachers and graduate

teachers  to  man  our expanded secondary  schools,

then we will have to do something rather, than  let

the thing go sliding down. I wonder if the Minister

has  been informed that at a meeting with heads  of

Government  and aided secondary schools,  when  the

question  of  shortage  of teachers  for  secondary

schools  was  discussed, the  suggestion  was  made

officially that the only way out was to push up the

teacher  with the class. Form III teacher with  the

class  into Form IV, Form IV into Form V, with  the

result that we shall have teachers teaching Form V,

who  themselves have only passed Form V. Sir,  that

is  a deplorable prospect to face. I wonder whether

the  Minister will really think out ways and  means

so that during this intervening period of shortage,

something  could  be  done. We are  losing  science

graduates holding Master of Science degrees because

they  are  dissatisfied. We  are  losing  to  other

branches  of Government service teachers  who  have

gained   experience  in  the  teaching   profession

because of the great disparity in pay. We are  told

by  one teacher that if, it was not for loyalty  to

the  old  school he could have gone over to  Johore

Bahru  to teach and draw $200 more. It seems rather

hard  to appeal to a fellow because of loyalty  to

the  old  school to keep on sticking  to  the  old

school and lose $200 a month. II there can be  some

adjustment  made officially by the Government,  our

secondary  schools could tide over this  period  of

shortage and difficulty.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I failed to give an answer to

the Member for Tanglin when he requested whether it

was possible for the Ministry to permit, I presume,

aided schools to pay the additional salaries out of

their  own  funds. As long as they are  not  public

funds  (I  think  there  are  philanthropists   who

support the aided schools and are prepared to  foot

the  bill), I cannot see any objection. In fact,  I

would    wish   that   there   were    more    such

philanthropists to assist education in general.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid I have not been kept informed about

the  discussions which the Member for  Tanglin  has

mentioned,  about  the  difficulties  of   engaging

graduate  teachers in schools. That is a  perennial

problem. I would be glad if he could send me a copy

of  that memorandum for study. I think we sometimes

make  a mountain out of a molehill when we say that

standards  are going down, and there is a desperate

shortage of graduate teachers in schools, when more

advanced  countries are saying the same thing;  and

we  are a newly developing nation. But this much we

can  say.  Our standards are comparable.  There  is

nothing  to be ashamed about. In fact,  we  can  be

very  proud. The Member for Tanglin is a member  of

the  Education Service himself. Is he proud of  the

service?  Why  should we belittle ourselves?  After

all,  before we had even a college or a university,

those  of  us who had the opportunity for secondary

education  were taught by normal-trained  teachers.

They  did  not  have  more than  just  a  secondary

education. Some of them were probably some  of  the

finest specimens of what teachers should be.  Their

dedication,   their  love  for  the   school,   for

education and for the pupils - I mean, it  is  all  a

question  of the quality of the persons  concerned.

And   I  have  confidence  that  in  Singapore  the

teachers  in  general, despite the additional  work

required for nation-building and other things, will

rise  to  the occasion, as they have. I am  pleased

and  proud  that they are holding up  the  standard

bravely,  and  this, all of us  can  be  proud  of,

because  before long, we ourselves will not  be  on

the  stage,  but  just spectators  looking  at  the

scene.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not

complaining that we are lacking in high  standards.

I  am  proud, Sir, that we have maintained our high

standards.   Our  high  standards  are   not   only

comparable to, but in some cases, they excel  those

of  other  countries. We can now say that our  boys

can  go to some of the best universities abroad and

even  top  the pass list. Sir, but with  all  these

increasing  difficulties,  naturally,  we  have  to

express our worries; that if we go on like this, it

is  going  to  be  difficult to maintain  the  high

standards.   For   instance,  Sir,   the   Minister

emphasises the importance of technical training and

science  training. What is the use  of  having  new

schools, laboratories and technical schools  if  we

cannot  retain our science teachers? We  might  say

that  our organisation is hanging by just a  single

thread.  If  one  teacher  resigns  today,   in   a

particular  section,  we  cannot  run  our  science

studies.  That  is  a  very  precarious  state   of

affairs.  We should have a reserve always in  every

branch. In case the first line goes, then there  is

a second line. But, at the moment, we cannot do it,

Sir, I appreciate the difficulties of the Minister,

because he does not control the finance. It is good

of him to say that aided schools can, if necessary,

pay more to engage or retain their specialists. But

it  would be better if, for the sake of equality of

treatment,  it  could be done  by  the  Government,

because  that  is  the fairest way  of  maintaining

efficiency all round. It is not easy, Sir,  to  get

benefactors  to  donate money nowadays  because  of

various reasons.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> We have taken steps, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, to train more teachers  for  science

teaching.  We  are, as Members  of  the  House  are

aware,   giving  the  majority  of  bursaries   and

scholarships to those who would take up science and

mathematics  in their studies in the  universities.

Likewise,  overseas scholarships for  undergraduate

or    postgraduate   studies.    In    the    past,

unfortunately,  too many of the  best  brains  have

been  attracted to either medicine or the study  of

law. Now we are hoping to divert such tendencies to

the study of science, mathematics and technology.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>



These take time because by the time they do return,

we would be, perhaps, outside this Assembly. But  a

start  has  been  made. We also  propose  to  start

training courses at the Teachers' Training  College

for  teachers to undertake the teaching of  science

in lower secondary classes. The school of education

of the University of Malaya is also considering the

establishment of special courses for teachers. This

is  under  discussion  with the  new  Professor  of

education  who is an extremely active professor  as

compared with professors of education in the  past.

I  think  we are moving along the right  track  and

will show results as a matter of course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 56 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item (45) of sub-head

1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have just one question to ask, and that

is,   whether  the  Minister  is  optimistic  about

getting his University graduates to fill the 64 new

posts?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The answer is yes. I am a very

optimistic  Minister for Education!  The  64  extra

posts  asked  for  in 1961 is  a  matter  based  on

possible supply as opposed to demand. We expect  to

recruit  24 University of Malaya Honours  graduates

with   Diplomas  of  Education,  (they  are  bonded

bursars), 25 University of Malaya Honours graduates

without the Diploma of Education, but they will  do

one   year  part-time  training  at  the  Teachers'

Training College, 10 University of Malaya Pass  and

Honours   graduates   who  are   non-bursars   and,

possibly, five other University graduates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad

for  that assurance and that optimistic outlook.  I

hope  that when aided schools ask for approval  for

appointment to aided schools or for those  who  are

bursary   holders,  the  Minister  will  pass   the

information  down  that there  should  be  approval

given.  In  view of the assurance given, Sir,  that

there will be no real shortage in this case, I  beg

leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>5.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member for Tanglin has not

completed his speech. Mr Thio Chan Bee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could the

Minister  please state what should be  the  minimum

number  of pupils and the minimum number of classes

before a school is entitled to a primary headship?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I

heard it said by the Member for Tanglin that in the

past if the enrolment of a school exceeded 500,  it

was  entitled  to one head teacher, which  means  a

principal. I am afraid those are days of the  past.

If  we are in any way to cope with the rapid growth

of the population, our schools will have to take in

more pupils than they did in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>



the past. For example, in our proposed new schools,

the  enrolment would actually reach something  like

2,000: 1,000 for the morning session and 1,000  for

the afternoon session. And in certain schools which

we  hope  to  build by next year, or by  1962,  for

example,  a ten-storey school in Selegie  Road,  we

will have a total enrolment of close to 3,000,  and

in  Silat Road an enrolment of 4,000. Of course, we

cannot  say  that  this is ideal,  but  because  of

economy we will have to make the best possible  use

of   what   we  have. Under  the  present  Schools,

Regulations, 1957. Regulation 115 does say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Except with the permission of the Director [which

means the Director of Education] given by notice in

writing  to  the  supervisor,  not  more  than  one

thousand two hundred pupils shall be in the charge

of  any  one  principal, and pupils  controlled  by

different  principals shall  not  occupy  the  same

school  building or buildings at one and  the  same

time.'



<br><br>So  I  think  the  formula of  500  pupils  to  one

principal is too generous a formula to be  accepted

in  these  present times. We allow a  principal  to

look  after  a  school. It may be that  in  certain

rural  schools  there  is only  a  morning  session

because there are not enough pupils to fill up  the

afternoon  session. But in city schools there  will

only   be  one  principal  for  both  morning   and

afternoon sessions. If the enrolment of the  school

exceeds  2,000,  we are prepared to  have  a

vice-principal appointed who will be in receipt of

one-half of the allowance applicable to the principal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, no doubt

because  of  economic reasons, the Government  must

economise, but can we economise to the point  where

there is inadequate supervision of the education of

the  young? Sir, professionally speaking, I believe

those who are advising the Minister agree that if a

head has more than 500 pupils in a secondary school

and  about  640 pupils or 16 classes in  a  primary

school,  he is running the risk of not knowing  his

pupils  as  human  beings but  merely  as  so  many

figures on the school roll. However, if the  number

has  to  exceed 500 in the secondary or 640 in  the

primary - and as the Government says if it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>



beyond  1,200  there  must be permission  from  the

Ministry - then it is only right that there should be

another  head with equal responsibility and  almost

equal remuneration



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the arrangement that is being introduced now

is  that  no  matter how large a  school  is  there

should   be  just  one  head  drawing  a   headship

allowance. I agree that there should be one overall

head  in control of a big school, or of a group  of

units  on the same site, in order to preserve unity

and  to  ensure  co-ordination. But  to  insist  on

having  only one head drawing a headship  allowance

when  the  total  enrolment  is  beyond  1,000   is

expecting  too  much  from  a  human  being.   Sir,

hitherto I think no Government school has grown  as

large as some of the aided schools. I believe  that

the  Chung  Cheng High School has an  enrolment  of

something like 4.000.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> 3,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> 3,000. The Chinese High School

has  also  round  about 3,000. Some  of  the  aided

schools  are  almost reaching that figure.  So  the

proposed reorganisation in which the aided  schools

are  co-operating is such that if one man  only  is

given  the  head-ship allowance  and  the  rest  as

senior  assistants  are asked to  do  the  work  of

principals  without even getting  an  extra  dollar

allowance - unless,  of course,  they  are  appointed

vice-principals - I think it is expecting  too  much

from  them to shoulder all the responsibilities  of

the  regular  head.  What I envisage  is  that  the

senior  assistants performing the duties of a  head

of, say, an afternoon session school of about 1,000

or  1,200 pupils will say to the parents coming  in

with  their  problems, "Sorry. I am not  the  head.

Will  you please see the head?" Whether we like  it

or not, although the head is supposed to be on duty

chiefly  in  the morning session, he must  shoulder

all  the  problems  of the afternoon  session,  And

where  there is also an evening session,  the  poor

head  is  in charge of three sessions with  overall

responsibility.  In theory, the  senior  assistants

are supposed to carry out duties almost similar  to

those   of  independent  heads  in  their   various

sessions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>



I  think  that is expecting too much from that  one

head. Sooner or later, he will have a breakdown, or

he will suffer from high-blood pressure, or have  a

stroke.  Sir,  we have already had  such  cases.  I

think  the Minister might know of a few cases where

the  strain  has been so continuous  that,  humanly

speaking, it is expecting too much of one  head  to

be  in  charge of three sessions with  the  aid  of

senior  assistants. My suggestion is that  where  a

senior  assistant does practically the  work  of  a

principal,  he  should  be  given  at  least   some

responsibility   allowance,  not   because   senior

assistants  are mercenary but because  it  is  only

natural - and  I am sure the trade union  experts  on

the Government side would agree in the interest  of

justice - that it they are expected to carry out the

duties  of the head in their single sessions,  they

should  be  given  some remuneration  so  that  the

appointment  of  one teacher as a senior  assistant

can  be  considered as a promotion. The appointment

of  an  officer  as  a  senior assistant  today  is

regarded as a penalty or a sentence whereby  he  is

asked  to  do the work of a principal and,  at  the

same  time,  shoulder  the  responsibilities  of  a

principal, because if anything goes wrong he is  in

trouble.  Yet he is told that he cannot  draw  even

one  cent  more unless he becomes a vice-principal.

So  we  have  the situation in a very large  school

where  we  have  only one overall head  and  senior

assistants, where formerly there were three or four

heads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister will look into this

matter - in  the  interest of  efficiency  consistent

with  economy,  because there  will  be  a  lot  of

saving - with  a  view to giving some  responsibility

allowance to the senior assistants who perform  the

duties of a head.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of

all,  I would like to correct the figures mentioned

by  the  Member for Tanglin. The enrolment for  the

Chung  Cheng High School for last year  was  3,714,

and  for  the Chinese High School it was 2,242.  It

was  not  4,000 for the Chung Cheng High School  as

stated  by  the hon. Member. In fact,  there  is  a

limitation to the enrolment of the Chung Cheng High

School as a result of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>



unfortunate  events in 1957. They are not  supposed

to exceed S2 classes, thus bringing it to something

like  3,600 or 3,700. That is the maximum enrolment

permissible  for the Chung Cheng High School.  Last

year,  this  school was the only school  which  was

permitted  to appoint a vice-principal  because  of

its  considerable enrolment and, as I have  already

explained,  we have already decided that  for  1961

schools  with  an enrolment exceeding 2,000  pupils

will  be  permitted to appoint a vice-principal.  I

think  this will apply to at least a dozen  schools

the majority of which will be Chinese schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel it is one thing to say we have an ideal,

and  another  thing to practise it. I have  already

explained that, for economic reasons, we are unable

to bear the burden of one principal for 500 pupils.

It  is  just as well saying it is ideal to  have  a

private tutor to look after your children.  If  you

can  afford it, well and good. But here we are  not

thinking  in terms of education for the  elite.  We

are  trying to provide education for the mass;  not

just  tens of thousands, but hundreds of thousands,

and never in the history of Singapore are we giving

so  much education to so many people. Because it is

the  responsibility of the State to give  the  best

possible education to as many as possible, so  that

those who are unfortunate from the point of view of

finance  may be able, after education,  to  improve

and better their social and living standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say that senior assistants regard their

appointment as one of penalty is indeed  unfair  on

the   part  of  those  who  have  been  given   the

opportunity to assist the principal in  schools  to

assume  heavier responsibility. And I do not  think

that  every time we talk in terms of giving someone

a  little  more  responsibility, we must  dangle  a

carrot: here is so much money because you are doing

a  little extra. I feel that if we approach it from

this  point  of view, then we are all  a  bunch  of

mercenaries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I do not know what the

Minister for Labour and Law has to say. If a man is

made to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>



occupy  the  post  of  manager  and  he  is   told,

"Officially we won't call you `Manager'." Or he  is

made  foreman and he is told, "Officially  you  are

not  a  foreman,  although you do  the  work  of  a

foreman. And it is wrong for you to ask for  a  bit

more."  Sir, I wonder whether that is not  contrary

to the principle of a workers' government. I am not

asking that the Government should not economise.  I

am   in  favour  of  it  in  view  of  the  present

situation.  But to ask that a senior assistant  act

as,  say, the head of an afternoon session, who has

to  go  to school even during holidays, who has  to

attend  to  extra  duties, who  has  to  listen  to

telephone calls and problems during the night, that

he  should  be paid the same salary as the  regular

teacher  on  the  staff who has  not  got  all  the

responsibilities  under him - if, Sir,  that  is  the

Government's  policy, and if they still  insist  on

that,  I suppose the teacher will have to take  it,

although  I  must  say  we have  to  express  their

disagreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another case, Sir - this is very

peculiar - that in the interests of economy, measures

are  sometimes carried out too far.  There  is  one

instance  where  a  lady  principal  of  a  primary

school,  on  reaching the age of 50, was  asked  to

retire. The obvious reason was that in that way the

Government  would  save  the principal's  allowance

because she was already a principal. Sir, if a lady

principal  is  asked to retire at the  age  of  50,

firstly,  she  cannot  draw  her  provident   fund.

According  to  the provident fund regulations,  she

must  be 55 - I am correct, Sir - before she is allowed

to  withdraw her provident fund. If she is asked to

leave and lose her job just because she happens  to

have been made principal and because of economy the

principal's   allowance  must  be  cut   off   and,

therefore,  at the age of 50 she could be  got  rid

of,   is  that  an  adequate  return  for  faithful

service?  I  am  sure,  Sir, in  the  interests  of

maintaining  the  morale  of  teachers  and  heads,

surely at the age of 50 a lady principal like  that

should  be allowed to continue to at least the  age

of  55  when she could withdraw her provident  fund

contributions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there was another case of a lady teacher who

in some way, because of qualifications, was given a

graduate  allowance but was teaching in  a  primary

school.  She was asked to retire at the age  of  50

because thereby they could use her salary to employ

maybe  two or three young teachers. Surely  at  the

age of 50, a lady teacher should not be retired. If

that  is the case, then the Central Provident  Fund

regulations  must  be revised to  the  point  where

people  who  retire  at  50 should  be  allowed  to

withdraw  their provident fund benefits.  I  wonder

whether-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It appears to me that

perhaps  the  Member for Tanglin is wandering  away

from   the   motion,  which  is  an  amendment   in

connection  with primary school principals.  He  is

now  debating something about provident fund. I  am

afraid  I  was not paying close attention,  but  it

seems  to  be  very far away from the  motion.  Mr

Thio.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, it is indirectly linked

up with a primary school principal who was asked to

Member for Tanglin if he could tell me in detail of

this particular instance of a principal aged 50 who

away.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder

whether  the Minister is not aware that  a  woman's

retiring   age  is  optional  at  45   and   forced

retirement at 50.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I asked for

an answer from the Member for Tanglin.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall be

glad to furnish the Minister with the information.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think it is perhaps wise

not to mention names in this Chamber, especially if

it is not really necessary to advance an argument.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, in view of the assurance

given by the Minister, I shall inform him after the

sitting. I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 56 be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (47) of sub-head

1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the item is described as "Graduates; of

recognised   Universities  and   Special   Teachers

Training  Institutions". Could the Minister  please

say, Sir, what recognised Universities" are?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question

of  recognition of University degrees comes  within

the  province  of  the  Public Service  Commission.

Under  this  item  (47), they  generally  apply  to

teachers  employed  in  the Chinese  stream,  whose

degrees  have  been recogised in the  past  by  the

Public  Service  Commission  and  also  those   who

graduated  from  Nanyang  University  if  they   be

appointed in Government or Government aided schools

after approval by the Public Service Commission. It

was a conditional recognition of Nanyang University

degrees.  This item, too, would include  those  who

qualify from the Teachers' Training College. In the

past  the  Teachers' Training College  offered  two

courses: one, a full-time two-year course, and  the

other  a  three-year part-time course. But as  from

this   year,  all  the  courses  at  the  Teachers'

Training College have been integrated into a single

system.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

graduates  of  American  universities  and   Indian

universities  have  been feeling very  dissatisfied

because  there  has been no definite  ruling.  They

have  been appealing, and appealing, and appealing.

I  think the Minister knows that. I wonder if there

cannot be some kind of an arrangement whereby those

who are already doing work comparable with that  of

graduates of British universities should  be  given

some  sort  of an increment in order to remove  the

feeling of dissatisfaction. I understand. Sir, that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>



some  Science graduates of Indian universities  are

looking  for  jobs in the Federation, although  the

Government schools where they are teaching  are  in

need of them, because of the better prospects being

offered in the Federation. Sir, I am sure we do not

want to keep on losing our good people here if,  by

some  adjustment, the Ministry could help  them  to

stick where they are in Singapore schools.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  question  of  recognition   of

University  degrees is relevant to  more  than  one

Ministry,  and I am therefore rising to  make  some

statement  on the subject. But, first, I must  draw

attention  to the principle proposed by the  Member

for  Tanglin,  and  that  is  that  he  urges  the

Government  to  give  increments  of  salaries   to

teachers   with   the  object  of  removing   their

dissatisfaction.  Sir, this  is  a  very  dangerous

principle to apply.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I am afraid the Minister for

Finance  is  a  bit too late. We  are  now  on  the

subject of graduates of recognised universities.  I

am  afraid the Minister is too late. Shall we  deal

with the subject of graduates?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I was just about to develop

the  theme  and give the real reason why increments

should  be  given. It is not because  a  person  is

dissatisfied and therefore you give him money. That

would  be the bottomless pit, Mr Speaker, Sir, If

we do give increments of salaries, it is because we

acknowledge the qualifications to be adequate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is aware, of course, that many

students  from Singapore have studied  in  American

universities and non-Commonwealth universities, the

qualifications  of  which  are  not  recognised  at

present.  So we have been in consultation with  the

Public Service Commission and have now agreed  upon

a  scheme whereby a Committee of the Public Service

Commission  could be established  to  examine  this

question  of  recognition of foreign  degrees.  The

draft  is  practically in the final  stage,  and  I

think  we shall reach finality on this before  very

long.

<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, first, may I explain? I

was  not  asking for extra remuneration chiefly  to

remove  the dissatisfaction. I said that where  the

graduates we're already doing work comparable  with

that  being  done by British university  graduates,

then they should be considered. However, in view of

the fact that steps are now being actively taken. I

beg leave to withdraw the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 56 be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (58) of sub-head

1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this is a matter which has often been discussed in this Assembly. I, therefore, seek

clarification  from  the  Minister  for  Education,

firstly, with regard to the methods by which  these

religious   teachers  are  appointed  or   engaged.

Another  point  is the manner in which  they  teach

religion  in  schools. I would like  to  have  more

details about this. Do these teachers teach only in

the  Malay  schools or do they teach  in  non-Malay

schools too?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, concerning the recruitment of

these  religious teachers, they were selected  from

candidates     with    the    highest     religious

qualifications  in Singapore, both men  and  women.

With  regard  to  the manner in which  they;  teach

religion in Malay schools, each teacher is asked to

teach  in  several  schools  to  fit  in  with  the

timetable  for  religion provided  by  a  religious

Committee  of  the  Ministry  of  Education.  These

teachers teach only in Malay schools.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, apart

from  the  reply given by the Member, I would  also

like  to know from what standard is religion taught

in  schools.  It seems that in the 1961  Estimates,

there  is  no increase in the vote to increase  the

number of religious teachers, although I know  that

the  number of enrolment of children is increasing.

May   I   get   clarification  from  the   Ministry

concerned?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

religion  in Malay schools is taught from Darjah  I

to  Darjah VI for this year, and this subject  will

be  taught in Malay secondary schools in Kallang in

Forms  2  and 3. The syllabuses for these secondary

schools have already been prepared by the Religious

Education Committee.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, my other

question  has  not been answered. Are there  enough

religious teachers to meet the demands for 1961?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to answer the

Member  for Kampong Kembangan, it will be necessary

to  discuss  the question of religious teaching  in

schools  in  principle. Except for schools  in  the

Malay  medium, we are discouraging the teaching  of

religion  in the other streams. In fact,  religious

teaching  in  mission schools will be  an  optional

subject as from 1961. As a special lee-way, because

certain  pupils prepare religious knowledge  as  an

examination   subject  for  the  Senior   Cambridge

Examination,  it has been agreed with  the  Malayan

Christian  Council that the teaching  of  religious

knowledge   in   the  English  schools   would   be

permissible  for Form 4 and Form 5  if  the  pupils

choose to take it as a subject for the examination.

In  other words, we are trying to discourage, being

a  secular  State,  the  teaching  of  religion  in

schools proper. But noting the special position  of

the  Malays  in  the Constitution,  where  religion

forms  part  of  the  school  curriculum,  we   are

desirous  that  Malays  who  wish  to  study  their

religion would join the religious schools.  If  the

pupils are attending the morning session, then,  of

course, they should attend the afternoon session of

the   religious  schools,  and  vice  versa.  These

schools will receive aid from the Government at the

rate of $10 per annum per pupil.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I do not

wish  to belabour the point which has already  been

explained  by  the Minister for Education.  But  in

addition  to that, there is another point  which  I

see   I  must  explain.  I  must  plead  with   the

Government, particularly the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>



Minister for Education, on this matter, because the

Member  for  Ulu  Pandan said  just  now  that  the

candidates  appointed  as  religious  teachers  are

candidates   who  possess  the  highest   religious

qualifications. But, Mr Speaker, if  we  carefully

consider  the emoluments of the religious teachers,

we see that the remuneration of the overseer in the

Teachers' Training College is much better than that

of   a  religious  teacher,  So  if  they  are   in

possession of the highest qualifications, and their

remuneration  as  a  religious teacher  is  low,  I

consider  that their status is not being given  due

consideration.  I  feel  that  the   Minister   for

Education   should  reconsider  this  matter.   The

maximum of the annual increment is $7.50 a year, if

we  compare  it  with the other provisions  in  the

Estimates. There is no religious college here.  So,

comparatively speaking, the disparity is great. May

I  get  a reply from the Minister for Education  in

regard  to my question? Does the Minister  consider

the  status of the Malay religious teachers low  or

that   the   certificates   are   not   given   due

recognition, and hence, they receive a lower pay?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> As explained previously, Sir,

the question of salary scales has not been altered,

and  so this is a carry-over of what used to be the

effective scale for teachers appointed as  teachers

of  religion in Malay schools. I have been  advised

that  the teachers so appointed are those who  have

completed seven years of primary education in  what

is  known  as sekolah ra'ayat or religious schools,

where  they  teach  partly religious  subjects  and

partly  normal school subjects. So that the  salary

scale  would  appear  to apply  to  those  who  are

appointed with a primary school education. That  is

the  best  course in the circumstances because,  as

the Member for Kampong Kembangan has said, there is

no  higher religious college in Singapore. The only

one  existing is in Klang, where there is a  Muslim

college.   Until   such  time  as  the   Federation

Government has decided on an effective salary scale

for  such  graduates,  we are just  suspending  the

matter for the time being.

<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 56 be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (63) of sub-head

1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, could the Minister please give us some

clarification as to the basis on which the Ministry

decides  on  the  quota of school  servants  to  be

provided  for  each school; whether it  is  on  the

basis  of enrolment or of floor area, because  many

heads do not quite know the basis?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> As the day progresses, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I feel as if the Member for  Tanglin

has  got  the  edge  on the Staff  Section  of  the

Ministry! They work according to a rough formula of

providing  six servants for a secondary school  and

four  servants  for  a primary school.  It  depends

again  on  whether the school has a  large  playing

field which would then require more gardeners,  who

come  under the category of servants. If there  are

three  or four schools grouped together using  just

one  playing-field, then I suppose there will be  a

little  give and take. Three schools - 3 x 4  is  12

servants - I  suppose then they  could  do  with  two

servants less, because all of them are sharing  one

field and things like that. There are instances, of

course, where it is probably cheaper to purchase an

electric  lawn  motor  in  place  of  one  or   two

servants. These are matters of detail where I feel,

if cases of dissatisfaction arise and if they could

be  thrashed out in a spirit of goodwill, then most

problems could be easily resolved.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish that

the same spirit expressed by the Minister now could

prevail in the whole Ministry, because things would

he  much  easier and I am sure solutions  would  be

found  much more easily. I have to refer  to  this,

Sir,  because some time last year, heads of schools

were shocked when they were told that the number of

their school servants was to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>



be reduced, even in the case where a school had new

buildings with a larger floor area. One school  was

asked  to reduce the servants quota by three.  Sir,

after  a  lot  of  time  had  been  wasted  in  the

composition of a detailed memorandum to explain the

situation  of  new buildings, more floor  area  and

large  fields, at last the number reduced  was  one

instead  of three. Sir, I am not speaking  for  the

heads  of  schools. I am speaking for the  servants

this  time.  How  could the servants  appreciate  a

reduction  when  the schools had increased  by  new

buildings  and  they were told that  their  present

staff  must  be reduced by One? So what the  school

had  to  do was to employ an extra servant and  pay

out of private funds. Sir, with this double session

and  in  some  school  cases  triple  session,  the

servants  are complaining that if the Trade  Unions

Ordinance  was applied then they could  really  ask

for  overtime. But because they have been  long  in

the  service of the school and they also  have  the

spirit  of give and take, they would rather not  do

it, Sir, and they naturally ask that they should be

supplied  with additional servants in order  to  do

the  work  better. I know of cases where they  work

from  6.30  a.m. until 7 or even past 7  p.m.  Sir,

because  of that, I am glad that the Minister  has

given  an  assurance that in a spirit of  give  and

take, depending on circumstances, he is prepared to

adjust  the number of school servants allocated  to

schools.  Sir,  in  view of that assurance,  I  beg

leave to withdraw the motion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the hon. Member should not

be in such a hurry to withdraw. Because he has made

such  a  long speech, I am sure the Minister  would

like to answer the points raised. Mr Yong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Here again, Sir, I would

appreciate  it  if  the Member  for  Tanglin  would

mention  the  name  of the school concerned,  where

perhaps an overenthusiastic official said, "Oh, no.

You are overstaffed by three servants," and after a

lot  of  parley, decided, "All right, you may  have

one  back." But the impression I got was  this.  So

much leeway has been given in the past to aided



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>



schools  that  if the formula was applied,  certain

schools  would really have an excess  of  servants.

Anyway,  even if there were an excess of  servants,

it  would not involve retrenchment, because we will

see to it that the supernumerary servants would  be

given  employment in other schools,  and  generally

they get transferred.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin then moved a little ahead

of   time   and  said  that  school  servants   are

complaining  they  cannot get  overtime.  In  fact,

there is an item* later on down for discussion. But

since  the Member for Tanglin has raised it, may  I

just answer in reply?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps, if it is convenient, we

might  as well deal with sub-head 37* at page  470. Is it convenient?



<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The amendment in respect of sub-head 37 reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 56 be reduced by $10 in respect

of sub-head 37.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is convenient. Mr Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> There is such a circular in

November 1957, but unfortunately, it was only  sent

out to Government English schools. As usual, in the

past,  those were the only schools that existed  in

the  Ministry. All other schools did not  exist  at

all.  Aided schools just carried on. They presented

their  cheques  and money was forthcoming.  Anyway,

the hours of work for school servants have been the

same  as in the past. Mondays to Fridays 7 a.m. to 6.45 p.m.; not 6.30 in the morning nor 7 o'clock at night; Saturdays from 7 to 11 a.m., total 44  hours

a  week.  This  circular  will  be  issued  to  all

streams, including aided schools. Then there  is  a

further  circular  issued in February  1959,  about

extra  remuneration for school servants in  respect

of  additional work. Office boys would be  entitled

to  $8 a month and school servants $5 per month for

extra work as a result of afternoon sessions.  This

has  been made applicable to all schools which have

to   do  two  sessions.  Once  again,  whereas   in

Government  schools  they were paid  during  school

sessions,  that is to say, exclusive  of  holidays,

servants in aided schools were paid 12 months in  a

year. This will be put



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>



right  in  1961 - another  case  of  integration  and

making  it the same for all servants in all schools

and all streams.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall be

glad after the sitting to provide the Minister with

information regarding the schools which  feel  that

they  do  not have enough servants. Sir,  regarding

extra  remuneration and working hours, perhaps  the

problem  is  not appreciated unless we are  on  the

scene  with  the school servants. If they  commence

operations  at  7.15 a.m., it  will  be  too  late,

because  some of our students are in the  habit  of

coming  to  school very early. The  doors  must  be

open,  otherwise  the children  will  be  hammering

impatiently at the school doors. Those in charge of

opening  the classroom doors and office doors  have

to  be  on  duty  much  earlier.  If  there  is  an

afternoon  session and a night session, one  cannot

assume that the servants only do the sweeping  once

a  day, because after the morning session, there is

already  one quota of dirt all over the  place.  We

try  to relieve the burden of the servants in  some

schools  by  having  service squads  clean  up  the

classrooms before the pupils go home. This is  just

to  lighten the burden of the servants.  Then  when

the  new  session  comes in in the  afternoon,  you

cannot tell the children to keep things as clean as

adults  could.  After that, there will  be  another

quota  of  dirt. At night there is a third session.

Very  often,  Sir,  we  have visitors  and  parents

coming  round.  Surely we do not  want  the  school

buildings  to  be at any moment in an unpresentable

state.  So, naturally, the servants, after sweeping

off  the dirt of the morning session, will have  to

sweep off the dirt of the afternoon session, and at

night, they have to sweep off the dirt of the night

session also. I do not know how we can stagger  the

work  so  that the servants can just do  their  own

particular quota as if they are working only for  a

one-session school. It is not easy, and we will  be

glad if the Ministry could really supply us with  a

workable scheme. But we, who are in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>



charge  of  schools, realise that with  the  triple

session  coming in, the work will become a hardship

to these servants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, regarding remuneration, I wonder how $8

extra  per  month  for six days a week  plus  extra

labour  not  in single-session schools but  double,

and in some cases triple-session schools, is worked

out. Maybe the servants would rather work it out on

an  overtime basis and calculate it at  rates  that

can  be  approved by the Labour Ministry. I  really

feel, Sir, that $8 per month extra where we have  a

triple-session or a double-session  school  is  not

adequate for the labour and the time involved. Sir,

a  thing like this naturally takes the heart out of

the labourers if they are told that. In the case of

the school of which I am at the moment in charge, I

do not propose even to implement this, because I do

not  think  it  is  fair. The principals  of  aided

schools have been instructed that since December is

a  vacation month, Sir, the extra allowance  of  $5

for  December should not be payable. Naturally  the

servants  reason  that  if fees  for  December  are

collected  and  teachers  are  paid  for  December,

whether  it is a vacation month or not, why  should

they  not have their allowance? Maybe there is some

misunderstanding, but the circular has been issued.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Of course, Sir, there is no

misunderstanding.  I  have  told  the  Member   for

Tanglin  just  now that that is the position.  Many

things  took place in the past where aided  schools

just did as they pleased and presented a cheque.  I

think  it is unfair for those working in Government

schools  to be given poorer terms. If the principle

was  to pay extra remuneration for extra work, then

if  there  was no work because of the  holidays.  I

suppose  it was only fair that during the  holidays

they  should  not receive this extra  emolument.  I

find  it  most amusing indeed that the  Member  for

Tanglin  is  taking such a great  interest  in  all

matters  educational just in the last few weeks  of

his  active service in education. I hope it is  not

that last flicker of the candlelight before be goes

off.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I am sure that the Member for Tanglin

will  flicker  quite a lot in this Assembly.  On  a

point  of  information,  Sir:  could  the  Minister

inform  the  House  whether  servants  working   in

schools do not come within the ambit of the  Labour

Ordinance, and if they do, why is it that they  are

discriminated against?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> It is unfortunate that my

colleague, the Minister for Labour and Law, is  not

around to answer that question. I am sure if I  had

in  any  way  transgressed the law, he  would  have

promptly pulled me up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I do not know what goes on in

schools  at  base  levels,  but  listening  to  the

debate,   it  appears  to  me  that  the   servants

mentioned by the Member for Tanglin come within the

category set out in the Labour Ordinance.  If  they

come   within  such  a  category,  then,   in   the

circumstances delineated by the hon.  Member,  they

must be paid overtime for more than eight hours  of

work  per  day; and overtime means 1�  times  the

rate  per hour, which would be very much more  than

$8 per month. Unless the Labour Ordinance says that

those  working in Government service  are  excluded

from  the  ambit of the Labour Ordinance, then  the

present  situation is possible. But,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  I  am  not  aware  of  the  Labour  Ordinance

excluding  servants working for the Government  who

could otherwise have come within the provisions  of

the  Labour  Ordinance. And even if this  group  of

persons  are  specifically excluded by  the  Labour

Ordinance  on the basis that they are  servants  of

the  Government - I understand that the Minister  for

Labour  and  Law  is bringing up a  new  Bill,  the

Labour  Ordinance -  perhaps  he  might  give   this

category his earnest consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I suppose I will ask my

colleague, the Minister for Labour and Law, to read

the  Hansard to see whether he would like to follow

it up.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, counting

the  number  of hours stipulated, it does  come  to

nine  hours; but I suppose if you deduct the period

of  recess, and so on, it comes within the limit of

the eight hours. Unfortunately, in practice, it  is

not  possible, as the Member for Tanglin is  trying

to  point out. A servant is supposed to start  work

at  7.45 a.m. but he cannot do so at 7.45 a.m.; and

he  is  supposed to finish at 6.30 p.m., but it  is

not  practical as he cannot finish it by 6.30  p.m.

The  principals merely try to follow the Government

regulations to the letter so that they  do  not  go

against the Labour Ordinance, but I feel that it is

in  a way cheating these servants, especially those

servants  who do not have quarters in the  schools.

What  we  have  to do is to keep within  the  eight

hours and say, "All right, you work this number  of

hours  before  school, this number of hours  during

school, and this number of hours after school." And

then  we  work  it  out for each  session  so  that

according  to the timetable on paper, the  servants

work  eight hours a day. But then the servant  does

not  work  only eight hours a day. During the  time

when he is supposed to be free, as he has no living

quarters in the school, he is at the beck and  call

of  the  principal. He has nowhere  to  go  but  to

remain  in school; and should there be any work  to

be  done  for the school, for example, if  a  child

feels sick and messes up the floor, who else but he

will  have  to clean it up? The servant  is  needed

during  the  time  when it is supposed  to  be  his

relief hour. So actually even if you space it  out,

as  the principals are doing now, so that it can be

said  that the servants are working eight  hours  a

day  as  laid down in the Labour Ordinance, I  feel

that  it  is really cheating them, because as  they

are  not  free  to  go home and they  do  not  have

quarters,  they  are not resting during  the  hours

when  they  are  supposed to be resting.  They  are

actually on duty.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I feel, Sir, that the Members

of  the Opposition are very effective in dramatics.

All  this talk about cheating the poor servant.  We

think that all this talk and statements



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>



mean nothing. We are judged on what we perform  and

what  we do ultimately for the State. I think  that

is the acid test.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

sub-head  32  reads "Free Text Books". I would like  to

know  from  the  Minister  for  Education  why  the

provision  for 1961 in respect of free  text  books

has  not been increased. The provision for 1960  is

$50,000. To the best of my knowledge, the number of

students and unemployed persons receiving free text

books  is  increasing. Therefore, the provision  of

$50,000 should be increased for next year to enable

more  students to receive free text books from  the

Ministry  of Education. It may be that the Minister

feels  that  there  is  no  need  to  increase  the

provision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 56 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 32.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Leong Keng Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): As

regards free text books, I am afraid the Opposition

Members  are  under a misapprehension.  These  text

books are loaned free of charge to the students for

their  use.  When they finish their  courses,  they

have  to return them to the schools concerned. This

system of free text books on loan depends upon  the

number of students. For instance, a family with  an

income of less than $150 a month, or a family  with

two  or three children with an income of less  than

$200, can borrow the text books free of charge. For

the   sake   of  promoting  Malay  education,   the

Government has extended this system to the  Malays.

The  amount spent on them in this respect is double

that spent on other schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to why the sum allotted for 1961 has not been

increased,  I  would like to point out  that  these

books  are  on loan. After using them, these  books

have to be returned to the schools so that they can

be  loaned out to other students again. That is why

the sum allotted has not been increased.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

only understand that the word "free" means free. In

this   case,  "free",  means  "loan".  It  is  very

strange.  So  I think it is not worth while  to  go

into  a lengthy debate on this subject if it  could

be  explained that free text books are  books  that

are  loaned out. If they are loaned out,  it  means

that  the $50,000 worth of books are still on hand.

It  may then mean that there is no need to increase

the  provision. I feel that this clarification from

the Parliamentary Secretary is not satisfactory.  I

am  of  the  opinion  that the provision  for  1961

should  be further increased, because although  the

books  are  on  loan, the number of  students  will

increase  next  year. It is only  proper  that  the

Ministry  of  Education should consider  increasing

this provision.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a

welcome  change to hear from the hon.  Member  that

this  vote should be increased. So there should  be

no  difficulty if this vote is increased in  future

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I should explain that I did query this

sub-head,  whether the sum voted in  the  Estimates

would  be adequate, and I was very much cheered  to

hear  from my officials that the 1960 vote has  not

been exhausted. They think that the present vote of

$50,000 is sufficient. In other words, there should

be  no  increase in the vote. This sum is only  for

secondary  schools. There is a  separate  vote  for

primary  schools. In their opinion, the  sum  voted

should be adequate, but in the unfortunate event of

it  becoming in-adequate, then it will be up to the

Ministry to apply for a virement from the Treasury,

and  I am sure that out of the $68 million we  will

be  able  to  find some money available from  other

votes  to  supplement the vote for this  free  text

book loan scheme.

Singapore and the Federation of Malaya are paid  by

given as an addition apart from those given by  the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the students at the

bursaries for the Malay students. In 1960 bursaries

for  Malay students at the Polytechnic are paid  by

however, Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a Malay student

who  receives a bursary after he has competed  with

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is the

policy  of the Singapore Government to give special

assistance  to  Malays in the field  of  education.

That is why this year we announced a scheme to give

free  education for Malays up to University  level.

There  are  special  Malay bursaries  in  secondary

schools.  In  the  year  1960,  88  such  bursaries

amounting   to   $18,000  and  island  scholarships

totalling  $8,400. And as explained by  the  Member

for  Ulu  Pandan,  all the Malay  students  in  the

University  of Malaya are in receipt of  bursaries.

Some  are in respect of fees, and others additional

bursaries  for  expenses.  One  Malay  received   a

bursary  in the Polytechnic in general competition.

We  hope to make special arrangements for Malays in

1961. This is a matter which I will have to take up

both  with  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  who   is

Chairman of the Polytechnic, and my colleague,  the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the aided English schools have their own

provident  funds,  and  the teachers  employed  are

allowed  to contribute. Formerly it was 5 per  cent

at  the  non-graduate scale.  Now  those  who  have

served   for   a  longer  period  are  allowed   to

contribute at a higher percentage than 5 per  cent.

Even  then,  when  they  retire,  their  retirement

benefits  are far below those of their counterparts

in  the  Government service. Sir, the teachers  and

principals   in  the  aided  Chinese  schools   are

wondering  whether  Government  would  allow  them,

perhaps encourage them, to organise themselves,  so

that they could have their own aided Chinese school

provident  fund  whereby they will  be  allowed  to

contribute  more  than what is  allowed  under  the

Central  Provident Fund. The maximum allowed  under

the  Central Provident Fund is 5 per cent up  to  a

point  where a contributor can only contribute  $25

and not more. Sir, if a teacher in an aided Chinese

school  has served for 20 years and is only allowed

to  contribute  $25 a month, then by  the  time  he

retires  he  would have very inadequate  retirement

benefits.  I wonder, Sir, whether the Minister  can

say  that Government will be prepared to assist the

aided  Chinese schools to have their own  provident

fund schemes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could the

of  private  provident funds? That,  I  would  have

thought,  would be an arrangement between  employer

and  employee.  May I know whether he  is  thinking

that  Government  should put in a contribution?  If

that is not the way, then may I know what practical

measures he has to suggest?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is in

line  with  the  Government policy of  equality  of

treatment  of  all schools. Sir, the aided  English

schools were, in fact, encouraged in those days  by

the colonial government to have their own provident

fund  schemes  whereby  the Government  contributed

dollar  for  dollar or whatever  the  aided  school

teachers contributed on the basis of certain rates.

In  the beginning, Sir, I believe it was 5 per cent

of  basic; then it was changed to 7 per cent.  When

the teachers had served for long periods- it is,  I

think,  about  18  or  20 years-by  the  time  they

started this improved scheme, the rate went  up  to

as  high as 15 per cent, and Government contributed

10  per cent of the employees' basic pay. Sir,  the

Government regarded this as donations to the  aided

English  schools' provident fund.  Now,  the  aided

Chinese schools, of course, not being grouped under

organisations,  are contributing only  as  ordinary

units  to  the Central Provident Fund.  I  am  just

wondering,  Sir, whether they cannot be  given  the

same   equality  of  treatment  as  aided   English

schools, so that they need not feel that there  has

been discrimination.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is

indeed news. I was never aware that there was  such

a   thing   as  the  previous  colonial  government

assisting the English aided school teachers in  the

starting  of  a  provident  fund  scheme.  I  would

appreciate  it  if  the Member  for  Tanglin  could

submit that for consideration and study.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall be

glad  to  ask  the  proper  authorities  to  submit

details to the Minister in due course.

<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just now

when  the  Member for Tanglin referred to  a  woman

principal who had been asked to retire at  the  age

of  50, the Minister asked for the specific name of

the  woman  principal. It gives me  the  impression

that  asking the woman to retire at the age  of  50

years  was  not  the  correct  thing  to  do.   But

according to the Pensions Ordinance, which  I  have

read,  the  retiring age for a woman is five  years

below  that of a man. Since the retiring age  of  a

man  is 50 years with an option of retiring at  the

age of 55 years, I take it that the women would  be

retiring  at  the  age of 45 years  and  compulsory

retirement at 50 years. Before I go to the  Central

Provident Fund question, could I have clarification

of  that, because it all depends on when the  woman

is asked to, retire?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is that relevant?



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Yes. If the woman is asked

to  retire  at 50, then the situation is  different

with  the  Central Provident Fund. But  if  she  is

asked  to  retire at 55, then my argument will  not

hold any water.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The position is as the hon.

Member  has  said. But the point was raised  by  my

colleague.  It was not merely because  of  the  age

factor but because there was the statement made  by

the  Member  for  Tanglin  that  she  lost  certain

provident fund benefits as a result of retiring  at

that  age. And I think that, because of this, there

might  have been special circumstances that  needed

looking into.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I take it

that  the compulsory age for retirement for a woman

is  50 years. Therefore, I would like to point this

out,   especially  with  regard  to  women   school

teachers.  They have to contribute to  the  Central

Provident Fund. Nevertheless, there is provision in

the  Ordinance that a school teacher who has served

15   years - including  principals - and  has   reached

retiring   age,  which  is  either  45   years   or

compulsory



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>



retirement  at  50  years, is  entitled  to

three-quarters of what she would have got if she were not

married.  The  difficult situation arises - in  fact,

double difficulty for the woman-in this way. At  45

years  of age a woman teacher retires. She has  all

the  time  been  contributing towards  the  Central

Provident  Fund.  When  she retires,  she  opts  to

accept  the  three-quarters pension  plus  whatever

gratuities it carries - three-quarters of  the  usual

gratuity. Now whatever she has contributed  towards

the  provident  fund she is not  able  to  draw  on

retirement. The Central Provident Fund is  supposed

to  be  a  sum to help the worker when  he  or  she

retires. When she retires, she is not able to  draw

that  amount. The double difficulty is  this.  From

her  gratuity is deducted the amount the Government

has paid into the Provident Fund because there is a

rule  in a Government Ordinance that when they  pay

out  any  gratuity or any pension, or any money  at

all  to  their employees, on retirement, they  take

out everything that is due to the Government before

the  sum is given to the pensioner. Therefore,  the

woman  has to pay not only her share of the Central

Provident  Fund - and not being able to  withdraw  it

for  another ten years, because she is not able  to

withdraw it until she has reached 55 years - but she

has  also to pay for the Government's share on  her

retirement.  So that if she has put in $5;000,  she

has  to  pay Government's share of $5,000 and  that

money  will  be in the Central Provident  Fund  for

another ten years until she reaches the age  of  55

years. So I feel that that is very unfair on women.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am just wondering whether the

Minister  is  prepared to answer. The  Minister  is

prepared. Dr Goh.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> As the law stands, Mr

Speaker, Sir, this would be the position:  that  in

the  case  of  withdrawal from the provident  fund,

that  was  the  age  limit. Obviously  the  Central

Provident  Fund  has to take safeguards.  The  fact

that  a woman retires at the age of 45 or 50  years

does not mean that she will not be able to find



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>



work  elsewhere.  Now this is one  of  the  curious

anomalies  which have arisen in the past  and  over

which  we cannot be held responsible. I have always

held  the view that women should retire at a  later

age than men. If a man retires at the age of 55,  a

woman should go on working to the age of 60. It  is

a  biological  fact that women outlive  men  by  a

considerable number of years. Be that  as  it  may,

Mr  Speaker,  it does seem to me that  this  is  a

matter  that needs looking into. It is not  such  a

desperately urgent matter, but I would say that the

time  has  come to have some second thoughts  about

this whole business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to get ourselves involved in

this highly controversial issue of the fear of  the

University  of  Malaya  people  that  because   the

Government pays the piper, it is going to call  the

tune. I believe it has been accepted now in view of

the  Prime Minister's statement that the University

of Malaya will be an autonomous organisation-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> It has always been.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Well, it has always been, and

will   always  be.  I  simply  want  to  ask  for

confirmation in this House that that is going to be

the  policy of Government in future; and I  express

the  hope,  Sir, that that will be  the  policy  of

Government also towards Nanyang University,  so  as

to   remove   their  fears,  because  equality   of

treatment naturally must hold good here as  on  the

secondary school level or the primary school level.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Surely, Sir, if the Prime

Minister  has already made a public statement  that

the  autonomy of the University of Malaya has never

been  questioned,  and again in this  Assembly  the

hon.  Member for Farrer Park himself also was happy

to  accept  the statement of the Prime Minister  as

adequate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>



assurance,  it  does not require the  Minister  for

Education  to  give  a further  reassurance  of  an

assurance  made  by  the  Prime  Minister.  If  the

question  of autonomy does not arise, the  question

of  assurance also does not come into the  picture,

and  that  should apply to a university  if  it  is

properly run and organised.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The Hon. the Minister for Finance in

his Budget speech said that the Government proposed

to  give $1 million more next year than this  year.

But  I  see  under the Remarks column  that  it  is

subject  to  Treasury sanction. What  exactly  does

that  mean?  Does that mean that the $1 million  is

subject to Treasury sanction, or is the whole  vote

subject to Treasury sanction?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The explanation is simply

this,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir.  The  financing  of  the

University    of    Malaya    for     the     years

1959/1960/1961-triennium - was  decided  by  a  Joint

Finance Committee composed of representatives  from

the University of Malaya and the two Governments of

the  Federation  of Malaya and Singapore.  In  that

report, the annual expenditure for the three  years

was  compiled and subsequently accepted by the  two

Governments at 90 per cent of the sums recommended.

For  the  years  1959  to 1960,  both  Governments,

therefore, gave to the University of Malaya 90  per

cent  of the figures stated in the report. But this

year,  there has been a request on the part of  the

University of Malaya to the effect that  since  the

present  enrolment in the University  has  exceeded

the  figures stated in the report, they would  like

the two Governments to release the 10 per cent.  In

other  words, a full contribution to the University

as  envisaged by the Joint Finance Committee.  That

being   so.  Government  representatives   on   the

University   have  agreed  to  this,   subject   to

satisfactory  answers  to  be  obtained  from   the

Universities  during the year whether  the  10  per

cent  should or should not be released.  Therefore,

for  the  sake of the Estimates, the full  sum  has

been entered. I might mention that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>



the  sum  involved for the Singapore Government  is

$3,966,670.  Then  there are two  additional  sums;

$74,700  being expenses for the Central Secretariat

of  the  University which has a separate  estimate,

plus  a  further sum of $20,000 being the Singapore

Government's  share  in the pre-university  courses

that  are  being  instituted in the  University  of

Malaya  (Singapore Division) at the request of  the

Singapore  Government to provide a one-year  course

for   graduates  from  the  non-English   secondary

streams  of education in Singapore, making a  total

of $4,061,370 as shown in the vote on sub-head 59.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a great deal of light has been thrown on

many problems in the field of education as a result

of  this debate. I am glad also that there  is  now

promise  of  a new spirit of give and take  and  of

goodwill-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I am just wondering whether

we  could touch on topics raised in their order.  I

think  the hon. Member will remember that I stopped

him  from dealing with tuckshops, and then he moved

another  amendment.  Perhaps  he  could  go  on  to

tuckshops,  unless he wishes to carry on  with  his

exordium.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was

leading on to that. Sir, the circular on management

of  school tuckshops is made up of 16 pages in  the

first circular and four pages in the second, making

a  total  of 20, so I was not inaccurate. Sir,  the

language, unless I am ignorant of the language,  is

authoritative. So, if the Minister says that heads



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>



of  schools can have the discretion in spite of the

language of authority to interpret generously, Sir,

I am not sure whether his own officials would agree

to  that.  Because I have been taught that  when  a

superior officer says, "Please call", it is  really

a command, Sir. The circular is in language worded

like this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The following regulations governing the

management  of  tuckshops in all  Government  aided

schools shall become effective from 1st of January,

1961:-



<br><br>Sir, "shall" is a command. Section 1 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`School Tuckshop Committees: Every Government and

aided school which has a tuckshop shall set up a

school tuckshop committee comprising the following:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principal of a school, Chairman.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A representative of the teachers of the school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A representative of the hawkers of the school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An inspector of schools from the Ministry of

Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A representative of students for a secondary or a

full school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A representative of either old boys, or parents

or  pupils  for a primary school, and the  School

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuckshop Committee



<br><br>shall  meet  at least twice a year. Other  meetings

should, however, be held as and when necessary.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then a list of duties:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`."The duties' of the School Tuckshop Committee

shall include.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if inspectors of schools have to attend all

these meetings -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Twice a year, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> - and there are round about

700 registered schools-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr Byrne): 700

principals!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> In that case, there are at

least 400 tuckshops and 1,200 meetings at least  in

a  year.  Well, some inspectors of schools must  be

specially allocated to attend to the tuck-shops.  I

wonder, Sir, whether all this labour and expense is

necessary. The Government is all the time saying it

must economise. Sir, the Director of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>



Education, a highly paid man, becomes involved.  In

subsection (2) of section 2, it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A school whose tuckshop is unable to accomodate

the  minimum  number of stall-holders required,  or

which  is  unable  to fill a vacancy  to  meet  the

requirements  of  the  above  regulation,  may   be

allowed  to  have less than the minimum  number  of

small  stallholders  with  the  permission  of  the

Director of Education.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, in almost every paragraph, Sir, appears the

word  "shall".  Appointment of stallholders  is  in

section 3, subsection (1), which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Applications for stalls in all new schools shall

be  considered by a selection committee  consisting

of  the  principal of a new school (chairman),  the

Assemblyman  of  the area in which  the  school  is

situated,  or an Assemblyman member of the  Central

Tuckshop  Committee, Inspector of  Schools  of  the

area  and a representative from the Sin Chew School

Canteen Vendors Association'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it looks as if politics is entering into

school management.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Management

of tuckshops.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Tuckshops.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> An Assemblyman of the area

must  be  a member of this committee. Sir,  I  have

sufficient  trust  in  the principal.  So  long  as

discretion is given as to how things are conducted,

I  will not want to attend such a committee, unless

I receive complaints. Why should I go and interfere

with  the  internal  management  of  a  school?  As

Assemblyman  of  my  area,  I  become  a  political

figure.  I  do  not  want  politics  to  come   and

interfere in the internal management of a school. I

do   not  want  the  principal  to  feel  that  any

political pressure is applied by any Assemblyman of

any political Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure whether this Sin Chew School

Canteen  Vendors'  Association  comprises  all  the

vendors.  But if it is not, and if there are  other

hawkers' associations, they would say that there is

a   monopoly   given   to  this   Canteen   Vendors

Association.  Then  the  tuckshop  fees  are   also

regulated.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Tuckshop Fees: For the purpose of assessing

tuckshop  fees,  all Government and  aided  schools

have been graded a, b, c, d, or e according to  the

purchasing  power of the pupils. The classification

of  the rate to be applied by each school is  given

in appendix 5.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Quite a long story!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, it is very long. It is so

long that in the end -



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> To bring about

standardisation!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> - the one who drew up this

circular,  Sir, decided that the people would  have

difficulty either in understanding or carrying  out

the  details  of  the circular, so  a  meeting  was

convened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second circular went out, dated about 8 days

later. Paragraph (2) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The attached notes [some more notes, Sir] have

been drawn up to introduce uniformity in the matter

of  calculating of fees of individual  stallholders

and   to  assist  school  tuckshop  committees   in

determining the monthly fees to he paid.'



<br><br>Paragraph (3) :



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A meeting of all principals of schools affected

by   Education  Circular  33/60  will  be  held  as

scheduled below to clarify any doubts you may  have

regarding the circular and the attached notes, and

to   expound   procedure  and  other  details   not

mentioned in the circular.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is "to expound procedure and other

details".  So, in due course, the heads of  schools

went  there.  Sir, I had to be here, so  my  senior

assistant had to go. I was told, Sir, when I  asked

for  a  report,  that it was just to  listen  to  a

directive. No request was made whether they had any

improvements to suggest or whether the  system  was

really  the best possible. They were just  convened

to  listen to an exposition of this thing. Somebody

expounded  and  they were asked to  carry  out  the

orders.  Sir,  that is the spirit which  democratic

people  do  not  quite  appreciate.  If  there   is

something  not  quite right with the  system,  they

should be given the right to say so and their views

should  be  considered by the Ministry  before  the

thing is given



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>



to   them  just  like  that.  In  that  case,   the

experience  of  the heads of schools  in, tuckshop

management counts for nothing. In fact, the  system

introduced in all the schools here was tried out in

many of the older schools, and they found something

even  better. Now, will the Minister assure us that

if  a  system  is  better than the  system  he  has

introduced,  should it be scrapped in favour  of  a

worse  system for the sake of uniformity?  Sir,  we

want equality. But when it comes to uniformity,  it

is just like saying, we want a standard-size dress,

that  is,  the average one, and we ask the Minister

for   Labour  and  Law,  who  is  rather  huge   in

proportion, Sir, to go into that standard suit.  He

becomes  too  big for that. And we ask  the  Deputy

Prime  Minister to go into that suit, Sir.  He  may

not  want it. In fact, Sir, I have been told by one

head  of a Government school that when he tried  to

implement  this, he found that the hawkers  in  his

school  canteen were going to be made to, pay  more

than  they were then paying. Sir, the system  which

was  devised  in one larger school  was  on  a

co-partnership basis. Here the hawkers contribute 5 to

10  per cent of the gross takings to the school  in

return  for use of equipment and canteen.  If  they

make  their  foodstuffs attractive  and  delicious,

naturally, more school children buy the  stuff,  so

they  make  more  profit. If they  give  foodstuffs

which  the  children consider to be below  quality,

they  will not buy; so they will get less. So, this

kind  of  a system, Sir, is much better than  where

the rates are fixed. The hawkers are happier and so

are  the  children and teachers, because  they  get

good   quality  food.  The  school  is  also  happy

although  it  does not get as much as it  will  get

under this proposal. Sir, under this proposal,  all

the  net  takings  are  to be  surrendered  to  the

Accountant-General. The Government  will  only  get

$100  from  each primary school. Sir, in the  past,

tiffin  shed  profits were ploughed back  into  the

schools  for  the  benefit of the schools  and  the

school  children.  Under  this  scheme,  Sir,   the

profits are sent to the Accountant-General for  the

revenue of the State.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, aided schools, since they have to pay for

half  of  the  cost  of  the  buildings,  are  more

fortunate  in that they are allowed to  retain  the

profits  which  are to be ploughed  back  into  the

schools.  But surely, Sir, in the interest  of  the

children  in Government schools, at least  half  of

the  profits should be retained in the schools for

the  use of the school children. In any case,  Sir,

this  authoritative attitude militates against  the

fresh   ideas   that   are   being   received   for

improvement. I would suggest, Sir, that in view  of

what the Minister has said about the spirit of give

and  take,  the same should prevail down below,  so

that  before  anything is made  cut  and  dry,  the

principals   of  schools  or  the  Head   Teachers'

Conference - if it is resuscitated - would  be  invited

to   discuss  the  pros  and  cons  and   to   make

suggestions for further improvement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next subject I would like to touch on -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have to remind honourable

Members  that this debate ends at 7.45  p.m.,  that

is,  another  quarter of an hour.  I  do  not  know

whether tuckshops can be disposed of in a couple of

minutes before we touch on any other subject? I see

that  the Member for Farrer Park is also interested

in this particular matter-



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Not on tuckshops, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No. Perhaps we could deal with

tuckshops. The Minister might wish to give his

opinion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Member for Tanglin has touched on

the question of school tuckshops. He asked just now

why  these inspectors were not allotted better work

to  do,  instead  of  sending them  to  investigate

tuckshop  problems.  We must understand  that  only

inspectors  can  be  sent  to  investigate  matters

relating  to  schools. When we send  inspectors  to

inspect  the  tuckshops, we do not mean  they  must

interfere with the schools' internal matters. Their

purpose is to supervise, to see that hawkers in the

tuckshops  carry out their services  properly,  and

also  to  see  whether the tuckshop  committee  has

properly carried



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>



out the directives of the Education Ministry. As to

another issue raised, he said that in the circular,

the word "shall" was used. He touched on this word.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to show what the Ministry of Education

wanted   them  to  do  because  this   relates   to

directives by the Ministry more or less on  matters

relating  to legal aspects. Therefore, we must  use

the  word "shall" and we must not use other  terms.

This  is very clear. The Member for Tanglin is  the

principal  of  an  English  school  and  he  should

especially understand this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member does not entirely understand the

number  of  unions  there  are  for  hawkers.   The

Ministry  recognises  the School  Canteen  Vendors'

Association,  because  from  the  list  of  members

submitted to the Ministry, we know how many members

there  are.  We are satisfied that the  members  of

that   union  outnumber  those  of  other  hawkers'

unions.  As  far  as I know, the membership  totals

over  1.000.  Therefore, we  have  written  to  the

schools   saying   that   the   above   association

represents the school hawkers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member said that the rents paid for

stalls  have increased. This is not true. Formerly,

there were two kinds of schools: Government schools

and  aided schools. In the past, the stalls in  the

aided  schools  were  rented  out  through  tenders

calling  for contracts. In this respect, the  rents

were  higher. But since the introduction last  year

of   the   unification  of  rents   affecting   all

tuckshops, they have been reduced by half. In  some

schools,  they pay slightly more than  the  average

rent.  After  one year of experience, some  trouble

has  arisen.  Therefore, we have  classified  these

rents  as `A', `B', `C', `D', and `E'. If a  school

belongs to the `A' class, it means to say that  the

students  of  that school have a higher  purchasing

power. The leviable sum on that school is 18  cents

per  pupil. On a `B' class school, it is  16  cents

per pupil. On a `C' class school, perhaps it is  13

cents per pupil, and on a `D' class school, perhaps

it  is 10 cents per pupil. The schools belonging to

the  `A' class are very few in number. What I  have

just said applies only to primary schools. The  `B'

class



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>



schools are more than the `A' class schools, and so

on.  The rates charged are fair to all hawkers. The

rates paid by the hawkers in Government schools are

paid   to  the  Government.  The  fees  from  aided

schools,  of  course, are allotted  to  some  other

proper channel-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate in Committee of Supply resumed.



<br><br>7.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as time is pressing

on,  I  will confine my remarks to two main  points

which I wish to touch upon this evening.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, listening to the debate on the Ministry of

Education Estimates, it appears to me that the main

trouble seems to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>



stem  from the fact that the Ministry officials  do

not seem to have the confidence of the teachers  of

our   schools  in  Singapore.  It  seems  that  the

officials in their pettifogging officialdom do  not

seem to understand the problems of school teachers,

school-masters  and  head-masters.  If   they   can

concede   the   point   that   the   teachers   and

schoolmasters,  being nearer the  school  children,

are  in a better position to appreciate educational

problems than Ministry officials, perhaps we  might

be  able  to restore some sort of peace and thereby

ensure  some  sort of progress in  the  educational

field. It seems to me that all that is happening in

Singapore  today is a lot of frustration caused  by

unnecessary circulars, petty regulations,  such  as

the  one  which was read out this evening,  all  of

which  seem  to  show  that  the  whole  point   of

education  is  being missed. Perhaps  the  Ministry

officials have nothing else better to do than  seem

to  be interested in tuckshops and spend their time

drafting regulations which run to 20 pages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to touch upon is the

question of the six-day week for primary schools. I

do  not  wish  to  speak on the  six-day  week  for

secondary schools, because I do not feel that I  am

sufficiently  competent to do so on  that  subject.

But on the question of primary schools, I would ask

the  Minister  for  Education respectfully  to

re-consider  the whole position in the light  of  what

has happened in the last year or so. Sir, I submit,

with respect, that in so far as the primary schools

are  concerned,  the  six-day week  has  served  no

useful purpose. If anything, it has acted in a  way

not in the best interest of the primary schools. We

were made to understand that as the Chinese schools

themselves have a six-day week, perhaps it  is  not

out  of place that the English schools should  also

fall  into line. So I was surprised to read on page

1  of this afternoon's Free Press under the heading

"Chinese  primary  school  hours  should  be   cut,

Minister  told" describing the hours  that  Chinese

primary  school teachers should be called  upon  to

work.  I have done some multiplication and division

and find that it eventually comes to about 41 hours

a  day  which, when multiplied by five, gives  them

the time they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>



think that primary school teachers should be called

upon  to  teach  in Chinese schools. Therefore,  it

seems  to  me that we could quite easily  get  back

into  the  five-day week in so far as  the  English

stream is concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to take up any more time of the

House. Perhaps the Minister might want to reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will

quickly answer the points raised by the Member  for

Tanglin. The circular mentioned is not meant to  be

an   army   directive.  We  are  the  Ministry   of

Education.  But,  unfortunately,  the  hon.  Member

thinks  that  "shall" is a command. I could  almost

feel that he was clicking his heels every time  the

word  "shall" was mentioned. He takes the  view  of

Assemblymen  being asked to take some part  in  the

membership  of  a  school  tuckshop  committee   as

political  interference. It is  far  from  that.  I

think it is important that Assemblymen, if they are

prepared to offer their services, should know  what

goes  on  in their own constituencies. New  schools

are  to  be erected. After all, almost every parent

has  at  least one or two children in  school.  The

problem  of  how  they  are  looked  after  in  the

tuckshop is not confined to P.A.P. Assemblymen  but

to  the  Assemblyman of the particular constituency

in  which the school is. We welcome the presence of

Opposition Members to see that all is well, so that

they  can be happy with what is going on, far  from

interfering with the responsibilities and powers of

the  principal.  Most of the difficulties  that  we

come  across are, of course, brought about  by  the

desire   of   bringing  the   four   streams   into

uniformity. A simple analogy is this.  If  we  were

dealing with only one stream of education, it would

be  like  a  ball rolling smoothly; but  with  four

streams  of education, it is like a cube.  It  does

not roll but it just wobbles here and there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We come next to the remarks of the Member for

Farrer  Park.  I  agree that officialdom  could  be

somewhat  stiff and officious in their bearing  and

also  in  the manner in which circulars and letters

are  sent out. That is why it is necessary for  the

officials to go through a political



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>



study  course to understand that keeping  in  touch

with  the public is important, and I would  welcome

more  discussion groups and meetings of inspectors,

principals  and teachers. These have  already  been

started  and  I  would  encourage  more  of   these

discussions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the six-day week for primary schools, I am

afraid  that  there  will  be  no  change  in   the

educational policy of Singapore, but I  can  inform

the Member for Farrer Park that, at the moment,  we

are  trying  to  devise  new time-tables  both  for

primary  and secondary schools for 1961 whereby  we

will  be bringing all activities, which in the past

were considered as extra-mural activities, into the

normal  school curriculum. Since most  schools  are

now  normally working on two or three sessions,  it

becomes  very  difficult  for  the  pupils  in  the

morning  session  to turn up in the  afternoon  for

their  activities.  So,  many  of  the  extra-mural

activities   will  become  part   of   the   school

curriculum.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

said  that Assemblymen were asked to take  part  in

the tuckshop committees. Our Assemblymen have never

been asked, except maybe one Assemblywoman.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, the Member for Cairnhill

has  not been paying attention to what I have said.

Or  perhaps  he  was out having his coffee  in  the

C.P.A. room. The regulation which was read out  in

extenso  by  the Member for Tanglin was that  there

<div align="center"><b>MOTION FOR SUSPENSION OF MEMBER</b></div>



<br><br>7.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, as Leader of the House it is part  of

my  duties and, in fact, it is my responsibility to

assist  you  in  maintaining  the  decorum  of  the

Chamber. We have seen over the past few sittings -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Hon. the Leader of

the  House should first satisfy me that this motion

can be taken now. I would like to know the terms of

the motion to start off with.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, as you are aware,

under  Standing Order No. 30, there is no necessity

for notice of motion to be given in order to move a

motion for the suspension of a Member. The terms of

my motion are-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House condemns the Member for Hong Lim

for  his  dishonourable conduct  unbecoming  of  an

elected  representative of the people, in  that  he

repeatedly used his privilege in this Assembly as a

cloak   for   spreading  malicious  falsehoods   to

unjustly  injure innocent persons both  inside  and

outside this Assembly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he be suspended from the service of this

Assembly until such time as:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) he apologises to this Assembly for his

dishonourable conduct;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) he unreservedly withdraws his unfounded

allegations  against the Prime  Minister  and

the Minister for Labour and Law; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) he assures the Assembly that he will not

persist  in  abusing his  privilege  in  this

Assembly  for uttering malicious  falsehoods;

or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) be prepared when challenged to repeat

outside  the  Assembly the charges  he  makes

inside the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> May I have a copy?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copy of the Motion handed in.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think there are two points on

which I must be satisfied. Firstly, whether or  not

this motion can be taken on a day allotted for  the

business of Supply. That is the first point that  I

am  not quite certain about. I would like to  refer

the  Leader of the House and honourable Members  to

the  relevant Standing Order No. 85, paragraph (2),

which reads -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`On a day allotted to the business of Supply, the

business of Supply shall stand as the first  order,

and  so long as the business of Supply has not been

completed,  no business other than the business  of

Supply  shall  be taken after 3 p.m. or  before  8 p.m.,'



<br><br>the  other  part of the paragraph is not  relevant.

Secondly, it appears to me that this motion,  which

is  purported  to  be  moved without  notice  under

Standing  Order No. 30, paragraph (e), is a  motion

which   goes  beyond  merely  a  motion   for   the

suspension of a Member. Under Standing Order 30:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Unless Standing Orders otherwise direct, notice

shall  be  given of any motion which it is proposed

to move with the exception of the following:-



<div align="center"><h4>*** *** ***</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) A motion for the suspension of a Member.'



<br><br>It  appears  to  me  that in reading  the  Standing

Orders,  one  must read the Standing  Orders  as  a

whole.  The  Standing Orders are  really  aimed  at

giving  fair  notice  to  Members  of  any  motion,

especially one of grave import. It appears  to  me,

at first glance, that Standing Order



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>



30  (e) should be related to Standing Order 56 (1).

There  is  a motion there which could be  moved  to

suspend  a Member from the service of the  Assembly

on  the  initiative of the Speaker  when  there  is

grave disorder, abuse of the rules of the Assembly,

and  so  on.  I would like to consider this  point.

There  is little time left to carry on, unless,  of

course, the Leader gets the assent of the House  to

carry  on  with this business after 8  p.m.  But  I

would  suggest  that  I give  a  considered  ruling

tomorrow at half-past two.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> So be it, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We are now nearing 8 p.m. and if the

Minister for Finance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>



would  agree, we could adjourn. I do not  think  it

necessary  to report progress because  we  have  an

order  of the Assembly already that the Development

Estimates  anyway will start tomorrow.  So  perhaps

Mr Leader will move the adjournment simpliciter.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, "That this Assembly do now

adjourn."-[Dr Toh Chin Chye].



<br><br><div align="right">Adjourned accordingly at</div>

<div align="right">Seven minutes to Eight o'clock p.m.</div>
