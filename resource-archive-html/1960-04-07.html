<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Before I call upon the Member for

Tanglin, perhaps he could indicate whether or

not it would be convenient to take the amendment

in parts. Is it convenient to take amendments

<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A2, line 34, at end, to add-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(i) one member to be appointed by the

Minister on the nomination of the Singapore

Teachers Union;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(j) one member to be appointed by the minister

on the nomination of the Singapore Chinese

Teachers Union;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(l) one member to be appointed by the

Minister on the nomination of the Singapore

Chinese Schools Conference;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(m) one member to be appointed by the

Minister  on  the nomination of  the  Malay

Education Council.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. the Deputy Prime Minister in his

speech  at  the Nanyang University  inaugurating

University  Week  said these wise  words.  I  am

quoting from the Straits Tunes of Thursday, 31st

March:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wisdom came with tolerance and understanding."



<br><br>Sir,  the  leaders  of  the  Singapore  Teachers

Union,   under  the  tutelage  of  the   present

Political   Secretary   in   the   Ministry   of

Education, who was the Secretary-General of  the

Singapore  Teachers  Union for  many  years,  of

course,  learned  to  develop  very  independent

minds  on many questions. No doubt they did  rub

some  Ministry officials on the wrong  side  and

very  likely  they  are not  regarded  as  quite

persona grata by the Ministry of Education.  But

all  the same, Sir, the Singapore Teachers Union

is  the largest union of English school teachers

and,  as such, I think they should be allowed  a

representative on this Adult Education Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A great deal of the work will have to be carried

out  with  the  assistance of teachers  teaching

night classes, and I think it is only right that

they  should  be represented on  this  Board  to

discuss policies and give advice and suggestions

on   planned  schemes  so  that  they  will   be

workable. Also, Sir, if their representative  is

on  this  Board, they will naturally  feel  that

they should co-operate more wholeheartedly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson, Sir, at one meeting of

the  Select Committee on this Bill, did say that

teachers and head teachers were like drivers and

conductors   employed   in   the   Ministry   of

Education,  and  that the Ministry  was  like  a

Board of Directors. Sir, I hope that is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>



not the policy of the Government, because if  it

is,  then  one regrets to say that in  the  days

when  Singapore was governed by colonial rulers,

there  were  representatives of teachers  unions

and  head  teachers conferences on the Education

Advisory   Committee.   They   took   part    in

deliberations  regarding  plans   and   policies

affecting education in the Colony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do believe, Sir, that if we take the attitude

that  teachers  and  head  teachers  are  merely

servants  to be ordered about, then we will  not

get  the  maximum effort from them. There  is  a

difference  between people who  are  treated  as

servants  and those who are treated  as  friends

and  partners. I believe that teachers and  head

teachers will produce the maximum effort if they

are treated as friends and partners in the field

of education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Chinese schools now being treated on a

parity with English schools naturally would want

representation  on this Board.  Of  course,  the

ideal  thing would be to have just one  Teachers

Union  and  one  Head  Teachers  Conference   to

include   members  of  the  teaching  profession

teaching in the different media. But until  that

comes to pass, I am afraid, Sir, that we have to

regard the situation as it now stands and invite

the    representatives   from   the    different

organisations so that they will be able to  help

the Government in its plans on adult education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that because of disagreement

between   the   Ministry  officials   and   some

representatives of the Singapore Teachers Union,

the Joint Consultative Committee was abolished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, reminding ourselves of the words of the

Hon, the  Deputy Prime Minister,  "Wisdom  came

with tolerance and understanding," I am sure  in

that  spirit teachers Will respond. It was  this

spirit  which the Hon, the Minister  for  Labour

and  Law  said  was  being  implemented  in  the

Industrial  Relations Bill which has now  become

an  Ordinance. The stages he advocated out of  a

deadlock were appeal -



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> I thought so!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Re-negotiation or

reconciliation, or final arbitration. I do hope,

Sir, that in that spirit, this amendment will be

considered and accepted



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of representation for the Malay

Education Council, I hope it is appreciated that

we are not stressing communalism, but we are re-

emphasising  what is laid down in the  Singapore

Constitution, that the Malays in Singapore  must

at all times be given special consideration.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I did try to indicate to

the  hon.  Member  that  perhaps  it  would   be

convenient to take this amendment in two  parts:

one  dealing with representation of teachers and

head   teachers  and  the  other  dealing   with

representation  of the Malay Education  Council.

It appears to me that the Member for Tanglin has

not  indicated  how the two are interrelated  so

that the debate could conveniently be undertaken

on  the  whole amendment. Will the  hon.  Member

please indicate that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I accept

your  correction. I will stop at  amendment  (l)

and move amendment (m) later on.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Very well.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, on the Adult Education

Board,  the  people would naturally  expect  the

Teachers  Union and the Head Teachers Conference

to  be  represented, and if the Government  does

not  want  them to be represented, I  hope  they

will  give an adequate explanation with adequate

reasons.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It has been moved as an amendment:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A2, line 34, at end, to add-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(i) one member to be appointed by the

Minister on the nomination of the Singapore

Teachers Union;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(j) one member to be appointed by the

Minister on the nomination of the Singapore

Chinese Teachers Union;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(k) one member to be appointed by the

Minister on the nomination of the

Singapore Head Teachers Conference;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(l) one member to be appointed by the

Minister   on   the   nomination   of   the

Singapore Chinese Schools Conference;".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the words proposed to be

added, be there added."



<br><br>2.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Sir, how the Member

for Tanglin chooses to interpret what I said  at

the  Select  Committee meeting is his privilege,

and I certainly do not intend to tell him how to

mind  his  business, but if it will  please  the

Member, I shall repeat myself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say that teachers and head teachers must be

represented  on  this  Board  because  they  are

functionaries  in the promotion of  literacy  is

making  a farce of whatever principle the Member

is  toying in his mind, because there  are  many

other   categories  of  workers  who   will   be

connected  with adult education in  one  way  or

another.  You have the inspectorate,  the  jagas

who  open and shut the classrooms and the kebuns

who  sweep  the  floor.  What  about  all  these

people?  Are  they to be represented  separately

too?  Is  representation of these  units  to  be

given  separately too? What about the clerks  in

the  Ministry  and those in the Cultural  Centre

who  will do paper work in connection with adult

education. Are they to be represented too? I  am

sure  the  Member is aware that  Government  has

called for volunteers and it is very likely that

the  adult  classes  will be staffed  with  non-professional teachers.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the public, the civil servants, what

about representation for these people? These are

the  people who will also be called upon  to  do

work in connection with adult education. Sir, to

suggest  that  teachers must be  represented  on

this   Board  just  because  they  are   workers

connected  with adult education is not  a  valid

suggestion. That is exactly what I say.  But  if

we say: are workers as such to be represented on

the  Board? Is our working class as such  to  be

represented  on the Board? Is there a  provision

to this effect? I say there is.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trades Union Congress, which is the parent

body  of  all  categories of  workers,  has  the

privilege of nominating two members who, besides

being active participants in the formulation  of

the  policies  of the Board, will have  a  moral

obligation  to look after the interests  of  the

teachers.  And exactly who should be  appointed,

is  a  matter for the T.U.C. to decide.  Whether

kebuns,  or jagas, drivers or conductors,  or  a

principal  in  the form of the hon.  Member  for

Tanglin,  I  am  sure  the T.U.C. is  competent

enough to decide.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

not  opposed  representation  on  the  Board  by

members  of  the T.U.C. What I did ask  for  was

that  there  should be increased representation,

because  as  at present composed or constituted,

we  have  7  Government nominees,  2  University

nominees  who could become Government  nominees,

and  only 2 T.U.C. nominees who are, as it were,

independently nominated. Surely the presence  or

the inclusion of a few more representatives from

the Teachers' Union and Head Teachers Conference

would  be  of assistance to the Board and  would

give   the  Board  a  slight  leavening  of   an

independent element which is really all  to  the

good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, democracy is a system which works more

slowly   no   doubt,   but   nonetheless    more

effectively, because those who are interested in

an  enterprise are invited to share their  views

and  sometimes to share opposition views. If  it

is  the  purpose of Government to  have  on  the

Board just people who will say, "We agree", then

of  course  the  present  composition  is  quite

sufficient. But I envisage that it is the desire

of  Government  to  have also  Opposition  views

which  could  be considered but  it  should  not

dominate the discussions. That I agree. Since it

is   a  Government-financed  organisation,   the

preponderance of votes must be under the control

of  the  Government. That is understood. But  to

have  just two nominated by the T.U.C. and  the

others  nominated  by the Government,  I  think,

Sir, there is a case for having an increase.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not familiar with all the

intricacies  of  the problem which  we  are  now

discussing. But it does seem to me that the hon.

Member  for  Tanglin  cannot  get  rid  of   his

colonial  past.  The  basic  assumption  in  his

argument  is  that any person appointed  by  the

Government is there to act as a rubber stamp. It

may  be that his long experience as a Government

nominee in the colonial government has fortified

him  in  this belief. But I can assure you,  Mr

Speaker,   Sir,   that  when  we,   the   P.A.P.

Government, appoint members to Boards, we do not

expect  them  to  do what we tell  them  to  do;

because if that were the case, then there  would

be no need at all for establishing such a Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout his argument, the hon. Member bases

the plea for greater representation from what he

calls  independent forces purely on the mistaken

belief  that the persons we appoint will be  our

stooges. I can assure him that we do not  expect

him  perhaps to understand the whole  philosophy

on which our Party is based. But he is making  a

profound  mistake  if  he  thinks  that  members

appointed  by the P.A.P. Government will  be  of

the  same  calibre as he himself and  his  other

colleagues of the colonial days.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if that

reasoning  is valid, then I would say that  this

Assembly  should be abolished!  There  could  be

just  another  Assembly made up  of  appointees,

because  the appointees need not be told  to  be

stooges; they can be independent. But, Sir,  the

procedure  is  most undemocratic  - that  is  the

point.  If we are a Government that believes  in

democracy,   the   procedure   must   also    be

democratic, and in that case the representatives

on the Board must be nominated by the bodies.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am not at all grateful, Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  for  this  little   lesson   on

democratic   procedure  from  the   Member   for

Tanglin.  But there is no parallel  between  the

functions and duties of a Board such as that  we

are  considering today and those of the Assembly

of  this  House.  The Board's functions  are  to

carry out the policies of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>



the  Government. It is essentially an  executive

body.  Where  an  Assembly  or  a  Parliamentary

Assembly  such  as  ours is the  supreme  policy

making and legislative organ of the State, these

two   organs  operate  at  completely  different

levels.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the

Adult  Education  Board were to  control  assets

belonging  purely to the Government, maybe  that

sort  of  a  policy  could be  defended.  But  I

understand,  Sir,  that among the  assets  which

would  be  controlled by the  Board  are  assets

contributed  by private individuals  and  assets

brought from the Colonial Development Fund. That

being  so,  Sir, naturally it is  not  a  purely

Government    organisation.   If   the    public

contributed to it, surely they would like to see

representation from bodies which are allowed  to

nominate their own representatives.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday I had

occasion  to  compliment  the  sagacity  of  the

Member for Tanglin because he chose the path  of

wisdom in deciding that silence was golden, when

pearls of wisdom were dropping from the lips  of

my  Friends  opposite. But I must  say  that  my

confidence in him this afternoon has really been

shattered and mistaken. Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

accused  my  Friends opposite of  never  reading

Government bills. It is a human thing to dislike

Government  bills, but I do not  think  you  can

ever excuse anybody for failing to read at least

newspaper reports of these proceedings. It  must

have  dawned  on  the mind  of  the  Member  for

Tanglin  that  a new set up in the  Trade  Union

world was being attempted by this Government. If

he  had taken the trouble to read the newspapers

this morning, he would have found out that there

is  a provision in the new Trade Union Bill that

only  unions which are affiliated to the  Trades

Union  Congress  will  be  registered  as  trade

unions. And when they cease to be affiliated  to

the  Trades  Union congress, they  cease  to  be

registered unions. He would have seen the report

that   whereas  before  any  seven   disgruntled

persons can constitute themselves into a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>



trade  union,  the Government now proposes  that

there  must at least be 250 members in  a  trade

union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are making a break from the past. In the

past  the  Trades Union Congress  was  just  one

union  out of 250 unions. We are putting an  end

to  all  that.  And that is why  we  propose  to

compel affiliation to the T.U.C. before a  union

can be registered as a union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson has

explained   to  the  Member  for   Tanglin   how

ridiculous  it  would be if,  say,  any  special

group   of   workers  were  given  any   special

representation  in  an  organisation  like  this

Adult  Education Board. Why should the  teachers

be   given  any  special  representation?  Other

members of our community are also associated  in

these  activities. If the teachers have a  valid

claim to any special representation, others  who

volunteer,  may be in other organisations,  also

have  an  equal claim for special representation

in these activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard him all the time talking about

democratic  principles  and  all  that  sort  of

thing, but he has never answered the point  that

the  Member  for Thomson has made. Mr  Speaker,

Sir,   we  have  been  indulgent  in  all  these

matters. We, as the Government, are quite  ready

to  consider  reasonable arguments,  but  we  at

least are realists. We stand to be convinced  by

argument,  not by emotion. So far, Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  I can assure you, speaking from this  side

of the House, that none of us has been convinced

that  there  is  any merit in the representation

that has been made by the Member for Tanglin.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, one thing that can be said  of

the  hon Member for Tanglin is this: if we  were

to  listen to him long enough, we would  imagine

that  we  are attending a Sunday school  sermon.

The only defect is that he did not try to end it

up with a loud "Amen".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am somewhat surprised at the manner in which

he  seems  to  pop  up and down,  attempting  to

answer the speeches



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>



of  my colleagues. His example reminds me of the

gymnasium  which I used to haunt in  my  younger

days when I took up boxing, where there was  the

inevitable punching bag which, although you kept

punching  it, kept coming back for more punches.

At yesterday's sitting of the House, I mentioned

a  very battered rubber stamp. We now see a very

battered punching bag!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the five amendments from the hon. Member

for  Tanglin, he has just raised issues on  four

of  them,  namely, nominees from  the  Singapore

Teachers  Union, the Singapore Chinese  Teachers

Union,  the  Singapore Head Teachers Conference,

and the Singapore Chinese Schools Conference. He

may  not  be  aware that two  out  of  the  four

already  have  nominees serving on  the  highest

educational advisory body in the State,  namely,

the  nominees from the Singapore Teachers Union,

representing  the English stream  of  education,

and a nominee from the Singapore Chinese Schools

Conference. It is not necessary that the nominee

or  nominees of organisations should be on every

committee or board. It would be senseless. If we

were  to  follow his argument, we might as  well

have all the Assemblymen on every board that the

Government sets up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin has suggested that there

should  be  a nominee from the Chinese  Teachers

Union. May I draw attention to the fact that  in

June  last year, as soon as the People's  Action

Party   took   office,  and  as   Minister   for

Education, I had to advise this particular  body

of  Chinese teachers how undesirable it  was  to

organise a team of 33 Chinese teachers to  visit

Taiwan?  So  we  can  safely assume  that  their

political    philosophy,   if   any,    requires

education, perhaps lots of adult education, that

is,  loyalty to Singapore and not to that pimple

on  the  face  of  free Asia, an  island  called

Taiwan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the organisation known as the Head

Teachers  Conference,  perhaps  the  Member  for

Tanglin is a member of this Conference. It is, I

think,   unnecessary  that   there   should   be

classification of teachers - teachers who teach



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>



and teachers who administer. So I cannot see the

necessity  at  this juncture for  considering  a

nomination from this particular organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin mentioned certain assets

which  this new Board would take over. In  these

assets  he  included sums of  money  donated  by

private   individuals  and  from  the   Colonial

Development Fund. It is the purpose of a  Select

Committee to consider such representations.  The

Member  for  Tanglin, who was a  Member  of  the

Select   Committee   on  the   Lembaga   Gerakan

Pelajaran  Dewasa Bill, is well  aware  that  no

written  representations were  received  by  the

Select  Committee.  It can therefore  safely  be

assumed  that  there have been no loud  protests

over  this  transfer  of  assets.  So  there  is

certainly  no  foundation for  stirring  up  the

emotions  of  individuals that  the  assets  are

going to be lost to this new Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I further wish to add that if we follow closely

the  progress of this Bill, if we, for  example,

study the Official Report of the proceedings  of

the  Select  Committee, we will find the  Member

for  Tanglin  proposing  that  there  should  be

nominees  from the National Union  of  Teachers,

and  having been told that there was no National

Union  of Teachers, he then came up at  a  later

stage with definite names. But he has got to  be

taught  how  to  proceed with the amendments  to

Bills. At least, he is willing to learn!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might take this opportunity, Mr Speaker, of

making  an  announcement about the  question  of

teachers and adult education. When the 4½ hours'

extra session work was abolished, it was decided

that  we  would call for volunteers to  man  the

adult  and  literacy  classes,  which  will   be

handled by this new Adult Education Board. I  am

very   pleased  to  be  able  to  announce   the

wonderful  response from members of the  public,

the  teachers and the civil servants. Of course,

the  greatest  credit must go to the  400-strong

Malay  Teachers  Union who  passed  a  unanimous

resolution to offer their voluntary services  to

the   Government.  To  date,  there  are   2,140

volunteers  who  include; I am very  pleased  to

say, six of my colleagues.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>



By  making this announcement, I hope I will  not

stop  the  response to volunteer, and that  more

will come forward because the Government intends

to  go very much further into the rural areas of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The volunteers are as follows: Chinese, 1,125; Malays, 519, which include the

400-strong  Malay Teachers Union; English,  472;

and Tamil, 26.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I close, I only need to say this. I am

unable to take seriously the proposals from  the

Member  for  Tanglin unless he does one  of  two

things.  Firstly,  volunteer  to  do  one   year

service  for adult education, or become a  pupil

at  one  of our adult literacy classes and  then

give us suggestions for improvement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, some of the

points I made have not been answered. (1) Is  it

the  policy  of Government to treat teachers  as

their  servants  or  as their  partners  in  co-

operation? The Member for Thomson said that they

should  not be represented on the Board  because

they   are   like   drivers  and  conductors - the

employees.  The Hon, the Minister for Education,

however,  did  say, Sir, that they  are  on  his

Advisory Education Council.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think it is only fair to

the  Member  for  Thomson that the  hon.  Member

should  quote  the exact words  the  Member  for

Thomson used. The words are in column 80 of  the

Official Report of the Select Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, the Hon. Minister for

Labour and Law did say that -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think I must insist on

the  exact words of the Member for Thomson being

quoted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, to quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Bani: I feel that the reasons given by the

hon. Member are no justification for asking that

teachers be represented on the Board. As  I  see

it,  asking the head teachers or teachers to  be

represented on this Board is similar  to  having

conductors and drivers - without prejudice  to  my

socialist  sentiments - on the Board of  Directors

of a firm."'



<br><br>Sir,  the Hon. the Minister for Labour  and  Law

did give the impression that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>



any  Opposition Member who keeps quiet  deserves

the highest praise. Sir, if that is the function

of  the  Opposition,  then  it  is  contrary  to

parliamentary practice. The Opposition should be

free  to  express  views, which  have  not  been

uttered.   They   may   be   contrary   to    or

complementary  to the views of  the  Government,

but  we  are here for a certain purpose, and  in

every  parliamentary system, there  must  be  an

Opposition  to keep it alive. In fact,  in  most

countries, the Leader of the Opposition is  paid

a  certain  stipend so that he can maintain  the

Opposition. But I notice, Sir that it is not  so

here.  Maybe  the purpose here is  to  kill  the

Opposition.  Sir,  I  say  this  without   first

getting  the  permission of the  Leader  of  the

Opposition. I feel it should be said, because it

seems  to  me  that it is the  feeling  of  some

Government  Members - I will not say all - that  the

less  opposition  there  is  to  anything,   the

better.  Sir,  to keep the parliamentary  system

healthy,  I  think the Opposition must  be  kept

alive, otherwise democracy in Singapore is dead.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I thought the Minister was

praising the sagacity of the Member for Tanglin,

and not suggesting that he should keep silent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A2, line 34, at end, to add-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(m) one member to be appointed by the Minister

on the nomination of the Malay Education

Council."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not think the hon. Member

should worry about the letter (m) .



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if it is

the intention of the Government seriously to pay

special  attention to the Malay  language,  then

surely,  there  must  be a  Malay  member  here.

Perhaps, even though it is not so specified, the

Hon.  Minister will give an assurance that there

will  be  a  Malay  member  to  safeguard  Malay

interests. But if he has not had any such  plan,

maybe  he  will consider appointing a member  on

the nomination



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Malay Education Council. The  emphasis,

Sir,  is not on communalism, but on the language

medium. In fact, if the Government were to  give

an  assurance  that  they will  also  appoint  a

member to represent the Tamil language, we  will

welcome that assurance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not that we want to be vexatious,

but   we  feel  that  where  there  can   be   a

contribution, we would like to make it  and  let

the  Government  with a majority  of  the  votes

decide.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, it will be very

useful  if Members of the Opposition,  with  the

same persistency and tenacity as the hon. Member

for  Tanglin,  keep  reminding  Members  on  the

Government  Benches  how to  run  their  various

Ministries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He should, however, realise the fact that, when

Bills  are  being put forward before the  House,

serious  consideration has been given to various

aspects; how boards, when constituted, would  be

managed in the best interests of the State. This

Government is not going to be pushed around with

last-minute  suggestions coming  from  the  hon.

Member   for   Tanglin.  The  remarks   I   made

previously   apply  also  in  respect   of   the

nomination  from the Malay Education Council  in

that   their  nominee  serves  on  that  highest

advisory  body  known as the Education  Advisory

Council,  which meets once a month. The  nominee

of this Malay Education Council also serves as a

member   of   the   Malay   Education   Advisory

Committee, which advises the Minister  on  Malay

education.  It is, I think, superfluous  on  the

part  of  the  Member  for Tanglin  to  ask  for

assurances from the Minister for Education  that

at least a Malay will be appointed on this Adult

Education  Board.  It  does  not  require   such

assurances because the People's Action Party  is

a Party, which believes in action - deeds and not

words. When we produce the results of our deeds,

people  who have the same beliefs as the  Member

for Tanglin get startled. They get ruffled, just

like  chickens on the farm when something  takes

place.  They  talk of progress  when  they  mean

retrogression. They say things,  which  they  do

not mean.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>



We, on our side, plan and think carefully before

we  proceed.  Listening to what the  Member  for

Tanglin  has to say reminds us of an old record,

which  is played again and again ad nauseam.  He

is  also  somewhat like the mosquito, which  you

find  buzzing inside a mosquito net. It is quite

a   nuisance.  It  does  nothing  else   except,

perhaps,  to irritate the man in bed who  wishes

that  he  could  just give it a  hard  swipe.  I

regret,  therefore, that his proposed  amendment

is not acceptable to the Government side.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I congratulate the Hon, the

Minister  for Education when he said that  there

are  various  stages where a  nominee  from  the

Malay  Education Council is represented for  the

purpose of working together with the Government,

in   the  sense  that  he  participates  in  the

planning of Malay education in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this is the third time that I have

appealed  to the Government, particularly  about

the  position  of  the Malay Education  Council,

whose members are not represented on this Board.

I believe that fact will not be a loss or a gain

to the Government. Perhaps it is considered that

the  Malay  Education Council can be represented

on  other bodies, but not on the Board which  it

is  proposed to set up in this Bill  which  will

become law in Singapore, and which Will use  the

Malay language for the first time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister for Education is of the opinion

that  Malay  education is of a low  standard,  I

would  like  to  emphasize  that  not  only  the

representatives  from  U.M.N.O. and  the  Party

Ra'ayat,  but  also  members from  the  People's

Action  Party  (who  are  the  Government)  have

served on the Malay Education Council right from

its  inception  until today. And  they  play  an

important   part  in  the  task  of  the   Malay

Education Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I am not trying to coax the

Government but merely to bring to the  attention

of the Government the difficulties, which we are

now facing. I feel we may be accused of taking a

communalistic  attitude.  I  do  not   wish   my

arguments to be based on communalism or what  is

embodied in the Preamble to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>



the  Constitution. This is for  the  purpose  of

fostering and encouraging the Malay language  so

that it will become the national language and be

taught  to those who are not well versed  in  it

and  who are eager to learn it. So if there  are

institutions    or    bodies    like    U.M.N.O.

particularly, or Party Ra'ayat or other  Parties

it  may  be that, in the eyes of the Government,

if  they  are  to  be represented,  this  matter

cannot be put into practice, on a board on which

the Government has full power. I merely wish  to

draw  the  attention of the Government to  this,

because  on  numerous  occasions  I  have   been

castigated by the Government side who have  said

that  language reflects the nation, So  if  this

saying could be carried out in practice, it will

not  be  a  loss to the Government to appoint  a

nominee from the Malay Education Council so that

he  could  co-operate  with  the  Government  in

matters of planning.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I appreciate the views

expressed  by  the Member of the Opposition  who

has  pleaded persistently on behalf of the Malay

Education  Council. However, on  the  Government

side,  we  have never looked with contempt  upon

the  Malay Education Council, nor have  we  ever

made  the  accusation that the struggle  of  the

Malay  Education  Council  is  communal.  I   am

surprised that the Member for Kampong Kembangan,

in supporting his colleague, constantly repeated

whether   he  would  be  accused  of   being   a

communalist champion. Mr Speaker, I am  greatly

surprised. Why? A cock that crows lays no  eggs.

I  think perhaps the reason is this - this is only

the   feeling   of  the  Member   for   Kampong

Kembangan. But the Government has never  accused

the  Member for Kampong Kernbangan of  being  an

upholder  of  communalism.  The  Government  has

never  accused  anybody on this  issue.  But  we

always  remind  them  not to  stir  up  communal

feelings,     because    of    the    disastrous

consequences.  This  is  what  we  have   always

reminded  them. I feel, Mr Speaker,  if  people

can   boast  of  the  existence  of  the   Malay

Education Council,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>



I  will  associate  myself  with  that  sentiment.

because  I  am one of the founder members  of  the

Malay  Education Council and I have served  on  it

until  today. Therefore, Mr Speaker, I  know  the

exact  situation of the Council. I also know  that

two  Members from the Opposition side are  serving

as   committee  members  on  the  Malay  Education

Council  today. I feel Government has already  put

the Malay Education Council in the same privileged

position  as  the  Singapore Educational  Advisory

Council,  whose function is to advise the Minister

on   matters  affecting  Malay  education  or  the

development  of the Malay language  in  Singapore.

Mr  Speaker,  the problem of the  Malay  language

does  not  merely  concern the Malay  people.  The

Malay   language  has  now  become  the   national

language. It has become more or less the  property

of  all those domiciled in Singapore-not just  the

Malays.  It is not surprising, therefore, that  in

the   course  of  advancing  and  developing   the

national language; it is not necessary that Malays

should  be  represented.  In  some  cases  in  the

University of Malaya, from what I know,  lecturers

in  Malay  are not Malays. Therefore, Mr Speaker,

the  development of the national language does not

lie  solely  in the hands of the Malays.  What  is

more,  Mr Speaker, the Malay language has  become

the  national  language. Where there  is  a  will,

there  is  a way. We can draw on linguistic  Malay

experts  from either the Chinese or other streams.

About  the  absence of a representative  from  the

Malay Education Council, Mr Speaker. Sir, it does

not  follow that it is because the Government  has

belittled the Malay Education Council; but, on the

other  hand, propositions put forward by the Malay

Education  Council  have  been  accepted  by   the

Government, who have considered that they  are  in

the  interests  of the development  of  the  Malay

language  in Singapore. Mr Speaker, if there  are

certain  quarters  who  hold  the  view  that  the

Government  belittles or looks down with  contempt

on the Malay



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>



Education Council, that may be because of sinister

motives.  For, as the Member for Kampong Kembangan

said  just now, language reflects the nation. This

matter  will not rest only on one race but on  all

the peoples who live in Singapore.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

what  I mentioned just now was not of my own  free

will, but it has been quoted from a Member of  the

Government when the first sitting of this Assembly

was held.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not my intention to

labour on this point. But I would like to reply to

the  Parliamentary Secretary to the  Minister  for

National   Development  on  his  allegations   and

assumptions  about myself. Sir, has  he  forgotten

that  at one time he could be said to have planted

a fiery feeling which I could say, with sincerity,

I  learned from him? So if it is his intention  to

accuse me, I would like to -



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): On a point of order. On

the   subject,  which  the  Member   for   Kampong

Kembangan  has learned from me, that is irrelevant

to the subject matter under debate.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the hon. Member thinks that is

offensive,  I  suppose  the  Member  for   Kampong

Kembangan should withdraw that expression.  But  I

was  under  the  impression that the Parliamentary

Secretary  would  be quite pleased  to  know  that

somebody has learned from him!



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, the position is that this matter has

arisen.  If I was dug out yesterday, then today  I

am  ferretted out! But I would like to be frank on

a  friend-to-friend basis. If we want to  lay  our

cards on the table, let us do so openly. Some may

consider  that  I am a communalist.  I  am  not  a

communalist nor am I a fanatic. If I am accused by

the  Government  for being a communalist,  then  I

must  point  out that I have never  quoted  verses

from the Koran in this Assembly, as I feel that it

is not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>



proper to do so here. I would like to bring home

the  fact that I do not base, my appeal  on  the

Preamble to the Singapore Constitution,  nor  on

communalism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I merely ask the Government to bring the

different bodies closer together on a social and

friendly basis.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

think  the  Member  for  Kampong  Kembangan  has

repeatedly  expressed his desire  to  co-operate

with  the  Government. We, on  this  side,  have

given  full co-operation to the Malay  Education

Council   of   which  the  Member  for   Kampong

Kembangan  is a member. Therefore,  this  matter

does  not  arise. In spite of the fact that  the

Malay Education Council is not to be represented

on  the Adult Education Board, nevertheless  the

Government  has  given special consideration  to

it,   in  that  the  hon.  Member  sits  on  the

Education  Advisory Council for the  development

of the Malay language in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, I feel that what

I have to say will come as a surprise to Members

of  the Opposition because I am unable to accept

the  suggestion to extend the membership of  the

Board  to  include  nomination  from  the  Malay

Education  Council under the proposed  clause  5

(1) (m).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to go back however to clause 5 (1) (a)

where  the  Minister  has  power  to  appoint  a

Chairman,  a Deputy Chairman and one member.  In

view  of the fact that the Malay Teachers  Union

have  set  a  most inspiring example  by  coming

forward  to  support  the  Government   in   its

programme to popularise the national language, I

can  give this assurance, that one of the  three

members  to  be appointed by the Minister  under

clause  5  (1)  (a)  will come  from  the  Malay

Teachers  Union and not from the Malay Education

Council.

Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (I)

of section 106 of the Income Tax Ordinance (Cap.

166),  resolves  that  the South  Indian  Labour

Fund,  Federation of Malaya,  be  added  to  the

First Schedule to the said Ordinance with effect

from the 1st day of September, 1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An application has been received for the

exemption  of the South Indian Labour Fund  from

income  under section 13 (1) (e) of  the  Income

Tax  Ordinance by inclusion of the Fund  in  the

First Schedule to the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Fund has been established by the

Federation  Government under  the  South  Indian

Labour  Fund  Ordinance, 1958,  to  replace  the

Indian Immigration Funds, which have been  wound

up  by enactment. The resources of the Fund will

consist  initially of sums paid  over  from  the

Indian Immigration Funds when they are wound up.

The  Fund will be disbursed for the repatriation

of  and assistance to Indian labourers and their

dependants  or  orphans,  and  for   any   other

purposes beneficial to South Indian labourers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malayan Board of Income Tax has considered

this  case and recommends that the South  Indian

Labour  Fund  of the Federation  of  Malaya  may

properly  be  included in the First Schedule  to

the  Income Tax Ordinance with effect  from  the

1st   of  September  1958,  and  the  Government

accepts the recommendation of the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 106 of the Income Tax Ordinance gives

power  to the Legislative Assembly by resolution

to add to therein or revoke the whole or part of

any   Schedule  to  the  Ordinance.  The   First

Schedule  specifies  institutions,  authorities,

persons  or funds whose income is exempted  from

Assembly  may  by resolution add to or  amend  the

Schedule to the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been necessary from time to time to bring

will  be statutorily vested in authorities,  which

have replaced them.

a  number of changes of departmental titles  owing

to  ministerial  re-organisation. The  purpose  of

this  motion is to enable officers to fulfil their

statutory duties under the correct titles.
