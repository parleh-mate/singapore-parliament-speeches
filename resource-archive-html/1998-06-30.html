<div align="center"><b>ASSESSMENT OF MANPOWER NEEDS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dr Tan Boon Wan</b> asked the Minister for Manpower whether

his  Ministry  has assessed the manpower needs  of  the  country

after the current regional crisis; whether there is any mismatch

between  what we have and what we will need; and,  if  so,  what

steps are being taken or planned to close this gap.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  manpower situation has been affected by  the  current

economic  slow-down.   More workers have been  retrenched.   The

majority  of  jobs  lost was in labour intensive  and  low-skill

areas.  On the other hand, new jobs created tend to be of higher

value added and require higher level of skills.  For example, in

the  manufacturing sector, the $8.5 billion of  committed  fixed

asset  investments will generate some 20,000 new jobs  over  the

next  few  years.  Most of these new investments such  as  wafer

fab,   petrochemical  and  telecommunications,  require  skilled

workers  with  NTC certification.  The demand for  workers  with

technical  and  specialised  skills  includes  more  than  2,000

engineers,  2,000 diploma holders and 3,000 NTC II  holders  for

this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the shift in demand to higher skill jobs, we

face  a real danger of a mismatch in the skills required by  the

employers  and what our workers can do.  Structural unemployment

will  be  the outcome if nothing is done.  This problem must  be

tackled  by retraining and skills upgrading, especially for  the

older  workers.  Hence, the Government has committed $50 million

in  addition  to  the Skills Development Fund's $50  million  to

expand the outreach of the Skills Redevelopment Programme  which

is  targeted at upgrading workers' skills so that they can  cope

with the changes.  Yesterday, the Minister for Finance announced

another  $20 million for a Skills Development Centre.  The  $120

million  Skills Redevelopment Programme will be able to  provide

skills upgrading for up to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>

40,000  workers.  If every worker makes a determined  effort  to

raise  his or her skill level, we will be able to close the  gap

and rid the consequences of structural unemployment.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> May I ask

the  Minister  how  long has this retraining programme  been  in

place?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Skills

Redevelopment  Programme  was first launched  in  December  1996

under   the  auspices  of  the  NTUC,  the  Singapore   National

Employers'  Federation  (SNEF)  and  the  Government.    Several

Government  departments or statutory boards were involved.   EDB

and  PSB  were  very much involved in the pilot  phase  of  this

programme.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> How is it, may I ask, that we still

continue  to  have this gap between the skills  needed  and  the

skills that our workers can provide?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have quite a large

number  of  older  workers, aged 40 and  above,  who  have  less

education because, in their younger days, education was  not  so

freely and readily available.  This is the group of workers that

are most in need of skills upgrading.  Skills upgrading needs  a

little  bit  more time.  We cannot just wave a  magic  wand  and

overnight  we  have 400,000 or 500,000 workers who are  suddenly

turned   into   skilled   workers.   So  although   the   Skills

Redevelopment Programme was launched in December 1996,  it  will

take  us quite a few years to reach out to all the older workers

to help them to upgrade.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> May I ask the

Minister,  besides the skills qualification, does the Government

expect  any mismatch in terms of the graduates from polytechnics

and universities?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this year's group of

graduates  may experience a more difficult time getting  a  job,

and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>

I  have  said  before  that some of the graduates  who  are  too

fastidious or waiting for the ideal job to come around may  find

that  they have to wait quite a while.  So the advice  is  that,

for  a  new graduate entering the job market for the first time,

whether  he is a polytechnic graduate or a university  graduate,

he  should  try to get a job as soon as possible, regardless  of

what  the offer is and, even if it is not his ideal job,  it  is

still better to have a job and be employed and take the time  to

learn  the  ropes than to stay unemployed because  the  economic

situation  is not very good.  There is a sharp slowdown  in  the

economic  growth.  Many companies are not expanding  their  head

count even at the higher end.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said that, there are still some sectors, whether

it is in the manufacturing or service sector, which are still in

need  of more senior and experienced or even graduate employees,

and  these are the companies that will be recruiting.   In  some

cases, they may even find that they have difficulty getting  the

number of skilled workers that they need from among our pool  of

graduates.  For instance, in the manufacturing sector, like  the

wafer  fab, which I mentioned earlier on, they have a very  high

demand  for  technicians and engineers whom we cannot completely

meet with our own graduate output.  Some of these companies  may

in  fact still have to recruit foreign talent to supplement  the

domestic graduates who are joining the workforce at the moment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Given that the Minister's advice is for some

graduates  not to be too fussy and that there will be shortfalls

in others, I understand that there is a mismatch at least in the

short term.  If that is the case, will the Government relook  at

the  intake  into  universities and  polytechnics  to  cure  the

mismatch problem?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the long term, we

expect  to  be short of talented and skilled manpower.   So  the

Government's effort is towards increasing the supply of  skilled

manpower from our local manpower resources.  We have a committee

called  Manpower  21  to  look at the  medium  and  longer  term

manpower

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>

planning  to see how we can better meet the demands  of  various

industries  and  to ensure that there will be sufficient  output

from our various institutions of higher learning to meet as much

of  the  demand as possible.  But for the longer  term,  with  a

small population of only three million people, and if we want to

generate  that kind of economic growth that we had been enjoying

previously,  my feeling is that we will always remain  short  of

talent  at  the top end.  That is why the Government is  talking

about  trying to recruit international talent to supplement  our

domestic talent.

<div align="center"><b>UNIVERSITY AND POLYTECHNIC FRESH GRADUATES</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Financial assistance for further study or self-improvement</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>courses)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry,  in view of the slowdown in job creation, whether  the

Government will consider measures to assist fresh graduates from

universities and polytechnics, including bridging repayments  of

any  outstanding  study loans the students have  undertaken  and

helping  to  finance further study or professional  courses  for

self-improvement and skill upgrading.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Second Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the maximum loan repayment period

is   20  years  for  university  graduates  and  10  years   for

polytechnic graduates.  University graduates are given up to two

years  and  polytechnic graduates up to  one  year  before  they

commence  their loan repayment.  However, the institutions  will

exercise  flexibility in helping students who are genuinely  not

able to begin their repayment within the stipulated timeframe.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graduates who wish to pursue further studies can do so at

NUS  and  NTU,  which  offer research  scholarships  leading  to

Master's  and  PhD  degrees.  This option  is  best  suited  for

graduates  with an interest to pursue a career in  research  and

development, especially in the areas of science and engineering.

NUS and NTU will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>

continue to offer more research scholarships so long as there is

a demand by interested and qualified graduates.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Yesterday, we heard that the hotels will be

given  higher  tax rebates or tax concessions for  refurbishing.

In  similar  light,  would  the  Minister  consider  that  fresh

graduates from polytechnics and universities might usefully  use

this slowdown to upgrade their own skills and would the Minister

consider increasing loans or tax concessions to assist them?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> As the Nominated MP has put it,

the scheme will be quite complicated because what constitutes  a

worthwhile  programme  will  be hard  to  define.   But  if  the

Nominated  MP  has got a scheme which is well-defined,  we  will

certainly consider it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Would the Minister consider that for those

in  the  polytechnics  and  universities  a  further  degree  or

professional degree would be a scheme worth considering?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> If it is a postgraduate effort

which  is  sponsored by a university, then, as I  said  earlier,

scholarships  are available.  But if it is something  for  self-improvement, it is very difficult to distinguish between, say, a

toastmaster  course  to improve your public  presentation  or  a

course  to  improve your second language skills or a  course  to

improve  your  professional standing.  Inherent in  the  subject

that Mr Simon Tay has raised is the great difficulty in defining

what  constitutes a worthwhile programme, and we do  not  really

want this to be a tax loophole.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Given that the hotels themselves do have

approved  refurbishment,  is  the principle  not  the  same  for

studies?   And leaving aside toastmaster courses, would  courses

by  recognised universities or other institutes here and  abroad

not be worthwhile projects?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> In theory, yes. But, in

practice, it is very difficult to define such worthwhile courses

and  to  police it in a way which makes the system fair and  not

open to abuse.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Waiting list and incentives to shift over to</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>purchase private condominiums)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for National

Development (a) how many applicants are on the waiting  list  to

buy a Housing and Development Board (HDB) executive flat and how

much  time and Government subsidies will be required by the  HDB

to  meet  this  housing demand; (b) how many of such  applicants

have  shifted to the purchase of Executive Condominiums  instead

and  how  quickly  can the Government meet  the  demand  of  all

applicants;  and  (c)  whether  the  Government  will   consider

providing  incentives  for  applicants  to  shift  over  to  the

purchase of private condominiums since many private condominiums

are  now  offered  for  sale at prices comparable  to  Executive

Condominiums,  thereby  reducing HDB's  burden  of  meeting  the

public housing demand.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b>

As  at  31st  May  1998,  there were 12,600  applicants  on  the

Registration  For  Flat  (RFS) queue for  Executive  flats.  HDB

stopped  receiving applications for Executive flats with  effect

from 21st August 1995 when the Executive Condominium (EC) Scheme

was  introduced.  Based on the current Building  Programme,  HDB

will  take  about  two  years to clear  the  applicants  on  the

Executive  flat queue.  For the new Executive flats offered  for

sale  in  the second quarter of 1998, the average market subsidy

(ie,  the difference between the assessed market value  and  the

HDB selling prices) is about $65,000 per unit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on their registration numbers, applicants on the

Executive  Flat queue were referred to buy EC in the various  EC

projects when they were launched.  Other applicants on  the  HDB

queue  can  also  buy EC flats under the open category  if  they

satisfy  the  eligibility  conditions.  All  applicants  on  the

Executive  Flat queue have been given the opportunity to  switch

to  ECs.   Based on HDB records, about 2,200 applicants  on  the

Executive Flat queue have booked ECs.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay has suggested that the Government consider giving

incentives  to encourage applicants to buy private condominiums.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, private condominiums, Executive  Condominiums

and  HDB  Executive  flats are different  products  catering  to

different  groups of home purchasers.  It is really  up  to  the

purchaser  to  weigh the terms and conditions  and  the  selling

prices of the three housing options to make their choices. There

is no need for the Government to intervene or provide additional

incentives to encourage applicants to buy private apartments  or

condominiums.  There is also no need to reduce HDB's  burden  in

meeting  the  public housing demand.  ECs are built  by  private

developers and HDB is very happy to build flats for those on its

queue.

turmoil;  and (ii) lowering the parking charges for  the  under-utilised URA heavy vehicle parking lots located outside of 3  km

of  housing estates to improve the poor demand for such  parking

lots.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me explain the

situation.   First, there is a big difference in season  parking

charges for heavy vehicle parks.  The HDB and URA charge between

$60  and  $120  per  month.   In  comparison,  the  charges  for

equivalent private heavy vehicle parks are between $160 and $180

per  month.      Second,  there is also a big  mismatch  in  the

supply  and  demand.  There is currently very strong demand  for

heavy vehicle lots within 3 km of housing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>

estates.   URA manages some 4,300 of such lots within  3  km  of

housing  estates,  but  has  a  waiting  list  of  nearly  2,500

applicants.   In  contrast, there are some 6,000  heavy  vehicle

lots  outside  the  3 km radius operated by the  private  sector

which  are  not  taken  up.  So there is a  need  to  make  some

adjustments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With effect from 1st July 1998, the season parking charges

for  public heavy vehicle  parks within 3 km of housing  estates

will  be  revised to between $65 and $130, an increase  of  only

between  $5  and $10. This is the first revision in nine  years.

This  revision is necessary to meet these two mismatches,  as  I

have explained earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay also asked whether the URA can lower the parking

charges  for  under-utilised  URA  heavy  vehicle  parking  lots

outside  the  3  km  radius.   There  is,  in  fact,  no  under-utilisation of URA heavy vehicle lots outside the 3  km  radius.

Out  of  the  6,000 heavy vehicle lots outside this radius  that

are  not taken up, only 77 are URA lots.  So URA pricing  is  at

the right level.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, would the Minister

explain  how  does the increase in season parking charges  solve

the problem of mismatch?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> If we have 4,000 lots and there are

another 2,500 on the waiting list, obviously, the price  is  too

low  for  the lots within 3 km of the housing estates.   At  the

same  time,  there are 6,000 lots outside the 3 km radius  which

are  under-utilised.  So we have to adjust the prices of the URA

lots  nearer town and we hope the private sector will lower  the

charges of the lots outside the 3 km radius.  Then there will be

a better matching of supply and demand.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the mismatch may not necessarily

be  due  to  price factors but due to the location of the  heavy

vehicle  parks, because it would be more convenient for  vehicle

owners or drivers to park their vehicles near their homes, which

are normally in the HDB estates.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Obviously, being nearer the housing

estates is more convenient and therefore a person should  pay  a

higher  price  for  that convenience.   So,  today,  we  have  a

situation  where if a driver is lucky to get a lot  in  the  URA

heavy  vehicle parks within 3 km of housing estates, he  pays  a

lower  price.   And those who cannot get a lot  will  just  wait

forever for a lot.  If a person is unlucky to get a lot, then he

pays  a higher price further away from his housing estate.  This

is not a sensible way to run heavy vehicle parks.  So we need to

make the adjustment - URA to raise its charges a little and  the

private sector to lower their charges a little.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Does the Minister not think that to

solve  the  problem  of heavy vehicle parks  and  also  for  the

convenience of the drivers, the answer should be to  build  more

heavy  vehicle parks near HDB estates, rather than  raising  the

price?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> We do build heavy vehicle lots but there

is a premium on land within the housing estates.  And this is  a

historical  situation where drivers of heavy vehicles  have  got

used  to the convenience of driving their heavy vehicles  within

the  housing  estates and sometimes park in the private  housing

estates next to the HDB estates.  As Members will remember  some

7-8  years  ago,  we  made it mandatory  for  them  to  park  in

designated lots and not park illegally along public roads.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an anomaly. If one is a driver of a tour bus, he

is  not  allowed  to bring his tour bus to his  housing  estate.

There are designated parking lots for tour buses.  Similarly, if

a  person  is a driver of an SBS or TIBS bus, he does not  drive

his  bus to his housing estate.  But for heavy vehicles, we have

this historical practice and therefore we are slowly moving away

from this practice, and requiring the heavy vehicle  drivers  to

park  their  heavy  vehicles either in the  factory  or  in  the

industrial  estate where their vehicles are operating  and  then

take public transport back to their homes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I understand

that many lorry drivers work in shifts and they sometimes finish

work  very late.  Usually, they carry a bicycle at the  back  of

their  lorries  so that they can cycle home.  Can  the  Minister

look  into  the issue of how to improve the transportation  from

the  heavy  vehicle parks to the HDB estates?   I  believe  that

people  choose the nearby heavy vehicle parks because  they  can

ride  their bikes to their homes.  If it is more than 5  km,  it

probably takes an hour to ride the bike home.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Chuang is right. We are beginning to

see  more and more lorry drivers installing bikes on their heavy

vehicles, especially on a prime mover, and this makes a  lot  of

sense.  If a driver is operating on a late night shift, he parks

in the industrial estate nearest his home and he cycles home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is no way that we can meet the demand for a

lorry  driver  to have his lorry parked next to  his  home.   It

causes a lot of inconvenience.  They start up their vehicles  at

5  am  and they disturb the estate.  So we have to have properly

designated  heavy vehicle lots, both within our housing  estates

as  well  as  outside the housing estates, and  let  the  market

pricing  mechanism  settle  the preferences  of  individuals  on

wherever they want to park.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, does the Minister agree that it is

for  the Ministry's convenience to settle the issue and to solve

the  problem  of heavy vehicle parking lots by just raising  the

season  parking charges on the pretext that there is a  mismatch

rather  than solving the problem by building more season parking

parks  within 3 km of HDB estates?  I am not talking of building

it in the heart of HDB estates.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Obviously, Mr Low does not walk around

his  housing  estate.  When he says within 3 km, he  is  talking

about  right in the middle of his housing estate.   Most  of  us

have  constituencies where heavy vehicle parks  are  within  our

housing estates, and it is not possible to find more and more of

such places.  This is premium space and we have 2,500 on the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>

waiting  list.  There is no way that they are going to  get  the

lots.   So  the guy who has got a lot, he is enjoying a premium.

We have to make the adjustment.  It has been nine years since we

raised  the  fees.  Our costs of operating these  heavy  vehicle

parks  have gone up and we are making a small adjustment up  and

we  are  hoping  the  private sector  will  also  make  a  small

adjustment  down,  and  then the market  can  work  its  way  to

allocate the supply and demand appropriately.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Has the Minister considered building

multi-storey heavy vehicle parks?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> In which case, the charges would double.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE GENERAL HOSPITAL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Calculation of B2 ward fee)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J B Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr J B Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Health whether

he  will  explain how the full cost of $142.00 for a day's  ward

fee   for  B2  wards  in  the  Singapore  General  Hospital   is

calculated.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir, the

figure  of  $142  quoted  by Mr Jeyaretnam  is  the  daily  cost

incurred by SGH in 1993 to provide the basic ward facilities and

services  for each B2 patient.  The salary cost of ward  nurses,

health  attendants and support staff makes up about 60%  of  the

cost.  Ward equipment, facilities, and general services such  as

linen  and food constitute another 20%.  The remaining 20%  goes

towards  general overheads which include hospital administration

and maintenance of common areas and equipment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, B2 patients do not pay the full ward cost of $142

at  the SGH.  Because of heavy Government subsidies, they pay  a

daily  ward fee of only $50.  This ward fee of $50 has  remained

unchanged since 1993.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I assure the Minister

that  I  am well aware that the patient does not pay that amount

every  day.  Would the Minister agree that the whole purpose  of

showing the full cost in the bill rendered to the patient is  to

show that the Government is subsidising

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>

the  treatment?  What I had hoped to get from the  Minister  was

not  in percentage terms but actual breakdown of how is it  that

it  costs the Government $142 to maintain a single bed in a ward

consisting, I am told, of six beds every day.  How does it  cost

the Government $142?  May we have actual figures?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, obviously, Mr Jeyaretnam does not

understand operational costs and how they are allocated.  I will

give  him  the figures and I hope the figures do not boggle  his

mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, indirect manpower costs include the salaries of staff

working  in  the  support departments which are not  within  the

ward,  because the daily cost is not the cost of just supporting

the  six beds in the ward.  There are a lot of other costs  that

are necessary to support those six patients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, indirect salary cost, the support staff including

staff  supporting the facilities, plant and engineering, medical

records,  infection  control which is very  important;  we  have

staff checking the infection level to make sure that patients go

in   and   do  not  get  infected  by  other  people;   hospital

administration, all these come to $43 per patient  day.   Direct

salary  of  nurses and health attendants within the  ward,  this

comes  to  $40  per day.  Depreciation and temporary  occupation

licence  fee comes to $18 per day.  Food services, $7.   Laundry

and  linen, this comes to $4.50 a day.  Overhead costs comes  to

$29  per  day.   Overhead  costs would be  things  like  patient

billing, medical records, maintenance, security, maintenance  of

the  common areas, because the hospital does not just constitute

that  room  where the patient is in, but a lot of  other  common

areas.   So  all  these costs amount to $29.  As a  result,  the

total daily cost to look after one patient in the B2 wards comes

to $142.50.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister talks of

supporting  services  and records.  Are we  to  understand  that

these  supporting services are not only for the six beds in  the

B2  ward but are for all the patients in the hospital?  This  is

what I would like to know from the Minister,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>

ie, precise figures as to what is the total cost, the number  of

patients  in the hospital on any particular day, and how  is  it

divided.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> I would suggest that Mr Jeyaretnam get a

copy  of the SGH Annual Report where all those figures are there

for  his  examination.  After he has studied the Annual  Report,

and  if  there are any other further questions, I will  be  very

happy  to  answer them for him.  For me to try to give  all  the

data here would take days.  SGH has a workforce of almost 5,000,

divided into hundreds of categories.  Does he mean that he wants

me  to give him the precise cost per category, the precise  cost

of  each employee, how the cost is being allocated to the A, B1,

B2  and  class  C patients?  Please take a look  at  the  public

documents  which are available.  And if he does  not  understand

after  that, I am sure he can get one of his accountant  friends

to explain to him.  After that, if he still does not understand,

I will be very happy to explain to him.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I know from the Minister what are these

overhead  costs?   I  thought he had already  detailed  all  the

costs.   Now we have got an overhead cost, and we have also  got

depreciation cost.  Depreciation of what?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, it costs about $300 million to

build  a medium size hospital, let alone a hospital the size  of

Singapore  General Hospital.  If he understands  anything  about

accounts, he will realise that equipment which you purchase have

to  be depreciated.  That is what the depreciation costs are all

about.   After  you have depreciated all these  facilities,  you

allocate that cost to A, B1, B2 and Class C patients.  There are

certain  formulae which are adopted on cost allocations.   As  I

said,  we  have the manpower costs, which amount to 60%  of  the

total cost.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May we have the rough figures of manpower

employed and their wages.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> If Mr Jeyaretnam would like to file a

specific  question, I would be very happy to give them  to  him.

This is because the cost data of SGH

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>

comes  to  a  good sized booklet and I do not think I  would  be

doing  Members  here any favour by spending the whole  one  hour

just reading through the cost accounting records of SGH.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Well, you could hand it out.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Would the Minister explain the

principle of allocation of costs to the various classes of wards

in  terms  of indirect manpower cost, depreciation and  overhead

costs?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> As I have just mentioned to Mr

Jeyaretnam,  there are various formulae which are adopted.   The

formula  varies from category to category.  For example,  direct

labour.  Direct labour is a direct costing, ie, if that ward has

an  average of, let us say, 20 nurses, then the cost of those 20

nurses  will  be  fully accounted for by that ward.   There  are

other  things  which  are indirect.  For  example,  the  Medical

Records Office.  How is that cost allocated to A, B1, B2 and  C?

Because the Medical Records Office serves every patient,  it  is

allocated in proportion to the number of patient days.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the common areas, the maintenance cost of the common

areas would be allocated in terms of the actual area occupied by

the  B2  ward.  There are certain things which are allocated  in

terms  of the area occupied by the B2 wards.  Certain costs  are

allocated  in  terms  of  patient usage and  certain  costs  are

allocated  based  on  the  intensity  of  care.   So  there  are

different formulae that apply to each of the cost factors.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Is the Minister satisfied that the

formula  so  far  that  has been adopted is  fair  to  the  cost

allocation of lower class wards such as C class and B2?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, all these cost allocation formulae

have  been  arrived  at after much discussion with  professional

auditors and cost accountants and we stand guided by them.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would the Minister tell us how many nurses

and  sisters are allocated to one B2 ward or do they serve other

B2 wards as well in the vicinity?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the nurses are normally direct

costs, ie, the B2 wards will have perhaps 50 patients.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> B2 wards have only 6 patients per ward.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> You are talking of per room. But the

whole  ward may have 50 beds or, in that case, maybe 54 beds  or

48  beds.  I  do  not know what is the full complement  of  ward

nurses.  As I said, there are 5,000 over staff in SGH, and I  am

not  a walking encyclopedia.  It is not my job to know the exact

figures anyway, unless Mr Jeyaretnam specifically asks for them.

Taking a figure out of the air, if that ward has a complement of

50  nurses, then the cost of those 50 nurses would be divided by

48  beds or 54 beds, and that becomes a direct cost.  There  are

other  costs which, as I have said just now, are indirect costs.

For example, the Medical Records Office.  There, they have maybe

20  staff.   Then  the salary cost of those  20  staff  will  be

allocated  over  all  the hospital beds.  This  is  because  the

assumption is that each patient, whether he is in B1,  B2  or  C

class,  has the same access requirements to the Medical  Records

Office. Therefore, they are what we call "allocated costs".

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, would you like to ask your next

question?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 12 of the Constitution guarantees all persons

equality  before the law and equal protection of  the  law.  Any

recourse to the Courts, either by bringing an action against the

Government or by way of defence to a prosecution.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I again assure the Minister of State

that  I  am  only too well aware of what is in the Constitution.

Does the Minister of State agree that it is one thing to have an

Article  in the Constitution, it is another to provide a  cheap,

quick  remedy  for  those who consider their  rights  have  been

denied or violated?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Once again, the NCMP brings up an

old  issue.  This point has been raised in this House before  by

PAP  MPs, Mr Davinder Singh and Mr Shanmugam, in 1990, 1992  and

1994  and we furnished a full reply.  There are means, in  fact,

free  means,  by  which an aggrieved person who feels  that  his

rights  have  been  violated,  or  that  he  has  been  unfairly

discriminated, can seek recourse.  For example, he can seek  the

help of his Member of Parliament at the meet-the-people session.

And  indeed  those of us who hold meet-the-people sessions  will

know  that aggrieved citizens do come to see us and we write  in

on  their  behalf  to the relevant ministries  and  departments.

Those  of us who are on this side of the House, who handle these

appeals, can tell everyone here that we take these appeals  very

seriously.  We consider and send them to the departments to  get

their inputs to see whether there is a need to follow up.  There

is  no  reason for us not to take them seriously.  If  there  is

indeed some wrongdoing, or some wrong to be put right, there  is

every reason for us to do that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Will the Minister of State tell us to what

court  does  a  person who is aggrieved go to if  his  right  is

denied or violated?  Does he go to the Magistrate's Court?  Does

he  go  to  the District Court?  Or does he have to  go  to  the

Constitutional Court?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Surely, the NCMP must know, as a

lawyer of so many years' standing - I do not know whether he  is

in  active practice now - that there is this branch of  the  law

called  "administrative  law" where  he  can  take  out  various

administrative orders, whether it is certiorari -  to  quash  an

executive action, or mandamus - to get the executive to act in a

certain way, or habeas corpus, if you want somebody to be freed.

All  these  are in the law books.  Indeed, Mr Simon  Tay,  quite

recently  in this House, did say that the courts have  acted  in

this role to review executive actions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Does the Minister of State say that you can

go  to the Magistrate's Court for a certiorari?  Do you not have

to  go  to  the  High  Court and if it  is  an  Article  of  the

Constitution, do you not have to go to the Constitutional Court?

And at what cost to the poor man who is left without any rights?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I think we have talked about

this  before in this House.  If an aggrieved person  who  is   a

Singaporean feels that he has to test his constitutional  rights

in  court, he will take out an action in the High Court invoking

administrative law.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Minister  of  State whether there has been any  crying  need  by

either  the Law  Society or any professional group such  as  the

Singapore Women Lawyers' Association or other lawyers to set  up

a  similar  body like the Board of Equal Rights?   I  think  the

House will probably be interested to know.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, there has been no such

call.   But I take it that it is the NCMP's pet topic.  He  will

come  to  this  House  and ask for the  setting  up  of  boards,

committees and commissions of inquiry out of the blue.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is the Minister of State aware that a number

of countries have such bodies which deal effectively and cheaply

other  Scandinavian countries and New Zealand have  adopted  it.

But,  as  we have mentioned in this House before, every  society

must  determine  the way in which its laws and legal  mechanisms

operate.  Other countries, unlike Singapore, do not have so many

feedback channels such as the SIU, meet-the-people sessions, or,

for  that  matter,  NMPs  and NCMPs,  who  can  bring  up  their

constituents' grievances in this House.

problem  and encounrage companies to take the necessary  actions

beforehand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Government agencies have been directed to complete the

conversion of their affected systems by the end of this year  to

allow a clear one-year lead time for further testing before  the

turn  of the century. To-date, about 40% of the conversion  work

has  been completed.  Most Government agencies will be  able  to

meet the end-1998 deadline.

.    In general, our private sector is aware of the Y2K problem.

However, survey results indicate that there are still many

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>

companies, and even specific sectors, which are uncertain of the

impact of Y2K on their operations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Computer Board (NCB) conducted an IT Manpower

and  Skills Inventory Survey in October last year.  A  total  of

269   companies   responded.   About  122  companies   (45%   of

respondents) stated that the Y2K problem was of concern to them.

Of  these  122  respondents, 54% were already in  the  planning,

budgeting and impact analysis stages of tackling the problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another survey conducted by the Singapore Federation of

the  Computer Industry (SFCI) in February 1998, 64% of  the  347

respondent organisations indicated that they are affected by the

Y2K  problem.   Another 25% indicated that they are  unaffected,

while the remaining 11% said that they are not sure.  The survey

also  found  that  finance companies, public  organisations  and

larger  institutions  are the most affected  while  construction

companies and smaller companies appear to be the most unsure  of

the impact of this problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help push for early resolution of the problem, NCB has

requested  all  Government agencies to closely monitor  the  key

infrastructure companies under their supervision.  For  example,

the Telecommunication Authority of Singapore (TAS) has to ensure

that all the telecommunications operators, like SingTel, M1, are

Y2K-ready.  Similarly, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)

has  issued guidelines to all financial institutions  to  review

their  computer systems and to complete their Y2K conversion  by

end of this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the launch of the Y2K Conversion Campaign in November

1996, NCB has been working with the various Government agencies,

trade associations and professional bodies to organise seminars,

conferences  and exhibitions.  These serve to promote  awareness

of  the Y2K problem, especially among the small and medium-sized

enterprises  (SMEs).   For  example,  there  are  bi-monthly  IT

Awareness  Briefings  for SMEs.  Further awareness  of  the  Y2K

problem is also built up

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>

through  press coverage on television, radio and  in  print,  in

particular,  the Chinese-language media.  The recent  television

series  "Singapore at Work" contained a segment on  this  issue.

NCB   has  also  set  up  a  Y2K  web  site  to  provide  useful

information, and to provide an avenue for the public to  discuss

issues, to share experiences and to seek help.

.     Apart  from  increasing awareness of the Y2K problem,  the

Government  is also providing SMEs with financial assistance  to

tackle  the  problem.   SMEs can tap  on  the  Local  Enterprise

Computerisation Programme (LECP) grant to help them defray up to

70%  of  the  cost  of consultancy services to  tackle  the  Y2K

problem.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like to ask the Minister whether our Public Utilities Board will

ensure  that  the Y2000 problem does not impair  the  supply  of

power  to  Singapore.   This is an area  of  concern  which  the

American  utilities authorities have recently surfaced and  they

have expressed concern in this particular area.

<div align="center"><b>REFUSAL TO ENLIST FOR SERVICE IN THE ARMED FORCES</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Reasons for sending persons to prison)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister and

Minister for Defence what are the reasons for sending persons to

prison  for  refusing to enlist for service in the armed  forces

because of their religious convictions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Defence (Mr Matthias Yao Chih)</b>

<b>(for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  under the Enlistment Act, every  male  Singapore

Citizen  and  Permanent  Resident is required  to  register  and

enlist  for  National  Service on reaching the  stipulated  age.

Under  the  Singapore Armed Forces Act, all  enlisted  personnel

must  obey  and carry out lawful orders given by their superiors

in  the  SAF.   There are no provisions in these  two  Acts  for

anyone  to  exempt  himself from the requirements  for  whatever

reason.  A

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>

person who fails to enlist or, as an enlisted personnel, refuses

to  comply  with any lawful order is guilty of an  offence.   He

will be charged and punished accordingly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, National Service is vital to the security of a small

country  like  Singapore.  Whereas some  States  may  choose  to

establish  a standing army, for a small country like  Singapore,

compulsory  military  service is the only  way  to  build  up  a

credible national defence force.  Our citizens must be ready and

prepared to defend the country.  There is no other alternative.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Service works in Singapore because of its

universality.    For   this  reason,  all   male   Singaporeans,

regardless  of  race  or religion, are required  by  law  to  do

National  Service  to defend our country.  All Singaporeans  are

treated  equally  before  the law.   No  Singaporean  should  be

allowed  to  cite any reason to exempt himself  from  having  to

contribute  to the national defence effort as every  Singaporean

benefits from the peace and security which National Service  has

helped  to  ensure.   Singapore cannot make exceptions  for  any

group  as  that  would undermine the whole system  of  universal

national service.  It would also be unfair to those who do their

part to defend our country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Service is an issue that is subject to the laws of

the  state.  No group, religious or whatever, should be  allowed

to  advocate  the breaking of our national laws.   Allowing  any

group,  for  whatever  reasons, to be excluded  from  compulsory

military  service  would  compromise  the  universality  of  the

application  of  the law.  It is a simple question  of  equality

before the law for all Singaporeans.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure the Minister of

State  is aware of the Article in the Constitution which secures

for  every  citizen freedom of worship, and freedom  of  worship

means freedom to profess and practise his own religion.  And  if

his religion forbids ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, can you ask your

question?  No speeches, please.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Yes. My question is: if his religion

forbids  taking  up  arms,  is  it  not  a  violation   of   the

Constitution  to force him to do so and to punish  him  for  not

doing so?

<br><br><!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam knows the

Constitution better than I.  Yes, I am aware of this  particular

Article.  Article 15, subsection (1) says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Every person has the right to profess and practise his

religion and to propagate it.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (4) says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This Article does not authorise any act contrary to any

general   law  relating  to  public  order,  public  health   or

morality.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, refusing to do National Service, which is required by

law,  is disruptive of the national ethos and it is a matter  of

public interest and relating to public order.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is it not possible for the Government to

put  them  to  some  other work, as is done in other  countries,

where conscientious objectors are put down to do community work?

<br><br><!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Sir, National Service is a question

of  national defence and the defence of Singapore's sovereignty.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay</b> asked the Minister for Foreign

Affairs  what  steps Singapore has taken as part  of  the  ASEAN

effort to assist free and fair elections in Cambodia.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr

Speaker,   Sir,   the   United  Nations   is   coordinating   an

international   team   of  observers,   known   as   the   Joint

International Observer Group (JIOG), to observe the elections in

Cambodia.  ASEAN has agreed to join the JIOG.  As part  of  this

ASEAN effort, Singapore will be sending eight officers from  the

Singapore  Police Force to serve as electoral observers  in  the

JIOG in Cambodia.  Our observers will be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>

deployed  in Cambodia from 19th-30th July 1998.  The  JIOG  will

observe  the  electoral process in Cambodia and is  expected  to

announce  the  results of its observations at  the  end  of  the

electoral process.  Therefore, in an answer to his question, our

decision  to send observers to be part of the JIOG reflects  our

willingness to assist Cambodia in its efforts to hold  free  and

fair elections.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> May I ask the Minister how the figure of

eight  compares to Singapore's contribution to the last election

in 1993?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> The last election in 1993 was different

because  what  was needed was election monitors and  also  other

category  of support staff.  Here, what was expressly  requested

by  the  United Nations team were election observers in  certain

parts of the country.  And after consultation between the United

Nations  and  ASEAN,  ASEAN decided  to  send  eight  from  each

country,  but there will also be electoral observers  from  many

other countries.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister, now that Singapore

is  sending  observers,  would  his  Government  agree  to  have

observers in Singapore observing Singapore's elections?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Singapore is an open society. Anyone can

visit Singapore during the hustings and the campaign period  and

observe  and  follow Mr Jeyaretnam all over  Singapore  and  any

other candidate, and there is no bar to that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> While I understand the wish for Singapore to

take  part in the UN process, would the Minister not agree  that

since  Cambodia's  membership  in  ASEAN  will  trigger  on  the

elections,  thus  ASEAN  and Singapore should  actually  take  a

larger  role  in  this beyond provision of eight officers,  like

what we did in 1993?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Whether eight, 10, 20 is not a critical

point.   If  the numbers who collectively make up for  the  JIOG

effort  are  insufficient, I am sure  the  United  Nations  will

indicate to the member countries.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> If I may direct my question in more detail.

Given  that  the question of Cambodia's membership in  ASEAN  is

important to ASEAN, should we be leaving it to the UN to dictate

how  many people we should send rather than to actually increase

our  numbers ourselves?  In this connection, given that we  have

committed  a 100-man peacekeeping force, should 100 not  be  the

kind of number we are thinking about, rather than 8, 20 or 30?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think that the

central  issue  is numbers.  The central issue is whether  there

are  sufficient  numbers of observers for the  JIOG  to  make  a

reasonable assessment of whether the process of the elections in

Cambodia  was  free and fair.  If the total number of  observers

that  collectively  have  come from ASEAN  and  the  friends  of

Cambodia, or EU and other participants, would enable the JIOG to

come  to  a fair and considered assessment, that should  be  the

main criterion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Tay, would you like to ask your next

question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> May I ask one last question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right.

that elections ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Tay, can you get to your question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Does the Minister have an opinion on the

view  of  NGOs that free and fair elections are not possible  in

Cambodia, given the suppression by certain forces?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would not like to

speculate  at  this  stage and pre-judge whether  the  elections

which will be held will indeed be free and fair.  I think it  is

best  to  let  the  elections proceed.   Let  the  international

observers  who  will be there observe, and at  the  end  of  the

process, let them come to a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>

considered conclusion whether the elections were free and  fair.

I  am  aware of the many comments made by different parties that

the run-up to the elections has given rise to concerns.  Indeed,

the  ASEAN troika, as well as the friends of Cambodia,  recently

have expressed concerns that the atmosphere must be neutral  and

I  agree with their view.

<div align="center"><b>COMPUTER MISUSE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a second

time."

<br><br><i>Introduction</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the implementation of the IT2000 Master Plan

formulated by the National Computer Board in 1991, Singapore  is

rapidly being transformed into an "Intelligent Island". The uses

of  information technology have become pervasive in every aspect

of  a  society - at work, at home and even when we play. Indeed,

the  reliance on computers in areas such as government, business

and  public  services has increased significantly  in  Singapore

over the past few years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increased use of computers has given Singaporeans a

wide  range of communication means and access to services.  With

the increased use of computers in work and at home, Singaporeans

have  been  able  to  tap into a wide network of  electronically

stored  information  and  services on  the  Internet.  This  has

increased their productivity at work and enhanced their personal

and  social lives.  For example, increasingly, people have  been

able to handle transactions with government agencies or private

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>

businesses   electronically.   This   includes   paying   bills,

submitting applications, booking tickets for sports and cultural

events,  communicating  with  friends  and  shopping.   In   the

business  arena,  transactions are also  increasingly  done  via

electronic means, eg, various banks have already commenced  some

banking   transactions  through  the  Internet.   The  pace   of

expansion of usage of computers is phenomenal over the past  few

years and this pace is likely to speed up in the years to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With greater use of computers at home and at work, not only

have  the number of computer related crime cases risen, but  the

level  of sophistication has likewise increased.  Computer crime

today  spans  a  wide  spectrum and computer  criminals  are  of

various  sorts and have different levels of technical  know-how.

Apart from this, another category of computer criminals are  the

hackers  who  break into computer systems to create mischief  or

make  illegal  gain.  CID has investigated cases where  students

hacked into local and overseas systems in the United States  and

Europe.   There  was a case involving a hacker who  hacked  into

local and overseas systems to obtain programmes for his Internet

Relay  Chat  channels and free Internet access  accounts.   This

hacker did not even pass his "O" level, so it does not mean that

only  those with higher education are good at computer  hacking.

Between  1993 and 1995, there were only three reported cases  of

computer  crime.  All were related to cloning of mobile  phones.

In  1996  alone, the number of reported cases increased  to  14.

More  significantly, these cases included two cases of  computer

hacking  and  four cases of unauthorised access.  In  1997,  the

number  of cases rose to 39.  In the first five months  of  this

year,  25 cases have already been reported.  There may be  other

cases that were unreported.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in the number of computer crimes and the

serious  implications of these offences necessitate a review  of

the  Computer Misuse Act.  Computer crime can be as  serious  as

traditional crimes.  For example, CID had investigated

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>

a  case  in  1997  where a technician at Motorola  accessed  the

company's  human  resource  system,  adjusted  the  data   base,

resulting  in him getting extra money or salary for a period  of

about  two  years.  He also amended the salary data relating  to

his  fiancee  resulting  in  her  getting  more  pay  and  other

remuneration.   In such crimes involving fraud  and  dishonesty,

the  culprits were usually employees of the victim companies who

were  entrusted with computer access or were able to access  the

computer  systems  due  to poor security  practices  or  through

illegal means.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increasing use of computers for various purposes in

Singapore  would mean that this rising trend in computer  crimes

would  continue.  It is therefore necessary and timely to update

the  Computer  Misuse  Act (CMA) to deal  with  an  increasingly

complex environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, crimes committed through the electronic medium

and  through use of computers are difficult to detect  but  they

are  just  as serious as traditional crimes and we must  equally

protect  our  population against such crimes.   To  ensure  that

Singapore   remains  an  attractive  place  for  investors   and

businesses to operate effectively and securely, computer  crimes

must  be  treated as seriously as other criminal offences.   The

proposed Bill therefore addresses three areas:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Enhanced security. Firstly, it strengthens the

legislative  framework to ensure that the use of  computers  and

conduct of E-commerce are made more secure.  It will ensure that

the  law  is  adequate to cover the various types  of  computer-related offences which have emerged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Stronger deterrence. It aims to enhance the deterrent

effect  of  the  penalties for computer  crimes.   The  proposed

penalties  will also be proportionate to the damage caused,  and

distinguish between first time and repeat offenders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Up-to-date enforcement powers. It will give Police up-to-date powers of investigation and evidence gathering to deal

with complex computer crimes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Enhanced Computer Security for `Protected Computers'</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like other countries, Singapore has become more

reliant  on computers over the years.  This reliance is apparent

in various essential public and private services.  For instance,

computer systems are used in the provision of essential  day-to-day  services  such as telecommunications, public utilities  and

transportation.  The telephone, mobile telephone and the  paging

networks  which we take for granted in our daily  life  rely  on

computer  systems to operate.  Our land and air traffic  control

systems and the road traffic light control systems which  ensure

smooth  transportation are examples of systems using  computers.

Even  our  water treatment system to ensure that  our  water  is

potable  depends  on a computerised process.   In  the  business

sector,  banking services are also highly computerised -  cheque

clearance,  money transfers and fund management are areas  which

depend  on  computer systems.  Other areas where  computers  are

widely  used are in the military and security-related activities

and  in  the  provision of emergency services (such as  medical,

police and civil defence).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The integrity of these systems must be safeguarded to

ensure  that  essential services do not  become  the  target  of

computer  crimes.  Such crimes, if perpetrated,  could  lead  to

major disruption and financial loss to the economy or even  loss

of  life.  For  example,  if  a perpetrator  overcomes  security

measures,    accesses    and   alters    programmes    in    the

telecommunication computer systems causing the telephone network

to crash, this would create major social and economic disruption

to  the country.  Another example, if a perpetrator accesses the

emergency call handling system of the Police or of the Singapore

Civil  Defence  Force  and  modifies  the  programme  to  create

problems  in receiving and dispatching resources, then  it  will

cause  delay  in response which may result in loss of  lives  or

property.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry therefore proposes that the Act be amended to

protect these computer systems.  Clause 7 introduces a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>

new  section 6C to enhance the penalties for offences  committed

against   "protected  computers".   "Protected  computers"   are

defined  as  those  systems  used in  connection  with  national

security,  banking  and  finance, emergency  services  (such  as

police  and  ambulance services), and essential public  services

(such  as  public utilities, telecommunications,  communications

and transport).  The punishment under this section is comparable

to  provisions under present legislation dealing with  criminals

committing   offences  against  the  State,   serious   mischief

offences,  and  serious bodily harm cases.  In this  information

age,  crimes against `protected computers' could have  the  same

detrimental  effect  on national  security,  public  safety  and

integrity  of the economic system.  The Amendment Bill therefore

proposes  that  offences  committed on  "protected  systems"  or

"protected computers" be liable to enhanced penalties of  up  to

$100,000 or imprisonment of up to 20 years.

<br><br><i>Differentiating Penalties for First and Repeat Offenders/Graduating Penalties according to Severity</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry also proposes to make a differentiation in

the  penalties  imposed  on  first  time  offenders  and  repeat

offenders. Currently, there are three basic offences in the CMA,

namely:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) An offence of unauthorised access under section 3;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) An offence of unauthorised modification to computer

material,  such as introducing computer virus, under section  5;

and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) An offence of unauthorised use or interception of

computer services, such as phone cloning offences, under section 6.



The existing punishment for these three offences is a fine of up

to $2,000 or imprisonment of up to two years or both.  Where the

offence causes a loss of above $10,000, the punishment is a fine

of up to $20,000 or imprisonment of up to five years or both.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enhance the deterrent effect of the law as well as

ensure  that  repeat  offenders are treated more  severely  than

first  offenders,  clauses 3, 5 and 6 of  the  Bill  propose  to

enhance  the  penalties, and to differentiate the penalties  for

first and repeat offenders.  Clauses 3, 5 and 6 also ensure that

the penalties are commensurate with the severity of the offence.

This  addresses a shortcoming in the current Act, where offences

under  section  3,  that  is, unauthorised  access  to  computer

material,  section  5,  that  is, unauthorised  modification  to

computer  material and section 6, that is, unauthorised  use  or

interception  of computer services attract the  same  degree  of

penalty,  even though the offences under sections 5  and  6  are

more severe than those under section 3.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offences committed under section 3(1) can be compared to

certain  offences in the physical world, eg, that of trespassing

into someone's garden or backyard instead of housebreaking. With

greater  use  of the Internet in our society, such offences  are

likely to increase, based on the experience of the United States

and other developed countries.  For example, a person surfing on

the  Internet  may  gain  access into someone's  web  server  or

personal  computer out of curiosity. The penalty for  the  first

offender is revised upwards from a fine of up to $2,000  or  two

years  imprisonment or both, to a fine of up to  $5,000  or  two

years  imprisonment or both.  The imprisonment term is  kept  at

two  years as this offence is  less severe compared to the other

offences in the CMA.  As repeat offenders under section 3(1)  of

the CMA should be dealt with more severely, they would also face

a  more severe penalty of a fine of up to $10,000 or three years

imprisonment or both.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalties under section 5(1) (unauthorised

modification)   and   section   6(1)   (unauthorised   use    or

interception)  will  also be increased to address  increases  in

such offences.  In 1997, there were about 25 such cases.  In the

first  five  months of this year, there were  already  23  cases

reported.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples of offences under section 6(1) are cloning of

mobile  phones/pagers  or  when a  person  uses  someone  else's

account  and  password to obtain free Internet usage.  Recently,

two  persons were charged in court for using illegally  obtained

Internet accounts not belonging to them to gain access into  the

Internet.    The  accused  persons  deceived  the  victim   into

revealing  to  them  her  password.  The amendment  proposes  to

increase  the  penalties considering the  consequences  and  the

losses  suffered by the victim.   Clauses 5(1) and 6(1)  propose

to raise the penalties for first time offenders from the current

fine of up to $2,000 or up to two years imprisonment or both, to

a  fine  of  up to $10,000 or up to three years imprisonment  or

both. Repeat offenders would face a fine of up to $20,000 or  up

to 5 years imprisonment or both.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3, 5 and 6 will also increase the penalties for

offences  under  sections 3(2), 5(2) and 6(2)  where  damage  is

caused,  to  a  fine not exceeding $50,000 or  imprisonment  not

exceeding  7  years or both.  The penalties for these  offences,

where  damage  is caused, can be compared with the more  serious

property  offences in the Penal Code such as criminal breach  of

trust where the penalties could extend to 7 years imprisonment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cite a case to illustrate the damage that could be

caused  by  such  an illegal act.  In 1996, in a case  involving

section  5(2), a systems administrator who was unhappy with  the

management  of  his company, inserted a Trojan  horse  programme

into  the  computer  system.  This programme would  replace  the

original system files with damaged files while backing-up of the

system was done.  He also timed the process to occur when he was

away  on  holiday.   As a result of this, the  company's  system

crashed  and  the entire production line came to  a  standstill.

After  his  dismissal,  he  called  a  production  operator  and

instructed  her  to  access the system on the  pretext  that  he

wanted  to  erase  his personal files.  The production  operator

followed  his instruction and a set of system files was deleted.

The  system  thus  crashed  for  a  second  time.   The  accused

eventually was

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>

charged  for  two  counts  under  section  5(2),  but  was  only

sentenced  to a maximum fine of $20,000, although the  company's

computer system and production were badly affected.

<br><br><i>Definition of Damage</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker Sir, there is also a need to recognise that the

impact  of computer crime goes beyond just financial terms.   It

is  necessary  to  widen the definition  of  "damage"  to  cover

damages  beyond financial loss.  Clause 2 of the Bill  therefore

proposes  to  widen the definition of "damage"  to  include  any

impairment  to  a computer or the integrity of data  or  program

that:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) causes loss aggregating at least $10,000 in value.

(This  is  the  estimated  cost of restoring  or  repairing  the

damaged   computer  system.   Economic  loss  such  as  business

opportunities forgone due to the downtime of the computer  could

be  considered if the prosecution could make out a case that the

loss  was  attributable  to the damage caused  to  the  computer

system);

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) modifies or impairs, or potentially modifies or

impairs,  the  medical diagnosis or treatment of persons.   (For

example,  this  could  involve hacking  into  a  medical  record

database  to change or falsify the diagnosis on medical records,

resulting in the wrong treatment being administered);

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) causes or threatens physical injury or death. (This

could   include   hacking  or  threatening  to   hack   into   a

pharmaceutical plant to change the composition of the  chemicals

used in the manufacturing of certain drugs); or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) threatens public health or safety. (This could involve

hacking into the public utilities systems).



<br><br><i>Addressing New Offences</i>

<br><br><i>Accessing computer with or without authorisation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, under section 4 of the current CMA, it is

an  offence for a person to access a computer without  authority

in  order  to commit a crime.  However, it is uncertain  whether

authorised users of a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>

computer who abuse their authority to access computers to commit

an offence are currently liable under the CMA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An example is the recent case involving Golden Village

Cinemas.   In  December 1996, the management of  Golden  Village

Cinemas reported a case of fraud involving usage of their  Smart

Cards.   Four  accused  persons  were  eventually  arrested   in

February  1997  in  connection with  the  case.   Investigations

revealed that they had exploited the weakness of Golden  Village

Cinema  computer and Smart Card system for monetary gains.   The

staff  who had authority to access the cinema cash card  top  up

computer system used it to top up the cash value of unused cards

for  subsequent  sale  and  covered  their  tracks  by  altering

computer records.  Although this offence was perpetrated through

the  use of a computer, the offenders were prosecuted under  the

Penal  Code  for  criminal  breach  of  trust  which  carried  a

punishment of fine or up to 7 years imprisonment, instead  of  a

fine  of up to $50,000 or imprisonment of up to 10 years if they

were to be prosecuted under the amended provisions of the CMA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To clarify this uncertainty, clause 4 of the Bill will

amend  section 4 to make it an offence for anyone  to  access  a

computer  to  commit a crime, regardless of whether  access  has

been  authorised.   The  punishment is retained  at  a  fine  of

$50,000 or imprisonment not more than 10 years or both, as it is

already sufficiently severe.

<br><br><i>Acts of Interference or Obstruction of Lawful Use of a Computer</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there is currently no law against acts of

interference  or  obstruction of lawful use  of  a  computer  or

impairment of the usefulness of a computer.  An example of  such

an  act  is E-mail bombing where enormous amounts of E-mail  are

sent  to a victim.  When the victim checks his mailbox for mail,

he  may  find  hundreds  of  them each  time.   The  process  of

downloading the mail would take a long time.  As the  subscriber

is  entitled  to  a  certain amount of memory  for  E-mail,  the

victim's  mailbox may crash.  Currently, Police could  not  take

further action on such cases as there is no law against such

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>

act.  Victims have to seek help from other organisations such as

the  Internet  Service Providers (ISPs) in order to  seek  civil

recourse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deter such acts, clause 7 will introduce a new section

6A to make it an offence for the unauthorised obstruction of use

of  a computer.  The proposed penalty is a fine of up to $10,000

or  imprisonment of up to 3 years or both for a first  offender,

and a fine of up to $20,000 or imprisonment of up to 5 years  or

both  for  repeat  offenders.  If damage  is  caused,  then  the

offender would face an enhanced penalty of up to $50,000 fine or

7 years imprisonment or both.

<br><br><i>Unauthorised Disclosure of Passwords or Access Codes</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 will also introduce a new section 6B to make it an

offence for unauthorised disclosure of passwords or other access

codes  by any person if he does so for any wrongful gain or  for

unlawful purpose or to cause wrongful loss.  It is possible  for

a  system administrator to sell passwords to unauthorised  users

to  enable  free access and usage.  Passwords and  other  access

codes  are also used to enhance computer security and such  acts

would  compromise  security.  The proposed  penalties  for  such

offences are similar to the penalties applicable to interference

or obstruction of lawful use of computer.

<br><br><i>Necessary Powers for Enforcement Agencies</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also amends the CMA to provide the Police with the

additional   powers  of  investigations.   In  the   course   of

investigation,  Police may require persons to provide  necessary

assistance.  For example, the Police may require persons who are

in  charge  of  or involved in the operation of computers  under

investigation  to  help to retrieve data from  those  computers.

Under  the current Act, it is not an offence if a person,  whose

assistance the Police requires, refuses to do so.  Clause  9  of

the  Bill proposes to make it an offence if a person refuses  to

provide

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>

assistance   or   obstructs  the  Police  in   the   course   of

investigation.  The penalty is a fine of up to $10,000 or up  to

3  years  imprisonment or both. There are similar sections  like

that  in the Penal Code, eg, section 179 - refusing to answer  a

public  servant authorised to question -which carries a  penalty

of  imprisonment which may extend to 6 months or fine which  may

extend  to  $1000  or both, or section 186 - obstructing  public

servant  in  discharge of public functions  -  which  carries  a

penalty  of  imprisonment which may extend to 3 months  or  fine

which may extend to $500 or both.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the existing provision in section 14 will also need to

be  widened to allow Police to gain access to encrypted data for

the  purpose  of  investigation.  Clause  9  of  the  Bill  also

proposes  to amend section 14 to widen the provisions  to  allow

lawful  access to data and encrypted material in the  course  of

investigations  of  offences under the Act,  or  other  offences

disclosed in the course of such investigations.  As a safeguard,

such powers of access can only be exercised with the consent  of

the  Public  Prosecutor.   Without the  consent  of  the  Public

Prosecutor,  the  Police will not be able to  obtain  access  to

encrypted data or material.  In practice, an arrangement will be

put  in  place for the Police to secure the consent of the  AG's

Chambers without compromising operational efficiency.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, this Bill is intended to send a strong

signal  that  computer  crimes will be treated  and  dealt  with

seriously in Singapore.  As Singapore positions itself to be  an

intelligent  island  and  a global centre  for  E-commerce,  the

legislative  framework must keep pace with the  developments  to

ensure  the  integrity of our computer systems against  would-be

cyber  criminals and hackers.  With the Bill, banks,  commercial

institutions, foreign investors and businesses can rest  assured

that  Singapore would be a good and safe place where  E-commerce

can  flourish.  Singaporeans can also rest assured that the  law

provides  adequate coverage for the safe operation of  essential

computer systems in Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  to  speak in general support of this Bill.  I also support

the  enhanced penalties for the offences as outlined in the very

comprehensive  speech  by  the  Minister.   However,  there  are

certain proposed amendments that I think merit reconsideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Computer Misuse Act was enacted to criminalise any

misuse of computers.  Its original targets were hackers who seek

unauthorised access to computers and having gained such  access,

either damage the computer systems or steal data from them.  The

behaviour  this  Act  was  intended to control  is  unauthorised

access.   Today,  we  are  considering a  curious  amendment  to

section 4 that would change the general approach for controlling

unauthorised  access.   We  are actually  going  to  criminalise

authorised access to a computer when the authorised user uses it

to  commit another specific crime.  In other words, the original

intent  of the Computer Misuse Act to punish unauthorised access

is going to be changed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me use an illustration to highlight these proposed

changes.   If a man either orally or write out a note  extorting

money from his neighbour, he is, of course, liable to be charged

for  extortion.  If he uses an old typewriter to  type  out  the

same  note, he can still be charged for extortion.  If  he  uses

his  computer  at his place of work to print out  such  a  note,

being  a  high-tech  criminal, he can be charged  not  only  for

extortion  but  he will in addition be liable  to  a  charge  of

computer misuse under the proposed section 4.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have difficulty understanding why this should be the

case.  Under the original provision, the man would be liable for

an  additional charge under the Computer Misuse Act only  if  he

uses  the computer without authority.  That is the mischief that

the  Computer Misuse Act was directed at.  What is the  mischief

that  this  new  section is intended to overcome?   The  man  is

already liable to be charged for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>

what  I  should call the principal offence.  Why is it necessary

to charge him for another computer related offence?  Does it not

amount  to punishing people for using a computer in addition  to

whatever  other  crime  he has committed?   If  so,  how  do  we

distinguish  such  a  case  from one that  makes  use  of  other

instruments such as a pen or an old typewriter in the commission

of  a  crime?  In the illustration I have given, can one  really

distinguish between using a computer from one of using  the  pen

or  the  typewriter?  The main question is: is it  necessary  or

desirable  to  introduce a provision that criminalises  what  is

otherwise  legitimate  behaviour,  ie,  using  a  computer  with

authority?   The deletion of the words "without authority"  from

section  4  is, in my view, unjustified.  I would strongly  urge

that these words be retained.  The amendment is unnecessary, and

not defensible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is likely that the proponents for this provision may

argue  that  many crimes, as the Minister has pointed  out,  are

committed  by  employees using their employers'  computers,  ie,

computer  users committing crimes through proper  use  of  their

computers,  and that this is the mischief that the amendment  is

supposed to control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that I remain unconvinced about the need to

cover this situation for two reasons.  First, the employee  will

already  be charged with the principal offence, be it  cheating,

falsification of accounts, fraud, criminal breach  of  trust  or

what   have  you.   Second,  it  remains  open  for  the  public

prosecutor  to argue that if an employee uses a computer  for  a

purpose  that  is  not within the scope of his employment,  that

should  be treated as unauthorised access and, therefore, within

the  law as it now stands.  This issue remains to be decided  by

case  law, and it is much better to allow such a development  to

take  place  rather  than  to amend the  law  as  suggested.   I

strongly urge Members and the Minister to reconsider whether  it

is necessary to amend section 4.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn to section 6A. This is a new section referring to

"unauthorised obstructioin of use of computer".  The language of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>

the  section appears to be unduly  open-ended and wide.  I refer

in  particular to the proposed section 6A(1)(b) where it states,

and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Any person who knowingly and without authority or lawful

excuse -

<pre>

     (b)  impedes or prevents access to, or impairs the usefulness or

       effectiveness of, any program or data stored in a computer,

</pre>

shall be guilty of an offence .'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phrase "impairs the usefulness or effectiveness of any

program  or  data"  is   really very open-ended  and  imprecise,

particularly  in  relation  to computer  usage.   Again,  it  is

difficult  to imagine what the mischief the section is  intended

to   cover.    Impeding   and  impairing   the   usefulness   or

effectiveness of a program is really a matter of  degree.   Once

you turn on a computer and access a program, you are really in a

way using the program, taking up the memory of the computer and,

therefore, maybe impairing the effectiveness of other  programs.

Is  it intended that this section be applied, for instance, only

to  aggressive  businessmen who e-mail bomb potential  customers

with  their  advertisements?   Or is  there  some  more  serious

problem that this section is intended to cover?  It is not  very

clear in the section itself as to what the problem is.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn to new section 6C which contains a new provision

prescribing   enhanced   punishment   for   offences   involving

protected computers.  Such computers are determined according to

the  knowledge  of  the  person alleged to  have  committed  the

offence.   Does he know or ought reasonably to have  known  that

the  computer is one that is used for certain specific purposes,

such  as  the  security, defence or international  relations  of

Singapore?    Aside  from  these  purposes,  the  section   also

includes  computers  dealing with other  purposes  such  as  the

protection   of  informers,  banking  and  financial   services,

communications and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I agree with the purpose of the section, it is

difficult to see why the nature

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>

of  a protected computer should depend on the state of knowledge

of  the accused.  For example, it is provided in subsection  (3)

of  section 6C that the requisite knowledge shall be presumed if

there  was  an  electronic  warning  drawing  attention  to  the

section. Such a presumption would obviously not operate if,  for

instance,  a  person  does not understand the  language  of  the

warning,  or  the  computer is so fast that the  warning  simply

flashes  through too quickly for the reader to  appreciate.   To

take  an  extreme  example.  A foreigner  gaining  access  to  a

protected computer, not understanding English or Chinese, may on

this  basis have more scope to avoid enhanced penalties  than  a

local  in  the same situation.  One would have thought  that  in

such  cases,  it  would  be better to stipulate  that  once  the

warning  is  given, the accused will be liable to  the  enhanced

punishment.   His understanding or knowledge of the  warning  or

lack  of  it  may  be  a  factor to be  taken  into  account  in

sentencing,  and  it should not be, in other words,  an  element

deciding whether a computer is protected or not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn finally to section 14 - the proposed amendments to

police powers.  This includes specifically the requirement  that

the  police  are  to be given assistance in the case  where  the

information  is encrypted.  Once again, while I agree  that  the

police  should  be  provided with powers to require  information

from  suspects  in their investigation, I do not  think  that  a

change to the existing provision is necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the original provision does not provide specifically

for the situation of encrypted information.  But the language of

the  original  section is wide enough to cover such  situations.

Under  the existing section, the police can require the  suspect

to  "provide  him  with  such reasonable assistance  as  he  may

require."   This  is  wide enough for the police  to  require  a

suspect  to give assistance with regard to encrypted information

and  the  like.  There  has not been any  case  concerning  this

subject.   It  seems  to  be  too early  to  suggest  that  this

encrypted  information element is not within the  existing  law.

My submission is that the existing provision is more than enough

for this purpose.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that enough has been said to persuade the

Minister  and Members of this House that it may be expedient  to

reconsider whether some of the amendments are actually necessary

or  desirable.  I hope that there will be a further  opportunity

to  review the desirability of enacting some of these provisions

into law, bearing in mind that the Computer Misuse Act, as it is

appropriately  named,  is  to  control  computer   misuse,   ie,

unauthorised access to computers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Minister has

pointed  out,  the rapid development of computer technology  and

fast  falling prices of hardware and software have  led  to  the

extensive  use of computers for all purposes.  From the  largest

corporations, Government ministries to schools to households, we

can  always  see  the  computer at work.  Increasingly,  we  are

enjoying the convenience and improvement in productivity through

the  use of computer networks.  However, the lightning speed  of

changes  in  computer  technology and its  indispensability  are

imposing strains on all social and legal systems.  As Prof. Chin

has just pointed out and given examples, laws may not be enacted

fast enough or realistic enough to regulate without complication

the  activities carried out in the virtual world or, in-between,

from the real to the virtual world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent CIA report says that nowadays the scientists'

ability  to network the computers is faster than the ability  to

protect them, and given the kind of money they have spent on the

security  of  the  computer systems, they  still  say  that  the

national  security of the United States of America can still  be

at  risk if there is an electronic warfare whereby the attack is

targeted to cripple the vast network of computers that  is  used

to   control   its   power  plants,  transportation,   financial

institutions, defence systems, etc, as the Minister has  pointed

out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, Sir, I support this Computer Misuse

(Amendment)  Bill, which will impose enhanced penalties  on  all

categories  of  offences  related to the  misuse  of  computers,

particularly the important part is on protected computers

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>

in  new  section 6C.  This section carries a maximum penalty  of

$100,000 or imprisonment of a term not exceeding 20 years or  to

both.   While the 20 years' imprisonment term seems like a  just

punishment,  the $100,000 maximum fine appears low  for  actions

that  can cause millions of dollars in damage to the public  and

is  definitely mild compared to the $50,000 maximum fine  for  a

repeat  offence  in  breeding mosquitoes or  $200,000  fine  for

damaging an underground cable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has also introduced a new definition on the word

"damage"  in clause 2.  Clause 2 mentions a loss aggregating  at

least $10,000 in value, but it does not explain how the loss  is

assessed.  The reason why I think the calculation of the  damage

should   be   spelt  out  in  the  Bill  is  that  the   section

differentiates between offences where the damage is $10,000  and

above,  and those which are below $10,000, with the effect  that

in  the  former  case, the penalties are greatly  enhanced.   An

accused  will have no way of knowing whether he will  receive  a

lower  or higher charge because the law does not state  how  the

damage is assessed.  Under the same clause 2(b), paragraphs  (c)

and  (d)  are  probably too wide because it raises the  question

whether  a perceived threat to public health or safety or  death

or physical injury is subjective or objective.  Can the Minister

describe the circumstances under which the controlling authority

or the court has the subjective power to decide on the damages?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since this Bill touches on everybody's life, like the

Electronic  Transactions  Bill,  there  should  be  more  public

education  on the Bill.  I have conducted some personal  surveys

with  companies and individuals, professionals such as  lawyers,

engineers  and  architects, and to my surprise most  people  are

quite ignorant of the existence of the 1994 Computer Misuse Act.

Now with these enhanced penalties and, of course, more pervasive

use  of  computer  networks these days, it  is  imperative  that

public  awareness  must  be  raised  for  the  new  Bill  to  be

effective.   Many  computer  owners are  not  computer  literate

enough to protect their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>

computers.   I  once heard that somebody hacked into  a  banking

network system although no harm was caused.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual users also do not know that their usual

behaviour, such as revealing passwords, loading illegal software

to play games or to do their own work, to delete the database or

even  leaving the computer logged on but unattended during lunch

time,  can  lead  to  serious consequences.   Like  all  crimes,

prevention  is  the best way to avoid it.  It is quite  late  to

alert the public about this law by putting somebody behind  bars

for  20 years after a major havoc has been caused by his hacking

into protected computers and causing huge damage.  Hence, I urge

the  Government  and the public institutions  to  enhance  their

efforts to protect their computer networks.  At the same time, a

major effort must be put in to find ways to communicate in plain

language  to the public about the effects of the law, just  like

the  one  we  had on speeding 60 km above the speed limit.   The

potential  penalties  must be firmly registered  in  everybody's

mind.   Hence,  I suggest that seminars and public  lectures  be

conducted  at  community centres, educational  institutions  and

trade  associations to prepare our people for law and  order  in

the real world as well as in the virtual world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than those points which I have sought clarification,

Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when I was

studying  in  America, I took the opportunity to  visit  Harvard

University  where there is a museum of all the first  computers,

and  I  saw this computer made in 1943, a huge room-size  thing,

which seems to have hundreds of metres of wires in it.  And I am

told  that such a computer actually has less power than  one  of

our  little desktop things we have today.  The use of  computers

has  become  so pervasive that everything we have either  has  a

computer  operating it or a micro-chip which is  as  good  as  a

computer,  such  as in our watches, microwave ovens,  cars,  and

washing machines.  As a matter of  fact, under the definition of

this Act, microwave ovens and washing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>

machines being programmable devices are actually also computers.

So  if  you misuse them, you also get charged.  But, Sir,  jokes

aside, I think the subject is serious enough when we talk  about

computers per se.  In other words, it is important that when  we

use  computers,  being so pervasive these  days,  we  should  be

careful  how people use and misuse them.  I think it would  have

been  actually incomprehensible even for the computer makers  in

the early 80s, for example, to expect that computers would be so

well  used.   In  fact, in 1980, a CEO of one  of  the  computer

makers  dismissed  the  idea  that there  would  actually  be  a

computer in every house.  But look at where we are today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is important that we catch up with the time

and  make  misuse of computers something that people  must  take

note  of  and  prevent when we can with the law.  I have  always

been  of  the  view that where computers are used to  commit  an

offence and other offences, for example, extortion, blackmailing

or  stealing something from employers or the company and so  on,

there  is  actually an ultimate offence that can be  chargeable.

As  a  matter  of illustration, we do not have a  special  knife

misuse  law.   Neither  do  we have  a  typewriter  misuse  law.

Because  it  is  actually  the result of  that  misuse  that  we

criminalise,  whether it be extortion, murder or  causing  hurt.

This  is  where  I support Prof. Chin, ie, where we  create  new

criminal  offences, we have got to be particularly careful  that

we  do  not  go  overboard.  In the Computer Misuse  (Amendment)

Bill,  the  new  section  4 talks about authorised  use  of  the

computer  to  commit  an offence.  If there  is  an  offence  of

stealing  or misappropriation of funds, I think that  itself  is

chargeable under existing law.  It is good, of course, if we can

say  that  if you use a computer because of the way the computer

works, how fast it is, and how difficult it is to detect that we

enhance the penalties, I am supportive of that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do want to take note, as Prof. Chin has urged Members

and the Minister to do, that if we criminalise something that is

"authorised", then basically we are talking of a situation where

you have a transfer of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>

funds,  somebody is authorised to use the computer  to  transfer

funds,  for  example, he is using an authorised  instrument,  an

authorised tool, to do an unauthorised thing.  If it  is  indeed

the  concern  of  the  company that there  should  not  be  such

unauthorised transfers, then I think the moment a person who has

use of a computer does an unauthorised thing, then he already is

using  a  computer  in  an  unauthorised  manner  and  therefore

misusing  it,  and therefore there is no need to  add  the  word

"authorised".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that the drafters of this new section probably

took  a look at cases elsewhere.  There is indeed a case  in  UK

where policemen, for example, use a police computer.  They  were

authorised  to do so.  And they use this computer to  do  things

that were not authorised.  I think in that sort of situation, we

really  are  talking  about a person who,  having  exceeded  his

authority, is really an unauthorised user, and so we should  not

add this word "authorised" which has a very serious implication.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on from that point, Sir, looking again at this new

section  4, I think what we are trying to catch in the  Computer

Misuse  Act  is  really not the old class of  criminals  who  do

things  like extortion and blackmailing and so on.   But  really

there  is  a  new class of misusers of computers who  have  been

described  in  the literature contemptuously as computer  nerds,

people  who are anti-social, people who are social misfits,  and

perhaps  even teenagers out to do mischief.  And we are  saying,

look,  computers run everything in our lives, now including  our

airplanes and control towers and medical facilities.  Therefore,

we  want  people  to  be responsible in the  use  of  computers.

Hence, section 3 of the Computer Misuse Act has now been amended

to  enhance penalties and to add certain new concerns regarding,

for example, damage in a way which was never thought of when the

first  Act  was passed.  I support that, Sir.  But I would  urge

that  when we talk about this new class of criminals who  really

sometimes  may win the sympathy of people who say,  "What?   But

these  are  teenagers.  They know nothing  better.",  we  should

really say, yes, they should actually be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>

using  the computer for study, for work, and so on, but  not  to

use  to  do  things  that will damage other people's  lives  and

property.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when we talk about an offence which is a true misuse of

a  computer,  I  am  all  for making sure  repeat  offences  are

penalised  even  more  and  if damage is  caused,  that  greater

enhanced penalties will be imposed.  And this is now the  scheme

of  things as we can see.  Sections 3, 4, 5, 6 and 6A  all  have

got  a  basic penalty for an offence, higher penalty for  repeat

offence and enhanced penalty for damage caused.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the new section 6C, which is my next point, we have,

you might say, a higher level of enhanced penalties, and this is

when  a  "protected computer" is used to do the crimes that  are

being  committed.   So  for  a protected  computer,  such  as  a

national  defence computer or a computer which is  used  by  the

Government for public safety and so on, it is important that  we

send  a  clear message that these computers are useful and  they

affect  a lot of lives and we should not play around with  them.

This  is where I support Mr Chuang's view too that we should  go

out  with  an education campaign to tell people that  these  are

things  that you should not be doing.  In a private conversation

with  Mr Chuang, he in fact claims that some lawyers do not even

know  the existence of this Act.  I leave my mind open to  that.

But  I think it is important that not only do we tell people  of

the  provisions  of  the  law but also  that  these  cases  have

happened.   It is like nobody has heard of this case  until  the

Minister  mentioned earlier in his speech that  there  was  this

case.   And  I think it is important for people to be  reminded.

When  these cases are charged in court, the headlines are there.

But I think people need to be reminded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would go on to say that the new section 6C makes it an

offence for anybody who commits an offence under sections 3,  5,

6  or  6A,  if he does it with a protected computer.  But  I  do

believe  that  this new section 6C does not cover section  4  or

section  6B.   So what we end up with is an anomaly.   In  other

words, a person who has access to a computer to commit a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>

wrong  thing, like transfer of funds or to switch off a computer

in  a medical facility so that he causes death, this person  can

be charged under section 4.  If he does the same thing through a

computer  which  is  a protected system, he  does  not  get  any

enhanced  penalty.  But if he accesses a computer and  it  is  a

protected  computer, he gets an enhanced penalty  under  section

6C.  I think it is more serious for a person to approach and use

a  protected  computer  to  either do these  offences  or  under

section  6B where he discloses the access code.  Sir, again,  it

is  important that we not only protect computers by making  sure

access  codes are not posted on the Net and trafficked and  sold

for a price and so on, we should also seriously look at the fact

that  if  this  is an access code to a protected  computer,  the

penalty must be higher.  And if the objection is that this is an

enhanced penalty on top of an enhanced penalty, I think that  is

not a real objection because there are other offences in the Act

that already have penalties upon penalties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to point to another interesting issue

which  Mr Chuang has alluded to, and that is, in the new section

6A  where  any  person  who knowingly and without  authority  or

lawful  excuse  interferes with a computer.   The  Minister  has

mentioned that this covers a situation of what we call spam or e-mail  which  is sent into a computer to just basically  cram  it

with full of mail messages and then this causes a breakdown or a

crash in the e-mail system.  Here we need to be careful that  we

do  not  make  illegal and illegitimate a proper marketing  tool

which businesses use, and that is, to use the computer to send e-mail  to  solicit business.  I think there is  quite  a  lot  of

literature  on computer spam and even a lot of postings  on  the

Internet  which  criticise such commercial  parties  from  using

spam.  But I would say that it is important that we do not close

off  this  avenue completely if it is reasonably and justifiably

used.   Therefore, a person's lawful excuse, he might  say,  is,

"I'm trying

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>

to  sell  something."   I  think the  Minister  should  consider

whether this is something that the law would prosecute.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said earlier on that here we are trying to make

computer misuse an offence.  And we are tackling a new class  of

criminals who really have no concern for other people,  who  are

anti-social and social misfits, and they have a lingo  of  their

own, a language that they use.  When you talk about programs and

data,  they  know what it is.  And when you talk  about  e-mail,

they too know what it is.  In their lingo, data is not equal  to

e-mail;  e-mail is e-mail, data is data.  Under the  definitions

of  the  Computer Misuse Act, data actually is  wide  enough  to

cover   e-mail.   Data  is  defined  under  the  main   Act   as

"representations of information or of concepts  that  are  being

prepared or have been prepared in a form suitable for use  in  a

computer".  This is wide enough to cover e-mail, and I hope  the

Minister  will  clarify that, so that it will no  longer  be  an

excuse  for a person to say, "Oh, well, what I did was  e-mail."

And  the Computer Misuse Act only protects programs and data  on

computers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I thank the Members for speaking on

this Bill.  Indeed this Bill is necessary and we are updating it

to  provide for a changed situation from the time of  the  first

Computer  Misuse Act some years ago.  If you just  look  at  the

number  of  Internet users today compared to,  say,  January  or

February  1995,  just  the  number of  Internet  users,  without

counting  the access they can have through their employers,  has

increased  10  times,  easily from 25,000 to  about  270,000  by

January  this  year.  And there is an equally  large  number  of

those  who  have  access to Internet using their own  employers'

computers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can see that the situation envisaged in 1993-94

when  we first had the CMA was something that we do not  see  it

today.   There  is  an exponential increase  in  the  number  of

computers,  the usage of computers and the number  of  users  of

computers.   Therefore, we need to update the Act.  By  updating

the Act, we are not trying to put obstacles in people's path  in

their use of computers by making

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>

them  unauthorised users just because they have been  authorised

to   do  something  but,  if  they  were  to  use  it  for  some

unauthorised purposes, they will be acting against the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Members that anybody who uses the computer

with  authority  for a lawful purpose will not be  caught  under

this Bill.  So have no fear if you are using it for a proper and

lawful  purpose, with no intent to commit a crime.  You  do  not

have to worry that even by removing the word "unauthorised", you

will  be caught by this new section 4.  I have explained earlier

on  why we have this new section 4.  The idea of section  4,  as

amended,  is  to  remove the uncertainty that a person,  who  is

originally  authorised  to access the  computer,  may  now  find

himself  guilty of an offence if he were to use it to  commit  a

crime.   It will, if he were to use it to commit a crime.   That

is  what the purpose of this new section 4 is all about.  So  it

is very clear that we can catch the person under this amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of my colleagues asked why do we not catch them under

the  other  laws  because the primary  act  is  that  of  theft,

extortion, etc, and we could use the other laws to punish  them.

Yes,  of  course, we can also do that.  But we feel  that  if  a

person  has actually abused his authority in using the computer,

we  should try to use this legislation and update it  so  as  to

also  catch him under it.  But it does not mean that the  person

can  be  charged twice for the same offence based  on  the  same

facts.   So  if  we  were to charge a person for  extortion,  an

example used by Prof. Chin, when he uses his computer instead of

his typewriter to print the extortion letter, then of course, we

will  not  charge him under the Penal Code.  He will be  charged

under this particular Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 4(2) actually narrows the offences under which we

can  charge a person for committing a crime.  It is quite  clear

that  it is only for certain categories of offences and not  all

types of offences involving the use of computers. In that sense,

we  have more or less narrowed the ground for which a person can

be charged using a computer with intent to commit an offence, as

specified in section 4.  I have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>

given the example of the Golden Village Cinemas case.  There are

other  similar cases which the police in the past have not  been

able  to charge a person under the CMA because there was no such

provision or the provision itself was not clear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me say this again. If a person uses his computer

for a lawful purpose, he does not have to worry that he will  be

charged  under  section  4.   If he is  authorised  to  use  the

computer but uses it with intent to commit a crime, as specified

in section 4, then he may be charged under this Bill.  But if he

is  charged under this Bill, based on the same facts, he  cannot

be charged under another Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin says that section 6A on impairing the usefulness

or  effectiveness of data stored in a computer seems to be a bit

open-ended  and  imprecise.  He asked, apart from  e-mail,  what

else  are we actually thinking about and he was not sure whether

it  is workable.  I gave e-mail bombing as an example of what is

meant  by  impeding access or use.  Under section  6A(1)(b),  it

says that if a person "impedes or prevents access to, or impairs

the  usefulness or effectiveness of, any program or data  stored

in  a  computer  .".   That is how it is  worded  under  section

6A(1)(b).  An example of this is a person sending commands to  a

computer server which would cause it to perform functions  which

could  slow down the programs or cause it to miscompute  certain

things  without actually gaining unauthorised access  or  making

any  unauthorised modifications.  This can be done by exploiting

the  bugs  in  the  system or the weaknesses  in  the  software.

Repeated  requests  may be sent which will  then  overwhelm  the

computer  and  slow  it  down  and impair  the  usefulness,  for

example, by making it to miscompute.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples of such offences are, in the lingo of the people

who  know, Ping of Death and Teardrop.  Maybe I should say  what

are  Ping  of  Death  and Teardrop attacks.  Ping  commands  are

legitimate  commands  sent  to check  whether  a  server  is  in

existence  or  responsive before engaging it.  If Ping  commands

are repeatedly sent to the server and the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>

server  ends  up  processing  and  responding  to  the  command,

resulting in it not being able to perform other tasks, then such

Ping  of Death attacks may actually cause the computer to crash.

Teardrop attacks are packets of useless data repeatedly sent  to

the  computer and the computer has to process the data.  It  is,

however, unable to interpret such data and this again may  cause

the computer to hang.  So there are many examples of how one can

obstruct  a  computer, or the use of a computer, or impedes  the

use of a computer, apart from just e-mail bombing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we prove that an offence has taken place, ie, the

system has crashed or hanged due to such an offence?  The  owner

or  the user will have to show that he indeed could not use  his

computer at all.  If the effect of the offence was to impair the

computer's  effectiveness,  for example,  in  slowing  down  the

response  to  legitimate  activities,  then  there  are  network

management  tools  which  could  show  that,  technically,   the

computer's  response has indeed been slowed down.  So  this  can

actually be easily checked.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin also said that the original section 14 in

addressing  Police  powers is enough.  We do  not  think  it  is

enough,  in  particular, the Police power  to  access  encrypted

data.   If  a person refuses to cooperate or just play dumb  and

refuses  to  tell you how to access because he did not  want  to

reveal  his  password  to  open up  the  computer,  then  Police

investigation  will be impeded.  Section 14  also  makes  it  an

offence  if a person obstructs the lawful exercise of  power  or

fails to comply with the request to provide reasonable technical

and  other assistance to the Police.  The Police may require any

person  in  possession of decryption information  to  grant  him

access  to such decryption information necessary to decrypt  the

data  required  for purposes of investigation.  Of  course,  the

Police just cannot say, "Open up and show me."  It will have  to

get the Public Prosecutor's consent before it can actually act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chuang talks about the definition of "damage". We think

that this definition, as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>

we have described it now, is a much more sophisticated manner to

define damage so that enhanced penalties for damage can apply to

serious  situations which, nevertheless, would not  fall  within

the definition of "protected computers".  As more aspects of our

lives are being controlled by computers, we will have to find  a

way of ensuring that we do not suffer as a result of it.  So  we

have to provide for protection.  Hackers  can use a computer  to

hack  into  the  computer  system of  a  chemical  factory,  for

example, to discharge toxic chemicals into the environment or to

change  hospital  records or diagnosis,  etc,  as  I  have  just

explained.  Therefore, we have to define section 2 and widen  it

to  include, apart from financial loss, impairment to  computers

that  will potentially modify or impair the medical examination,

diagnosis, treatment or care of one or more persons;  or  causes

or  threatens  physical  injury  or  death  to  any  person;  or

threatens  public health or public safety.  In  that  sense,  we

have widened it.  So it does explain how damage is to be defined

in the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to this so-called anomaly, mentioned by Dr Toh

See  Kiat,  in section 6C on the enhanced penalties which  cover

some offences but omit others, such as those in sections 3, 5, 6

and  6A  but  not that of sections 4, 7 and the new section  6B.

Section 6C aims primarily at offences which affect the integrity

of  protected  computers and cause adverse consequences  to  its

operation.   That  is why the principal sections  pertaining  to

hacking and other offences which could create adverse impact  on

protected computers are covered in sections 3, 5, 6 and 6A.  The

coverage  does not extend to sections 4, 6B or 7.  If authorised

users  of  protected computers commit offences  of  unauthorised

modification  under  sections 5, 6 and 6A, then  they  are  also

liable  under section 6C.  There is therefore no need to capture

section  4  under  section 6C.  Section  4  is  to  address  the

offences  where authorised users use the computers to  commit  a

crime  and not to damage the computer per se.  Under section  4,

if  an  offender has authorised access and accesses a  protected

computer to commit an offence

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>

under  sections  5,  6 or 6A, then he would  have  committed  an

offence  under  section  6C and enhanced  penalties  would  then

apply.  If, however, the person accesses it to commit a criminal

offence   without  affecting  the  integrity  of  the  protected

computer,  then the punishment under section 4 will  apply.   If

the  offender  commits an offence under section  4  and  he  has

unauthorised  access to a protected computer in  the  course  of

committing  the  offence,  then he would  still  be  liable  for

enhanced  penalty  because  he has unauthorised  access  to  the

protected computer in committing the offence under section 3.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for section 6B, if an offender discloses the password or

the  recipient  uses  it  to  enter a  protected  computer,  the

recipient  can  be charged under section 3 to which  section  6C

applies  with enhanced penalty.  The password owner can also  be

charged with abetting, under section 7, the unauthorised  access

by  the recipient, and be punished in the same manner, that  is,

he  is  subjected  to  the enhanced penalty.   It  is  thus  not

necessary  to apply section 6C to section 6B per se but  to  the

commission of the subsequent offences which affect the protected

computer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for section 7, that is the section relating to abetment

and  hence  there  is  no  need to  incorporate  it  inside  the

provisions  of  section 6C.  However, if a person abets  another

person in committing an offence punished under section 6C,  then

the abettor would be liable for the same enhanced penalty as the

principal offender.  So the provision of section 6C,  as  it  is

currently drafted, is adequate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me come back to Prof. Chin again on the question of

people  getting into the protected computers that they  may  not

know  that  it  is  a protected computer and  therefore  may  be

punished.   I  think  all  these cybernauts  are  rather  clever

people.   They  know  what they do and  as  they  enter  into  a

protected computer, I am told, there will be adequate electronic

signposts   and   other   warnings  put  up   stipulating   that

unauthorised access to the computer or the program or data is an

offence  and, therefore, it will attract enhanced  penalty.   So

warnings  will  be  given to the would-be  culprits  to  try  to

trespass protected

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>

computer  systems.   The offender would have sufficient  warning

that  he is entering into a protected computer as he would  have

to  acknowledge  that he has read the warning, for  example,  by

clicking  on  a  link  or a button with a title,  "I  accept  or

comply"  and  enter before he could proceed.  The  intent  of  a

person who accesses a protected computer without authority would

then  be taken into account when considering prosecution.  So  I

think there will be enough signposts, warnings and, at the  same

time, if you still want to enter, you say, "Yes, I want to  come

in and see", then you are actually committing an offence.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Mr Speaker, may I clarify this

point with the Minister?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> The section actually says that

whether a computer is a protected computer or not depends on the

state of knowledge of the person accessing the computer.  In  my

view,  that is not necessary.  You can have a protected computer

precisely  because  of  the  warning that  you  have  indicated.

Whether  the  person understands the warning or  not  should  be

material only in relation to how culpable he is in accessing the

computer.   But  it  should  not  be  part  and  parcel  of  the

definition  of what a protected computer is.  Under the  present

provision,  it  is  part and parcel of the definition,  which  I

think  is  wrong.    Because that would depend  on  whether  the

person understands the warning or not.  That is the point.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I am glad that Prof. Chin accepts the

point  that  there is enough warning in the protected  computer.

The  question is whether the person needs to know that it  is  a

protected computer or not.  I have left it to the AG's  Chambers

to  advise me on this and, as I said, no law is static.   As  we

gain  experience,  we  get  more experience,  more  cases,  more

examples,  new technology, then all kinds of changes  will  come

about.   Eventually, we will find a way to fine-tune and improve

the  laws  that  we have.  That is how we conduct  our  business

here.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to Dr Toh's worry about spaming. As he has

described, spaming is like when people send you junk mail in the

mail  box but it is done through the computer.  Sometimes it  is

really  difficult for us to refuse junk mail other than throwing

it  into  the rubbish bin.  But in the case of the computer,  if

people send you junk mail, then there is very little you can  do

about  it.   As Dr Toh said, we really do not want to discourage

people  who  want  to  advertise their  products.   But  if  the

computer owner or user feels that he has got so much junk  mail,

maybe  he  can get in touch with the Internet Service  Providers

(ISPs)  or  the service providers to make sure that they  screen

off  such junk mail from his mail.  The intention is not  really

to  discourage people who want to advertise, and there are other

avenues of advertising.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I just wanted to make sure that the

Minister assures advertisers that if they do use this system, it

can  be used without being criminalised by the section.  But  as

to  users  themselves, if they want to stop spaming,  they  can.

There  are  software mechanisms.  They can also  tell  the  ISP.

That is not my concern, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> If spaming leads to obstruction and

impedes  the  person's use of a computer, in other  words,  keep

loading and loading the person with all kinds of junk and  as  a

result his computer crashes, then we may have a problem.  But as

I  said,  the idea here is not to discourage people who want  to

advertise their wares or whatever it is they want to sell.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> That is right. In other words, the act of

sending the e-mail is not wrong but only when the advertiser  is

so insistent and persistent that he bombs out the e-mail system.

Then I support that, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> E-mail is data as defined under the

Computer  Misuse Act.  So do not think that by just  sending  e-mail, therefore, you are not caught by the Act.  You are, if you

actually use e-mail and bomb other people's computer.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me come back to Mr Chuang's concern about computer

users  or  people  who may be caught by the Act without  knowing

that  they  have  actually offended the  laws  of  the  CMA  and

therefore  suggesting that we need to have more publicity,  more

campaigns, seminars or whatever it is to tell people  about  the

new  provisions.  As I said, all these computer buffs are  quite

well read people and, of course, we will try to post as much  of

this  as  possible on the Internet and other media, so that  the

people will get to know of it.  And through the publicity in the

media,  through  cases brought up in court, I think  people  are

quite  well aware of the offences committed using the  computer.

We  do not have to do a big play of it each time we have a case.

But I think those who are knowledgeable - I assume those who use

the  computer are knowledgeable - will be able to understand the

implications  of  their misdeeds.  And  if  that  is  still  not

enough,  then perhaps more seminars can be conducted  and  maybe

CASE  can  also  help  in  spreading this  knowledge  among  the

consumers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

the Bill. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;

read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>CONTROL OF VECTORS AND PESTICIDES BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>2.52 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Control of Vectors and Pesticides Bill is a

comprehensive  legislation that will deal with both  insect  and

non-insect vectors.  It will replace the Destruction of Disease-Bearing Insects Act (Chapter 79), which was enacted in 1968.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to consolidate and reform the law relating

to  the  destruction of vectors and the control of  vector-borne

diseases, and has new provisions for:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the registration, licensing and certification of

persons engaged in vector control work; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the control of the sale and use of pesticides

and vector repellents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the introduction of this Bill is timely as we are

seeing  a  resurgence  of vector-borne  diseases,  not  only  in

Singapore,  but  in the whole of Southeast Asia and  many  other

parts   of  the  world.   Vector-borne  diseases  are  dangerous

diseases that can result in human suffering and even deaths.  My

Ministry  is  committed to protecting our population  from  such

diseases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task, however, of preventing outbreaks of vector-borne

diseases is a mammoth one.  Its success will depend very much on

effort  by  the  community  -  from  home  occupants,  work-site

contractors, estate managers and just about everyone  who  owns,

manages or occupies a property.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of dengue fever, for example, my Ministry has

over  the years been educating the public on ways in which  they

can  prevent the Aedes mosquito from breeding in their premises.

Surveys have shown that the public has understood what needs  to

be  done.   Many  do  in fact make the effort to  regularly  and

carefully check their homes and compounds.  However, I  have  to

point   out  that  even  if  95%  of  the  homeowners   in   the

neighbourhood have done their part, dengue outbreaks  can  still

occur if the remaining 5% take an indifferent attitude and allow

Aedes to breed in their homes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that Members will agree that it is really unfair

to  the majority who are doing the right thing, but still  stand

the  risk of being infected with dengue, just because a  few  of

their  neighbours choose not to do anything or remain  careless.

The Bill will provide for greater punitive measures against this

minority group who, by being indifferent, endanger the lives  of

others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, more and more chemicals and formulations are being

introduced  into  the market as pesticides and insecticides  for

vector control.  Some of these can be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>

potentially hazardous to the users, as well as to the public, if

they  are  not  handled  or  applied  carefully.   With  greater

emphasis given to vector control, there is a need to ensure that

the  people using and applying these chemicals know what  to  do

and  how to prevent harm to themselves and to the public.  Also,

we  need  to  ensure that pesticides, especially those  used  in

formulated   household  insecticides,  do  not  contain   active

ingredients  that are dangerous to people.  For  these  reasons,

the Bill will have provisions to address the professionalism  of

the  pest  control  industry and to the sale of  pesticides  and

repellents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are today about 110 pest control companies operating

in  Singapore.  They employ about 2,000 employees, half of  whom

are  supervisors  and the other half unskilled  or  semi-skilled

workers.   Of the 1,000 or so supervisors, only about  20%  have

undergone  classroom  training conducted  by  the  Pest  Control

Association and some of the larger pest control companies.   The

others learn the trade as they go along.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to formalise the training to ensure that all those

in  the  trade  are  properly trained.  The Bill  therefore  has

provisions requiring supervisors and workers to undergo training

courses  conducted  by  my Ministry or  by  accredited  training

centres.  Thereafter, they will sit for examinations set  by  my

Ministry.  Only when they have been trained and have passed  the

examinations   will  they  be  licensed  as   either   qualified

technicians or pest control workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grace period of nine months will be given to those

already  in the trade to attend the appropriate training courses

and  to  sit  for  the examinations.  In the interim,  they  can

continue  to  work  and  will  hold  a  provisional  licence  or

certificate as the case may be.  This window period is necessary

and  fair  as  the industry cannot come to a standstill  in  the

interim period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the training and licensing scheme, my Ministry aims

to raise the level of competence and professionalism of the pest

control  industry.   Only when the people in  the  industry  are

knowledgeable

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>

and  highly skilled, can we then depend on them to play a bigger

and more effective role in vector control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now highlight some of the other major

provisions in this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that the public's safety is protected, the Bill

seeks  to  control the types of pesticides that can be  used  in

vector control and to specify the approved active ingredient and

their  maximum permissible levels.  Only those that are approved

for use will be registered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 6, 8 and 9 of the Bill will require all pesticides

used  for  vector  control  and  all  vector  repellents  to  be

registered  before they can be sold in the market.  The  product

has to be sold in a container or packaged with an approved label

and carries the registration mark.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 empowers my Ministry to order the recall of stock

and   cease  the  sale  of  registered  pesticides,  if   deemed

necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 empowers my Ministry to take samples of

pesticides for analyses and the stock can be seized or sealed if

the  analyses  show that the provisions of the  Bill  have  been

contravened.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contravention of any part of the Bill pertaining to the

control  of pesticides and repellents will incur a maximum  fine

of  $20,000  and/or  3  months jail for the  first  offence  and

$50,000  and/or  6  months jail for the  second  and  subsequent

offence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I mentioned earlier in my speech, we need to come

down hard on those who are irresponsible and cause mosquitoes to

breed  in  their  premises.  The penalties for the  breeding  of

vectors will be increased with this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 16, the occupier or owner of a construction

site  or  workplace which breeds vectors will  be  liable  to  a

maximum  fine of $5,000, and/or 3 months' jail sentence for  the

first  offence.   Second  or subsequent offences  will  incur  a

maximum  fine of $10,000 and/or 6 months' jail sentence.  If  he

ignores our advice and continuously fails to eradicate

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>

the  breeding places in his premises, he will be served with  an

Order  under clause 18.  The Order, other than requiring him  to

eradicate  the  breeding grounds, may require him  to  engage  a

registered  vector control operator or licensed  vector  control

technician  to  carry  out  the  vector  control  work  and,  in

appropriate  cases,  to  stop work for  such  period  until  the

breeding habitats are eradicated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 24(a), failure to comply with the Order may

render  him liable to a maximum fine of $20,000 and/or 3 months'

jail  for  the first offence and $50,000 fine and/or  6  months'

jail for the second or subsequent offence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 49, in cases where the offence is committed by

a body corporate, a partnership or an unincorporated association

of  person, the director, manager, partner, secretary  or  other

similar officer of such bodies may be charged for the offence if

it  was  committed with his consent or connivance or if  he  had

failed  to  exercise all diligence to prevent the commission  of

the offence.  This will enable us to hold management accountable

for  the  unsatisfactory conditions of the  premises  under  its

control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Bill does not differentiate between work-sites

and domestic premises, my ministry intends to offer the occupier

or owner of domestic premises where breeding of vectors is found

a   composition   fine  instead  of  charging  them   in   court

straightaway.  Under the Bill, offences may be compounded  to  a

sum  not  exceeding  $5,000. The current  composition  fine  for

homeowners  is $100.  We will increase this amount  to  $200  to

increase its deterrent value.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Part V of the Bill deals with the registration,

licensing   and   certification  of  pest   control   companies,

technicians and workers respectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, with these provisions, the pest

control  industry will be regulated.  Clauses  25  and  28  will

require  any  company in the business of vector  control  to  be

registered  with  my Ministry as a vector control  operator.   A

registered vector control operator

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>

must  engage  only  licensed  vector  control  technicians   and

certified vector control workers to do vector control work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clauses 26, 27 and 29 of the Bill, no person is

allowed  to carry out vector control work unless he is  licensed

as  a vector control technician or certified as a vector control

worker.   Only certified workers are allowed to assist and  work

under  the  supervision of licensed technicians in carrying  out

vector control work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 32 provides for the registration, licence or

certificate  to  be cancelled, if the person who is  registered,

licensed  or certified contravenes the provisions of  the  Bill,

fails  to comply with conditions imposed or directions given  to

him,  or  has obtained the registration, licence and certificate

by fraud or cheating.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 35, the maximum penalty for offences under

this  Part  will be $20,000 and/or 3 months' jail for the  first

offence  and  $50,000 and/or 6 months' jail for  the  second  or

subsequent offence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill deals with the broad principles and requirements

on the control of vectors and pesticides.  Specific and detailed

regulatory  requirements  will  be  made  under  regulations  as

provided for under clause 60 of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill enables my Ministry to deal with the

resurgence of vector-borne diseases more effectively and  better

protect our population from outbreaks of these diseases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has sought the views and inputs of the private

sector  during  the preparation of the Bill.   They  have  given

their general support to the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Destruction of the Disease-Bearing Insects Act (Chapter

79) will be repealed when this Bill is enacted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I rise in support of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A local newspaper recently reported that, in Hong Kong, a

dog died and three

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>

members  of  a  family  suffered from illnesses  resulting  from

ignorance  in the use of a tick control pesticide.   This  is  a

good  example  to  show  how  dangerous  vector  repellents  and

pesticides are.  Most of the chemicals used in vector repellents

and  pesticides  are  lethal to insects and  smaller  creatures.

They   are  equally  lethal,  with  higher  dosage,  to  people,

especially  the  aged  and  young  people.   Therefore,  it   is

important  that  the  people who handle such  chemicals  require

adequate  knowledge  of the chemicals, the  way  to  handle  the

chemicals  and  the possible remedial action if  anybody  should

accidentally come in contact with the chemicals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the Bill, which is a comprehensive one, that

deals  with  the possession and subsequent application  of  such

chemicals.  The Bill ensures that all operators, technicians and

workers  dealing with the sale and application of the  chemicals

to   be  registered.   This  will  reduce  the  possibility   of

mishandling  of the chemicals by lay persons which could  affect

the health of the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to cite a personal encounter with a pest

control  company  which came to my home  for  the  treatment  of

termites.   The workers from the company drilled  holes  on  the

wooden window frame and squeezed a bluish powder into the holes.

After  their work, those holes were left exposed and the  powder

could  be easily accessible by ignorant young children.   In  my

view,  the  bluish powder is toxic and could cause  problems  to

young children when they come into contact with it.  This  is  a

very  bad  pest control practice and could only be  due  to  the

ignorance of the workers or irresponsibility of the person doing

the job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By registering them, perhaps such errant pest controllers

could  be  eradicated from the market and only  those  with  the

appropriate knowledge will be allowed to operate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I notice that the operators, technicians and

workers  could  be  given provisional certificates  or  licences

pending the acquisition of certain prescribed qualifications.  I

think this provision is too generous and it may lead

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>

to  unqualified operators, technicians or workers continuing  to

practise  without a qualified licence or certificate.   It  will

undermine  the  spirit of the Bill.  I hope  the  Minister  will

clarify  the  conditions and how long the  provisional  licences

would be issued.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill states that the certificate would last for three

years  and  is renewable.  I personally feel that  this  is  too

lenient in comparison with the Professional Engineers Act, which

grants university trained professional engineers with only a one-year  practising licence.  On what ground are the  pest  control

technicians  and  workers, who would any  time  endanger  public

health,  granted a three-year permit? May I request the Minister

to justify why a pest control licence is not issued on an annual

basis, just like the Profession Engineers Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill does not spell out precisely in what way the

licence  could  be revoked.  We must continuously emphasise  and

remind  all  pest  control licence holders that  their  licences

could  be  revoked if they do not comply with the code  of  good

conduct  pertaining to their practice.  Could the Minister  also

clarify this matter?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 35, the penalty for the operators, technicians

and  workers  is grouped into one category if they should  break

the law.  The maximum fine is $20,000 and three months' jail for

a first time offender.  In my view, the penalty for the operator

should  be  made more severe compared with that of  the  worker.

Could the Minister enlighten the House on this matter?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 18(4), it is mentioned specifically about the

levelling of the ground to prevent vector breeding.  I think  it

may  be difficult for the construction site to comply with  this

particular  clause  because of the size  of  the  land  and  the

movement  of heavy vehicles.  It will be very costly  to  comply

with this requirement.  However, effort must be put in to ensure

that it is free from vector breeding.  Could the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>

Minister  elaborate  on how the Ministry intends  to  deal  with

construction  site,  in  particular, compliance  with  this  sub

clause?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the definition of vector breeding, I personally feel

that  it  is  a  very important issue for the officer  to  judge

whether  the  owner of the premises had violated the regulation.

Take  a simple example that a house owner checks and clears  all

the possible breeding areas on a weekly basis, like clearing the

tray  under  a flower pot.  I am sure from the day  the  trapped

water  is cleared until the following week before the next check

takes  place,  rain water could be collected and a few  mosquito

larvae  could  be growing.  Before the larva is  turned  into  a

mosquito,  within a week it will be cleared and there should  be

no   mosquito  breeding.   Unfortunately,  nearer  the  date  of

checking, the Environment officer will come and find a few  tiny

larvae in the tray of a flower pot. The owner of the house  will

then  be  summoned  for  breeding mosquitoes.   In  my  view,  a

situation  like this is arguable, and I hope the Minister  could

make  it  clear  whether a situation which I have  described  is

considered to be breeding mosquitoes and therefore in  violation

of the provision of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 looks like it is unrelated to the Bill. Could the

Minister explain why one should not remove any vegetation within

six metres of any pond or stream?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know that chemicals used as vector repellents and

pesticides   could  endanger  lives  if  they  are   stolen   or

accidentally  discharged  into the  atmosphere  or  watercourse?

This  could  happen as a result of a leak caused by  the  impact

during  transportation or fire or flood in the premises  storing

the chemicals.  May I ask why the transportation and storage  of

such  potentially hazardous chemicals are not part of the  Bill?

Could the Minister explain?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise

to  speak  in  support of the Control of Vectors and  Pesticides

Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been instances, too often before, of offenders

of mosquito breeding sites taking fines too lightly and ignoring

warnings.  Recalcitrant offenders were flouting the laws in  the

maintenance   of  mosquito  breeding  grounds,   especially   on

construction sites.  This had caused a lot of inconvenience  and

annoyance to the dwellers around the mosquito breeding  grounds.

But,  more  importantly,  of course, this  had  facilitated  the

spread  of  dengue haemorrhagic fever which had caused  quite  a

number of fatalities.  Hopefully, this Bill will bring down  the

rising numbers of dengue haemorrhagic fever from a high of 4,300

cases last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to commend the following changes that

this  Bill brings.  Under this Bill, first offenders  face fines

of  up  to  $5,000  (five times more than  the  current  $1,000)

although  jail sentences remain the same at not exceeding  three

months.  Repeat offenders face fines of up to $10,000 (increased

from  the  current  maximum of $2,000) and  jail  sentences  not

exceeding six months.  The judge can choose to fine or jail  the

offender,  or both.  Although offenders who fail to comply  with

written  orders will face unchanged jail terms,  there  will  be

stiffer fines of $20,000 (up from the current $1,000).  Sir, the

stiffer penalties in this Bill should put across the seriousness

that  must be adopted in this area where negligent behaviour  on

the part of offenders can cost lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having more quality control over workers in this field,

through  certification of vector control operators,  technicians

and  workers,  is also commendable and is a first  step  in  the

right  direction.   This  will involve education,  training  and

examination of certain prescribed tests.  There was a survey  in

1996 which showed that about half of the 2,000 or so workers  in

vector control would be field operatives, and almost a third  of

these field operatives would have had only primary education and

would  also be inclined to be older workers.  Many in this group

have  been  in  their job for years and could neither  read  nor

write.   These  workers, therefore, may have problems  in  going

back  to  learn and to pass tests.  Mr Speaker, Sir,  I  suggest

that rather than

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>

denying  this  group of their livelihood, courses  conducted  in

their  own  dialects and oral, rather than written, examinations

should be arranged for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that public education is the key to achieve

successful  vector control.  Sir, I know that the  Ministry  has

put  in  a lot of effort in this respect.  However, more can  be

done   at   those  locations  where  the  incidence  of   dengue

haemorrhagic fever is especially high.  Door-to-door handing out

of  pamphlets  with  advice  and instructions  will  be  useful.

Instead of fines alone, households with breeding sites should be

given help to solve their individual specific problems.  A  list

of  certified  vector  control  operators  registered  with  the

Ministry  of the Environment should be made available and  given

to  the public when the certification of operators has been  put

in place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are inadequacies, however, in this

Bill  and I would like to see some addenda made in dealing  with

several  issues.  I would like to suggest that we look at  these

three issues:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, protection of the vector control operators and

technicians.   There  is  no provision  in  this  Bill  for  the

protection  of  workers from the harmful  effects  of  chemicals

found in insecticides.  There are many pesticidal chemicals that

cause  acute or chronic toxicity in humans.  Some commonly  used

chemicals  found  in  pesticides are (1)  organophosphates,  (2)

halogenated hydrocarbons, and (3) pyrethroids.  All of these can

be rather toxic, if misused.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organophosphates poisoning can cause convulsions,

paralysis,  cardio-respiratory depression and  coma.   Death  is

usually  due  to cardio-respiratory failure.  A fair  number  of

organophosphate  compounds  are  capable  of  inducing   delayed

neurotoxicity,  resulting  in  the  clinical  manifestations  of

sensory disturbance, ataxia, muscle twitching and weakness,  and

in   severe  cases,  complete  flaccid  paralysis.   Halogenated

hydrocarbons  can  cause  neurotoxicity with  manifestations  of

weakness,  paraesthesia and myotonia as well as  suppression  of

immuno-responses.  Pyrethroids are the safest of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>

the  three  chemicals mentioned.  Still, they  can  cause  acute

toxicity resulting in tremor, profused salivation and clonic  or

tonic seizures.  There are also reports of organophosphates  and

halogenated   hydrocarbons  having   carcinogenic   effects   in

experimental animals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the significant toxicity of the pesticides,

workers  in  this area should have regular medical examinations.

In fact, exposure to organophosphates is under section 69 of the

Factories  Act (Chapter 104).  Factory workers exposed  to  this

substance  must  have  compulsory and regular  examinations.   I

strongly  feel  that  workers in vector  and  pesticide  control

should  get  the  same  protection  as  those  workers  in   the

factories.   There should not be double standards of  protection

when both workers are exposed to similar toxic substances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, compulsory use of protective gear. There is no

mention  in  this Bill on the use of protective  gear  by  field

operatives.  Appropriate clothing, masks, gloves, goggles and so

on  should be advocated.  Preventive measures are very important

when  dealing with toxic chemical insecticides.  Educate workers

on  the  harmful effects of these substances and on  the  proper

ways  of  handling  them.   Make  the  use  of  protective  gear

compulsory for these workers.  Abate the possibility of  trading

the  safety  of  workers  for  the monetary  savings  that  some

companies or individuals consider as priorities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, setting up of a Review Committee. There should be a

permanent  Review  Committee that can  continuously  assess  the

permissible amounts of active ingredients used in the pesticides

in  Singapore.  The Committee should access continuing  research

and  current information to determine the safer chemicals in the

markets.   It  must  make  necessary  adjustments  and  aim   to

substitute more harmful substances with lesser ones.  Even  more

importantly, it must be alert and ready to abolish  the  use  of

seriously  toxic  or  proven carcinogenic  substances  from  the

market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,   since   independence,  Singapore  has   made   remarkable

achievements  in housing, environmental development   and  other

areas.   We  enjoy  the  reputation of being  a  "Garden  City".

Every year, we have been attracting millions of tourists to this

Garden   City,  and  this  must  be  attributed  to   the   good

comprehensive  planning of the various Government  agencies  and

the  cooperation of the people.  It is something that  has  been

achieved  by all of them through their cooperation.   Therefore,

we   must   step  up  our  efforts  to  preserve  our  beautiful

environment, and to maintain our "Garden City" reputation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, according to the report of the Ministry of the

Environment,  last  year, more than  17,000  cases  of  mosquito

breeding were detected.  In the first four months of this  year,

the  number  of  dengue haemorrhagic fever cases  has  risen  to

1,786.  In this beautiful Garden City of Singapore where a  high

standard of hygiene is maintained,  so many of these cases  were

detected.   I  think this is certainly something  that  warrants

our attention and concern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to further control vector breeding, the Ministry

of the Environment is moving this Amendment Bill to deal sternly

with people responsible for vector breeding in order to preserve

our  hygienic environment.  Under the new Bill, anyone found  to

be  responsible  for breeding mosquitoes in construction  sites,

premises,  ships  and even in the cabins of  aeroplanes  may  be

faced with a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment  not exceeding

three months, or both.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to preserve and protect the health of the people

of  Singapore and the reputation that we have in the world as  a

Garden  City, I support this Amendment Bill.  But to  make  sure

that  the new Act can be more effectively implemented,  I  would

like to make three suggestions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the work of vector control should be done

comprehensively.  In other words, the possible places and  sites

of  vector breeding should be embodied in the ambit of the  Act,

so that the various Government

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>

agencies will be better able to control the breeding places.   I

find  that  in the new Amendment Bill, the parks and undeveloped

vacant  land  have not been included.  Mr Speaker,  Sir,  public

parks are places that the public and tourists frequent.  In most

of  our parks and gardens we also have ponds.  Wherever there is

water,   there  is  an  opportunity  for  mosquitoes  to  breed.

Therefore,  we  should further control  these possible  breeding

places.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, vacant lands reserved for future development,

especially  vacant lands near the Housing and Development  Board

estates, should be further controlled and managed.  There should

be  regular  spraying  of insecticides to  prevent  breeding  of

mosquitoes.   When  I  went  on  house-to-house  visits  of   my

constituents,  many residents told me that a lot  of  mosquitoes

did  not  come  from the HDB flats themselves, but had  actually

come   from  undeveloped  lands,   woods  or  forests    nearby.

Therefore,  in order to have a better control of these potential

breeding  places,  I think we should  consider  including  these

undeveloped vacant lands and public parks in the ambit  of  this

Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we must have a national campaign against mosquitoes.

Every  citizen has a responsibility to do this, and it  is  good

for  everybody.   In  order to better  educate  our  public  and

promote their awareness on the possibility of mosquito breeding,

I  would  suggest  that the Ministry of the Environment  get  in

touch  with  the CDCs and the Town Councils, schools, residents,

especially  the private residents, to start a national  campaign

against  mosquitoes, so that we can eradicate all  the  possible

and  potential  mosquito breeding places  and  sites.   I  think

public education is more effective than fines alone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we must conduct training classes which are open to

the  public.   I  am  glad  to know that  the  Ministry  of  the

Environment  has  started training courses for  technicians  and

workers in vector control.  But because there are more and  more

cases  being brought to our notice, I hope that the Ministry  of

the Environment can conduct  more courses to train

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>

the  workers  and  the technicians so that  they  may  have  the

professional qualifications and skills to handle vector  control

work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, we have been hit by some kind of economic

recession and many workers have been retrenched.  We can  create

more  job  opportunities if the Ministry of the Environment  can

consider  providing training courses for the retrenched workers,

so  that  in this critical time they can have job opportunities.

This  is  like killing two birds with one stone.   In  order  to

achieve  the  objectives of vector control, I hope the  Minister

will consider my three suggestions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> First, let me thank the three Members

who  have  spoken  in support of this Bill.  Dr  Low  Seow  Chay

raised  quite a few points.  His first one was in terms  of  the

provisional certificate.  He felt that the nine months  for  the

provisional certificate, as provided under the Bill,  is  a  bit

too  generous.  Sir, we need to provide adequate  time  for  the

current  group  of  workers  to undergo  training  and  to  pass

examinations.   The  nine  months,  I  think,  are  just   about

adequate.   In  fact, in talking to the industry,  some  of  the

companies have requested for a longer provisional licence period

because,  as  pointed out by some of the speakers, some  of  the

current  crop  of  workers are not that well educated.   So  the

employers were afraid that even with the nine months,  they  may

not find that the time given to them long enough for them to  be

trained properly.  So the period of nine months, I think,  is  a

good compromise.  The industry's work can continue.  At the same

time,  we are giving the current group of workers adequate  time

to undergo training and to pass examinations.  Especially as the

last speaker has mentioned, with the poor economic situation, we

do  not  want to put any of these workers unnecessarily  out  of

work either.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also mentioned that the issuing of a certificate for

three  years  is a bit too lenient, that even for the  engineers

they  are only issued a one-year licence.  I think the effective

period  of  the  licence depends very much on the  organisation.

Many organisations, in fact, are now proceeding

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>

to  give  licences  of  a longer duration.   In  fact,  for  the

engineers,  unless I am wrong, I  think the one-year licence  is

renewed without any re-testing.  So it is just an administrative

process  of getting them to renew.  Similarly, for the  workers.

Once they are trained properly and have passed the examinations,

we  will  give them a three-year certificate to enable  them  to

carry  out  their  work.   But  at  the  same  time,  there  are

provisions  in the Bill for my Ministry to cancel their  licence

or  certificate  if  they  are found  to  have  contravened  the

provisions of the Bill.  So the safeguards are there.  If any of

these workers, although they are trained and they know what they

are  supposed  to do, do not comply with the requirements,  they

will then lose their licence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked why all the three groups, ie, the

operators,  the  technicians and the  workers,  are  categorised

under  the  same  provision,  in terms  of  penalty.   Sir,  the

penalties,  as provided under this Bill, represent  the  maximum

penalty.   As  to how much of the penalty they will  receive  it

will  actually  depend on the offences they have committed,  the

circumstances  surrounding the offence and the severity  of  the

offence.   It  will be very much left to the magistrate  hearing

the  case to decide how big a penalty to impose on them.  So  if

the operator is found to be the one who is responsible, then  of

course the operator will receive a larger penalty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked about the requirements this Bill will

pose  to the construction companies, in terms of compliance with

keeping their sites free of potholes, for example, and all areas

which  can allow vectors to breed.  Sir, the Bill is quite clear

in  this regard.  The owner or operator of a site is required to

ensure  that  the  conditions that can lead to the  breeding  of

vectors  are  totally eradicated.  For a construction  site,  it

means that if there are potholes or ponding in certain parts  of

the  site, they have to ensure that that area is levelled up and

the  potential  for  vector breeding is eradicated  because  our

primary concern must be for the health and safety of the people.

Filling up the potholes does not cost very much.  But if

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>

the  pothole  is not filled up and larvae start to breed  there,

people living near the construction site  will then go down with

dengue  and,  worse,  some may go down with dengue  haemorrhagic

fever which can, as Members know, lead to death.  So our concern

must  be  for the safety of our people and the cost involved  in

keeping the site clear of vector breeding potential, I think, is

very small in respect of the cost to the population otherwise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked if a house owner is liable if he has potted

plants  around  and he puts a tray under each potted  plant  and

water  collects there and larvae are found on the  trays.   Sir,

again,  the  Bill  is quite unambiguous.  Every  home  owner  is

responsible  for  ensuring that the conditions for  breeding  of

vectors  are  totally  eradicated.  That is  why  we  have  been

advising all home owners that if they have potted plants, please

remove the trays.  If they feel the need to have the tray there,

then  instead  of checking it every week, they should  check  it

every two days. Otherwise the responsibility is still theirs  if

mosquitoes are found to be breeding in that little pool of water

there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked about clause 20 and he says that it seems to

be  out of place.  Sir, clause 20 is a very specific requirement

and  it is meant to address the problem of breeding of Anopheles

mosquitoes.  The Anopheles mosquito is a vector for malaria  and

this  species  of mosquito breeds in streams and  seepage  water

and, more importantly, it requires sunlight.  Therefore, we have

to  make  sure that where there are streams, running  water  and

seepage  water,  the undergrowth is not unintentionally  cleared

away because that will then give greater access to sunlight  and

increase the potential for Anopheles mosquitoes to breed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked why the transport and storage of hazardous

chemicals are not part of the Bill.  Sir, I agree with him  that

it  is  important to regulate the transportation and storage  of

hazardous  chemicals.   It is under  a  different  Act.   It  is

catered for under the Poisons Act.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo also raised a few suggestions. Her first

suggestion is that since the workers in this industry tend to be

not very well educated, perhaps, the training courses should  be

in  dialects and, as far as possible, the examination should not

be  in  written  form.   Sir, in fact we do  intend  to  conduct

training  courses,  not just in dialects,  but  also  in  Malay.

Also,  most  of the questions would be in the form  of  multiple

choice  answers  to make it simpler for the workers  and,  where

appropriate, pictures will be used instead.  So this  will  make

it  much easier for us to test the understanding of the workers.

Our key priority is to make sure that the workers understand the

danger of what they are handling, how to protect themselves and,

more  importantly,  how to protect the general  public  who  are

living in the midst of where they are spraying, for example.  So

the examination will be conducted in such a way that we can test

their knowledge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, she asked that, in our effort to eradicate dengue

fever  and the breeding of Aedes mosquitoes, we should go  on  a

door-to-door campaign and that we should help the households  to

solve their specific problems.  Sir, I do not think it is really

possible  for us to do a door-to-door campaign, if  we  want  to

reach  out  to the whole country.  What we have is a very  broad

based  education approach where, throughout the year,  pamphlets

and brochures are being sent out to households, especially those

in  areas  which are prone to the breeding of Aedes  mosquitoes.

Then  we provide them with literature and the key advice on what

to  do.   For  those households which are found to  be  breeding

mosquitoes, we actually counsel and advise them on the  specific

steps to take.  For example, where the gutters are choked up, we

will  explain  to them the need to check the gutters  regularly,

clear  the gutters and even drill holes in the gutters to ensure

that  there  is  no  ponding of water in certain  parts  of  the

gutters which tend to sag over time.  What we have found is that

most  households  actually do know what they  should  be  doing.

When they are caught, they will say, "Yes, I wanted to do it but

I forgot."  So the key thing is to educate them and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>

tell  them that everyone needs to play a very responsible  role.

They  should put their knowledge into action and not assume that

everything will be well.  Because at the end of the day, if  the

Aedes mosquitoes are breeding, their own family members would be

the first to be bitten.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, she also pointed out that the chemicals present in the

pesticides  and insecticides are dangerous.  We are  introducing

this Bill because the chemicals are becoming more potent.  There

is  a  much  bigger range of chemicals now being  available  and

therefore  we  must ensure that the industry and those  who  are

involved  in the industry, from the operators to the technicians

to  the workers, are knowledgeable and trained.  So we are going

to  train  them and part of the training will also be  to  train

them  in handling the chemicals, to protect themselves and  also

the  general public.  We will also require the workers  and  the

technicians through the issue of a code of good practice to  use

proper  equipment and protective gear.  In this way,  this  will

protect  the  workers as well as the general public through  the

use  of proper equipment.  All the workers and technicians  will

be required to go for annual medical checkups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also proposed that a committee be set up to assess the

safety of the products.  Sir, Dr Neo will be happy to know  that

we  already have such a committee in operation.  It is known  as

the Advisory Committee for Hazardous Substances and Toxic Wastes

and this Committee is charged with reviewing the import, storage

and  use  of poison and other hazardous chemicals.  Sir,  it  is

already ongoing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng has asked that public parks and vacant

land should also be included in the Bill.  Sir, public parks and

vacant  lands are also covered because this Bill also binds  the

Government,  ie, all Government departments have to comply  with

the  provisions of this Bill.  If there are vacant State  lands,

for example, the body that is responsible for looking after that

State land is also

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>

responsible  for  ensuring that the  land  is  clear  of  vector

breeding  sites  and, if not, we will also take  action  against

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also stressed the importance of education. He said that

fines  are good but it is also important to educate the  people.

We do have a very active education programme going on.  It is  a

year round programme.  We have exhibitions at community centres,

shopping  centres and the various grassroots organisations.   We

will  continue to do that.  In fact, with the setting up of  the

CDCs,  we are now in active communication with some of the  CDCs

to  see  what  we  can  do,  in terms of   working  together  to

propagate the message in the constituencies under them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also suggested that, to make the training programme

more  accessible, we should arrange for more centres to  be  set

up.   Sir,  our intention is to have the private sector  conduct

the  training  eventually.   As a start,  we  will  set  up  the

training  programmes and the examinations, and we will encourage

private  companies to come forward and offer training programmes

which   we  will  then  vet  and  endorse.   Our  responsibility

eventually  will  only be to set the examinations,  certify  and

issue  certificates to the workers who qualify.  That is  indeed

our approach.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> I would like to clarify one point. Earlier

on, I did ask for increased surveillance only at locations where

the  incidents of dengue haemorrhagic fever are especially  high

and where door-to-door instruction pamphlets will be useful, not

for the whole of Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, in those areas where dengue fever

or  Aedes  mosquitoes are commonly found,  we  do  have  a  very

intensive  programme and this intensive programme also  includes

door-to-door campaign.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Clarification, Sir. What is the

penalty  for mosquito breeding grounds found on the premises  or

properties under the charge of, for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>

instance,  the  Ministry of the Environment, such  as  concealed

drains, sewers and sub-stations, or land under the Land Office?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, if they are found to be not

diligent, then the same penalties do apply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

<div align="center"><b>ADMINISTRATION OF MUSLIM LAW (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Community Development (Mr Abdullah

Tarmugi): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now

read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Administration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA) was enacted in

1968.   The  Act  establishes the Majlis Ugama  Islam  Singapura

(MUIS)  to  administer Muslim affairs and the Syariah  Court  to

decide  on  matters  such as divorce, custody,  maintenance  and

division  of matrimonial property.  Both the Syariah  Court  and

the  Civil  Courts  have co-existed for many years.   They  have

complemented each

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>

other  in  ensuring that justice is administered to Muslims  who

have  to  make  recourse  to the law  to  resolve  their  family

matters.  Muslim women have, for many years, looked to the Civil

Courts  to  claim  maintenance from their  husbands.   Over  the

years,  Muslims have also turned to the Civil Courts to  resolve

custody disputes under our Guardianship of Infants Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one important area where Muslim women, especially,

have  turned  to  the Civil Courts.  After a divorce  has  taken

place,  the Syariah Court may order that one party transfer  the

ownership of the home to the other.  Where that party refuses to

do so, the other party has often turned to the High Court for  a

Declaration  that  the  matrimonial  home  be  transferred,   as

directed  by  the  Syariah  Court.   Once  this  Declaration  is

obtained,  the  transfer papers can be executed by  the  Supreme

Court's  Registrar even if the party who is ordered to  transfer

the home refuses to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation has existed for many years. Both the Civil

Courts  and  Syariah  Court have worked  together  in  order  to

resolve  family  disputes involving Muslims.  Muslims  benefited

greatly  from this as there was a range of options open to  them

to  pursue  their quest for justice.  They have  had  a  choice.

Throughout  the entire period the Civil Courts were careful  not

to  interfere  in  the religious aspects of the  Syariah  Court.

Thus  the  Civil  Courts never interfered with matters  such  as

divorce,  betrothal,  nullity or the determining  of  iddah  and

mutaah.  These remained exclusively within the Syariah Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation changed in 1995 when, in the case of Salijah

v  Abdullah  Teo, the Court of Appeal ruled that Muslims  cannot

seek  a Declaration from the High Court.  Even though the  Court

of  Appeal  ultimately granted a Mandatory  Injunction  to  give

effect to the Syariah Court's order, there was concern that this

meant  that in future, Muslims could no longer turn to the Civil

Courts as they did before.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concern was exacerbated when in November 1996, in

Lathibaby's  case,  the  High  Court  ruled  that  it   had   no

jurisdiction

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>

to  hear custody and maintenance cases involving Muslim children

where the parents had either:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) applied to the Syariah Court for divorce; or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) had been divorced in that Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These cases have unsettled what has been an established

system for the Muslim community in Singapore.  Suddenly, Muslims

in  Singapore no longer enjoyed the avenues and choices they had

for  many  years  for  the resolution of  disputes  over  family

matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A real and urgent issue therefore had arisen which would

affect  pending and future cases.  Sir, let me give  Members  an

idea  of  the size of the problem.  In 1996, for example,  2,445

Malay couples filed maintenance applications in the Family Court

alone.  In 1997, there were 2,401 applications, and in the first

half  of this year, 1,407 applications.  The Syariah Court  will

not  be  able to cope with all these cases if it were to  handle

them alone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had consulted the Ministry of Law, AG's Chambers,

MUIS, the Syariah Court and Malay MPs.  They agreed with me that

unless we reinstate and formalise the situation that had existed

before  the  Lathibaby's  case, we would  face,  as  one  of  my

officials  put  it,  "daily queues forming outside  the  Syariah

Court  that  stretch  right down to Toa  Payoh!"   We  therefore

chose to restore the status quo ante.  But more than this,  Sir,

I  think  we  cannot, as a principle, deny Muslim couples  their

rightful access to the Civil Courts if they so choose this forum

to solve their disputes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment has been labelled by some people as

"reactive"   rather  than  taking  a  long-term  view   of   the

development  of  the  Syariah Court and the aspirations  of  the

Muslim  community.  Sir, I do not apologise for  this  approach.

When  a  man is drowning, taking the long-term view of  teaching

him   to  swim  does  nothing  to  save  him  from  his  present

predicament!  There is a problem that needed resolution and  our

responsibility   must  be  to  find  a  quick,   effective   and

practicable solution.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me reiterate that this Bill seeks to enable established

practices  which have worked satisfactorily to  continue.   What

the  Bill  proposes is that, as a base, the Syariah Court  would

have   jurisdiction  over  all  matters  presently  within   its

jurisdiction  where  the  parties are Muslims  or  were  married

according to Muslim law.  However, parties can agree  to  go  to

the  Civil  Courts  for  disputes over maintenance,  custody  of

children  and division of matrimonial property.  Where there  is

no  agreement, a Muslim party can only go to the Civil Courts if

he  first obtains leave from the Syariah Court.  A grant of such

leave  by the Syariah Court can be challenged.  Ultimately,  the

Syariah Court's Appeal Board will decide on the issue.  To avoid

duplicity of proceedings, the Bill provides that where one court

has  jurisdiction over a matter, the other court will  cease  to

have any jurisdiction over that matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give effect to all these, this Bill amends the relevant

provisions  of  both  AMLA  as well  as  the  Supreme  Court  of

Judicature Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have asked why cannot we just streamline and

strengthen  the  jurisdiction of the Syariah Court,  instead  of

reverting to the concurrent system.  Yes, we should do that  and

indeed  that  is  a matter which myself and my  colleagues  will

pursue.  But that will take time.  Meanwhile, we should not  let

matters  be  in  a limbo because it is not good for  the  Muslim

community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must stress at this stage that neither the Civil Courts

nor  the  Government is forcing concurrent jurisdiction  on  the

community.  Government has always held the view that the  Muslim

community itself will have to decide what it wants and where  it

wants to go provided it is in the context of the type of society

Singapore  is  and the role that the community  wishes  to  play

within this society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now refer to other parts of the Bill. Foremost

among  these  other  matters are the  conferment  of  additional

powers on the Syariah Court.  These will make the Syariah  Court

a much more efficient and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>

effective  body for the administration of justice to Muslims  in

family matters.  These additional provisions are as follows:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Giving effect to Syariah Court Orders -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes that Syariah Court Orders can be

registered  with the District Court for purposes of enforcement.

The  formidable enforcement machinery of the Civil  Courts  will

now be used to enforce judgements made by the Syariah Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Syariah Court can also now amend, vary or rescind its

orders.   Previously it had no such power and any  amendment  or

recission  of  an  order made must be by way of  appeal  to  the

Appeal Board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court can also now order costs to be paid by any party.

Additionally,  it can execute documents, such  as  transfers  of

property, on behalf of a defaulting party who has refused to  do

so.  This resolves the problem highlighted in the Salijah case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Improvements to Syariah Court Operations -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to improve the efficiency of the Syariah

Court  by  enabling additional Presidents to be  appointed.   It

also includes a new provision prescribing that decisions of  the

Syariah Court and the Appeal Board are final and that there  can

be  no  further appeal or review of these decision by the  Civil

Courts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Transitional Provision -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a transitional provision. We also have introduced

a saving provision enabling cases which are pending in the Civil

Courts  to proceed in these courts without the need for  consent

of the other party or leave from the Syariah Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to MUIS. Mr Speaker, Sir, the powers of

MUIS  also  need  to be enhanced to give it more  focus  and  to

enable  it  to operate its religious functions more effectively.

Since  1975, the Saudi authorities have preferred to  deal  only

with  MUIS on Haj (pilgrimage) matters.  This is largely due  to

the powers and good standing of MUIS as the supreme Islamic

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>

authority  in  Singapore, and the amendment seeks  to  recognise

this  key  function.  MUIS will be empowered to be the authority

to  regulate  pilgrimage  services. But  it  will  not  directly

operate or be involved in operating pilgrimage services itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MUIS has also been advising on halal matters as it is an

issue  of  concern to the Muslim public.  The proposed amendment

will give MUIS the sole authority to advise on halal matters, to

regulate  halal  certification, and to issue halal  certificates

itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prosecution of offenders under the Sale of Food Act and the

Penal Code remains unchanged, as of now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments will strengthen MUIS' position as the

authority on Muslim affairs in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unwise for MUIS as a religious body to be directly

involved  in  commercial activities, and as a  statutory  board,

MUIS  is  currently constrained from adopting market  practices.

AMLA  is  therefore to be amended to allow it, with my approval,

to  form  companies and joint ventures. Those current operations

of  MUIS  that are more commercial in nature, such  as  property

development, property maintenance and wakaf  administration, can

be  carried  out by subsidiary companies which can  manage  such

operations more effectively.  The separate accounting  by  these

subsidiary  companies will also enable MUIS  to  streamline  its

operations, make it more focused and prevent cross-subsidies  of

inefficient projects by more economically viable ones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accounts of MUIS will also be streamlined. The

accounts  of any trust, wakaf, nazar and mosque vested  in  MUIS

are  separate  accounting entities from  MUIS'  accounts,  which

comprise  the  General Endowment Fund, the Mosque Building  Fund

and  MENDAKI Fund and such other accounts which the Minister may

specify  in  the  Gazette.  It is not  necessary  to  have  them

consolidated  with MUIS' accounts.  The amendments will  clearly

separate these accounting entities from MUIS' accounts and  will

make them

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>

subjected to a separate audit.  MUIS will now separately control

and audit these accounts, and report the results to me.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other proposed amendments are:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Appointment of an acting President of MUIS in the event

of a sudden vacancy of the post.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The minimum amount in issue for appeal to the Appeal

Board from the Syariah Court will be raised from $25 to $450  to

discourage frivolous appeals.  The Appeal Board will have powers

to  charge  fees.  The term of office of the Appeal  Board  will

also be increased from one to two years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The penalties for teaching false doctrine or deviant

teachings  will be increased from $500 to $2,000 to serve  as  a

deterrent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the amendments proposed in this Bill will

strengthen  MUIS  and the Syariah Court.  We  will  continue  to

monitor  the  development of both these  institutions  and  make

changes where necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have discussed the amendments carefully with my

Malay MP colleagues and I have their support.  My colleagues and

I  understand and empathise with the aspirations of  the  Muslim

community.  We know too that the Muslim community's reaction  to

changes  to AMLA is generally positive although there  are  some

concerns  over  certain  amendments particularly  on  concurrent

jurisdiction.  I have received much feedback from the community.

To give these views a chance to be aired, heard and considered I

shall commit the Bill to a Select Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State for the Environment (Encik

Sidek  bin  Saniff) (In Malay):  Sir, I stand up to support  the

amendment proposed by the Minister in charge of Muslim Affairs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today we are going to debate on the issue of amendment

which  is  very significant to AMLA which has been in  existence

since 1968.  There are two areas

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>

of  importance and should be given due attention.  Firstly, with

regard  to  the  expanding power of MUIS and the  Syariah  court

especially;  and  the  other,  the parallel  power  between  the

Syariah Court and the Civil Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support fully the proposal of the Minister that the

amendments should be refined by the Select Committee.  The Malay

Muslim  community  should study closely the  existing  power  of

MUIS,  covering  the  performance of haj,  halal  food  and  the

issuance of certificates, joint ventures and the appointment  of

President of MUIS, etc.  This should be refined, even  though  I

believe  there  are  many  others who will  pay  more  attention

towards  the parallel power of the Syariah Court and  the  Civil

Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please allow me to touch on this very sensitive issue.

Firstly,  both these two courts (Syariah Court and Civil  Court)

have been utilised by the Malay Muslim community.  Previously it

was  not  encoded  in AMLA.  Now it has been  encoded  in  AMLA.

Secondly,  though it has been encoded, the choice is up  to  the

rights of the Malay Muslim community themselves.  The Government

or  the  Civil  Court has no power to force.  I  would  like  to

stress  here  that  this chapter, ie, the Civil  Court  and  the

Government have no power to force. Thirdly, the cases of Salijah

v.  Abdullah  Teo and Lathibaby could be one of the  reasons  to

have this parallel amendment.  Fourthly, the concern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These steps seem to be tidy and smooth with the intention

to  confer rights to the Singapore society as a whole.  However,

because  of  the  system  that  is  solid,  as  found   in   the

administration of the Civil Court, for instance, having a longer

history,  and  very systematic, that may influence many  people,

especially  those who do not understand fully and may  take  the

easy  way out by going to the Civil Court without due regard  to

other  avenues.   Indirectly,  this  problem  can  be  taken  to

embarrass the Syariah Court or the Islamic law. Then people will

start

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>

pointing  fingers  at  the amendment, even  though  without  any

malicious intent from anyone to slur anybody.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So too with having the additional President of the Syariah

Court.  The  purpose is to assist in settling the  long  waiting

list,  ie, from Syariah Court to Toa Payoh and these people  may

fall  into  committing  other evil deeds  because  of  the  long

waiting  list and this will cause more problems.  There  may  be

others  who will think that if that is not enough, why not  have

one  more Syariah Court so that you do not have to refer to  the

Civil Court.  I believe these matters must be resolved with  due

care by the Select Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some realities must be understood. Firstly, the parallel

power  may be taken as a problem.  The power between the Syariah

Court  and the Civil Court can be seen as a problem whereas  the

true  problem  is within ourselves, the Muslim  community.   The

problem  of the Malay Muslim community is with regard  to  their

moral  principles.  Thus, the Syariah Court  has  a  problem  to

settle  their matters as well as the Civil Court.   However,  if

the  Malay-Muslim  community fully value and appreciate  Islamic

laws and the teachings of their Prophet, maintaining harmony  of

familyhood, there is a possibility that the Civil Court may  not

be  used at all, nor even the addition of the President  of  the

Syariah  Court  will be needed.  This is the real  problem.   We

have to rectify  ourselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Koran it is stated: "This day I have perfected your

religion  for  you and completed thy favour unto you,  and  have

chosen for you as religion Al-Islam."  Islam is encompassing and

complete.  We have to equip ourselves with Islam.  The  Almighty

also  has stated that there is cure to every sickness, there  is

answer  to  every  question and solution to  every  problem.  We

should  not  blame anyone.  We ourselves must sort out  our  own

problems.   This  is also a challenge for us,  so  that  we  can

solidify our belief and approach of "removing wrongdoings  takes

precedence  over introducing new benefits". In line  with  this,

several regulated or systemic steps should be undertaken.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, a conscientious effort must be undertaken so that

teachings  of  Islam will be fully appreciated by the  community

and  that they will carry out what is required of them and  will

not  do that is not required of them.  The inculcation of  self-evangelism  or  dakwah  and  tabligh  plan  must  be  undertaken

involving all Islamic institutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the credibility and character of the Syariah

Court must be kept and maintained so that only those having  the

expertise  will  be chosen, particularly for  the  post  of  the

President of the Syariah Court.  The deep understanding  of  the

language  of the Koran is very urgent and cogent so  that  there

will be no other misinterpretation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, all Islamic scholars, Islamic leaders and

professionals  must  cooperate  to  contribute  their  knowledge

leading to the Islamic resurgence so that its followers will not

be  misunderstood by non-Muslims without regard to situation and

condition.  In fact, contributions from these Muslims are  being

expected  and hoped for as had been done by the Prophet  himself

towards  the  Jews and the Christians in Medina  which  made  it

possible for the existence of the Medina Charter or Declaration.

That was the first early charter of Human Rights which was multi-racial, multi-religious, full of tolerance and harmony.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Mr Speaker, I would like to think that the

amendment  of  AMLA  in relation to the parallel  power  of  the

Syariah  Court to the Civil Court is something that is temporal.

It is an emergency.  It is not something that will be permanent.

What  is permanent to me is a unique cooperation among  us.   An

important cooperation between two unique institutions, to ensure

peace,  harmony of its community.  Hopefully, this will  not  go

overboard  of  its  religion  in  this  unique  country.    This

uniqueness,   if  channelled  properly  can  give   us   benefit

tremendously  especially if it is less controversial  or  better

still  if  there is no controversy at all.  Then it  will  be  a

sweet  symbol of tolerance in a multi-racial community which  is

dynamic and sophisticated.  The propensity of this thing will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>

become  an impetus that will bring the Singapore community  that

is unique to a new millennium with a new burning spirit.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I thank you very much for giving me the chance  to

speak in support of the Administration of Muslim Law (Amendment)

Bill,  which  has  been proposed by the Minister  for  Community

Development  and  Minister  in  charge  of  Muslim  Affairs,  Mr

Abdullah Tarmugi.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment to the Administration of Muslim Law Act

(AMLA)  is  long  overdue and timely.  Now,  that  it  has  gone

through for years a process of thinking and formulation,  it  is

now before us for our common good.  Its passage seems to be very

rough  because of the many controversies enveloping it.   It  is

not  without  blessing though.  Hopefully, all of us  will  gain

enlightenment through this exchange of ideas, be  it  inside  or

outside the House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, I support the decision of Minister

Abdullah  Tarmugi to propose that the Bill be sent to  a  Select

Committee.  It is also my hope that the opportunity and the time

given  will  be  used fully for all parties  to  understand  the

background  of  the  thinking  behind  the  effort  to  do  this

amendment,  particularly with regard to the  parallel  power  of

Syariah  Court and the Civil Court; it should be seen  not  only

from an ideal principle perspective but also the reality of  the

situation.   If  we  were  to pay too  much  importance  to  its

principles  and  not  its practicality,  at  least  taking  into

account  the present needs and conditions, we will face problems

in finding solutions  to the problems which we face now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Truly, as a Muslim, I would wish the power that is bestowed

on the Syariah Court to be absolute, but if this were to be done

now, the question we have to ask ourselves is: will it assist us

or  otherwise?   Every Muslim would want to look for  blessings,

but  what  must be done wisely is that it must be practical  and

suitable to the conditions in the context of the history of  the

Singapore  society which includes being multi-racial and  multi-religious.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passage to look for the ideal model to implement a

Muslim  way of life is indeed far and long.  It must be done  in

stages.    It  is  better  to  be  slow  but  steady.    Islamic

governments,  countries or Muslim majority communities  are  not

one as to which model accurately fulfills their needs.  This can

be seen in the economic, political or even social system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your permission, Mr Speaker, my experience since 1973,

about  25  years  ago,  since attending the International  Youth

Conference  in  Libya, making research and  studies  as  to  how

Islamic   governments   and  countries  and   minority   Islamic

communities   handled   these  issues.  They   include   Islamic

developments  in the Middle East, and the Islamic revolution  in

Iran, Islam and secularism in Turkey, Malay/Muslim community  in

South  Africa, Pancasila and Islam in Indonesia and the thinking

and  process of Islamisation of UMNO and PAS in Malaysia, simply

show how varied these examples are.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Islamic world is at variance. In fact, they develop

animosity between one another in their search for a solution  as

to  how to imbue Islamic values and system of administration. In

the ASEAN region, through the cooperation of Mabims, (unofficial

cooperation among the Religious Councils of Indonesia, Malaysia,

Singapore   and  Brunei)  there  are  efforts  towards   finding

convergence and to learn different experiences from one another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should be proud that even though Singapore is generally

a  secular  country, Islam has an important  place  in  society.

Together  with other religions, Islam is encouraged to  play  an

important role that is positive and constructive.  The existence

of  MUIS  as  a  statutory body bears  testimony  to  that.   In

addition, the Registry of Muslim Marriages and the Syariah Court

play an important role with regard to the questions of marriages

and other ancillary matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way we handle these matters is being seen by others,

Muslims and non-Muslims in and outside Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>

This  is an important process.  It is a test for us to show  how

Islam  and  the  Islamic  community can live  harmoniously  even

though Singapore generally is a secular country.  The system  of

administration  and development programmes  that  are  found  in

Singapore  is  an example for other minority Muslim  communities

throughout the world.  In fact, there are also countries with an

Islamic  majority which may want to learn our system of  Islamic

administration.   Examples  which  I  can  put  forward  is  the

administration  of  MUIS,  the  question  of  construction   and

administration  of  mosques, the system of halal  certification,

marriage  registry and also the Syariah Court. We must pay  high

regard  to  these good examples.  Our community has  taken  bold

steps  in  many areas.  Ideas and programmes for the development

of  the Islamic community have borne results.  I believe and  am

confident  that we will continue to be able to show examples  of

good systems and ideas as to how to live in a secular and plural

environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the amendment of AMLA, particularly for MUIS and

the   Syariah   Court,  the  positions  of  these  two   Islamic

institutions can be strengthened.  For MUIS, although its  scope

of  work  has  expanded  and  MUIS has  undertaken  more  tasks,

including the management of the performance of haj, issuance  of

halal  certificates, wakaf development, family  development  and

various socio-economic projects, AMLA does not reflect that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this amendment, the position of MUIS, as the supreme

body of Islam in Singapore, will be `formalised'.  MUIS by right

should  expand its role in line with the needs of the times  and

aspirations  of the community.  However, MUIS must be  realistic

in  fulfilling these hopes to avoid a situation where  (a  Malay

proverb)  it  fails to get what it wants and at  the  same  time

loses  what is already at hand.  MUIS must be given the  support

for  manpower, particularly professionals who can shoulder  this

responsibility.  MUIS should be given the power which  is  wide-ranging  and  strengthened  with  even  bigger  resources.   The

community must show

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>

their  support  by giving more contributions  to  zakat  or  the

development fund of the mosques.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the question of the Syariah Court, if we

were  to look closely at the real situation, I am confident that

the  amendments bring more benefits than weaknesses.   This  has

been  clarified  by Mr Abdullah Tarmugi earlier.   However,  the

problem that has arisen, in fact a cause for controversy, is the

concurrent jurisdiction conferred on the Civil Court  to  handle

some aspects of divorce, including custody, maintenance and  the

division  of  matrimonial  property.   This,  as  stated  by  Mr

Abdullah Tarmugi, is not a new thing.  In fact, there were  many

other  such cases that were settled with the help of  the  Civil

Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this amendment, the power of the Civil Court to carry

out this task will be `formalised'.  There will no longer be any

controversy as to whether the Civil Court has the power  or  not

to   handle   the  matter.  The  situation  in  the   past   was

embarrassing.  Some people were saying as though we had no shame

to  ask  when  we were not welcome.  But with this amendment  it

will be official.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will definitely help. This is another alternative

avenue  to handle the cases.  Nevertheless, the concern of  some

sections of society is also true as the ground for settling  the

cases is based on a different basis of law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my mind, whilst we accept the concurrent system, we

should also monitor these cases so that the issue of conflicting

laws could be avoided.  The differences should also be explained

to  the community so that they will be more responsible in their

decision-making in order to resolve their problems. Besides, the

President  of the Syariah Court is empowered not to grant  leave

to  the  cases which it thinks need the attention of the Syariah

law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the process to enhance the resources of the Syariah

Court must continue.  In fact, it should be actively pursued  so

that  the  time will come when the Syariah Court can handle  all

these cases.  However, until we reach that stage,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>

we  must be realistic by taking this middle path. It may not  be

ideal  but  it  will ensure that we can cope with  the  problems

ahead of us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must realise that the resources in the Civil Court are

also  our country's resources too.  We must know how to  utilise

it  if  it  can  fulfil  the needs of the  Muslim  community  in

Singapore. Not all cases that can be handled by the Civil  Court

will  be in conflict with the Islamic tenets.  For these  cases,

the facilities of the Civil Court should be used together by the

Muslim   community.   These  resources  belong  to  the   Muslim

community too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, these amendments have been initiated with the

intention to improve the situation.  The aim is noble.  Although

not  ideal and perfect, it should be seen as a temporary way out

or  as  an  emergency  way  out,  while  the  Syariah  Court  is

strengthened.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  firstly,  I  would  like to  express  that  we  have  made

considerable progress and many laudable developments  have  been

introduced to the amendment of AMLA during its First Reading  in

this  House  on  20th April 1998.  What is  clear  is  that  the

amendments will provide various ways for MUIS to carry  out  and

widen its role more effectively.  Among others, as explained  by

the   Minister  for  Community  Development  and  the   Minister

responsible for Muslim Affairs, Mr Abdullah Tarmugi earlier, the

amendments  will  allow  MUIS  to form  or  participate  in  the

formation  of  companies, joint-ventures or  partnerships.  MUIS

will  also  be vested with the proper powers to deal with  Halal

issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is even more crucial, I believe, is the fact that the

amendments involve the enhancement of powers and capabilities of

the  Syariah  Court. Under the proposed amendments  the  Syariah

Court  will  continue  to  retain  exclusive  jurisdiction  over

matters,  such  as  marriage  issues,  divorce,  dissolution  of

engagements, dissolution of marriages and divorce orders.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these exclusive powers, the Syariah Court

will  also be bestowed with five additional powers, as described

in the Amendment Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, many of the additional powers in the

proposed  amendment are intended to strengthen the authority  of

the  Syariah  Court  so  that  it can  exercise  its  role  more

effectively.  However, I feel that some of the proposed  changes

may  have  contributed to some confusion. What  I  mean  is  the

parallel  or  concurrent jurisdiction which allows  Muslims  the

choice  of seeking remedy in ancillary matters, such as  custody

and  maintenance  claims  and division of  matrimonial  property

either at the Syariah Court or the Civil Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal for the amendment to the Act arises among

others,  from  the case of Mdm Salijah Abdul Latif and  Abdullah

Teo  in  1993   for  the  division of  matrimonial  property  as

mentioned by Mr Abdullah Tarmugi.  Two years later, the case was

brought  to the High Court before Justice Prakash who held  that

the  High  Court had no jurisdiction on the matter. Mdm  Salijah

appealed  but  the  Appeal Court agreed  with  the  decision  of

Justice Prakash.  Subsequently, the High Court rejected two more

cases  involving Muslim couples and these decisions  closed  the

avenue   for  Muslim  divorcing  couples  to  seek  remedy   and

resolution at the Civil Courts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Syariah Court is created because of

its  status  in  AMLA.   AMLA confers the jurisdiction  that  it

possesses and the High Court itself concurred  that it does  not

have  the  right to interfere in cases involving Muslim couples.

Therefore,  it  is  opportune for us and all those  involved  to

consider  deeply  and  thoroughly  how  the  amendments  to  the

Administration of Muslim Law Act can enable the Syariah Court to

resolve   problems  and  issues  of  divorcing  Muslim   couples

effectively,  especially in the areas of  matrimonial  property,

maintenance and custody of children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's context, the issues of matrimonial property,

custody and maintenance are not peripheral matters any

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>

more.  They are becoming more the core and crucial issues which,

more often than not, are matters for contention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we have the Civil Courts, I believe a more

comprehensive   solution   which  takes   account   of   Islamic

considerations  can  only be obtained by  couples  choosing  the

avenue  of  the  Syariah Court.  This includes the  question  of

custody,  division of property, apostasy of  couples,  rules  of

evidence,  and  other regulations. It is these very  differences

that led to the creation of the Syariah Court meant to specially

handle Muslim cases relating to the Syariah laws.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we must see this development as an effort

to  give enhanced recognition and authority to the Syariah Court

so  that the amendment to the AMLA will fulfil and overcome  the

shortcomings  and limitations that are inherent in  the  Syariah

Court.  Hence,  the amendment to AMLA in this  connection,  must

take into account the long-term implications.  The amendments to

AMLA should, as much as feasible, provide the Syariah Court with

sufficient  jurisdiction  to  enable  it  to  act  independently

according to the tenets of Islam, in line with the needs of  the

Muslim  community.  We must anticipate more complicated problems

to  emerge in future and as such, should properly equip that the

Syariah  Court with relevant powers of jurisdiction  to  prevent

the  Muslim  community from being trapped  again  in  a  similar

situation in the future.  Therefore, it is incumbent  on  us  to

explore  new approaches so that in the long term, Muslim couples

need  only  go to the Syariah Court to resolve their matrimonial

problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a known fact that Muslims in Singapore have made

their  claims  in the Civil Court since 1968.  But  it  must  be

borne  in mind that this is so because they really did not  have

much  choice,  owing to the shortcomings of  the  Syariah  Court

which  was  seen  to  be less effective compared  to  the  Civil

Courts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the proposed amendments to the AMLA are laudable

as it will help in reducing the backlog of long standing divorce

cases and also other cases that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>

have  remained  unresolved for a long period.  Undoubtedly,  the

proposed concurrent jurisdiction of allowing Muslims to have the

choice  of  resolving their ancillary claims in the Civil  Court

can  speed up many of these outstanding cases.  This is possible

because  of the efficient machinery, manpower and the  mechanism

that  are readily available in the Civil Court.  Because of  the

shortcomings in the Syariah Court today, this opportunity can be

maximised fully.  In other words, Muslim couples can refer their

cases   to  the  Civil  Courts  so  that  the  outstanding   and

complicated cases can be resolved quickly. This  could  continue

until  such  time  when  the situation (in  the  Syariah  Court)

improves and is more manageable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach, in my view, although effective, should be

employed in the short- term or temporarily only, while  we  work

towards  equipping  and beefing up the Syariah  Court  with  the

proper manpower, management systems, mechanism, expertise and so

on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, I feel the Government itself could feel proud if in

the midst of a plural and secular society, Singapore is able  to

create  a  credible Syariah Court. Since the amendment  to  AMLA

affects  the various aspects of life of the Muslim community  in

Singapore,  I think it would be proper for it to be carried  out

by  consultation,  taking  into account  the  views  of  various

quarters  in  the Muslim community in Singapore,  including  the

Muslim intellectuals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I am happy that the amendment to AMLA will

be  referred to a Select Committee as revealed by the  Minister,

Mr  Abdullah Tarmugi, earlier so that it can be looked  at  more

thoroughly,  with  considered views  of  the  community.   These

efforts  and endeavours will lead to the creation and upliftment

of  the  status of the Syariah Court  in the long term,  and  if

found  feasible,  a  status change from a tribunal  to  a  full-fledged  court  which  is  capable of handling  all  matrimonial

issues involving Muslim couples without having to resort to  the

Civil Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the amendment to AMLA

presented by Minister Abdullah Tarmugi.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Encik Harun A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Harun A. Ghani (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  this is the Malay language month.  I will begin my  speech

with  a  Malay pantun.  Roughly, it means that since Mr Abdullah

has  given  the  chance, many will be speaking and we anticipate

that it will attract a lot of criticisms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I fully support the Amendment Bill. Firstly,

this  Bill  is long overdue.   Thus, I congratulate Mr  Abdullah

Tarmugi for having the courage to bring this Bill to Parliament.

And  when  the Act is amended, it will bring much  good  to  the

Muslim community and no power is forcing it upon us to accept it

if  the  amendment is bad.  Of course, I think our Minister  has

discussed  with all his Parliamentary colleagues to  ensure  the

smooth  passage of the Bill so that the Bill can be accepted  by

all  levels of society.  Unfortunately, the final word from  the

Minister  is  that  he  wants to bring this  Bill  to  a  Select

Committee.   Of  course, I feel that the  Minister  wishes  more

people from the Muslim community to voice their problems through

consultation.   I  think, prior to that,  the  Muslim  Religious

Council  must  play  its  role  by calling  upon  all  religious

scholars and Muslim bodies to come to an agreement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, many matters have been touched on by our

colleagues  earlier and many are of the view that a  controversy

will  arise  regarding the issue of the Syariah  Court  and  the

Civil  Courts.   The  Minister  said  that,  without  having  it

enshrined  in  the law, the Muslim community has already  sought

redress in  the Family Court.  For example, in 1996, there  were

2,445  families; in 1997, 2,401 families.  And in the six months

of  this  year,  there were 1,407 families.   That  is,  without

having  it  enshrined  in the law, there were  already  so  many

cases.   So  I think that is a problem with the Muslim community

and it should not be enshrined by allowing the Muslims to go  to

the  Civil  Courts.  Indirectly, the image of the Syariah  Court

will  be  affected.  To me, we should leave the section  in  its

status quo.  That is my view.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say this because, without having it enshrined in the law,

there are already so

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>

many Muslims going to the Civil Courts.  And if you are going to

have it as a law, it is as if we are saying that Muslims can  go

to  the Civil Courts and ignore the Syariah Court.  That is  the

view  of  some  people.   We should look at  this  problem  more

thoroughly although the parallel jurisdiction is provided to the

Syariah Court and the Civil Courts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may arise a situation in which the two courts,

having  parallel  jurisdiction, may  pass  different  decisions.

And,  at the end of the day, we will have an orange sour on  one

half, ie, sour on the side of one court and sweet on the side of

the  other  court.   The  ones who will lose  will  be  our  own

community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I commend the proposal by the Minister to bring

this  amendment Bill to a Select Committee because he feels that

this  is an opportunity and chance for the Muslim bodies, Muslim

community,  scholars, experts, especially those who are  experts

in  legal  matters, to come together to look into this  Bill  so

that  the  amendments proposed will have the  agreement  of  the

whole community.

<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this

amendment  to  the Administration of Muslim Law  Act  (AMLA)  is

indeed very comprehensive and wide-ranging.  It covers two major

institutions  governing  Muslim life in Singapore,  namely,  the

Islamic  courts,  better  known as the Syariah  Court,  and  the

Muslim Religious Council of Singapore, better know by its  Malay

acronym, MUIS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment constitutes the first major amendment to AMLA

since  its inception more than 30 years ago.   AMLA was approved

in  this House on 17th August 1966 after it was sent to a Select

Committee.  In 1975, changes were made to allow Muslims to  make

contributions to the Mosque Building Fund via the CPF check  off

system.   Two  review committees were formed: one  in  1985  and

another in 1992.  These committees recognised the need to  close

some  gaps in the existing legislation and to provide new powers

to key Islamic institutions to keep up with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>

a  changing Muslim population in Singapore.  However, in closing

these gaps, careful deliberation was also needed given the  very

sensitive nature of any attempt to change matters pertaining  to

Singapore's  Muslim institutional framework.  I  must  therefore

congratulate  the  Minister  in charge  of  Muslim  Affairs,  Mr

Abdullah  Tarmugi, for finally closing the loop  after  13  long

years.   We, as a community, had to  close the gaps.

<br><br><i>Changes to MUIS</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the changes the amendment makes to MUIS

are  indeed welcome.  The move to empower MUIS to regulate halal

certification and pilgrimage or haj reflects the need to  better

manage  changing expectations within the community.   Many  food

outlets  in Singapore have recognised the growing Muslim  market

and  have  turned halal in order to attract this market.   MUIS'

new  role  in  the  regulation  of  halal  certification  should

reassure   the  Muslim  community  that  outlets   with    halal

certification are halal throughout their operations.  Similarly,

with  this  amendment, MUIS will have the power to regulate  and

penalise  travel  agents  offering  haj  packages.   With  these

changes,  Muslim pilgrims will be better protected and they  can

concentrate  on  the  rituals without  worrying  about  flights,

hotel,  meal  service, ground transportation and  other  related

matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment would also allow MUIS to form companies to

develop  fully its assets, especially its vast land bank,  which

it   holds  under  wakaf   or  trust.   The  role  of  wakaf  is

essentially charitable.  Properties remain in perpetuity but the

profits  are  channelled to help charitable  institutions.   The

Minister  has assured us that MUIS will not be directly involved

in the running of these companies.  However, the amendment gives

MUIS  an  avenue  of  ensuring that  its  assets  are  optimally

developed.  This will ultimately benefit the community at large.

These  changes,  as  I  said earlier, are a  reflection  of  the

growing  expectations of the community and  of  the  community's

expectations that MUIS plays a greater and effective role in the

affairs  of the community.  Hence I support totally the  changes

to MUIS.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Changes to Syariah Court</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment also has a major impact on the Syariah

Court,  which is empowered to deal with Muslim personal  matters

in Singapore.  Over the years, many Muslims have resorted to the

Civil  Court  to seek enforcement of judgments.   We  frequently

hear  about  the problems Muslim women and their  children  face

when  husbands  refuse to sign the transfer  documents  for  the

matrimonial home.  Often, these women do not have the  financial

resources  to  set up a household on their own.   The  amendment

would  allow  the Syariah Court President to sign  the  transfer

documents  if the husband fails to do so after being instructed.

This  is a significant move towards reducing the financial  pain

and  anguish  which  has too often been associated  with  Muslim

divorces in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another key change made by this amendment is the

strengthening  of  section 53.  With this  change,  the  Syariah

Court  now  can  make  use of the infrastructure  of  the  civil

justice  system  to  punish errant couples.   Section  53  gives

powers to the court to jail anyone refusing to comply with court

orders.  However, making use of these powers requires an  entire

support  system.   For  example, the setting  up  of  bonds  and

services  of  a bailiff are needed in order to ensure  that  the

jailed person's rights are observed.  The Syariah Court does not

have  these facilities.  With this amendment, the Syariah  Court

can tap into the existing resources of our justice system.  This

approach should be seen as an opportunity for the Syariah  Court

to develop further its own strength and human resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps the most significant change this

amendment would bring is the adoption of the so-called  parallel

jurisdiction  approach.  A couple, as mentioned by the  Minister

earlier, can now choose to proceed to either the Civil Court  or

remain  in  the Syariah Court after a divorce has been  granted.

As  a result, ancillary matters such as custody, maintenance and

the  disposal of the matrimonial home can now be dealt  with  in

either the Civil Court or the Syariah Court.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>

However, to proceed to the Civil Court, both parties, ie, the ex-husband  and  ex-wife, would have to agree to  do  so.   If  the

couple does not agree to do so, the party wishing to proceed  to

the  Civil  Court  can apply for leave from  the  Syariah  Court

President  to  grant  them permission to proceed  to  the  Civil

Court.   For  the House's information, and as mentioned  by  the

Minister  earlier,  Muslim couples have in the  past  chosen  to

proceed to the civil courts.  However, this avenue was closed as

a  result  of  the case of Madam Salijah Latif.  This  amendment

restores  this avenue.  The question is whether re-opening  this

avenue  is  the  right  thing  to do.   The  so-called  parallel

jurisdiction  approach this amendment adopts  has  raised  fears

that it will dilute Islamic law in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us consider the practical impact this amendment will

have  in greater detail.  Would a Muslim couple be given similar

justice  if they proceed to the Civil Court instead of remaining

in  the Syariah Court in the case of an amicable divorce?  I  am

not  a  lawyer.  But I believe both the Syariah and Civil Courts

would  take into account the interests of the wife, husband  and

children  in  making decisions pertaining to ancillary  matters.

In such cases, Muslim couples would not be short changed if they

proceed  to  the Civil Court.  Hence, with this amendment,  such

couples  would have more legal avenues and would likely be  able

to  resolve  ancillary matters in a shorter time.  A divorce  is

never  easy.  The sooner the couple and the children can get  on

with  their  lives, the better it will be for all  parties.   So

under what circumstances would different legal outcomes arise?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there are instances where the outcome under

Islamic  law  is  different from the outcome  under  civil  law.

Consider  the  following example.  The husband  renounces  Islam

after the divorce.  If the couple has a young child, it is  very

likely  that the Syariah Court would grant custody to the Muslim

wife.  But what happens if the non-Muslim husband makes a better

parent?  What happens if the Muslim party is a drug addict?   In

such  a case, the Civil Court would most likely give custody  to

the responsible parent.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>

Of  course, when the Syariah  Court grants custody to the Muslim

parent,  I  believe it takes the view that the  raising  of  the

children  according to Islam is to be done  by  the  family  and

community and not only by the parent.  The Minister has given us

the  assurance  that  the  religion  of  the  children  will  be

considered  by the Civil Court.  Perhaps the public  is  looking

for further guarantees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Islam, conduct is an important criterion in determining

custody.  A bad wife, as an example, is unlikely to gain custody

of the child.  In the civil system, conduct is quite immaterial.

An  adulterous  wife may be given custody of the child.   Hence,

this  is  another instance where you may get a different  ruling

from the Civil and Syariah Courts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of these differences, great pains will need to be

taken to address the concerns recently raised about the dilution

of  Islamic law under the amendment.  In particular, we need  to

examine carefully whether the amendment provides for an adequate

gate-keeping  mechanism  to  prevent  such  differing  outcomes.

Requiring  a  couple that disagrees on proceeding to  the  Civil

Court  to  apply for leave from the Syariah Court can, in  fact,

work   to   ensure  that  problematic  cases  are   dealt   with

appropriately  in  the Syariah Court. But  this  raises  another

concern.  While I believe that it is good to give powers to  the

Syariah  Court to decide on leave applications, it is  important

that  we  make this process transparent.  Could we not  consider

outlining some conditions under which leave could be granted  or

otherwise?   While I am confident that the Syariah Court  judges

would  decide  such  applications  wisely,  I  am  sure  that  a

transparent process would reassure the community that leave will

not be granted solely in the interest of bureaucratic expediency

and not on the merits of the case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment also makes the Muslim couple

responsible for deciding which system they want their case to be

heard  in.   I  believe this is a very good approach.  Divorcing

couples must be made aware of the repercussions of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>

divorce, especially on the children.  The amendment would  allow

the  divorcing  couple to decide which legal avenue  would  most

effectively  serve their personal and children's interest.   But

measures  must be taken to ensure that the Syariah Court's  role

in  divorce  proceedings is not undermined by our  ever  growing

hunger for expedient quick fixes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Syariah Court is a very unique institution. The

lawyers who appear before the judge are trained in civil law and

not  in  Islamic law.  The judge, however, is trained in Islamic

law.   This anomaly perhaps reflects our position as a  minority

Muslim  community within a larger multi-racial, multi-religious,

multi-cultural society where the law of the land is not based on

any  religion.  Hence, Sir, in reflecting upon the  impact  this

amendment  will have on the Syariah Court, I have  thought  more

broadly  about  the position the Syariah Court  has  within  the

context  of  the larger legal system in Singapore.  The  Syariah

Court plays a special role.  It occupies an institutional niche,

dealing  as it does with Muslim personal matters - a substantive

area  which other courts do not have the professional competency

to  operate  in.  This amendment establishes a stronger  linkage

between  the  Syariah  Court and the  broader  legal  system  in

Singapore.   Under  it, the Syariah Court can  more  easily  and

fully tap the expertise and resources of our legal system.  But,

Sir,  could we not find ways to make the link stronger?  With  a

stronger  link,  for example, the training and the  professional

career  track  opportunities of the Syariah Court  judges  could

more  closely mirror those of the judges and legal staff  within

the  broader  legal system.  The sharing of resources  would  be

more  complete and comprehensive and could include the  location

of the Syariah Court within the same legal complex as the Family

and other Civil Courts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe this amendment in its net effect is

beneficial  to  the Muslim community.  Some have criticised  the

amendment, arguing for the creation of a separate Syariah  Court

system unto itself.  Creating an entirely separate system

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>

would   not  only  demand  very  large  financial  outlays   but

substantial  commitments in training and recruitment.   Much  of

these  outlays  would  merely go into duplicating  services  and

competencies  already available in the larger  legal  community.

Creating  such a system would also require time.  One  needs  to

ask whether such outlays and commitments are the best use of our

limited resources.  The present amendment, by taking an approach

which  taps  into existing resources, eliminates  this  resource

allocation  issue.  It does, however, raise concerns  about  the

dilution  of Islamic law in Singapore.  As I mentioned  earlier,

safeguards are needed to address these concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this amendment. The original AMLA Bill in

1966  was  sent  to  a Select Committee.  I  am  glad  that  the

Minister  has  decided  to  send  this  amendment  to  a  Select

Committee.   It  will give the opportunity to the  wider  Muslim

community  to  express their concerns.  It  will  also  just  as

importantly give us the chance to hear views outside this House.

In dealing with such a Bill which will affect the religious life

of  the  Muslim community in Singapore, let us take  every  step

possible  to ensure that the concerns of the minority community,

of which I am a member, are addressed completely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, I believe this Bill is about the identity and

self-confidence of a community within the context  of  a  larger

Singaporean  society.  How that community,  my  community,  sees

itself  is  important to all of us here today and  outside  this

House.   If  my  community  feels that its  private  space,  its

ability to practise its own religious beliefs, is at risk,  then

the  common  ground  that  we share,  as  Singaporeans,  can  be

diminished.  However, if my community feels secure in the belief

that  it can be both Muslim and Singaporean, then we would  have

all served the interest of the community and nation wisely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you.

<br><br><!-- Encik Ibrahim bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Ibrahim bin Othman (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Sir,  I rise in support of this Bill.  Since it was enacted more

than

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>

30  years  ago,  AMLA  has fulfilled the  needs  of  the  Muslim

community  in  Singapore.  With AMLA, the Muslim  community  has

been  able to live comfortably and is able to progress  together

with others in Singapore.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>5.20 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our success in building modern mosques, religious schools,

raising funds to be distributed to different groups, development

of  wakaf  land,  clearly  shows the effectiveness  of  AMLA  in

bringing the community to a higher status.  The question now  is

this: is AMLA able to continue to fulfil the aspirations of  the

Muslim  community  in  facing future challenges?   I  think  the

amendments can be said to be a positive and progressive step  in

assisting the Muslim community to face future challenges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must realize that the Muslim community is a minority in

Singapore.   Like other communities, we are subject to  all  the

laws enacted in Parliament.  Although our country is based on  a

secular  system, the Muslim community is fortunate because  AMLA

has  been created specifically for the Muslim community  looking

after us in the practice of Islam.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must ensure that AMLA does not make our community to be

alienated from the lives of the larger multi-racial community in

Singapore.    The  amendment  to  AMLA  this  time   is   rather

comprehensive and reflects the practical approach of the  Muslim

community  in  a plural and secular society in Singapore.   Sir,

the  amendment  to  section 3 gives a  clear  provision  on  the

functions and role of the Muslim Religious Council of Singapore.

MUIS,  as  the body responsible for Islamic affairs,  will  have

wider powers and need therefore to raise its service to be  more

effective.   To be a more effective corporate body  in  carrying

out  its  responsibilities, MUIS must attract more young talents

to conduct its programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The professionals working in MUIS will then be able to lead

the community so that it will rise above the challenges,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>

especially  when we approach the new millennium. In relation  to

the  Syariah Court, I support the amendment to section 35  where

the  President  of the  Republic of Singapore can  appoint  more

than  one President of the Syariah Court.  The measure  to  have

more than one President in the Syariah Court will alleviate  the

existing burden of the President of the Syariah Court. I am sure

there  are many more cases that can be quickly resolved  in  the

Syariah Court.  By virtue of new section 35, the position of the

Syariah  Court will be enhanced as a legal institution of  equal

status  with  the Civil Court in resolving divorce  cases  among

Muslim couples.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with the additional powers to be granted to

the  Syariah  Court.  Among them is the proxy  power  where  the

President of the Syariah Court can sign documents of transfer of

property on behalf of those who refused to do so.  There is also

the  enforcement of orders where the Syariah Court can impose  a

penalty  against  those who refuse to comply  with  its  orders.

With  these  amendments and having capable staff,  I  think  the

Syariah  Court  will  be able to perform its  duties  fully  and

resolve  the  family  disputes  of  the  Muslim  community  more

effectively in future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are some quarters in the community which are

concerned  about  new  sections 35A and  35B  allowing  divorced

Muslim couples to choose the civil law for the determination  of

custody,  maintenance  and division of  matrimonial  properties.

They  are  fearful  that  the Islamic  law  will  not  be  given

consideration in determining the solution of these cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of Muslim couples resolving maintenance

and custody matters in the civil court is not a new matter.  For

a  long time, many Muslim women have gone to the civil courts to

obtain   maintenance  from  their  husbands.   Similarly,   with

custody.  After divorce, they have accepted the decision of  the

Civil  Court. This clearly shows that the Syariah Court and  the

Civil  Court  have  been able together to play  a  role  in  the

management

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>

of  the problems of Muslim couples.  As Muslims are also subject

to  the  law of the State, they cannot be prevented from seeking

justice  from  the Civil Court.  I support the  move  to  enable

Muslim  couples  to seek resolution in the Civil  Court  in  the

matter of custody, maintenance and division of property if  this

does not contravene the Islamic law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister responsible for Muslim

Affairs  if there are any decisions of the Civil Courts  so  far

that  have been in conflict with Islamic law.  If there are any,

I  believe it is the duty of the Syariah Court to advise  Muslim

couples  that  they  should  not  seek  the  solution  of  their

matrimonial  matters  in  the  Civil  Court.   Of  course,   the

appropriate  action  would  be  for  the  Syariah  Court  to  be

strengthened  with  qualified officials  who  will  be  able  to

resolve their problems quickly.  I would also like to know  what

is  the  position  of  the Mufti and the members  of  the  Fatwa

Committee on having matters resolved in the Civil Court.  If the

Syariah  Court  currently is not able to  perform  its  duty  in

resolving  the  problems  of  Muslim  couples  effectively   and

quickly,  could that be made an excuse for going  to  the  Civil

Court?  I think this must be explained more carefully.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to move on to the role of MUIS in the

management  of  mosques  and madrasahs  (religious  schools)  in

Singapore.   The  Muslim community generally welcomes  the  step

taken by MUIS to encourage mosques to display their accounts  to

the congregation and this will enable the congregation and other

philanthropists  to  know  the true financial  position  of  the

mosques.   Mosque officials appointed by MUIS must  be  suitably

qualified  residents who would therefore be able  to  carry  out

their  duties more effectively.  The plan by MUIS  to  employ  a

permanent   full   time  administrator  for  every   mosque   is

appropriate in the effort to enhance the status of the mosque as

a  corporate body.  In the management of the religious  schools,

MUIS  must  make  a decision on the structure  or  form  of  our

madrasahs.  The original aim of the madrasahs, as we know, is to

provide  indepth knowledge on Islam and for us  to  provide  the

scholars

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>

of  the  future.  Today, more parents are sending their children

to  study  in full-time madrasahs.  Therefore, there  is  now  a

group  of  our  children  who  miss  the  chance  of  undergoing

education  in  regular schools which are, of course,  of  higher

quality.  They also miss the opportunity to mix with children of

other  communities.  Is this trend good for  the  community  and

country?  That is the question that we must consider.   Can  the

madrasah graduates contribute to the economy of the country  and

can our children gain the quality education in madrasah?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Muslim community must find the answers to these

questions and decide on the appropriate madrasah system for  our

children.   Hence,  as  parents,  we  are  responsible  for  our

children  and we want our children to be pious Muslims and  good

citizens  who  can  contribute to the  country  later.   As  the

amendment  to  AMLA must be done in the spirit  of  consultation

within the Muslim community, I support that the Bill be referred

to a Select Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Information  and  the  Arts (Encik Yatiman  Yusof):   Mr  Deputy

Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion made in the  name  of

the Minister for Community Development and Minister-in-charge of

Muslim Affairs, Mr Abdullah Tarmugi.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, in 1995, as the Minister had earlier

stated  in  his  speech, the High Court ruled that  the  Muslims

involved  in matrimonial case could not seek a declaration  from

the  Court  of Appeal.  Then, the following year the High  Court

ruled   that  it  had  no  jurisdiction  to  hear  custody   and

maintenance cases involving Muslim children.  Since then,  there

has  been a backlog of cases.  The number is about 200 cases per

month or 2,000 cases per year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of dysfunctional families and the increase in

divorce  cases  is  not  peculiar to  the  Muslim  community  in

Singapore.   Other communities too experience it.  However,  the

problem for the Muslims had been compounded by the fact that the

Syariah Court could not handle the volume.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to this, the Subordinate Courts had been helpful in

clearing the backlog.  The Subordinate Courts took the view that

there  were  conflicting decisions and  took  the  cases.   Now,

following the High Court's ruling, this is not possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: what shall we do? The amendment of AMLA

is  intended, inter-alia, to solve this urgent problem which  is

growing  day  by  day,  apart  from  strengthening  the   Muslim

Religious  Council  (MUIS).   It  is  unfortunate  that   public

reactions  tend  to focus on the independent and  non-concurrent

jurisdiction of the Syariah Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there could be several reasons why public reactions

have been such.  The Administration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA) had

been introduced about 30 years ago.  Since its introduction, one

generation  had  passed  by.  New problems  and  challenges  had

emerged.  The Muslim community had undergone major change.   The

expectation  of  the community had increased.  Better  education

and  higher  standard  of  living had fueled  their  confidence.

Thus, when the proposed amendments were made known to them, they

aspire  for more.  They want the Syariah Court to be the supreme

governing body over Syariah laws.  They want this position to be

safeguarded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, their reaction is understandable and, as

a  Muslim, I share their concern.  But what we need to do is  to

take into account the circumstances in which the amendments  are

introduced in this House.  However, before going into this, Sir,

we  need to view the amendments in its entirety.  The Bill seeks

to  amend  AMLA  (Chapter 3).  Apart from conferring  concurrent

jurisdiction  on  the  Civil Courts and  the  Syariah  Court  in

certain  matters, it also extends the function of  Majlis  Ugama

Islam, Singapura, extends the powers of the Syariah Court, deals

with  halal certification, haj matters and the teaching of false

doctrine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall objective is to have a stronger and a more

effective  MUIS  and to enhance the power of the Syariah  Court.

It is my belief that with these amendments,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>

and given the strong resolve of the Muslims in Singapore, we can

be better prepared to enter the new millennium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move into the amendments involving the

Syariah  Court.   Why  does  the Government  choose  to  have  a

concurrent jurisdiction?  This is the question lingering in  the

minds  of  the Muslims.  The Minister is absolutely  correct  in

using  the  analogy of a drowning person.  In other  words,  the

amendments  are  meant  to  tackle  problems  in  an   emergency

situation.  I wish to add a number of reasons to this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, even in a non-emergency situation, experience in law-making process or process of legislation in many countries

showed that the process is often an evolutionary one.  Singapore

is  of  no  exception.   In  our case, despite  its  origin  and

historical roots, Islam has grown up in an independent  country.

This  being  the case, it has to embody this society in  itself,

and  has to order, encourage and promote it.  It has to regulate

order and regulate this society, adopting its principles and its

spirit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are fully aware that the theological beliefs of Islam

are not divorced in nature, or in objective, from the day-to-day

life of the Muslims.  In fact, the way we conduct our day-to-day

life  reflects the belief and the customs of the Muslims  vis-a-vis a multi-racial environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments, therefore, should be seen as part of this

evolutionary  process.   As  the circumstances  change  and  new

demands  arise,  just  like other laws,  it  will  be  improved,

strengthened  and  even  changed.  In my  view,  the  concurrent

jurisdiction  is  a transitional arrangement  and  therefore  is

acceptable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we not achieve the "ideal" state and have the Syariah

Court  that  is  seen  as the supreme governing  body  over  the

Syariah law?  The answer is, it is not impossible, but it  takes

a  long  time.   For  the time being, we  have  to  do  what  is

practicable,  while we strengthen the Syariah  Court's  staffing

and administrative capabilities so that they can carry

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>

the  heavier  and more complex responsibilities of  the  future.

Sir,  the  nation's  legal  system gains  its  great  reputation

through similar evolutionary process.  Rome was not built  in  a

day.  We need to be patient.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, experience in other countries in which Muslims form

either  the majority or minority population showed that  Syariah

or Religious Courts can take varied forms and exist in tandem or

side  by  side  with the secular legal system of the  respective

countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was informed that, in Pakistan, the Syariah Courts do not

enjoy  the  position as the supreme body over the Syariah  laws.

The  Pakistani Supreme Court is the supreme body over  both  the

Civil  and Syariah Courts.  The Civil Courts and Syariah  Courts

exist  in parallel and the Syariah Courts in Pakistan have given

the  Civil  Courts concurrent jurisdiction on matters pertaining

to  the  resolution of post-divorce issues.  Of course,  Islamic

law is the law of the land in Pakistan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Malaysia, according to the Information Malaysia 1998

Yearbook, prior to 1988, some cases involving Muslims  could  be

heard  by  the  secular courts.  In 1988,  Article  121  of  the

Constitution was amended so that the secular courts of  Malaysia

no  longer  have  any jurisdiction over any matters  within  the

jurisdiction of the Syariah Courts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Egypt, according to a former Egyptian High Court Chief

Justice,  there are no separate Syariah Courts  in  Egypt.   All

Syariah Courts were subsumed under the Civil Courts since  1955.

The  Civil  Courts  in Egypt comprise district  governorate  and

higher appeal courts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, Civil Courts are divided into chambers that deal

with  civil,  commercial and personal status matters separately.

The  chamber  of personal status administers the  Syariah  laws.

Hence,  all jurisdiction on matters pertaining to the resolution

of  post-divorce issues falls under the Civil Courts or enforced

under  the  civil power.  The Civil laws in Egypt are  based  on

written  laws  issued  in  the late 1920s  and  formulated  from

Islamic law and Islamic jurisprudence.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In India, I was informed that the Syariah Courts do not

exist.   However,  India  does not have a  uniform  civil  code.

There is a statute called "Sharia Act".  When Muslims appear  in

a  Civil Court (on divorce matters), the judgement on the  cases

is  based on Syariah laws through the application of the "Sharia

Act".  They could appeal all the way to the Supreme Court, which

will review their cases according to the Syariah laws.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Indonesia, the Religious Court (this is the term used

for the Syariah Court in Indonesia) is not the supreme body over

the religious and Syariah laws.  Chapter 1, Articles 1 and 2  of

the Indonesian Laws No. 7/1989 on Religious Court state that the

Religious  Court  is  the judicial body for Muslims  in  certain

civil cases as determined under Chapter III, Article 49.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The areas that come under the jurisdiction of the Religious

Court   in   Indonesia   are  those  pertaining   to   marriage;

inheritance,  wills,  and  grants based  on  Islamic  laws;  and

property  donated for religious or community use as  charity  or

wakaf.   The  Religious Court co-exists with Civil Courts.   The

Civil Courts enjoy the same position as the Religious Court  and

each  has  its own judicial authority.  In Indonesia, there  are

four  judicial  bodies.  They are Civil Court, Religious  Court,

Military   Court   and   State   Administrative   Court.     The

administrative, organisational and financial responsibilities of

each  of  these  Courts  come  under the  respective  Ministries

although they are established under the Supreme Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reason why I dwell at length on the experience of

Muslims in other countries is none other than to emphasise  that

there are many ways of implementing the Syariah laws and, as the

saying goes, there are many roads to Rome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is important is that we have to be creative in

deploying  selective  elements of Islamic  traditions,  combined

with  ideas,  techniques, institutions  and  facilities  of  the

present  and  recent  past  to cope with  the  specially  modern

predicament:  political, social, economic  and  cultural  issues

that  emerged as a result of the changes that have affected  the

world.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, let me ask this question. Do the amendments

proposed by the Minister take away or in any manner deprive  the

Muslims  of  their rightful choice for the avenue  to  seek  for

justice?  The answer is no.  The amendments give the Muslims the

right  to  exercise  their free will.  The control  is  entirely

within the Muslim community themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, individual justice can never be fully satisfied

within  the  condition of existence.  We can follow all  Islamic

rules that, in their ultimate result, should provide us with the

"happiness  in  both  worlds".  Moreover, we  can  follow  other

norms:  medical, social, moral, but, because of the entanglement

of fate or historical accident, we face a situation which places

us  under persistent "emergency" or abnormal condition.  This we

must  understand and accept and find solutions to  our  problems

within this context.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge facing us is how to combine or reconcile

Islamic law, Syariah, with the regulation of contemporary public

and  private  matters.  Given that Islam does not  constitute  a

monolithic  entity and not all Islamic countries or  communities

apply  similar solution to their problems, the Bill, to  me,  is

the  solution  currently available to us.  It  may  not  be  the

ideal,  but  it  is,  I  believe,  a  workable  one  given   the

constraints  facing the Muslims here.  Let us work  together  in

providing justice to thousands of Muslim men and women  who  are

in real need of our urgent attention and, to quote the Minister,

if  they queue up the length could be from the MCD Building down

to Toa Payoh.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in this context, Sir, that I am happy to learn and

fully support the Bill to be committed to a Select Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I commend

and  support  the Minister's decision to refer  the  Bill  to  a

Select Committee.  There have been reactions from members of the

Malay/Muslim community on the amendment to the Administration of

Muslim Law Act

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>

(AMLA).   Committing the Bill to a Select Committee  will  allow

these feedback and views to be heard and debated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In speaking to support the Bill, I am mainly concerned with

the  amendments  proposed  in the Bill  which  will  affect  the

Syariah  Court, firstly, by providing it with wider  enforcement

powers   and,  secondly,  by  conferring  parallel  jurisdiction

between   it  and  the  Civil  Court  on  matters  relating   to

matrimonial, maintenance and custodial issues.  I support  fully

the  proposal  to  enhance the power and roles  of  the  Islamic

Religious  Council (MUIS).  But I would like  to  focus  on  the

issue of parallel jurisdiction as it is widely considered as the

most controversial aspect of the Amendment Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, the proposed amendments are laudable in that they

address the current shortcomings of the Syariah Court.  Further,

Muslim women will receive enhanced protection not only with  the

greater  power of the Syariah Court President, but also  because

they  can  continue to refer matters of division of  matrimonial

properties, maintenance and custody to the Civil Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as has been widely known, the Syariah Court has been

suffering  from  a tremendous backlog of cases, of  which  those

pertaining  to matrimonial and custodial issues form  the  bulk.

In  the  short term, the granting of concurrent jurisdiction  to

the  High Court in these matters will ease the pressures on  the

Syariah  Court  as well as allow many Muslim couples  to  settle

outstanding issues arising from divorce proceedings as  soon  as

possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, it cannot be denied that the amendments go a long

way  to  clarify the confusion over jurisdiction in  some  cases

earlier  this year where it was unclear whether they fell  under

the purview of the Syariah Court or the High Court.  I refer  to

the  case  of  Madiah bte Atan v Samsudin bin Budin  in  January

1998.   The case of Salijah v Abdullah Teo in 1995, as mentioned

by the Minister and my colleagues, raised concern as to whether

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>

the  Muslim community could continue to refer their cases to the

Civil  Court as they did in the past.  This amendment  to  AMLA,

therefore,  merely  restores the choice that  they  had  enjoyed

before.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the long term, are these amendments sufficient

in  themselves to correct the problems without jeopardizing  the

reputation  and  image  of  the  Syariah  Court?   Although  the

amendments  go a long way to solving the backlog  of  cases,  it

does  not  solve  the  original cause of the  backlog,  ie,  the

shortage of manpower in the Syariah Court.  It is this shortage,

if  continued, which will lead to the impression not only in the

Muslim community, but also in the professional law community  of

Singapore, that the Syariah Court is inefficient and  lacks  the

expertise  and knowledge to enable it to clear the  cases  under

its jurisdiction in a speedy and systematic manner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enhanced power to be given to the President of Syariah

Court to transfer documents, for example, in cases of settlement

of  matrimonial properties and custody, will help to  strengthen

the  enforcement  power  of the Syariah Court  and  improve  its

credibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some quarters believe that the concurrent jurisdiction

between the Syariah Court and the Civil Court dilutes the  power

of  the  Syariah  Court.  In reality, however,  even  for  cases

transferred to the Civil Court, the rulings are to be consistent

with  the  Muslim  law.  This system, however,  can  be  further

enhanced  by  the  Civil Court concerned  by  appointing  amicus

curiae  (Friend  of  the  Court) to  assist  in  clarifying  the

relevant  aspects of the Muslim law.  This Friend of  the  Court

should  be a Muslim scholar or someone who can advise the  court

on  the Muslim law in order to ensure that the court rulings are

consistent with the Muslim law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, other than that, I think it is timely that, in

conjunction  with  the  current  amendments  being  tabled,  the

Government  should  also  look  into  the  issue  of   providing

additional  funding to the Syariah Court so that  it  would  not

appear  that  the Government seeks to permanently undermine  the

reputation and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>

image  of the Syariah Court vis-a-vis the Civil Court.   At  the

same time, to ensure that there is no perception of gender bias,

the  Government should look into ensuring that the Syariah Court

has  adequate female representation, especially in  relation  to

Family Law.  In this, we do not have to "reinvent the wheel"  as

in  Indonesia today, there are approximately 100 female  judges,

known  as  "Ibu Hakim", who preside over civil but not  criminal

cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is especially pertinent in the light of the amendments

empowering the Syariah Court to endorse its judgements.  In this

instance, the shortage of manpower would clearly be seen  as  an

impediment to the greater powers accorded to the Syariah Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, one further concern which I have over

the  amendments  applying to the Syariah Court is  the  lack  of

clarity on the basis of which the Syariah Court should act  when

an  application is made by one party to transfer its case to the

Civil Court.  A reading of the amendments shows that the Syariah

Court  cannot  grant leave to commence civil proceedings  unless

every   party  involved  has  been  given  seven  days'  notice.

However,   in   case  one  party  disagrees  to   transfer   the

matrimonial, maintenance or custodial matter to the Civil Court,

what  principles will the Syariah Court use in its  decision  to

transfer  the  case?  I did not find guidance in  the  Amendment

Bill on this point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, in conclusion, I would like to reiterate

that  although I commend the amendments as set out in the  Bill,

in the long term, other measures which I have related above, ie,

increasing  the manpower of the Syariah Court, an  investigation

into  the  inclusion of female judges for the Syariah Court  and

further  clarification on the principles applied by the  Syariah

Court in deciding on the transfer of cases to the Civil Court in

case  one  party disagrees, will serve better towards  improving

the efficiency and reputation of the Syariah Court.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, in some

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>

countries,  even where there is a much larger Muslim  population

compared  to  Singapore,  it is common to  find  legislation  on

Muslim affairs which is separate from the State to allow Muslims

to  apply  for  themselves laws consistent with their  religious

beliefs.   Many  Muslims around the world live under  conditions

where  Muslim  laws and administration, especially Syariah  laws

and  Islamic education, are completely separate and independent.

But the need for official recognition and support by the secular

state  remains strong.  This has led to uneasy divisions  within

the  society which could potentially develop into emotional  and

complex  political problems.  On the contrary,  AMLA  which  was

first  enacted in 1968 provides for issues of Muslim affairs  to

come  under  State administration with the Majlis to advise  the

President  of  Singapore  on  matters  relating  to  the  Muslim

religion in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the amendments proposed in this Bill must be

seen  as a significant step forward for the Muslim community  in

Singapore.   Despite  the  occasional  calls  for  separate  and

independent  Muslim laws and administration,  I  feel  that  the

interest  of  Muslims in Singapore is best preserved  under  the

existing arrangement.  These amendments to the Administration of

Muslim   Law  Act  (AMLA)  to  strengthen  the  two  key  Muslim

institutions  in  Singapore  must  be  welcomed.    The   Muslim

community  in  Singapore  faces many  challenges:  the  need  to

strengthen  family structures and prevent increasing  occurrence

of  divorce; the need to ensure that Muslims continue to get the

best  of  Muslim and secular education; and the need  to  ensure

that  Muslim civil and community organisations are strengthened.

These  can  be  best  served  by strengthening  the  key  Muslim

institutions through AMLA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in this context that I wish to support this Bill that

is  placed before the House.  However, there are several  issues

which have attracted much debate within the community.  Feedback

from  the various sectors of the community indicate the need  to

allow the community to go

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>

through  consensus,  through musyawarah.   Therefore,  referring

this Bill to a Select Committee is appropriate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is certainly not one for quick decision-making.

There are still sections of the community that are fearful  that

giving  concurrent jurisdiction to the Civil and Syariah  Courts

will  result in a dilution of the Islamic laws in the long  run.

With  regard to divorce matters, there is still confusion  about

potential  conflicts between civil and Islamic laws,  especially

on matters of matrimonial properties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to compliment the Minister for introducing the

provisions which, I think, are forward looking and proactive and

for referring this Bill to a Select Committee.  However, I would

like to ask the Minister for clarification and consideration  on

a  number  of points.  Firstly, new section 3(2)(f) states  that

other  functions may be conferred on MUIS by any  other  written

law.   Since AMLA is primarily concerned with creating  MUIS  to

regulate Muslim affairs in Singapore, it should be restricted to

that function and no others.  In my view, it is not intended  to

be  an  omnibus  Act to accept roles and functions  outside  its

jurisdiction.  Further expansion of the roles of MUIS should  be

debated in the context of this Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New section 5 gives powers to MUIS to form or participate

in  any company or through joint ventures.  Is MUIS designed  to

be  a business organisation?  This, I think, is a departure from

the  original purpose of having an organisation like MUIS.  Even

so, what are the limits of accountability and responsibility for

those handling the commercial interest of MUIS?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New section 26 is a good amendment for it provides for

better accountability and responsibility of those who have  been

delegated powers to act on behalf of MUIS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New section 35A, I think, is a good amendment as it

prevents  parties from filing multiple suits.  One question  is:

will the parties get the same remedies in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>

Syariah  Court  as  they  will in  the  Civil  Court?   This  is

problematic  because  if  the Syariah  Court  refuses  leave  to

commence proceedings in the Civil Court and if the ouster clause

under section 56A comes into force, then the parties will not be

able  to  get  the  remedies under civil law at  all.   The  new

sections  35A  and  35B are useful in that  they  prevent  forum

shopping,  a  case where litigants shop around  for  the  courts

which  will  give  them the best deal and hence multiplicity  of

suits.   It  also  limits the litigants to  remedies  which  are

available  under  the  Muslim law  and  the  Syariah  Court  can

effectively prevent litigants from having recourse  to  a  Civil

Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome new section 52 to bring amendments closer and in

line   with   the   Women's   Charter  provided   the   inherent

inconsistencies and conflicts can be resolved and agreed by  the

community.  I welcome extra powers given to the Syariah Court to

enforce these orders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find new section 56A a very curious amendment. The

existing section 55(7) already provides that the decision of the

Appeal Board shall be final.  But it does not make sense to  say

that  any  decision  of the Syariah Court  shall  be  final  and

conclusive  when  there is an appeal to the  Appeal  Board.   As

section  55(7) already provides that the decision of the  Appeal

Board  shall be final, it is clear that this decision cannot  be

appealed  against.  The attempt to exclude any form of  judicial

review of decisions of the Appeal Board or the court is contrary

to  established  principles of judicial  review.   What  if  the

decisions  of  the  Appeal Board are reached in  breach  of  the

fundamental  rules  of justice?  The litigant  will  be  without

recourse.  In any case, the use of this ouster clause  has  been

unsuccessful in ousting the supervisory jurisdiction of the High

Court.   A  similar  clause  is  found  in  section  46  of  the

Industrial  Relations Act and it was held in the local  case  of

application  of  Yee  Yut Ee by Justice Mr  Choor  Singh  to  be

ineffective.   There are of course numerous  other  examples  of

English law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides these specific provisions, there are other major

issues which come under

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>

the  provisions  of  AMLA and which, in  my  view,  require  the

support and consensus of the community.

<br><br><i>Resources of the Syariah Court</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are concerns that the proposed amendments have been

made more urgent and necessary in order to avoid the backlog  of

cases  in  the  Syariah  Court.  Therefore,  the  organisational

structure,  resources and manpower needs of  the  Syariah  Court

must  be  reviewed in the context of this Bill to ensure  prompt

handling of post-divorce cases.  The resources to enforce orders

of the Syariah Court must be looked into.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also concern whether there will be sufficient

suitably  qualified judges in the Syariah Court as it  would  be

difficult  to find someone with the necessary qualifications  in

Islamic  law  amongst the qualified professionals in  the  legal

fraternity.   Perhaps,  we should look  at  the  possibility  of

tapping the resources of the Judiciary to meet the needs of  the

Syariah  Court. It is clear that the Syariah Court needs  to  be

strengthened  not  only  in its legal  provisions  but  also  in

manpower and resources.

<br><br><i>Financial provisions relating to trust, wakaf, nazar and mosque</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The activities of mosques have recently seen vast

improvements with mosques providing a whole range of  community-based  services.  The financial provisions specifying  the  need

for greater financial accountability and financial reporting  is

indeed  timely  and appropriate.  Perhaps it is also  timely  to

discuss    professionalism   of   mosque   administration    and

streamlining activities and services offered by mosques so as to

avoid  duplication and ensuring high standards of services  that

the Muslim community so deserves.

<br><br><i>Recognition of Syariah Court</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been calls for the Syariah Court to be elevated

to  the  status  of  a court, making it part  of  the  judiciary

instead  of the present status of a tribunal under the  Ministry

of Community Development.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have made good progress through these amendments.

We  have  seen  and  heard of the strong desire  of  the  Muslim

community to participate and contribute in formulating  policies

for  AMLA.  We certainly can give this matter more time so  that

the  Malay/Muslim  community can decide for  themselves  on  the

various  conflicting issues which only the community can  decide

through  consensus.  I am sure out of this may emerge a stronger

sense of agreement and support and commitment that this Bill  so

deserves.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am obliged to

you for giving me this opportunity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, shortly after gaining independence in 1965, the

Government  introduced AMLA.  The Bill  was  sent  to  a  Select

Committee.    Representations were made and the  law  came  into

effect in 1968.  There have been various amendments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there is a major amendment before the House and I am

indebted to the Minister.  He has listened to the public  views.

There has been a report in the Straits Times that AMP and others

are concerned about certain clauses of the Bill.  I think it  is

appropriate  that  this  House commits this  Bill  to  a  Select

Committee  where  we  could  hear the  concerns  of  the  Muslim

community  and  at  the Select Committee, if  need  be,  further

improvements could be made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the life of a law is not logic but experience. I

speak  before this House as a practising lawyer.   Some  of  the

points that have been in my mind have already been taken  up  by

my  colleagues.   So I shall not duplicate but I  shall  try  to

reorientate myself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill will improve the administration of justice in

Singapore.  As the Minister has pointed out, the Syariah   Court

is  not  in a position to deliver the goods.  What is the choice

before the country?  Do we wait and let the Syariah Court system

exist  as it is and let the Muslim friends suffer?  I think  the

Minister  and the Government have wisely decided to  bring  this

change.   And the change, Sir, is not forcing on any Muslim.   A

choice of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>

jurisdiction  is  his or her right and I will shortly  state  to

this  House various other matters affecting the personal law  of

the Muslims.  The Muslims have the choice in the past.  They are

going to be given the same choice now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the case of the Central Provident Fund and the law of

inheritance.  If a Muslim decides to nominate, so  be  it.   You

follow  the  nomination.  But if he wants to follow the  law  of

Islam, intestate, then Muslim law will follow.  Take the case of

the  Maintenance of Parents Act.  A Muslim parent  who  has  not

been  maintained  can  go to the Tribunal.   Under  the  Women's

Charter,  Muslims  have  gone  to the  Magistrate's  Courts  and

obtained  maintenance.  The figures have been  released  by  the

Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the final analysis, it is the choice of the Muslim

community.   If there is any conflict, of course, the  leave  of

the  Syariah  Court has to be obtained.  But where both  parties

agree and they think that they can get better justice in a Civil

Court, why not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the question that is of concern to

some  Members  of  this House is this.  Can  we  reorganise  the

Syariah Court?  And the Minister has agreed that there is a need

and I think this should be done.  I wholeheartedly agree with Mr

Zulkifli  when  he  said  that perhaps  we  could  look  to  the

resources of the Civil Courts.  Could we have some of the bright

and  young  Magistrates and District Judges transferred  to  the

Syariah Court?  They could be trained in Islamic law.  It is not

a  difficult thing.  I think this is something that the Minister

may  want to consider.  Nevertheless, some attempts must be made

to  reorganise  the  Syariah Court.  I think  the  community  is

concerned.  But this is not possible now.  I think the immediate

problem,  as  I said earlier, is to get on with the disposal  of

the cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one aspect of this Bill which I seek the

indulgence of the Minister.  I beg to differ.  The Bill,  as  it

stands,  there is going to be one more President.  I  think  the

other  alternative  which I would suggest is to  appoint  Deputy

Presidents.  In the case

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>

of  the  Strata  Titles Board, we have Mr Tan Lian  Ker  as  the

President.  Then there is a Deputy President, Mr Gan Hiang Chye.

There are similar examples.  My fear is this.  If there are  too

many  Presidents, there is a question of protocol,  there  is  a

question  of  conflict.  So I think at the proper time,  at  the

Select Committee perhaps, this matter should be addressed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MUIS, in the last few years, has come of age. And I

say this sincerely because I have seen how many wakaf properties

have  been  developed for the benefit of the  Muslim  community.

Therefore, I see the increase in jurisdiction would be welcomed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am especially glad that trustees are now required to be

more prudent and the accounts have to be prepared and audited by

an  auditor.  I think it is important to have proper checks  and

balances and perhaps we could take a leaf from this Bill and  we

should even think of amending the Societies Act.  The people who

handle public funds must keep proper accounts.  And in the  case

of  MUIS, it has got wakaf and other trusts as well and I  think

the Schedule that has been attached to this Bill is welcomed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill is trying to overcome a lacuna as a result of

two  decisions  of  the  Supreme Court which  the  Minister  has

referred  to.   The  cases  are  Salijah  vs  Abdullah  Teo  and

Lathibaby.   If not for these decisions, I think the need  would

not   have  been  that  pressing.   But  because  of  these  two

decisions,  I think it is important that the law be  set  right.

It  is  the prerogative of this Parliament whenever there  is  a

lacuna in the law.  We must respond and I think the Minister has

rightly  responded.  He has been cautious.  He has waited  long.

He  has consulted the Muslim bodies.  He has done service to the

Muslim community, but there is still some doubt.  We will  leave

that to the Select Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the concern that we have is this. What type of Muslim

society  we  are going to build in the context of Singapore?   A

progressive Muslim society or a society that is conservative and

is not prepared to change?  I think it is to the credit of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>

Muslim  community here, with the setting up of MENDAKI which  is

another by-product of MUIS itself, the Muslim community has come

of  age.   MUIS  has  become part and  parcel  of  the  national

institution.   All  Muslims can be proud of  MUIS.   As  I  said

earlier, I had many things to say but because all that I  wanted

to say have been repeated by many Members, all I can say is that

I  support the Bill and I am glad that it is going to  a  Select

Committee.  I have some reservations which I have addressed  and

I hope the Minister would consider them.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

support the proposed amendments in the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed amendments seek to rectify some existing

inadequacies  in  some  areas  of  Syariah  Court   powers   and

procedures.   I  commend  the Minister for  being  very  forward

looking in bringing forward these amendments expeditiously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first of all, I would like to declare my interest that

I  have represented some clients in Syariah Court matters in the

past.   I  have also taken the trouble to consult  some  of  the

legal  practitioners  who practise in the Syariah  Court  and  I

would  like  to inform the Minister that the feedback  has  been

positive in looking at these amendments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Syariah Court is a new institution in Singapore

when  it was introduced in 1968.  In fact, it is one that should

be  considered as a young institution because of its  number  of

years  in  existence.   In comparison to  the  Civil  Courts  in

Singapore which have been in existence since the second  charter

of justice in 1826, they have a vast and long history.  But even

with  such a long history, anomalies and loopholes do  exist  in

the  law and even in procedures.  And it is because of that that

many  amendments have been made to laws and procedures  in  this

House.  As such, the amendments, as they come before the courts,

equally show that loopholes and lacunas can appear in all  forms

of law, and the AMLA law is no exception.  Sir, in that sense, I

am glad many of the inadequacies and weaknesses have come up and

that this Bill has come to this House for timely reform.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the recent increase in the number of divorces,

both  Muslim  and non-Muslim, many divorce couples  are  looking

forward to quicker remedies and faster procedures.  Some Muslims

consider  that  some of the procedures in the Civil  Courts  are

faster.   Here,  I must say that  some 10 years ago,  I  noticed

that  there  were  delays and a long backlog  of  cases  in  the

Syariah  Court.  But I was pleasantly surprised that last  month

when  I  visited  the  Syariah Court, as  part  of  the  Service

Improvement Unit, drastic changes had taken place in the Syariah

Court.   I  was impressed with the major administrative  changes

that  had  taken  place.   They  have  introduced  many  of  the

administrative  measures  that  have  been  undertaken  in   the

Subordinate Courts and in the High Court.   Instances like  case

management, time schedules, fixed dates for clearing of  backlog

cases, all these are very impressive changes and I am glad  that

administrative changes have been introduced.  I think  it  is  a

step  forward in improving the administrative efficiency of  the

Syariah Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having said so, I must impress upon this House that

many  of the plaintiffs who resorted to the Civil Court  to  get

the  right remedy resorted to it, not because they felt that the

civil  law  afforded  a better remedy, but,  unfortunately,  the

Syariah  Court did not possess these powers in the first  place,

and because some of these powers were lacking, they resorted  to

the Civil Courts.  But with the introduction of these powers  in

the  Syariah Court, I think it will go towards strengthening the

Syariah Court and hence prevent an exodus, which is the fear  of

some in the community towards the Syariah Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take the House through some of the

major changes in the Bill.  Let me, first, take new section 35A.

This  section  covers  two  subjects:  (i)  the  disposition  of

property  on  divorce; and (ii) custody of child.  The  proposed

scheme  means  that (i) once proceedings are  commenced  in  the

Syariah Court, parties may not commence civil proceedings in any

court relating to the above issues unless there is leave of  the

Syariah Court.  And (ii) where such civil proceedings have  been

commenced prior

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>

to  proceedings in the Syariah Court, then such proceedings  may

not  continue unless there is leave of the Syariah Court  or  by

consent of the parties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the area of custody of child.

It has become clear that the High Court has no jurisdiction over

custody  matters  under  section 16  of  the  Supreme  Court  of

Judicature Act where parties are Muslims or married under Muslim

law.  The powers of the Syariah Court to order custody are found

in section 52 of AMLA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above section, which is a new section, Sir, seeks to

confirm  the  decision  in the case of Lathibaby  Bevi  v  Abdul

Mustapha.   In that case, Sir, the High Court ruled  that  where

there have been proceedings in the Syariah Court, then only  the

Syariah  Court  has  jurisdiction over the same.  That  decision

implied  that  civil proceedings may be instituted  so  long  as

there are no proceedings in the Syariah Court.  Once proceedings

are  commenced  in  the Syariah Court, then  the  Syariah  Court

assumes jurisdiction to the exclusion of the other Courts.   The

amendment  seeks  to  tidy this principle by  the  mechanism  of

issuing commencement and discontinuance certificates before  the

Court can assume jurisdiction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is definitely a welcome procedure as:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) It is the Syariah Court that holds the key to the

commencement or continuance of proceedings in the civil  courts;

and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The second key is held by the parties themselves. It

is   the  parties  who  must  consent  to  the  commencement  or

continuance  of  the  action  in the  Civil  Court.   Here,  the

proposed  introduction of the new section  17A  to  the  Supreme

Court  of  Judicature Act requires the High Court in  future  to

exercise  jurisdiction only with the relevant  certificate  from

the Syariah Court or with the consent of both parties before it.

The   Civil   Court  cannot,  I  repeat,  automatically   assume

jurisdiction  over  such  matters.   I  believe  there  is  some

misunderstanding among some members in the Malay  community  who

assume that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>

the  Civil Court will automatically assume jurisdiction once the

matter  goes before the Civil Court.  I think this is  something

that  perhaps  the Minister could clarify in the course  of  the

Select Committee hearings or when subsequently the matter  comes

up.   Here,  it  is the Syariah Court that determines  how  many

cases go to the Civil Court.  If the Syariah Court decides to be

strict  and tells the parties that appear before it that it  has

now  got the full powers to make the decision that a Civil Court

can  make,  then I think the number of cases that  will  end  up

going to the Civil Court will be limited.  I think there are not

many  cases that both parties consent to go to the civil courts.

So  the  fear of some members in the community that the  Syariah

Court  will be very liberal in issuing the certificate  so  that

they  can  go  to the Civil Court, I think at this juncture,  is

something which is premature.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other key, which is being held by the two parties to

the  action,  is  that only when both of them  consent  can  the

matter  go  before the Civil Court.  So the Civil  Court  cannot

exercise  jurisdiction  in  the absence  of  consent  from  both

parties.   In any event, if one party is unhappy that the  other

party  has resorted to the Civil Court, they can always go  back

to  the  Syariah  Court and inform the Syariah  Court  that  the

certificate should not be issued and that the matter  should  be

heard by the  Syariah Court.  At the end of the day, the Syariah

Court  determines whether the matter should go before the  Civil

Court or not in the absence of consent from both parties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the other area where section 35 makes a major

change  is  that while the Syariah Court has jurisdiction  under

section  35(2) of AMLA to order the disposition or  division  of

property,  problems  have surfaced in the past  in  post-divorce

applications which have forced parties to seek remedies from the

High Court.  It was, I repeat, the absence of appropriate remedy

in  AMLA which has forced parties to resort to the Civil  Court.

However,  the courts, like the Court of Appeal in  the  case  of

Salijah bte Abdul Latif v Irwan bin Abdulah Teo, have ruled that

it  does  not have jurisdiction to hear the issue of disposition

or division of property where it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>

involves  Muslim  parties.  The proposed  amendment  once  again

seeks  to  create a new door to the Civil Court in the  area  of

disposition or division of property provided the conditions laid

down are complied with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another area which I note from the discussion in

this House which has raised concern among some Members, and this

is in the area of concurrent jurisdiction.  Effectively, the new

section  35A  creates  concurrent jurisdiction in giving  powers

both  to the Syariah Court and the civil courts in the two areas

I  have highlighted, ie,  disposition of property and custody of

child.   Naturally,  there are arguments  for  and  against  the

creation  of  such  concurrent jurisdiction.  Having  acted  for

parties  in the past in Syariah Court matters, I must  say  that

Muslim  Singaporeans  are fortunate that  they  have  two  legal

forums  to  seek remedies instead of one which many Singaporeans

are at present entitled to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in addition, at the end of the day, what matters is:

are  the  parties  who  are going to the court  happy  with  the

decision?  Are they happy that they have received justice?   Has

any  one  of  these  parties  who have  gone  before  the  court

complained  to  the Civil Court that because they  were  Muslims

they  have  been unfairly treated, that they have been  unjustly

treated, that the law has been applied unjustly?   Here, I  must

say  that I have not heard any Muslim party who has gone to  the

Civil  Courts complaining that the law has been unjustly applied

to  them.  I would highlight an instance later on where  I  feel

that  many of the principles which are found in the Civil Courts

and under Muslim law are similar.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of maintenance, the present section 35(2)

provides that the Syariah Court has jurisdiction to hear matters

relating  to  maintenance.  Section 3(1) and (2) of the  Women's

Charter  also  entitles  Muslim  parties  to  bring  maintenance

matters  to the Civil Courts.  Civil Courts have been  accepting

applications for maintenance by Muslim women for their or  their

children's maintenance.  Some resort to the Civil Courts because

of expediency and also the enforcement

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>

powers  available to the Civil Courts.  Here again, Sir, in  the

past,  many resorted to the Civil Courts because there was delay

in  the  way  maintenance proceedings were going in the  Syariah

Court.   But  I  must once again reiterate that  what  came  out

during my visit last month was that measures are being taken  by

the  Syariah  Court to speed up the collection  of  maintenance.

They  have  now  introduced a computerised  system  of  tracking

maintenance payments.  As such, the ability of the Syariah Court

to move in the area of collection of maintenance arrears will be

improved.  I think the number of Muslim couples who will  go  to

the  Civil Courts to claim maintenance may see a decline in  the

long run.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 35B confirms the present scheme of

arrangement  within the Civil Court and the  Syariah  Court  and

makes  it  clear  that  once  civil proceedings  in  respect  of

maintenance  proceedings are commenced, the Syariah Court  shall

stay  the proceedings before it involving the same matter.  Here

again,  there  are  once again arguments  for  and  against  the

exercise of this concurrent jurisdiction by two different  Court

systems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malay Muslim community in Singapore has been happy with

this  arrangement in the past because they know that it benefits

the  community.  The two proposals that have now come  about  in

section  35  which  involve  custody  and  the  disposition   of

property.   Once  they see the full implementation  of  the  two

provisions,  they  will  realise that it actually  benefits  the

community because it leads to the expeditious disposal of cases,

whether by the Syariah Court, or in the event of consent by both

parties, by the Civil Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area that I would like to highlight is the new

section  51(4).  This is a new power which was missing in  AMLA.

This  is  definitely a welcome proposal as all courts must  have

powers  to  vary  or  rescind  their  orders,  particularly   in

matrimonial  matters when circumstances change  along  the  way.

However, the grounds for varying or rescinding the orders appear

in  the  amendments  to  be limited to only  three  grounds.   I

believe

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>

that  the three grounds that are stated in the section are  very

restrictive and perhaps a wider term could have been  chosen  to

provide for greater exercise of discretion by the Syariah Court.

The same comment would apply to the new section 52(7).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in respect of the new section 51(5), I feel that

providing for a prison sentence in the case where one  party  is

in contempt of court is a little drastic.  Perhaps the option of

a  fine  or a prison sentence may be appropriate to suit varying

degrees of contempt of court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to move on to the new section 52(3).

Here  again, this is also a welcome provision.  There have  been

cases in the past where parties got their divorces effected by a

Kadi  under section 102.  In many of these cases, Sir, ancillary

issues  such  as  custody and disposition of property  were  not

addressed  and  recorded  as part of the  divorce  terms.   When

parties could not settle these issues, they could not go back to

the  Kadi  as  after  the  divorce he becomes  functus  officio.

Neither   could the parties refer these matters to  the  Syariah

Court because the present section 52 suggests that the powers of

the Syariah Court are restricted to making orders in respect  of

proceedings in the Syariah Court and do not include divorces  by

a  Kadi.   This  was confirmed in the decision of the  Court  of

Appeal in a recent case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendment specifically gives the Syariah Court

the  powers  to  make orders in respect of divorces  by  a  Kadi

under  section 102, whether such divorces are registered  before

or   after  the  commencement  of  these  amendments.   It  will

definitely  be a relief to many who have been caught  without  a

venue to sort out their ancillary matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new section 52(6) is something that I would say is

a  marvellous provision.  This section seeks to incorporate  the

principles that are found in section 112 of the Women's Charter.

Section  112  of the Women's Charter lays down the factors  that

the Civil Courts will take into account

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>

in  looking  into the disposition of matrimonial property.   But

there  is  a proviso that the Syariah Court in applying  section

112  will ensure that it is consistent with Muslim law.  The aim

appears to be to give clear guidelines to the Court and  to  the

parties  as to their rights over their matrimonial property.   I

am informed by many of my colleagues who practise in the Syariah

Court that many of the principles that are found in section  112

of  the  Women's Charter have already been applied by the Appeal

Board  in  many  of  its decisions in so far  as  they  are  not

inconsistent  with the Muslim law, although the  Board  did  not

refer specifically to section 112 in its decision.  This is  the

section  that  I  would  like  to  highlight.   There  are  many

provisions  in the Women's  Charter or in other areas  where,  I

believe,  the  principles  that are  taken  by  the  court  into

account, whether it is the Syariah Court or the Civil Court, may

actually overlap, and at the end of the day, the object  of  the

exercise is to ensure that parties in their post-divorce matters

are  treated fairly and that justice is accessible  to  both  of

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also learnt from some Muslim practitioners that the

proviso  that  the law be not inconsistent with  Muslim  law  is

important  as there are differences between Muslim law  and  the

Women's  Charter in this respect.  For instance, the non-payment

of  iddah  and mutaah has been held to affect the share  in  the

matrimonial  flat  (there is an Appeal  Board  Case  No.  14/95)

whereas these are matters which are irrelevant under the Women's

Charter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new section 53A is also something that should be

welcomed.  Here, it gives the President of the Syariah Court the

power to execute documents where a party who is ordered to do so

is  absent, neglects or refuses to do so.  This will ensure that

the situation that arose in Salijah's case does not arise again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the amendments, one would notice that it is

possible  for a party to go through three courts in the process.

For the issue of divorce, iddah and mutaah, they may have to  go

to the Syariah Court.  On the issue of custody and matrimonial

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>

assets, they may go to the Family Court.  On the enforcement  of

certain  orders, they may have to go to the District Court.   At

the  moment, if one looks at the location of these three courts,

one  is  in  MCD Building in Thomsom Road, the Family  Court  is

located  at  Patterson Road and the High Court is  located  just

within  walking  distance of this House, what this  means  to  a

layman  is  that to obtain different remedies he has  to  go  to

three  different venues.  I would urge the Minister that in  the

long term process of locating the Syariah Court, to explore  the

possibility  of  locating the  Syariah Court within  the  Family

Court complex so that it is very convenient for lay persons  who

access the courts to go to one location where they can have  all

their remedies in one place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, let me just say that there has been concern

expressed  that the new amendments may mean a big shift  in  the

number of ancillary matters pertaining to Muslims being heard by

the  Civil  Court.   I do not think so.  The Syariah  Court  has

become  dynamic and efficient.  It has become proactive and  has

adopted  some  new strategies to resolving matrimonial  disputes

such  as mediation, counselling and other new technologies.   It

has   also   gone  into  computerised  tracking  of  maintenance

payments.   I think the Syariah Court can rise to the  challenge

and meet the needs of its customers and not fear a big shift  of

cases  to  the  Civil Courts.  The prospect  of  this  happening

should become lesser, as I have reiterated earlier, Sir, as many

Muslim  parties have resorted to the Civil Courts  in  the  past

because of the lack of appropriate remedy in the Syariah  Court.

But  this should change with the new amendments.  In any  event,

proceedings  in the Syariah Court are attractive  also  as  they

cost  much less than those in the Civil Courts.  With  new  case

management,  time schedule, backlogs of cases and delays  should

be a thing of the past.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am quite sure that the Muslim community in Singapore

would  be eager  to give its input before the new Bill is passed

as law.  It is a Bill that will affect the Muslim community.   I

am  quite sure that there will be some areas where the Bill  can

be improved.  For that reason,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>

I applaud the decision of the Hon. Minister to refer the Bill to

a  Select  Committee  so  that  all  viewpoints  of  the  Muslim

community  could be heard and a considered decision  taken.   In

doing  so,  I  would particularly like to urge the  Minister  to

obtain  representation from the members of the legal  profession

who  specialise in Syariah Court matters and also  Muslim  women

groups, because I believe Muslim women form a large majority  of

those who have resorted to Civil Courts in the past.  So I think

their feedback will be useful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Thank you,

Sir,  for  this opportunity.  Being the last speaker, I  hope  I

still get your attention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had thought that this amendment would be a welcome

instrument  for  the  administration of justice  in  the  Muslim

community.  In soliciting feedback from grassroots organisations

and  Muslim  friends that I know of, I observe three conflicting

viewpoints:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, there are Muslim men and women who welcome the

amendment  and feel that the concurrent or parallel jurisdiction

in  both the Syariah and Civil Courts offers another option  and

avenue for grievance articulation and dispute settlement.   Some

Muslim  women  feel  that  Civil Court  intervention  under  the

Women's Charter compensates them more and protects their  rights

equally   like  the  non-Muslim  sisters.   On  the   procedural

challenges,  the Syariah Court has been criticised  for  lacking

the  sophisticated procedural mechanisms that the Supreme  Court

has  for proper administration of justice.  Petitioners have  to

wait  far too long to settle their disputes in the Syariah Court

due  to  low  manpower  and resources.  By  having  Civil  Court

intervention,  Muslim  petitioners  hope  to  see   faster   and

effective response to their disputes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the application of civil law to Muslim

matters  is  controversial.  I hear from other  Muslim  men  and

women  that  this  amendment changes the substantive  rights  of

Muslims, for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>

example,  in the way matrimonial assets were defined differently

under the Syariah Court and Women's Charter.  This Bill seeks to

deal with the administrative problems faced by the Syariah Court

by  giving  the  Supreme Court concurrent  jurisdiction  in  the

resolution  of  matters which are ancillary to divorce  such  as

maintenance,  custody  of children and division  of  matrimonial

assets.   The  problem is that the law applied  by  the  Supreme

Court  in  hearing  cases which have been transferred  from  the

Syariah  Court  will be the civil law, ie, the Women's  Charter.

What  if  there is a conflict between the Supreme Court and  the

Syariah  Court?  Matrimonial assets under the Syariah  Court  do

not  include possessions before marriage, but under the  Women's

Charter, they do.  Concurrent jurisdiction therefore may dilute,

as  argued  by Association of Muslim Professionals in  a  public

statement  a  few  days  ago, the status and  authority  of  the

Syariah Court in enforcing the substantive rights of the parties

under Muslim law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proponents of this view assert that the Syariah Court is

the  supreme  adjudicative body which must  be  strengthened  by

adding  more resources and personnel to its operation to  assist

it  to be effective in clearing its case overload and delivering

adequate service to the community.  For them, there is  no  need

for  concurrent  jurisdiction  as  this  may  only  confuse  the

petitioners  as  well as legal practitioners who  now  have  two

different forums to choose from which best suit the interests of

their clients.  Any change of tack by petitioners from using one

forum  to  another will create even more litigation hurdles  and

administrative  ambiguity.  And when children are  involved  and

have  to be dragged into different courts to testify, the  scene

can be messy and emotionally trying.  Mr Ravindran has portrayed

a  very different picture in his legal experiences.  Again, this

needs further clarification and verification. I am glad to  hear

from  Mr  Ravindran also that it is not easy to switch from  one

court to another.  But this has to be communicated and clarified

with the community.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moderate opponents to this amendment are willing to accept

the amendment for the sake of meeting current case pressures  as

long  as  the concurrent jurisdiction is only an interim measure

and  the  Syariah  Court  will over  time  be  strengthened  and

recognised   as   the  final  authority  in   adjudicating   the

substantive   rights   and   procedural   mechanism    in    the

administration  of Muslim affairs.  Conscious  development  must

then   follow  to  give  the  Syariah  Court  certain  essential

procedural mechanisms as well as enforcement powers to carry out

proper administration of justice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third conflicting view, which I observed is the most

thorny  one, deals with the process of consultation between  the

State  and the Muslim community.  Some sections of the community

groups  feel  that  the amendment was proposed without  adequate

consultation.  Policymakers did not carry the ground  by  giving

more  time  and attention to reviewing the issues with community

leaders   and   helping  them  to  get  a  fuller  and   clearer

understanding of the rationale of the amendment.  On  the  other

hand,  the Ministry has also failed to get appropriate  feedback

from the community to help improve the proposed amendments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, it was felt that given what is arguably the most

radical change to the AMLA ever since its promulgation in  1968,

the  process from conceptualisation to decision fixing  must  be

given  significant  time  to enable the  Muslim  community  more

opportunity  to reflect and offer feedback on the  matter.   The

process  was too rushed, top-down and did not include a  broader

base of viewpoints and recommendations for desired change.   For

some,   this   amendment  at  best  represents  only   selective

viewpoints.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the Ministry of Community Development and the

Minister  must have consulted various grassroots Muslim agencies

on  what  "best legal practices" to adopt to act in the interest

of  the  community.   There might have been  different  starting

points  and  ending  points  in the  consultation  process  with

diverse  groups.   Leading  community  agencies  may  not   have

explained the issues as well.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>

What  was  clear  was  that the process failed  to  capture  the

contentious  sentiments on this matter.   What  is  certain,  it

seems to me, is that the Muslim community does not yet agree  if

concurrent jurisdiction is a good strategy to serve the interest

of  the petitioners.  Even less certain is how they would  agree

on  a broader problem on who defines what changes for whom,  for

what  purposes and how?  There are apparent different  responses

to this broad concern arising from fundamental differences based

on gender, nature of interpretation of the Islam faith, sectoral

and professional interests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a non-Muslim, I cannot pretend to understand the full

implication of the AMLA on the followers of Islam. I am far from

understanding  the disputes relating to divorces  known  in  the

Muslim  law, as I learn, fasakh, cerai taklik, khuluk and talak.

I  cannot  therefore at this juncture take a stand on a  secular

platform  to make hasty judgement on matters which are evidently

delicate   and   sensitive.   Neither  can  I  point   out   the

insufficiencies of the proposed provisions in the  amendment  or

tackle  the fine-tuning of some of the clauses which some Muslim

legal practitioners have raised and submitted a proposal to  the

Ministry for review.  I suspect on this matter, after hearing so

many  different opinions from the hon. Members,  there  will  be

very different opinions from the professional and lay community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I feel that as a Singaporean in a multi-cultural

society, I must discharge my responsibility in being part of  an

"active  citizenry"  by  exercising some  degree  of  empathetic

reasoning on matters of tremendous importance to my compatriots.

Even  if  I cannot pass a last judgement, I could contribute  to

the  process of debate by simply surfacing, as I am  doing  now,

the  conflicting concerns of a particular community which I have

had  the  opportunity  to learn about.  In the  final  analysis,

short  of  a  higher  level  order which  allows  the  State  to

articulate and enforce clear principles of adjudication over and

above ethnic and religious specificities, I feel that the Muslim

community has to decide what and how they propose to manage  the

mounting challenges faced

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>

by the Syariah Court and the role of the State is to facilitate,

and  negotiate for, some degree of consensus in the  conflicting

viewpoints within the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this view, I strongly support the call for this

amendment   to  be  put  to  a  Select  Committee  for   further

deliberations and closer scrutiny.  I would recommend, Sir, that

the  Ministry  get more feedback from as many Muslim  groups  as

possible,  as  well  as from members of the public  through  the

media and written representations.  It would be helpful to  tell

the  public the rationale and background factors as to why  this

amendment  was raised and what outcome was intended.  I  believe

this gesture of openness will sit well in the community, in view

of  our  current  discourse on developing  a  people  sector,  a

brilliant  concept recently used by Minister Teo Chee  Hean,  to

show  that  space and process time are provided for citizens  to

work  out  their cohesion and the sense of relevance.   Let  the

Muslim community and its multifarious groups carry out a reality

check  among themselves and if they cannot reach consensus,  and

the  State  has to be the final arbiter, they at least  had  the

opportunity  to  say  they  agree  to  disagree  in  defining  a

significant piece of legislation.  We must give time,  Sir,  and

respect for such effort.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have left out

a  point  just  now.  I urge the Minister to write  to  the  Law

Society  to  ask  for its representation.   I  believe  the  Law

Society has formed a committee in this regard and perhaps he may

want to consider writing to them for representation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Mr Rai may wish to know that, in

fact,  the Muslim Law Committee of the Law Society has submitted

a report to me.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been a very long day. Since the Bill will go

to  a  Select Committee, I do not intend to go through in detail

the  replies.  Suffice it to say that I would address  the  main

points which Members have brought up.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to thank Members for speaking and the

strong  support  given  by   my colleagues.   I  would  like  to

specially thank Mr Ravindran for the clarification which he gave

from  the  practitioner's viewpoint, especially the point  about

Syariah Court having made improvements which, unfortunately, not

many people know about.  But, anyway, we will persevere, and  we

will continue to improve the Syariah Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope Members will bear with me, as I said, if I do

not  reply to all the questions in the interest of time.  But  I

just  like  to  highlight the concerns which the  community  has

brought up.  Of all the amendments, the main concern, which  has

been  brought  up  by the Muslim community,  is  the  matter  of

concurrent jurisdiction.  Some of the concerns are the result of

a  lack  of understanding of the full provisions.  Some  of  the

concerns  are genuine in the sense that they feel that  they  do

not fulfil the aspirations of the community.  If I could somehow

categorise these concerns, I would put them thus:  First,  there

were  concerns that the Civil Courts could reach decisions which

would  contradict  Muslim  law.  As I  said  earlier,  Sir,  the

concurrent  jurisdiction has, de facto, been happening  all  the

time.   In fact, Muslims have been going to the Civil Court  and

Syariah  Court all this time.  So far, there has  not  been  any

complaint about the injustice or the decision of the Civil Court

being  against  them.  I understand, Sir,  that  in  matters  of

custody  especially - and this matter of custody is one  of  the

most sensitive areas which the Muslims have brought up - when it

relates  to  the  children's religion, the moral  and  religious

upbringing of the child is a factor which is considered  by  the

court  also.  In any case, the interest and welfare of the child

are foremost, which is the same also in the Syariah Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second concern is that concurrent jurisdiction may

erode  or dilute the stature and image of the Syariah Court.   I

disagree, Sir, because given the additional powers which we  are

giving  to  the Syariah Court now, indeed, it will increase  the

stature and power of the Syariah Court.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>

I  would like to supplement this with what I said just now  that

we  will continue to develop the Syariah Court and look into how

and in what areas the Syariah Court could be improved so that it

can  be an institution which the community can be confident  and

proud of and which can fulfil the aspirations of the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, there is the fear that there would be an

exodus of Muslim couples, instead of going to the Syariah Court,

now   going  to  the  Civil  Court  because  of  the  concurrent

jurisdiction.   I, again, disagree, Sir.  I think  it  has  been

pointed  out  by Mr Ravindran just now that, in all  likelihood,

there  would be a decrease of Muslim couples going to the  Civil

Court because they are more aware now, especially with all  this

public  debate  about  the Syariah Court and  the  Civil  Court.

Because  of this awareness, I think there is a higher likelihood

of  Muslims now looking towards the Syariah Court than the Civil

Court.   Anyway, my Ministry and the Syariah Court are going  to

monitor whether this exodus does, indeed, take place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth concern is that they hope that the concurrent

jurisdiction, if it is unavoidable, ought to be temporary.  As I

said, we will monitor the developments both in the Syariah Court

and the Civil Court.  We hope to develop the Syariah Court to  a

level whereby it can be the kind of institution which the Muslim

community  hopes  for  and  where  the  Muslim  community   will

increasingly  depend  on.   While I cannot  say  how  long  this

concurrent jurisdiction will carry on, I would suggest  that  we

leave  the concurrent jurisdiction as it is first.  We carry  on

and,  in  the meantime, we will continue to develop the  Syariah

Court.  Because, ultimately, Sir, it is not whether or not there

is  concurrent jurisdiction, but how the Syariah Court is  being

perceived by the community as fulfilling their aspirations.  How

do  we  instil confidence and pride in the Syariah  Court?   The

only  way  to  do  it  is to assure that the  Syariah  Court  is

effective,  it is prompt in deciding its cases and  it  has  the

requisite expertise, manpower and facilities to do the job well.

This, as I said, we will continue to pay attention to.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, Sir, it is a question of choice. What we are

giving here is that the Muslim community would have a choice  of

either  going  to the Syariah Court or the Civil  Court.   Being

aware  of their rights and what the courts can do, I think  they

are  in a better position to make their choice now.  I feel that

we should not take away this choice from the Muslims.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The community should adopt the attitude which Mr Ravindran

proposes just now, ie, to see how the amendments are implemented

and  to  give it a chance to be implemented.  For all you  know,

the  implementation  of  the amendments will  satisfy  what  the

Muslim community is hoping for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various specific questions asked by Members. I

am not going to reply to all and, my officers have taken note of

all  the suggestions.  But I would like to address what Mr Harun

Ghani  mentioned just now.  I am afraid I cannot recite a pantun

as  he  did,  because in the translation of the pantun,  it  may

appear  differently.  But he did say that we  need  not  specify

concurrent jurisdiction and, by doing so, the whole problem will

be   solved   because  de  facto  we  already  have   concurrent

jurisdiction.   I am afraid that cannot be done  because,  as  a

result of the Lathibaby's case, the Civil Court has made it very

clear that whatever is in the jurisdiction of the Syariah Court,

it  cannot  be touched by the Civil Court.  So we have  to  make

this provision in the amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to address one particular point brought

up  by  Mdm Claire Chiang who argued that we are in fact solving

administrative problems through concurrent jurisdiction.  It  is

not  wholly  true because, as I said, we are merely  reinstating

what has been happening all this time.  I said just now too that

we  ought  to adhere to the principle of not denying  Muslims  a

choice  of  which forum they want to go to.   So  it  is  not  a

question  of merely trying to solve administrative problems  and

therefore  we resort to concurrent jurisdiction with  the  Civil

Courts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch on Mr Hawazi's speech. He made two

interesting points.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>

One is the appointment of amicus curiae (Friend of Court).  This

is  a measure which we could think about and see whether it  can

be  applicable.   The other point is the appointment  of  female

Muslim judges in the Syariah Court.  I am not too sure what  the

implications are in terms of Syariah law.  But, again,  this  is

something perhaps we could look into carefully.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various small points which I would not touch on,

as  I said, in the interest of time.  But I would like to assure

Members   that  whether  or  not  the  amendments   fulfil   the

aspirations of the community, I think, it has to be  seen.   The

Malay  MPs  and myself have looked carefully into the amendments

and  we  feel  that  the amendments will help  significantly  in

improving the justice system in Singapore, not only for  Muslims

but also as a legal system that exists in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would commend Members to tell those who are

interested in coming up with suggestions or those who feel  that

they want to make representations to the Select Committee, to do

so.   The  Select Committee will be more than pleased to receive

the representations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Bill be committed to a Select Committee consisting

of  Mr  Speaker  as Chairman and such Members the  Committee  of

Selection may nominate. - [Mr Abdullah Tarmugi].

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(As reported from Select Committee)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Third Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a  Third

time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Select Committee on the Interpretation (Amendment)

Bill  received nine written submissions.  After considering  the

submissions, the Committee decided that it was not necessary  to

hear  oral representation as almost all the submissions were  in

support of the Bill, and none had specifically opposed it.   The

Committee's Report has been presented to Members of the House.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee deliberated on the key points raised in the

submissions and agreed that they are already catered for in  the

Bill.   These  include safeguards to ensure  that  before  brain

death  is  certified,  having  two  doctors  to  determine  that

irreversible  cessation  of  all  brain  functions  has   indeed

occurred,  the inclusion of an independent medical  practitioner

to  certify  brain  death and that the statutory  definition  of

death  be  kept separate and distinct from provisions  governing

organ transplant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Select Committee has, after deliberating on the

issues raised in the submissions, recommended that there  be  no

amendment to the Interpretation (Amendment) Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take this opportunity now to reiterate five

important points concerning the Interpretation (Amendment) Bill.

First,  the  objective  of  the  Bill  is  to  provide  a  legal

definition of death for all purposes and formalise what  is  the

currently accepted medical practice.  The traditional concept of

death,  referred to by doctors as "cardiac death",  occurs  when

there  is  permanent cessation of the circulation of  blood  and

respiration in the body of a person.  This concept, however, can

no  longer  be  applied  in every case because  of  advances  in

medical  treatment and technology, in particular,  resuscitative

and  life  support  technology.  The law must allow  doctors  to

certify  death  when  a  person's brain has  ceased  functioning

totally  and irreversibly, even though his heart is kept beating

or  can  be kept beating through artificial means for a  limited

period of time. This is because such a person is in effect  dead

and  there  is  no possibility at all that he will  ever  become

alive again.  The legal definition of death proposed in the Bill

will  allow  doctors to use either the cardiac  or  brain  death

criteria  to determine when death occurs.  The doctor determines

which  set of criteria should be used according to the  clinical

circumstances of the case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the determination of brain death will be in

accordance with clinical criteria that will be prescribed in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>

regulations under the new section 2A of the Act. These  criteria

will  be  the  same as those currently prescribed in  the  Human

Organ  Transplant  Act (HOTA) Regulations for determining  brain

death  in the case of HOTA donors.  The brain death criteria  in

HOTA  are  a  refinement of the criteria that  were  unanimously

adopted  by  the  Medical Royal Colleges and  Faculties  of  the

United Kingdom in 1976.

.    Third, HOTA was implemented in January 1988. The definition

of  brain  death  and the criteria for determining  brain  death

under HOTA have therefore been tried and tested for the last  10

years and have gained public acceptance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, there is a need in certain circumstances to define

precisely the time of death.  For example, the family of a brain

dead  person  who  is being maintained on a  ventilator  can  be

spared unnecessary mental anguish and financial burden if  brain

death  can be promptly determined and certified.  Also,  if  the

deceased or his family had consented to organ donation, accurate

and  timely  determination of death is  necessary  so  that  his

organs  would  still  be viable when harvested.   Any  delay  in

certifying  death  may  result  in  the  donated  organs   being

unsuitable for transplantation to save the lives of others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, there are additional provisions in the Bill

governing the certification of death in situations where  organs

will  be lawfully removed for transplant purposes.  This  is  to

assure  the  family  of  the deceased  and  the  community  that

adequate safeguards are in place to prevent untimely removal  of

the donor's organs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b>

Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with Section 4 of the

Foreshores  Act  (Cap.  113) approves  the  reclamation  by  the

Government of the foreshore and seabed at Changi East containing

an area of about 630

ha  as  shown  coloured  pink on the plan  marked  `LAND  OFFICE

RECLAMATION PLAN NO 2/98' which is deposited in the Land Office,

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the sitting on 9th November 1990, Parliament

approved   the  reclamation  of  approximately   1,545   ha   of

foreshore/seabed  at  Changi East for airport  extension,  naval

base,  recreational and industrial use.  Those reclamation works

are in progress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Trade and Industry and Ministry of National

Development  have jointly proposed to reclaim an additional  630

ha  of  foreshore/seabed at Changi East.  This is shown coloured

pink  on the plan marked "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO 2/98",

a  copy  of which is displayed in the Library of this House  for

the reference of hon. Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 630 ha, JTC requires 450 ha of land for industrial

use,  while  CIDB needs 90.9 ha for their uses such  as  landing

jetties, holding/storage space for construction materials, ready-mixed  concrete batching plants and concrete pre-cast  component

yards.   The  balance area will be used for roads  and  planting

strips by LTA and NParks respectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed reclamation should be carried out to meet

any  projected shortfall of industrial land after the year 2000.

Ministry  of  Trade  and Industry projects that  even  with  the

reclamation  at Tuas and Jurong Island for industrial  use,  the

short   and   medium  term  industrial  land  supply   will   be

insufficient.   The additional reclamation at Changi  East  will

enable  the Government to increase the industrial land stock  on

the main island.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Port of Singapore Authority will be appointed as agent

of  the  Government  to  oversee  the  reclamation  works.   The

proposed  reclamation is estimated to cost about $896.7 million.

It  will  commence  in  November 1998  and  is  expected  to  be

completed in December 2003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with Section 4 of the

<div align="center"><b>(Motion)</b></div>



<br>7.05 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> This motion requires the signification

of support by at least one Member.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> I support.



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That in view of the economic downturn and political

transition in Indonesia, the Government should do more  to  help

control  and  prevent fires in Indonesia that  impact  Singapore

with haze pollution and affect the environment, human health and

economic activity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many will remember the grey months in 1997 and early

1998.   We  all suffered from the haze pollution.  It  was  more

than  an  inconvenience.  The elderly and those  among  us  with

respiratory  problems  were particularly  affected.   Our  young

children  were especially vulnerable.  One of the world's  worst

ecological  disasters;  that is how  the  Chief  of  the  United

Nations  Environment Programme described the fires and  haze  in

our  region.  Yet, some have short memories.  In preparing  this

motion, some ask why I should seek to move this motion now.  Our

skies are quite clear, and the latest meteorological predictions

are  that  rain  in the region is likely to keep haze  pollution

levels  lower  than  they were last year.  Moreover,  some  have

asked  me to feel that the economic crisis of the region  should

take precedence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it is true that the rains have put down most of the

fires  for the moment.  I also recognise the great and turbulent

times  Singapore and the region face, especially our neighbours.

Yet, I also believe that it is more important and timely for  us

to  focus  on  the  issue of fires in the region  and  the  haze

pollution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must do this because the fires and haze are a recurrent

problem.   In  the  1990s alone, heavy haze was  experienced  in

1991, 1994, 1997 and this year.  Each time,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>

concern and anger arose.  Then the sentiment evaporated when the

skies  cleared,  and in our inaction, the fires  and  haze  have

happened  again.  So we must not be inactive this time when  the

skies  are  clear.  We should act before the  haze  is  upon  us

again.   It  may  be good politics to talk about this  when  the

skies  are  grey outside, but it will be too late to  solve  the

problem.  We should discuss the issue and set out what  we  need

to  do  now,  so that we will not have to suffer the  same  fate

again  next year or in future years.  If we postpone our actions

again,  it  will  be  too late.  We must act  preventively.   We

should act when the skies are clear, to make sure they stay that

way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Sir, I recognise the economic crisis in the region is

serious.   In fact, it is the background of the fires and  haze,

which originate largely from Indonesia, our neighbour.  We  have

to  understand that the environmental problem is  tied  up  with

economics.  It is the unscrupulous big businesses and  companies

who  are  behind  the fires, not the natural El Nino  phenomenon

alone.   Experts agree that the dry weather makes things  worse.

But  the origin and underlying causes of the fires are man made.

Moreover,  because we are learning that El Nino  is  a  cyclical

event, we must be prepared for the next time it comes.  And even

the  experts  do  not know exactly when that will  be.   Weather

forecasts have been wrong before.  We cannot therefore depend on

the vagaries of rain to save us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic crisis is both a threat and an opportunity for

the  haze and fires.  The crisis may lead to a worsening of  the

fires  and haze.  There are three threats.  The first threat  is

that   Indonesia   will   lack  administrative   and   financial

wherewithal to deal with the fires.  The second threat  is  that

Indonesia  will  give  low priority to the fires.   Singaporeans

will  remember that the former Environment Minister of Indonesia

placed the issue no higher than fifth in his list of priorities.

The  third  threat  is that the economic necessity  to  increase

exports and gain foreign currency for Indonesia

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>

will  lead  to  more  unscrupulous,  unsustainable  and  illegal

logging and clearing of plantations by fires.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crisis and political transition in our region and

Indonesia   also   create   a  window   of   opportunity.    The

opportunities  are two-fold.  First, that in  the  economic  and

political  reform, policies with negative environmental  impacts

may be corrected.  For example, the previous IMF package set out

a  number  of conditions, including reform on the allocation  of

forest  concessions.  If transparency is brought to the  system,

more responsible land users can be preferred over those who  use

fire  to  clear land.  The second opportunity is that among  the

reformers in Indonesia today, there are those who have cared and

still  care  for the environment.  There may therefore  be  more

people  in  Indonesia itself who will work with us in  Singapore

and others to safeguard the environment of our region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the recovery for Indonesia and the

region should aim to be on the basis of sustainable development,

rather  than  one  that needlessly destroys nature  and  natural

resources, and harms our environment and human health.  We  must

prioritize  actions against fires and haze.   Let  me  emphasise

that  this  is  not just an environmental issue  about  forests,

about  nature, about animals.   The human and health  costs  are

high.  Moreover, the fires and haze are also economic phenomena.

An  international  study has estimated that US$4.4  billion  was

lost  by  Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore in  the  1997  fires

alone.   This  is a considerable amount of money, especially  in

these bad economic times.  This sum, moreover, does not consider

possible longer-term health effects.  It also estimates the loss

of  tourist arrivals for just one year, 1997.  If the haze is  a

recurrent  problem  and our region has a  bad  reputation  among

tourists, we do not know how much more our economy may  lose  in

the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore urge our Government to consider how it can do

more to deal with the fires and haze.  In calling for them to do

more,  I  acknowledge  the work that the governments  of  ASEAN,

including Singapore's, have done to date.  Credit

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>

should go to ASEAN governments that they have continued to  meet

to discuss the Haze Action Plan and other responses to the fires

despite  the  economic crisis.  There has  been  some  progress,

which I leave to the Minister for the Environment to explain.  I

believe that many Singaporeans still do not know fully what  our

Government is doing to protect and care for them on this  issue.

I believe too that more can be done by Singapore, in addition to

what  has been done already.  There are, of course, many  things

that Indonesia can and should do for itself.  After all, the use

of  fires is illegal under Indonesia's own laws and the bulk  of

damage is suffered by her own people and environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making these suggestions, I draw from a policy dialogue

which  was  organised  in  early June  1998,  by  the  Singapore

Environment  Council  on  which I serve  as  a  director.   This

dialogue brought together some 40 non-governmental organisations

(NGOs), think-tanks and experts.  Many of these NGOs are working

in  Indonesia  and have experience on the ground  there.   There

were  also  representatives from the private sector,  the  Asian

Development  Bank,  ASEAN Secretariat  and  the  United  Nations

Environment  Programme.  I chaired the dialogue which  issued  a

statement    with   some   30   suggestions   for   governments,

international  donors  and  the  private  sector.   I  wish   to

highlight just a few suggestions here today and add some  of  my

own.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I speak in the Singapore Parliament, I shall focus more

today  on  what I hope Singapore and our Government may  do.   I

shall divide my suggestions between, first, Singapore as part of

ASEAN;   second,  bilateral  measures  between   Singapore   and

Indonesia; and, third, self-help, ie, what Singapore can do  for

itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, ASEAN. I urge that the Singapore Government work

with  ASEAN members to extend and strengthen the existing Action

Plans.   These  Action Plans rely too much on  goodwill  without

binding  obligations,  and I urge our Government  to  work  with

partners  towards  a  binding  treaty,  which  must  accept  the

principle of state responsibility that Indonesia or other

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>

countries  which cause the fires are responsible for  them,  and

then  to  create  a  system for dispute resolution  among  ASEAN

members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I call on ASEAN to recognise that Indonesia has

acted  contrary  to International Law and Principle  21  of  the

Stockholm  Declaration.  Indonesia is causing great  damage  not

only  to  our  region  but  also to global  climate  change  and

biodiversity,   and  these  are  subject  to  two  international

treaties   to   which  Indonesia  and  Singapore  are   members.

Singapore and ASEAN should therefore work to focus international

attention and assistance on the problem.  And this proposal,  in

some  senses,  is  like  our response to  the  economic  crisis.

Singapore can serve by being a focal point on this issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third suggestion on how Singapore should work with

ASEAN  is  a negative one.  I believe our Government  and  ASEAN

should  not over-emphasise water bombing, throwing water on  the

problem.   Sir, the experts we have consulted have advised  that

this  is  of  great  expense  and of little  effect,  especially

without  sufficient  fire-fighting on  the  ground.   Given  the

economic  crisis, I have no doubt that the Singapore  Government

may   come  under  pressure,  alongside  Brunei,  to  fund  such

spectacular but really quite unproductive efforts.  I  urge  our

Government not to take this step.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On bilateral measures between Indonesia and Singapore, my

suggestions are four.  First, we have refrained from emphasising

state  responsibility  of  Indonesia  and  their  liability  for

damages suffered by our people and economy.  We have shown  good

neighbourliness and understanding of their circumstances.   This

is good.  But our friends in Indonesia must recognise that there

are  limits.   This is especially because the fires are  caused,

not  by  the poor in Indonesia, not by the Government,   but  by

large  companies.  The poor in the affected areas  of  Indonesia

suffer  even  more than Singaporeans.  We must ask Indonesia  to

recognise its responsibility and to fulfil its duty to cooperate

to prevent a recurrence of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>

fires.    Indonesia   must  recognise  its  responsibility   for

transboundary pollution that affects us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second plea on the bilateral relations is that Singapore

should  not  necessarily conduct itself only  on  the  level  of

country  to country, government to government. Sir, I urge  that

the  Government consider means to make these disputes  at  their

natural  level,  ie,  largely  between  citizens  and  corporate

offenders.   Our  Government can, with Indonesia's  consent  and

cooperation,  set up a special court between the  countries  or,

alternatively,  to  allow special access  to  courts  in  either

country.  Examples of such courts exist in the Nordic Convention

among  the Nordic countries in Europe and in the North  American

Free Trade Agreement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, on bilateral issues, Singapore has promised

billions of dollars in loans to Indonesia for their economy  and

for trade guarantees, in particular.  Sir, I urge the Government

to  consider  that any further assistance to Indonesia  must  be

tied   first  to  their  environmental  performance.    We   are

Indonesia's friends.  I think in giving those first loans,  that

is  clear.  But the Indonesian government must do its utmost  to

help  its  own  people and environment, and the  people  of  the

region, including Singaporeans.  Indonesia should implement  its

own laws against the use of fire. It should investigate and name

offending  companies and enforce those laws against the  use  of

fire,  against  all companies equally and effectively.   Foreign

investors  may be among those offending shareholders,  including

Singaporeans.    There  have  been  statements   by   Indonesian

ministries to that effect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not urge that our Government should protect

Singaporean investors abroad if they are truly offenders.  But I

do urge our Government to ensure that Indonesia's prosecution of

such  corporate  offenders should be equal and  that  Indonesian

offenders  should  also  be  prosecuted  on  par  with   foreign

investors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, Sir, I call on the Singapore Government to engage

the Indonesian

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>

government  more  broadly,  not  just  the  Minister   for   the

Environment  but  also  the Indonesian Ministries  of  Forestry,

Agriculture,  Trade  and  Industry  and  Finance.    And   these

engagements should be at the highest level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as many experts, and I believe the Minister too, have

recognised,  there  is  a  lack of  coordination  in  Indonesian

authorities  on  this issue.    The power  of  the  Ministry  of

Environment  in  Indonesia to control  forest  and  agricultural

lands is not at all clear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move on to my suggestions on how Singapore can help

itself, ie, self-help.  The first proposal I hope the Government

will  consider  is  to promote and facilitate eco-labels.   Sir,

this  is  not jargon.   Basically, it is a certification process

by   which   we  can  discover  which  products  have   a   good

environmental background and which are manufactured or  produced

in  an  environmentally harmful way, in ways that use  fire  and

result in haze.  Certification processes are already used by our

Government   for  a  range  of  products.   I  urge   that   the

certification of products be applied to those connected with the

fires  and  haze, which are timber and oil palm.   Certification

would  allow  Singaporean consumers and  those  environmentally-minded  consumers  in Europe and America and elsewhere  to  vote

with  their  dollar  signs, to punish  the  corporate  offenders

directly in the market place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second measure for self-help I propose is that there

should  be  an advisory to all Singaporean companies  investing,

lending  or  trading  with Indonesian companies.   The  advisory

should   spell  out  at  least  their  obligations  to   observe

Indonesian laws against the use of fire to clear land.  If we do

not  do this, Sir, we are polluting ourselves.  If we do not  do

this,  Sir,  it  will  also  be  a  political  embarrassment  to

Singapore, if our companies pollute overseas and flout laws.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third self-help measure, I hope the Minister and the

Government   will  consider,  is  to  assist  in   investigating

Singaporean   companies,   if  requested   by   the   Indonesian

government.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we face a large problem, such as the fires and

haze,  some among us may shrug our shoulders and say, "We are  a

very  small  country, what can we do?"  It is true.   We  cannot

change our geography.  But I urge against this counsel of apathy

and  fatalism.  That is not the response of Singapore when faced

with  so  many crises such as the regional economic crisis.   In

that case, we have been among the countries that have sought  to

focus  international attention and assistance, and we have  done

our share, some say more than our share, with the loans, to help

our  neighbour.   This  same  positive,  proactive  and  helpful

response should be used for the fires.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also some who say that Singapore can indeed do

more.   But their version of what we should do is to give  money

and  keep  quiet.  I do not share this view.  I do not recommend

that  we throw money at the problem.  Nor do I say that we  must

interfere  in  our  neighbour's internal politics.   I  want  to

stress  that  this,  as I see it, is not  a  case  of  Singapore

against  Indonesia, or Indonesia against Singapore.   There  are

those  in Indonesia who genuinely wish to solve the problems  of

the fires and haze and to enforce their own laws.  After all, as

I  have said, the Indonesians are the ones who suffer the  most,

not  us.   If such people have the will and the skill, but  lack

equipment,  know-how and funding, Singapore should assist  them.

It  is  the right thing to do and it is in our national interest

to do it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are others in Indonesia who wilfully set the fires or

who  close  one  eye to those who set the fires.   These  people

profit  from  flouting the laws and causing  damage  to  others.

These  people are no friends of mine, nor should they be friends

of  anyone in Singapore, I hope.  It is not help or funding that

we should give such people.  We have to find legal sanctions and

trade  and other measures that can press such people to  do  the

right thing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am saying as such, Sir, is that we need a mix of

help  and  sanctions, of carrots and sticks.  We  need  to  help

those  who  genuinely want and need our help, and  pressure  and

impose sanctions on the bad guys.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the motion is that the Singapore Government should do

more.  I have given some specific suggestions, but these are not

part  of the motion itself.  The precise measures can and should

be   left  to  the  Minister  for  the  Environment.   The  more

fundamental question, I urge upon the House, is whether we  have

done  enough  today,  whether  our  people  perceive  that   our

Government has done all it can and all it should.  If not,  then

we should do more.  And all those who wish the Government should

do more, including the Government itself if it plans to do more,

should support this motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that we should do this and not sit passive. We

should  do  this because this is a transboundary  issue,  not  a

domestic  matter,  but  a  matter of common  concern,  of  great

relevance  to  all  of  us.   We  should  do  this  because  the

international law is on our side, and against the fire starters.

We  should do this as part of our contribution to help save  the

global environment from further climate change gases and loss of

biodiversity.  We should do this because our economy needs  more

stimulus and growth, not further strain and grey skies from  the

haze.   We should do this because Singapore is our home, and  in

our  home,  we, especially our elderly parents and grandparents,

our young children and grandchildren, should be kept safe.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise

in support of the motion in the name of Mr Simon Tay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not too long ago, Singapore was blanketed with an unusual

haze  phenomenon on a scale never before experienced  here.   It

immediately  brought to our attention that what  was  previously

thought  of  as an unrelated seasonal problem, miles  away  from

Singapore, can bring about serious consequences to our lives and

economic  activities.  The forest fires in  Indonesia  certainly

made  life in Singapore difficult, from respiratory ailments  to

other   health   problems,  falling  tourist   arrivals,   which

consequently affected businesses in the hotel and retail  sector

at a time when these businesses

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>

are  heavily  dependent  on tourism.  It frustrated  efforts  to

promote  Singapore as a region, as an equatorial paradise.   Now

blanketed  by  smoke and haze, Southeast Asia quickly  became  a

destination to be avoided.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The haze problem brought home the point that Singapore

cannot  ignore issues like forest fires raging in a neighbouring

country.   These  problems  have wide, geographic  and  economic

ramifications.  These  problems respect  no  boundary.   Despite

these problems, Singaporeans have reacted to the situation  with

its  usual  calm and matured manner, aware of the  sensitivities

and  appreciate  the good relationship with its neighbours.   In

fact,  there  were  calls for more assistance  to  be  given  to

Indonesia  to help poor farmers cope with the situation.   After

all,  you cannot blame anyone for the changing weather condition

that is wreaking havoc across many countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it later became apparent that forest fires are not

merely  the  result of bad weather or poor methods  of  shifting

cultivation, but the involvement of major business conglomerates

engaged  in pre-meditated burning with total disregard  for  the

environment,  simply for commercial gains.  Quietly,  and  quite

quickly,  Singaporeans were upset and fed up with the situation.

While they may see the need and urgency to help in terms of both

expertise  and equipment and financial resources,  others  doubt

the  efficacy  and the effectiveness of such efforts  without  a

clear demonstration on the part of these businesses to stop  the

practice  of burning as a convenient but irresponsible means  of

clearing  land.  Now that the skies have become clearer,  albeit

temporarily, another type of storm is raging throughout Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the economic and political reforms now taking place in

Indonesia,  environmental issues may appear less  pressing.   On

the  contrary, with the onset of the dry season, renewed  threat

of  fire  and haze is ever present.  The haze that has blanketed

us since the middle of last year may not be visible now.  But it

is by no means a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>

closed  chapter.  Therefore, as good friends and neighbours,  we

must  help  Indonesia, not only in its efforts towards  economic

and political reforms, but in environmental reforms, and putting

in place measures to prevent future fires from taking place.  By

coordinating resources through the national haze action plan and

changing  the  mindset  about the environment,  that  while  the

forest   may   be   geographically  a  national   interest   and

responsibility, the environment is for all mankind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a country that is heavily dependent on external

assistance to stabilise and reform its economy, as it  does  not

have  the resources to tackle a huge environmental problem  with

the  same urgency, as we think it deserves, therefore, it is  in

our own interest that this matter is given the attention that is

needed.  I am glad for the active role that Singapore is playing

through the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on haze.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should continue to do more in terms of providing the

equipment  and financial resources from ourselves and persuading

other donor countries to help.  But amidst scarce resources  and

competing  needs brought about by the economic crisis,  we  must

ensure  that  resources  and assistance  will  bring  about  the

desired  outcomes in terms of preventing forest  fires  and  the

renewed  commitment towards a more responsible attitude  towards

the  environment.  Clearly assistance must be tied to firm plans

and commitment.  After all, for this assistance to be effective,

what  is  really needed are national plans for public  education

effort and strict enforcement against open burning, mobilisation

of  ground  fire fighting forces and transmission of information

on  fire outbreaks, matters which only the Indonesian Government

can  and must do, for no amount of international effort will  be

sufficient  if  the  will and commitment are lacking  at  places

where  they  are most needed - at the grassroots levels,  within

the business, the farmers, the villagers and local officials.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, Singaporeans must continue to be aware

not  to  be  too critical, for it is easy for us to  talk  about

forest

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>

fires, because we do not have any forest to talk about.  But  it

is  precisely  because  of  this that  Singapore  should  remain

involved  and  active, and demonstrate our willingness  to  help

solve this problem.  We should do more to help our neighbours to

be  better  equipped  and prepared to tackle  the  environmental

problem.   Never  before has it been clearly  demonstrated  that

even  for environmental issues, unless we take a firm and active

action, the clean air, water and equatorial forests for which we

are  so  dependent upon and for which we have taken for  granted

for so long may be a thing of the past.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first, let me

say  to  the  two NMPs that I do understand their concerns  and,

indeed, I fully share their concerns about the haze situation in

Indonesia  and the potential for the haze to return to Singapore

again when the dry season starts in the coming months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as pointed out by Mr Simon Tay, we have actually been

doing  quite a fair bit.  Before I reply to his specific points,

it  would  be good for me to explain the approach the Government

has taken so far, what we have done, and what we intend to do in

the coming months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me assure Members that Singapore, together with

our  ASEAN members, are continuing to pay close attention to the

threat  of  fires and haze, even though the skies are  now  very

clear.   We  fully realise that a repeat of the 1997  fires  and

haze disaster will certainly aggravate the region's already  bad

economic situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ASEAN countries also appreciate the economic problems

facing  Indonesia.   We  recognise that we  must  actively  help

Indonesia  to  prevent  fires and haze.  The  regional  economic

turmoil also means that such help must come not just from  ASEAN

members, but also from the larger international community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I share Mr Simon Tay's and Mr Zulkifli's

views  that  international assistance must be  directed  towards

measures  that  can  indeed be effective  in  dealing  with  the

problem, both in the short, medium and long term.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few months ago, when fires were raging in Kalimantan, the

priority then was to internationally mobilise equipment to fight

those  huge raging fires.   Fortunately, rains have returned  to

the region, and have helped to put out the large-scale fires  in

most  parts  of Indonesia.  Our focus has consequently  changed.

What is most pressing now is to help Indonesia in its effort  to

prevent  fires,  to detect fires early, and to put  in  place  a

system to put fires out as soon as they are detected.  The focus

of  regional  and international assistance should  therefore  be

shifted  from  efforts to put out huge raging fires  to  funding

ground-level activities aimed at putting out fires when they are

still small and manageable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the last haze episode, Singapore has, in fact, taken

a lead role in forging a regional response to the fires and haze

problem.  We hosted the very first ASEAN Ministerial Meeting  on

Haze  (AMMH)  in  December  last year and  initiated  the  ASEAN

Regional Haze Action Plan (RHAP).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Regional Haze Action Plan has provided a broad

framework  for  the  region  to tackle  the  haze  problem.   It

encompasses  short-, medium- and long-term  solutions.   Through

the  Action  Plan,  ASEAN countries have since  concluded  their

respective  national  haze  action plans,  identified  resources

available  and the additional resources needed to  fight  fires,

and  set  out  various  mechanisms  for  greater  intra-regional

cooperation on fires and haze.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key development under the Regional Action Plan was the

agreement  to  quickly implement two sub-Regional  Fire-fighting

Arrangements   -  one  to  prevent  fires  from  developing   in

Kalimantan and the other in Sumatra.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sub-Regional Fire-fighting Arrangements (RFAs) deal

with  ground  level  cooperation needed to detect,  monitor  and

fight  fires.   They  involve the sharing  and  mobilisation  of

resources within a sub-region to pre-empt and fight fires.   The

objective  is  to ensure that fire outbreaks are detected  early

and  put out quickly before they can expand to a disaster level.

Malaysia is the lead country in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>

Sumatra  RFA,  with  Indonesia and Singapore as  members,  while

Brunei  is  leading  the  Kalimantan  RFA,  with  Indonesia  and

Malaysia as the other two members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the recent ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Haze held in

Singapore  on  19th June, the ASEAN Environment  Ministers  felt

that  aerial water bombing is not only extremely expensive,  but

may not be that effective in heavily forested areas.  So in this

respect,  I  think  Mr  Simon  Tay  is  correct.   This  is  our

conclusion  too.   The Ministers agreed that Sumatra  RFA  would

involve two key activities.  The first is an aerial surveillance

regime  to  detect fires.  Why do we need this?  We  have  found

that  the existing satellite monitoring system that we  have  in

place  now  can only detect fairly sizeable fires.  Very  often,

these  fires  are  already too large to be easily  put  out.   A

monitoring  regime  using aircraft will help  to  overcome  this

limitation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerial surveillance, however, is also a very costly

operation.  Fortunately, Indonesia plans to use her own hardware

resources, thereby significantly reducing the cost.  But because

of economic problems, Indonesia will need help in funding out-of-pocket  expenses, especially fuel costs.  During the Ministerial

meeting, both UNEP and the USA, fortunately, had indicated their

interest  in participating in the aerial operations  and  we  do

look forward to their funding support for these operations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second activity under the Sumatra RFA is to improve the

communications  network among agencies  at  the  provincial  and

district  levels in Sumatra.  The objective is  to  ensure  that

information on fires can be quickly disseminated to  the  ground

fire-fighting forces.   This is an area where Singapore has  the

expertise.   We  will be providing Indonesia with  communication

and  computer  equipment to support the aerial surveillance  and

fire  fighting  operations.   The key  is  to  ensure  that  the

information picked up by the aerial spotters can be very quickly

fed down to the ground forces because every

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>

hour  that  is  lost will result in the fire only  getting  much

larger.  We will focus our assistance on four priority provinces

in  Sumatra, namely, Riau, Lampung, Southern Sumatra and  Jambi.

These  are the four provinces with significant fire-prone forest

land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make the RFAs effective, Indonesia will need help in

other  areas  too.  These would include fire-fighting  equipment

and the training for their firemen.  These are areas where other

countries have the necessary expertise.  Malaysia has offered to

provide  training  on  fire fighting and  ASEAN  countries  will

continue  to  seek  international assistance  through  UNEP  and

bilaterally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to UNEP and international assistance, UNEP has

participated in most of the ASEAN haze meetings and  is  playing

an  important  role in mobilising international assistance.   It

has  formulated a US$10 million short-term plan to contain fires

in  Kalimantan, and this plan was drawn up when there were about

1,000 fires raging in Kalimantan.  However, as recent rains have

helped to put out the Kalimantan fires, the donor countries have

quite understandably not been very forthcoming in responding  to

UNEP's  appeal.   At  the  recent  Ministerial  meeting,  UNEP's

representative  agreed that it would now try to  get  the  donor

countries  to  contribute towards preventive  measures  instead.

ASEAN will continue to maintain close contact and work with UNEP

on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about our role? Singapore will continue to provide

assistance  to  Indonesia  on  the  forest  fire  problem,  both

bilaterally and as part of regional and international efforts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, we provided about $300,000 to install an

Intranet  system  that enables ASEAN countries to  expeditiously

share satellite information on fires and haze.  We also provided

the  Jakarta Command Post, which monitors fires and  haze,  with

various  hi-tech  communication  equipment  and  computers,  and

trained its staff on their use.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, at Indonesia's request, we intend to provide

further assistance under the RFAs.  These would include computer

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>

and  communication equipment to support aerial surveillance  and

fire-fighting operations, as I have mentioned just now.  We will

also  train key ground staff from these provinces on the use  of

these and other equipment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another key element which the Ministers have identified is

public  education.   Public education must go hand-in-hand  with

other  efforts to deal with the haze.  Indeed, public  education

is  an important aspect addressed under the Regional Haze Action

Plan  and  the  Ministers have agreed that public education  and

incentives  against open burning should be widely  conducted  at

the  local levels.  These measures have, in fact, been  included

under  the  respective National Haze Action Plans, and  we  will

have to develop them into the implementation stage subsequently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On enforcement, ASEAN Ministers have also urged Indonesia

to  step  up its enforcement against illegal burning activities.

We noted that the Association of Indonesian Forest Entrepreneurs

was  prosecuted in court recently, and fined 50 billion  rupiah.

It  is  only  through effective enforcement, coupled with  heavy

penalties  that  reflect  the true cost  of  the  fires  to  the

Indonesian  and  regional economies, and to the  health  of  the

people,   that  Indonesia  can  deter  plantation  owners   from

continuing their highly irresponsible activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At our recent meeting, the Ministers also agreed that ASEAN

countries  should  include  presumptive  provisions   in   their

national laws to make it easier to successfully prosecute owners

of  burnt land.  This arose from the explanation that it is very

difficult to catch people who are setting fires to the land red-handed,  and  therefore the burden of proof is a very  difficult

one  to  fulfil.  At that discussion, both Brunei  and  Malaysia

shared with us their experience and they told us that they  have

such  presumptive  provisions  in  their  laws  and  that  these

presumptive  provisions  turn  out  to  be  very  effective   in

deterring illegal open burning activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministers also urged countries which are converting

large tracts of forest

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>

and  peat lands into plantations to carefully review their land-use policies so as to discourage open burning practices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay has also mentioned some other points. I will take

them  up separately.  He has asked that Singapore work with  the

other  ASEAN countries to strengthen the action plans.   We  are

doing that.  In fact, the Sub-Regional Fire-fighting Arrangement

is  a  result of the Regional Haze Action Plan that was  put  in

place.   As  we continue with the discussions, we were  able  to

translate  some of those information sharing plans  into  actual

action  plans  on  the ground. So the RFA was one  of  the  very

important outcomes of the Regional Haze Action Plan and we  will

continue  to  strengthen  those action  plans  and  ensure  that

resources can be found to implement them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also talked several times about the need to have

binding  treaties.   Sir,  treaties result  only  when  all  the

parties  involved are prepared to even consider the  possibility

of  such  treaties.  I do not think we have come to  that  stage

yet.   In  fact, we are very, very far from that stage where  we

can  even talk about the possibility of treaties.  Let us  focus

on  things which are productive, things which do not divide  the

whole meeting and make the meeting acrimonious.  Let us work  on

things  that  all  parties can agree with  and  where  effective

outcomes can be found.  Therefore, I do not think his suggestion

about  Singapore coming out with binding treaties with Indonesia

or,  in fact, with the other ASEAN countries is something  which

is viable at this present stage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked that the ASEAN countries and Singapore ask

Indonesia  to  recognise its responsibility  to  prevent  fires.

Sir, indeed, that is what we have been doing very actively.   As

a  result,  we  have  been able to make  progress  in  terms  of

bilateral  and regional cooperation on ways to tackle the  fires

and haze.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked us to set up a special court to prosecute

offenders, if I get it right.  Is that what he proposes?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> It is a special court which will allow

Singapore citizens or people who damage their companies  to  sue

Indonesian companies directly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I am not a lawyer. I do not know

whether this is a feasible approach.  I shall consult our  legal

experts.   But, as a layman, I would expect that any arrangement

of   this  sort  must  have  the  agreement  of  our  Indonesian

counterparts.   As  I  said just now,  I  do  not  think  it  is

something that is going to be very viable at the present moment.

In fact, we may actually be souring up the environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked that we release names of companies that

are  involved in illegal burning and ensure that the  Indonesian

government  prosecutes  both Indonesian  companies  and  foreign

companies  equally.  Sir, in fact, we have been asking  for  the

names  of the companies from Indonesia.  But till now,  we  have

not  received any response.  I think part of the problem is that

they  have  difficulties  proving  guilt  on  the  part  of  the

companies  that they have identified.  As such, I  think,  as  a

lawyer,  Mr  Tay would realise that until guilt is  proven,  one

should  not  start to penalise them.  Therefore, the  Indonesian

authorities  have  not come back to us with  the  names  of  the

companies.  At the last meeting, the Minister told us  that  two

companies  are  now  in the process of being prosecuted  and  we

await the outcome of these two cases when they come to court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked that we promote eco-labels. Sir, we already

have  a  Eco-Labelling Scheme in place in Singapore.  It is  not

for  the  Government to actively promote one class  of  products

over  another.  It is for the consumers and this  is  where  the

NGOs  may have a role.  If the NGOs feel very strongly that eco-labelling  is  useful  and  that products  with  eco-labels  are

supported, then I would propose that the NGOs who feel that  way

take an active role in promoting them.  But having said that, we

have to be aware of the potential negative implications.  One of

the  fears that many countries have expressed is the use of eco-labels  by  the  developed  countries as  a  protectionist  tool

against

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>

products from developing countries which may not be able to meet

those  high  eco-standards set by the developed  countries.   In

this respect, I would urge NGOs, even if they are interested, to

be  a  bit circumspect and look at the full implications of  the

scheme rather than look at very narrow aspects of the scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked us to identify and certify products which

are  linked to the haze and fires.  Sir, we are not able  to  do

that  because,  in the first place, we do not  even  know  which

companies are involved in deliberate fire setting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked us to issue advisory to Singapore companies

about their obligations to comply with the laws of the countries

they operate in.  Sir, we have stated these repeatedly that  the

Government  expects all Singapore businessmen and  companies  to

fully  comply  with the laws of the countries they  operate  in,

whether  it is in Indonesia, other parts of South East Asia,  or

countries   outside  the  region.   This  has  been  very   well

publicised  and  I  am sure our companies and  businessmen  know

this.   Nevertheless, I would like to take this  opportunity  to

remind   all  companies  that  are  operating  specifically   in

Indonesia  to strictly comply with Indonesian laws  against  the

use  of  fires  for land clearing activities.  I would  like  to

remind  them  that,  as  in  all  cases,  where  companies   are

prosecuted for contravening laws of other countries, they cannot

expect the Singapore Government to intervene on their behalf  if

they  are found guilty of being involved in such activities  and

are heavily penalised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked that we assist in investigating Singapore

companies  if the Indonesian government requests us.   Sir,  the

fires  started and took place in Indonesia.  This is  where  the

investigations have to be carried out.  I do not see what  value

Singapore  can  add to investigation into the  fires  that  take

place in Indonesia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also touched on those in Indonesia who want to help

solve   the  problem  and  that  we  should  help  them.    Sir,

governments  have  to work on a government-to-government  basis.

If the NGOs in Indonesia are very much concerned about

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>

the  problem,  and  I  think they have got good  reasons  to  be

concerned  about the problem, then it is up to our NGOs  to  see

what  they  can  do  to help them.  It is not possible  for  the

Singapore  Government  to intervene and actively  help  NGOs  in

other countries on matters which affect those countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those points raised by Mr Zulkifli are in many ways similar

to what Mr Tay has mentioned and I have addressed them too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me conclude by stressing that, despite all of

ASEAN's  efforts  and  even  with international  assistance,  we

cannot be the ones to put out the fires in Indonesia.  The fires

can only be prevented and put out by Indonesia herself.  Indeed,

Indonesia  has since indicated that she prefers to use  her  own

firemen to fight the fires.  What neighbouring countries and the

international community can do is to help strengthen Indonesia's

capacity to detect fires early and put them out quickly.   ASEAN

will  also help Indonesia address efforts against slash-and-burn

practices   and   urge  Indonesia  to  take  strong,   effective

enforcement actions against irresponsible plantation owners.  On

Singapore's  part, we have been actively helping Indonesia  over

the  past  year  to  address some of the challenges  related  to

forest fires and haze.  In this respect, I agree with the motion

by Mr Tay that we should do more and, indeed, we are doing more.

But these efforts and assistance should focus on areas which are

going  to be productive and which will help us move the solution

along    rather   than   addressing   things   which   may    be

counterproductive.   But  we  also appreciate  that  our  utmost

efforts  will  still  be not enough in  view  of  the  scale  of

challenge  facing  Indonesia.  We will therefore  also  help  by

continuing to rally further support and assistance for Indonesia

at the regional and international levels.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, if I understand the

Minister correctly, he supports the motion.  May I clarify  that

with him?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Yes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> I am heartened by that. But if I may very

briefly, given the hour, address some of the points.  I call for

basically a mix of carrots and sticks.  Of course, it is for the

Government  of  our  country to determine the  actual  mix  and,

again,  I  see  the  greater experience  and  authority  of  the

Minister  and the Government in determining what the mix  should

be  in its dealings with Indonesia.  As I said, I myself do  not

feel this is a Singapore-against-Indonesia issue and I hope  our

Indonesian colleagues do not feel that way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very much the victims of pollution against the people

who  created  the pollution, wherever they stand on the  border.

But,  however,  I must urge the Minister that the  route  he  is

taking  us  down, while increasing the capacity of Indonesia  to

respond,  will  not  necessarily  increase  the  will   of   the

Indonesian  government  to  respond  and  that  we  should   not

therefore  give up all sanctions and pressures.  I am of  course

aware  that  ASEAN prefers to put those pressures behind  closed

doors.   I  then ask the Government to allow greater leeway  for

NGOs  and people in Singapore to publicly express their concerns

to  the  Indonesian  people  and  government  in  their  private

capacities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I wish the Minister to consider that the eco-labels that he rejects should not be rejected out of hand. I

urge  that  the  Government study them.   The  Ministry  of  the

Environment  already administers all the existing eco-labels  in

Singapore.  There are more than 20-over products under these eco-labels.  We should not surrender this possibility once companies

are prosecuted, once names are named.  We should not abandon the

power  to  go  against the bad guys in the marketplace.   If  we

cannot  enforce Indonesian laws, we have a market for  which  we

can ask our consumers to make their voice known.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister cautioned against the danger of protectionism.

I  am  reminded of course that our Minister for the  Environment

was  previously the Minister for Trade and Industry and this was

a  very  controversial issue and I share that concern.   But  we

must  see  clearly that in this issue of timber  and  oil  palm,

there is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>

no danger that Singapore has protectionist measures in mind.  We

have got no timber and we have got no oil palm.  What we have in

mind is not protectionism, but protection.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also said that the government must work

with government and I believe that it is correct.  But there are

many tools in international law and international relations,  as

the  Minister well knows, to fund international agencies and  to

have international agencies support programmes and projects that

seem  workable, whether these programmes and projects come  from

NGOs or from Indonesia's host government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am encouraged by the Minister's support. I believe the

Minister  has more to say.  Without possibly responding  to  him

again,  I just wish to add that, as Indonesia goes through  this

period of reconstruction in environment, I urge, and this  point

has  not been addressed by the Minister for the Environment  or,

perhaps it is to be addressed by the Government as a whole, that

we  engage Indonesia not purely in terms of the environment  but

on these issues, again I stress, on forestry, on agriculture, on

trade and industry and finance as a whole, because these are not

about  fires  per se but about economic imperatives  that  drive

Indonesian   companies  or  Singapore  investors  in  Indonesian

companies to do these bad practices.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Yeo, do you wish to clarify?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I would like to respond to a few of

his  points.   First,  on sanctions.  I  think  the  concept  of

sanctions is best exemplified by the Americans.  The US  is  the

superpower  of the world, in fact, the main power in the  world.

They  have  applied  sanctions to many countries  and,  in  many

cases,  those sanctions have shown very minimal results,  if  at

all.   In  the  context  of Singapore, I think  the  concept  of

sanctions  would almost be laughable, and I think we should  not

do discredit to ourselves by doing something which would totally

be ineffective.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on eco-labels, yes, we already have the Eco-Labelling

Scheme.  But the Eco-Labelling Scheme is one which is very  well

established,  and  the  scheme  recognises  products  which  are

environmentally friendly.  What we have been trying  to  prevent

is  the concept of eco-labelling that labels products which  are

environmentally  unfriendly.  Because  that  opens  up  a  whole

Pandora's box of products which are environmentally unfriendly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a factory that does not reduce humidity artificially and

workers are sweating away, is that an environmentally unfriendly

factory  to  the  workers?  If a country  which  has  very  poor

sewerage   facilities  thereby  resulting  in   factories   also

discharging  wastes which are semi-treated into the open  drains

which,  of course, in a developed country would be an absolutely

no-no,  would  those  products be also declared  environmentally

unfriendly and therefore given a black eco-label?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not that Singapore does not have any timber and

oil palms and therefore we came up with this black eco-label  on

timber and oil palm products.  It is the principle and the whole

concept of the Eco-Labelling Scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has a very well established reputation in the

trading  world.  Whatever we do, I can assure Members,  will  be

jumped  upon and distorted for their own use by other countries.

Do we want to be the one to open the Pandora's box?  I think the

cost  to us from opening such a Pandora's box will be many, many

times  larger  than  the  worst haze  experience  we  have  ever

encountered.   So  I would urge that while we have  an  area  of

concern,  let us not allow our concerns to overpower our  better

judgment  and result in a bigger problem for not just  Singapore

but  the  whole region.  This will also boomerang on us, because

we are so interlinked with economies of the region.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I think that is a nice point to stop the

debate. I have allowed you a few clarifications.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I think I have addressed his three

points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That in view of the economic downturn and political

transition in Indonesia, the Government should do more  to  help

control  and  prevent fires in Indonesia that  impact  Singapore

with haze pollution and affect the environment, human health and

economic activity.

<div align="center"><b>PREPARATIONS FOR FUTURE CHANGES IN ELECTORATE TRENDS</b></div>

<br>8.05 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, at the outset, I

would  like to clarify that the motion I am moving this  evening

relates to changes in demographic patterns in this country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has been very successful, thus far, in

anticipating and cushioning foreseeable problems.  This has been

the hallmark of the PAP Government.  Today, Sir, I would like to

share  my  concerns  on the preparations for future  changes  in

electorate  trends  and the problems that  may  accompany  these

changes  in Singapore.  The implications for our future  leaders

and  the  consequences to this country as a whole  are  immense.

Plans  should be made, even as of now, or we will be faced  with

insurmountable problems.  Act before it is too late, so that  we

can  have a softer landing when facing the issue in the not  too

distant future.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am talking about the changes in the pattern of the

electorate.  The number of people above 40 years of age,  as  of

June  1997, was 1,094,900 and this number will increase  as  the

years go by.  This group of electorate will be more educated and

more influential and they will present certain pressures when it

comes  to voting for their government.  They will probably lobby

for  special  requirements  and different  subsidies.   And,  of

course,  it will be in the interest of the Government  that  the

needs of these citizens are gratified.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with this in mind that we have to plan ahead, well

into the future, on balancing the whole process of providing for

the  welfare  of one group without jeopardizing the  welfare  of

another   and  without  placing  undue  burdens  upon  continued

progress  of the State.  To succeed in this, we need a concerted

effort by the various authorities to work hand in hand.  We also

need all Singaporeans to understand that some sacrifices have to

be accommodated for the sake of a successful Singapore for their

children and grandchildren.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would suggest that we look at the following as ways

which  either the Government on its own, the Government together

with  the people or the people by themselves can adopt  to  help

solve this potential dilemma:

<br><br><i>Promoting the right mindset</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important prerequisite for success in this aspect

is  for  all  Singaporeans  to desire  self-reliance  and  self-sufficiency  without  burdening their  children  or  the  State.

Whilst  such a mindset will not be easily achieved, it  must  be

encouraged.   The Government must make the concept "popular"  to

our  people  who  may, very likely, construe it as  yet  another

burden  imposed  on  them.   Impart the  idea  effectively  with

abundant  education  and  explanation.  Implement  new  policies

gradually and with meaningful incentives so that the people  can

accept  this  mindset without undue hardship.   Previously,  our

forefathers' guarantee of future security and bliss was  through

having  children.   Nowadays, the smaller family units  and  the

living

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>

styles  are minus points for any guarantees of security  through

children  alone.   Added to this, the limited resources  of  our

country  mean  that, in future, we will need  every  able-bodied

citizen  to be in the workforce so  as to maximize our  economic

worth.   We can expect to hit a dependency ratio of 3  to  1  in

time to come.

<br><br><i>Saving more for the golden years</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need for more personal savings from now. The

message  should be "save as much as you can now for your comfort

in  the  future".  The CPF compulsory savings can only be enough

for  subsistence levels of living and indeed may not  be  enough

for  the  old-age,  especially when  we  will  see  longer  life

expectancy of people even beyond 80 years of age.  For the  more

affluent  middle-aged  Singaporeans,  there  is  an  even   more

pressing  need to save because they would have become accustomed

to more expensive lifestyles.  Moderation on their spending will

prevent  their  life earnings from being wiped out  for  a  more

graceful lifestyle in old age.

<br><br><i>Building up family ties</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promoting family values and improving family ties is of

fundamental  importance as the building block  of  our  society.

With  our fast-paced lifestyles, it now looks like we have  even

more  reasons to step up nation-wide efforts in promoting  these

values  in  our  society.  Government policies  can  be  further

enhanced  to  make this necessity a reality.  We  can  never  do

enough.   The  virtues  of  a closely knit  family  circle,  and

especially  of a three-tier family, loving and caring  for  each

other,  should  be  accentuated within our society  through  the

schools, the grassroots organisations and the whole community in

general.

<br><br><i>Encouraging self-sufficient lifestyles</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pipeline, and certainly on the right track, are the

studio  apartments which will be built for our senior  citizens.

They,   however,  are  only  the  hardware  for  self-sufficient

lifestyles.  It is important that the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>

software  is  available alongside.  Hence, the various  concepts

that   promote  self-help  activities  and  social  interactions

amongst  the  dwellers  of  these  studio  apartments  with  the

eventual formation of "buddy groups" helping each other,  should

be  encouraged.  Only when we have this software in  place  will

the  studio  apartments  package reach the  maximal  values  and

success in the future.

<br><br><i>Prolonging employability</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not sufficient just to raise the retirement age.

More  must  be  done  to help the older folk  get  back  to  the

workforce.   The  authorities in Government  and  the  employers

should  try to provide more opportunities for older workers  and

create  special  but  meaningful jobs  for  them.   It  is  also

necessary  to  train those who are willing  and  allow  them  to

contribute with dignity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a medical doctor, I cannot help but to also mention the

next two points.  They are, of course, related to the healthcare

aspects  of  this issue.  I have made mention of them previously

and they are:

<br><br><i>Maintaining healthy lifestyles</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any population, just by maintaining healthy lifestyles, can

reduce  severe  disabilities by as much as 60%.   Therefore,  we

should  adopt  a  more proactive approach to promote  this  idea

nation-wide.   People  from all walks of  life,  and  especially

those  near retirement or at retirement age, should be  reached.

This  latter group whose lives may span another 25 years  or  so

will  benefit  the  most.  Preventive care,  rather  than  acute

hospital  care,  is the way to go and it will save  us  all  the

money  and  save us from the agony in the end. It is  inevitable

that  we  will also have dependent cases that require much  more

help.  We will need to train more care-providers.  We will  also

need  to  provide  more care-services.  Both of  these,  at  the

moment,  are  not sufficient and are certainly  not  capable  of

coping with the increasing demands.

<br><br><i>Keeping healthcare cost affordable</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medisave and MediShield have limitations. Moreover, they

do not cater for those who suffer from  chronic illnesses

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>

and   require  substantial  expenses  without  warding  in   the

hospitals.   There may be a place to add a further  "safety-net"

insurance  to fill the gap left out by Medisave and  MediShield.

This insurance is to be used before resorting to Medifund which,

otherwise,  will be undesirably and excessively drained  in  the

future.   The  need  to  be cared for sufficiently  in  case  of

catastrophic illnesses, the inevitable escalation of  healthcare

cost  in future, the expected increase in the life-span of  most

people  to  80  years of age or more and hence  the  inescapable

increase  in  incidence  of  catastrophic  illnesses  should  be

highlighted.   This  extra insurance scheme  must  be  carefully

explained to the Medisave and MediShield subscribers lest it  be

construed as yet another "pay and pay" burden.  There must be an

incentive  for  saving further here.  Some  form  of  co-payment

between the Government and the subscribers and the respite  from

having  to save more in the Medisave or paying more premium  for

MediShield may be the way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the changes to future trends of the electorate in

Singapore,  the  problems they portend and the implications  for

all  of  us  are immense.  I beg the indulgence of our Ministers

and  my  parliamentary  colleagues to  look  further  into  this

matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Community

Development (Mr Chan Soo Sen): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, firstly I

would  like to thank the hon. Member for Kreta Ayer-Tanglin  for

the reminder for us to prepare for future changes in demographic

profile.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I use the word "reminder" because the Government has been

successful  in the last 40 years in planning ahead, anticipating

problems,  and  in  acting  early  before  the  problems  become

serious.   We  have also been fortunate in having an  electorate

that is prepared to think long term and accept necessary, though

not  always,  popular measures.  Our challenge, in fact,  is  to

ensure  that  this  time-proven way of doing things,  which  has

proven  to  have  served us so well in the last  40  years,  can

continue.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is aware of the demographic trend outlined

by   the   hon.  Member.   Because  of  Government's   education

programmes,  our  electorate will become better  educated,  more

creative,  and want to participate more actively in  matters  of

state.   I  would  want  to say that these  are  strengths,  not

weaknesses.  If more of our electorate participate more actively

in  the decision-making process, ownership towards policies will

increase,  commitment to our country will be enhanced,  and  our

people  will  be more cohesive.  A thriving people  sector  will

channel  the  energy  of our better educated electorate  towards

nation-building.  Together we will build a better Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I would also like to submit that a lot of these

are already taking place.  The Government has, over the last  20

years or so, gradually empowered the local communities to manage

their  own  affairs. With Town Councils, local communities  take

charge  of  estate  management and  upgrading.   With  Community

Development  Councils, local communities develop the heart-ware.

The  Government is actually looking ahead into the 21st  century

by  forming the Singapore 21 Committee to map out strategies for

nation-building.   The Committee has been involving  the  people

sector  extensively  to discuss the five dilemmas,  and  we  can

guarantee  that  people sector will be actively engaged  because

the  Chairman  of  the Committee, RAdm Teo  Chee  Hean,  is  the

Minister who first coined this term called "people sector".  The

Committee  is working on five sets of now very famous  dilemmas.

(1)  Internationalisation/Regionalisation  versus  Singapore  as

Home;  (2)  Less Stressful Life versus Retaining the Drive;  (3)

Attracting  Talent versus Looking after Singaporeans;   (4)  The

Needs  of  Senior Citizens versus The Aspirations of the  Young;

and    (5)  Consultation and Consensus versus  Decisiveness  and

Quick Action.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach of posing the challenges as pairs of dilemmas

is  precisely to exercise the creativity of our better  educated

and  more articulate electorate to prioritise and trade off,  to

think  of  short-term sacrifices for long  term  good.   As  the

Committee with participation from

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>

the  people sector puts up recommendations to resolve  the  five

sets  of  dilemmas, a broad cross section of Singaporeans  would

have   been  engaged  and  have  participated  in  mapping   out

Singapore's future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with the hon. Member that having the right

mindset is important.  However, mindset comes with experience in

life.  Speaking  with the older Singaporeans  in  their  50s  or

older,  one  would hear the concern that the younger generations

do  not have strong community spirit because they have not  gone

through  hard  times  such as the Japanese  occupation  and  our

difficult road to nationhood.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the current economic difficulties brought about by

the regional financial turmoil has provided valuable lessons for

all  of  us,  especially for the younger ones. We  are  reminded

about  our vulnerability, the importance of electing a good  and

clean  government,  the value of social cohesion,  the  need  to

prepare  for  sudden  misfortunes  even  though  we  feel   very

comfortable and secure.  In Chinese, we call it ju an si  wei  (

)  and  that we cannot take success and prosperity for  granted.

These  reminders  will  shape  our  mindset  and  will  help  to

strengthen  us.   I believe the memory of this turmoil  will  be

with  us  for some time.  So let us stay united and cohesive  to

get over this period of difficulty.  I believe we will emerge as

a  more  matured  country, with a more resilient  and  confident

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member has also addressed many issues associated

with  a  more aged society, including the need to stay  healthy,

having  affordable  health care, and achieving  financial  self-reliant.  My experience talking to the older Singaporeans in the

course of my work confirms that there has been awareness of  the

need  to  prepare  for the golden years, and a clear  desire  to

ensure  self-reliance.  Older Singaporeans do  not  want  to  be

burdens to our younger generation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an area that Singapore has made tremendous

achievement in, ie, housing.  Nearly all our senior citizens do

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>

not  need to worry about roofs over their heads because  of  our

very   successful  public  housing  programme.    This   is   an

achievement  which  is  outstanding,  and  not  many   developed

countries could even equal us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prolonging employability is also important, and I do agree.

However,  one  can  be  employable only if one's  knowledge  and

skills  remain relevant and marketable.  As jobs and  technology

change  very  rapidly, we should inculcate in  us  a  spirit  of

lifelong  learning and regular skills upgrading so that  we  can

all prolong our employability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Sports Council, People's Association, and the

Community  Development Councils will continue to promote  sports

and healthy lifestyle.  The hon. Member is a medical doctor.   I

have to agree with her that prevention is better than cure,  and

a good health should not be taken for granted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health will also continue to watch

healthcare  costs,  and  ensure that healthcare  is  affordable.

Medisave, Medifund and MediShield will be refined as we go along

to  ensure  that our people are better served.  In addition,  we

also  notice  that  the  private sector  has  developed  various

medical  insurance and savings packages.  The NTUC has also  set

up  Eldercare  Cooperative to initiate programmes to  serve  the

older  persons.  I am confident that there will be more  schemes

for  middle-aged persons to prepare for the golden years,  since

this is very obviously what the market wants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than health and cost of living, there is one area

that  concerns  an older person very much, ie,  loneliness.   To

counter  this,  the  Ministry  of  Community  Development   will

continue  to promote the importance of the family.  The Ministry

of  Education will also continue to inculcate in our  young  the

value of respecting the old and caring for them.  Social service

organisations will also help families develop skills  in  caring

for  the  needs of the old and developing expertise  in  elderly

services.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to promoting the importance of the family, we

should also rediscover and promote the importance of mutual help

amongst  neighbours.   Grassroots organisations  in  the  senior

citizen's HDB apartments will give greater emphasis on promoting

mutual  help amongst neighbours and working with social  service

organisations.   The  Ministry  of  Community  Development,  the

People's Association as well as the HDB will look into how  such

organisations will be set up.  With the spirit of community self-help,  the residents will live better and have a stronger  sense

of self-confidence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are already discussing the challenge of an aging

population   years  before  it  actually  happens.   Government,

private  sector and the community are already active in  putting

the various schemes in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>

place.   This  is  another  proof that we  act  before  problems

become  serious.   I believe we should have a soft  landing.  An

active  people  sector will help us to be  even  more  alert  to

impending problems, and increase commitment and ownership to the

solutions.   I  believe  that provided we  continue  to  have  a

strong,  good  and  clean Government, the change  in  electorate

trends as outlined by the hon. Member will be a great asset, not

a liability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.



<br><br><div align="right">Adjourned accordingly at</div>

<div align="center"><h4>ANSWERED BY 1.30 PM</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>ACCESSION TO HUMAN RIGHTS TREATIES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Minister for Foreign

Affairs  whether  Singapore will consider  acceding  to  further

human  rights  treaties such as the International Convention  on

the   Elimination   of  All  Forms  of  Racial   Discrimination,

International  Covenant  on  Civil  and  Political  Rights   and

International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.



<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many international treaties, including the

international  conventions on human rights referred  to  by  the

Member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such international conventions and treaties are

periodically  reviewed by the Ministry of  Foreign  Affairs  and

other  Government Ministries and Agencies.  As  the  Member  may

know,  Singapore  became  a  party  to  the  Convention  on  the

Elimination  of  Discrimination against Women  as  well  as  the

Convention  on the Rights of the Child in October 1995.  Whether

we will accede to any other international convention will depend

on   careful  examination  of  our  policies,  laws  and   legal

procedures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We take our international obligations seriously and accede

to  international treaties only when it is in our interest to do

and  when we are fully satisfied that we can give effect to  its

provisions.

<div align="center"><b>REDEVELOPMENT OF DEFU INDUSTRIAL ESTATE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Dr Ker Sin Tze</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  if  he  will  modify the  plan  to  redevelop  Defu

Industrial Estate in view of the economic slowdown and the  over

supply of industrial space in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, HDB announced the redevelopment programme for

its   industrial   estates.   The   main   objectives   of   the

redevelopment  programme are to provide better  facilities  that

will meet the operational requirements of the industrial tenants

as well as to optimise the use of industrial sites.  The current

HDB  industrial  properties are sorely in need of redevelopment.

Many  of  these were built many years ago and do  not  meet  the

industrial needs of today - for example, the electrical capacity

is  insufficient  and there is no provision for  heavy  vehicles

like  container trucks.  If we do not do anything, the  premises

will  not be able to meet the industrialists' requirements  and,

over time, they will be less and less competitive.  As such, the

Industrial Redevelopment Programme has to continue.  Since HDB's

redevelopment programme is mainly concerned with re-housing  its

industrial tenants and the total number of units that it manages

is  less  than  10%  of the total stock of industrial  space  in

Singapore,  the programme will not contribute to an  over-supply

of industrial space.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Defu Industrial Estate, it is currently not

due yet for redevelopment.  HDB will give the tenants sufficient

notice before it is due.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, HDB will provide various measures to help

industrial tenants relocate to new premises during this economic

downturn.    These  measures  include  firstly,   an   ex-gratia

compensation of $48,000 per unit for industrial tenants affected

by  relocation.  Secondly, an option will be given to industrial

tenants to either purchase or rent the replacement units. Prices

will  be  kept  at affordable levels by selling the  replacement

units  at a shorter lease period of 30 years.  Singapore citizen

tenants will also be given a 5%

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>



discount  of  the  market price. Tenants who  opt  to  rent  the

replacement  units will be allowed to pay existing rental  rates

on  a  per  square metre basis for the remaining term  of  their

existing tenancies.  Thirdly, industrial tenants will be given a

two-month  rent-free  fitting-up period.  This  period  will  be

extended to six months for Singapore citizen tenants.
