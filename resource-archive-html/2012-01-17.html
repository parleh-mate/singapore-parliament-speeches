Sir, in Singapore, we place a strong emphasis on prevention and inculcating
good oral hygiene practices from young. The Health Promotion Board's (HPB)
School Dental Service provides free basic dental care for all Singaporean
children aged seven to 18 years old, within the school dental clinics.
This includes cleaning, screening and fillings, as well as dental
health education, to promote good oral hygiene amongst our students.
Subsidised treatment is also available for pre-schoolers at HPB's School
Dental Centre.</p>

status of our 12-year-olds, measured by the DMFT index – that is,
a common measure of the number of decayed, missing or filled teeth
– is among the best in the world. At 0.6, it is much better than
in most OECD countries, including Japan and South Korea – which
are at 1.3 and 2.1 respectively. </p>

poor oral health, and to institute the appropriate follow-up measures. </p>

NDC provides the full range of subsidised dental treatment – such

the needs of all patients referred to NDC for management. Only procedures
deemed cosmetic in nature, such as dental laminates and bleaching
services, are not subsidised. Eligible patients who require root
canal treatment, crowns and dentures can also receive subsidies
for treatment at
private dental clinics under the Community Health Assist Scheme
(CHAS). Subsidised basic dental care is also available at the polyclinics
and at private dental clinics under CHAS. </p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</strong>
                  </span>: Sir,
with regards to the first question on the types of subsidised dental
procedures at the National Dental Centre (NDC): firstly, in fiscal
year 2010, the subventions that were given for subsidised dental
treatments at the various centres amounted to $23 million. At the
NDC, various procedures are subsidised – from basic dental services
to more complex dental procedures like crowning, root canal treatment
and dentures. The subsidy rates can vary from 20% to 76%, depending
on the type of treatment or procedure. Please allow me to list some
of the procedures where subsidies are available. The basic dental
procedures will be scaling, polishing, fillings and extractions.
The more complex ones would be crowning, root canal treatment, dental
treatment related to traumatised teeth and non-vital teeth, dental
treatment for patients who are under rehabilitation following cancer
surgery and so on. Most of these procedures which are required medically
are subsidised.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-35ba3a1b-6e58-449f-a5ad-5484b41f710a">
                  <a name="id-1d8ac922-4423-4968-8a82-a2d444828e35__id-35ba3a1b-6e58-449f-a5ad-5484b41f710a"><!--a--></a>The procedures which are
not subsidised by National Dental Centre are basically procedures
which are cosmetic. For example, dental laminates and veneers, bleaching, orthodontic
treatment for cosmetic purposes. If orthodontic treatment is required
for medical purposes, there will then be subsidy.</p>

A lot of people have been complaining about long waiting times to

teeth would have fallen out, or the dental problems would have grown
worse. Can the NDC do something about that to shorten waiting times
for fresh cases and for cases referred by the polyclinics?</p>

                  </span>: Sir,
I thank the Member for the question. Let me say that we are aware
of some of these feedback and concerns. In general, for emergency
cases or where severe pain is experienced, these are treated as
urgent cases and will be prioritised. They will be treated immediately,
say, the day itself, or within the week, depending on the level
of urgency. Another example would be the elderly who need urgent
denture replacements. These cases would be prioritised and they
would be treated.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1e325416-f60c-4ea1-8c17-52cb291a8df5">

list, generally, they would have been assessed by the dentists as
stable or pain-free cases. We would then put them on the waiting
list. The waiting time would depend on the level of complexity of
the procedures. In fact, for the NDC, the median waiting time for
first appointment, where the dentists will make the assessment, for non-emergency,
non-urgent cases, is 18 days. And depending on the type of treatment
that they need, if it is urgent, they will be sent almost immediately.
As I said, if they call up and it is an urgent case, they will also
be treated on an urgent basis.</p>

the expanded PCPS, which is now called the Community Health Assist
Scheme (CHAS). Eligible patients who have the CHAS card can also
have access to subsidised dental treatment at participating dental
clinics. There are 218 such participating dental clinics around
the island now. They can get subsidised dental treatment for crowning,
root canal work, dentures and basic dental services. For this group
of people, it would offer convenience and, of course, waiting times
would be much shorter. In the longer term, we are also increasing
our intake of dentistry students at the National University of Singapore,
to increase capacity in our healthcare system.</p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, we try to ensure that we provide a strong foundation

We also watch the employment landscape very carefully so that our

Survey (GES), over nine in 10 polytechnic and university graduates
who entered the job market in 2010 were employed within six months.
In the past five years, among employed resident PMETs aged 20-29,
the proportion of those on contract employment decreased slightly
from 12.3% (or 20,600) in 2006 to 11.3% (or 21,200) in 2010. Amongst
all resident employees, the proportion on term contracts has fluctuated
between 12% and 13%.</p>

of the employment landscape. Companies generally hire employees
on term contracts for two main reasons. First, contract employees
provide greater flexibility for companies to manage their costs
in an environment of increased global competition and shorter and
less predictable business cycles. This is true globally – outsourcing
and non-traditional employment arrangements, including term contracts, have
become more common. Second, there are also occasions where companies
need to turn to contract employees with specific skill sets not
available within the company for fixed-term projects or assignments.
Some companies may also place an employee on a term contract for
a specific period while they assess the employee's competency and
suitability for long-term employment. Further, some employers may
pay a premium to their employees to compensate for the short-term
nature of certain contracts in certain professions where skills
and expertise are in demand. In general, term contracts provide
flexibility for the market.</p>

of whether employees are on term or permanent contracts, we will
look after our workers. They are protected under our employment
legislation, such as the Employment Act, CPF Act, Work Injury Compensation
Act and Workplace Safety and Health Act. Notwithstanding this, we
do encourage employers to consider converting their contract employees
into permanent staff if they are found to be suitable for the job
and if the job is in fact expected to be available on a permanent
basis. This will provide greater employment certainty to the employee
and help enhance employee engagement.</p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Minister of State for the reply and
the re-assurance to employees on contracts that their rights will
be taken care of. However, referring to the same GES that the Minister
of State mentioned earlier, out of the total number of graduates
who were employed, only 68.5% were on full-time permanent employment
while the rest were on temporary employment. This year's preliminary
GES also indicates that trend as well. With the increased number
and the feedback that benefits, such as medical insurance and leave,
are being curtailed amongst younger employees, does the MOM intend
to re-look into this area, especially since most of the PMETs would
earn above $1,600 and not be fully covered by the Employment Act?</p>

the figures for 2010 are as follows: total employment rate for university
graduates is 90.7%, and full-time permanent employment rate is 84.8%.
We do track the figures carefully. The slight difference in figures
between the Member's figures and these figures is something we can
discuss further later on. I just want to reiterate that having term
contracts do serve a purpose, although we are very mindful of the
landscape. There are employees who will be on term contracts but
we do encourage employers to take them on, on full-time basis, should
they be suitable. Most of them, even on part-time contracts, would
be subjected to the Employment Act and the various legislations
I cited earlier. In terms of the specific concerns – those are things
we can look at and will take up the feedback from the industry and
from the unions.</p>

I think it is a good suggestion, but as far as we have seen, such

liquor in these areas can easily circumvent such restrictions on

Sir, I thank the Minister of State for the reply. I want to register
my deep appreciation for the deployment of the Auxiliary Police
Officers (APOs) in our area – that helped a lot. I have two supplementary questions
for the Minister of State. First, is the Ministry of Home Affairs
aware that some shops in Little India, which are just below the
residential units in the same block – have the licence to sell alcohol.
Some of them have actually stocked up, not just beer, but entire
shelves of alcohol, including whiskey and so forth. And so, this
has created a great ease for foreign workers or other visitors,
to buy these liquor easily, and then opportunities to get drunk
and the need to relieve themselves arise as well. These are issues
that the residents are facing, so I would deeply appreciate if the
Ministry could re-consider the issue of licences to sell alcohol
to these shops in this vicinity. </p>

question is: is the Ministry willing to consider the practice in
some countries where businesses that are issued licences to sell
liquor are physically located a bit further away from residential
areas so that the problems that I have raised will have less potential
to occur? Sir, for your consideration, please.</p>

Sir, I thank the Member for her clarifications. Well, I am not surprised
they will be stocking up a large variety of alcohol, because of
the congregation of foreign workers in that area. The workers come
not only from that area but from dormitories all over Singapore.
I think we can work together; work with them, together with grassroots,
perhaps advise them that it is not the issue about the stocking up,
but the alarm they are causing to our residents and how we, perhaps,
can address this together.</p>

alcohol licences to these shops in the same vicinity that I spoke

not just of the shopkeepers to sell liquor, but also the locals
who may sometimes want to buy from the shops at the ground floor
of their blocks. So while we understand these issues are also causing
other problems because foreign workers congregate in that area,
these issues are rather unique to the area that the Member, Ms Denise
Phua, has mentioned. Because it is quite a unique area, we have
to think a little bit out of the box on how to work together with
the storekeepers, how to work even with the foreign workers, the dormitories,
to prevent such disamenities from causing problems to our residents
over there. As an example, we do inform the employers of recalcitrant
foreign workers who keep getting arrested for disorderly behaviour.
And because of that, their Work Permit pass may not get renewed
because they are such a nuisance to our society.</p>

may I make a point to the Minister of State that this situation
is not unique only to Little India. We see this in the heartlands
and at the void decks. These shops sell liquor and we have people
congregating in those areas. They drink, they litter, they urinate
and they cause nuisance at times, and fights as well. So, especially
for kiosks located at these void deck areas, if we can restrict
the sale of alcohol, that will help. I hope that the Ministry can
consider this.</p>

Sir, I thank the Member for the clarification. When I mean "unique"
I did not mean that it only occurs in Little India. Little India
is unique because it is a congregation point for foreign workers
from all over Singapore. In other places, like we have found in
Mr Cedric Foo's area, they are usually from the nearby dormitories,
and usually the way to resolve the problem is slightly different
from that which we have to face in Little India. For example, we
do not have to deploy APOs in these areas, whereas in Little India,
because of the size of the crowd and the intensity of the merrymaking,
and so forth, we have to make sure that our presence is felt.</p>

Foo's area, for example, we have been working with him. They have
Citizens-on-Patrol who go around making friends – not just the residents
but the foreign workers as well. They become advocates to their
fellow members not to cause a nuisance to the nearby residents,
and I think the same kind of solutions and other kinds of solutions
are possible for us to work together with the MPs of the area.</p>

Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Transport)</strong>

Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Land Transport Masterplan, we set an ambitious target
to improve bus speeds from 16 kph-19 kph to a target of 20 kph-25
kph. These average bus speeds factor in the time taken for passenger
boarding and alighting activities, to give an accurate reflection
of the average speeds experienced by commuters over their bus journeys. </p>

a host of bus priority measures geared towards improving bus speed
and reliability. In 2008, we extended the length of normal bus lanes island-wide
from 120 km to 155 km, and more than trebled the length of full-day
bus lanes from 7 km to 23 km. This has helped improve bus journey
speeds along these heavily-used bus corridors by an average of 7%,
and even up to 20% along some stretches. To help reduce the time
taken for buses to pull out of bus bays, we also introduced the
Mandatory Give-Way to Bus Scheme in 2008, and this has now been implemented
at 202 bus stops across the island. The scheme has helped reduce
the time taken by buses to exit bus bays by up to 73%. </p>

improvements to bus speeds along specific routes, overall average
bus speeds have decreased slightly from 19.1 km/h in 2007 to 17.8
km/h in 2011. We believe that one major factor that has likely contributed
to the decrease in speeds is the increase in bus ridership, which
has grown by 16% from 2.9 million per day in 2007 to 3.45 million
per day in 2011. As more buses are introduced to cater to this increase,
this would have caused buses to wait a longer time at bus stops
to accommodate increased passenger boarding and alighting activities. </p>

LTA recently announced the selection of 35 bus stops to be expanded
to bus hubs by the end of 2013. This is to allow more buses to berth
in the bus bays for
simultaneous boarding and alighting activities. This will reduce
the average time each bus needs to dwell at the bus stops and in
turn improve bus speeds and the journey times for commuters. </p>

our bus speeds closely, and look out for opportunities to introduce
more bus priority schemes where it makes sense to do so, bearing
in mind the potential impact on other road users. We will also continue
to explore other measures to improve bus speeds.</p>

                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. One of the things
that we think will help improve the bus speeds is to reduce the
dwell times at the bus bays. If we consider the fact that when we
introduce more buses into the system, apart from road congestion
and making it easier for the buses to get through on the roads,
we also have to consider the fact that people boarding and alighting
contributes to the dwell time. And so for people who are already
on the buses, it adds to their journey time. And that is one of
the bottlenecks that we have to overcome. The identification of
the 35 bus hubs, with expanded bus bays to allow more buses to stop
at the same time, is a major effort that is ongoing. We have already
started work since October 2011, and we are making good progress.
It is an important part of our initiatives to try and improve bus
speeds. So that is a priority project and we will focus on it to
ensure that for those very busy bus stops, it will help reduce the
dwell times. For those passengers who regularly use those bus stops,
or whose bus services pass those bus stops, they will not be unduly
held up. So that is important. </p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister of State, besides
the speed issue, I think there is also the issue of the drivers'
familiarity with the routes. I would like to ask for the Minister
of State's comment on the recent few reported cases of drivers taking
the wrong route. I understood from my residents that it happened to those bus
routes that serve Yishun South residents. What measures have been
taken or will be taken so that such incidences can be reduced?</p>

                  </span>: Sir, I
think the Member's question is relevant. As we expand the bus fleet,
we do have to hire more bus captains. It is not an easy thing to
do because the work conditions of a bus captain are quite demanding.
So quite apart from finding people with the correct driving skills,
we also need people who have the right service aptitudes. And of
course, the ability to be familiar with the bus routes, adds additional layer
of complexity.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b94a7efe-fe18-4a31-8828-506ceb0d311a">

been contributed by the fact that we sometimes need to deploy drivers
to the bus routes that they are not used to driving. That is because
there are occasions where there are services that need to be improved
very quickly, and we need to pump in the buses, and so the drivers
have to be re-deployed. One of the measures with which we can deal
with this, is to allow more of the bus captains to be cross-trained
on different routes so that each driver perhaps being just familiar
with his own route that he drives on a regular basis, is also familiar
with several other routes. This measure obviously takes time to
implement because there are so many drivers and, apart from their
usual duties, we have got to find the capacity for them to be extracted from
their regular service in order to go for the training.</p>

Member that it is something that is taken seriously. We want to
have more flexibility to be able to cross deploy the bus captains
when it is necessary to do so, so that they can be more responsive
to emerging needs in bus services. This is something that has to
be done quite properly.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr
Lui Tuck Yew</strong>
                  </span>: Sir, public transport is a service
that is available to any member of the public as a means of travel
from one location to another for a fare. It includes our public
buses, trains and taxis. Taxis are positioned at the higher end
of the public transport spectrum, filling the gaps between buses
and trains, and providing a door-to-door service that is closer
to that of private transport.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9491b9f3-ad16-4e82-827f-035b6adc9ad1">

was deregulated in 1998 and the supply of taxis was deregulated
in 2003. The objectives of these two measures were to inject greater competition
within the taxi industry and allow market forces to determine the
supply and pricing of taxis that best meet the demand for taxi services. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-03a3900f-bfef-4563-9fcd-c6cc987480e9">

fares, taxi companies have made both upward and downward adjustments
to their fare structures in response to changes in demand for taxi
service. For example, to encourage commuters to call book for taxis
during peak period where demand is high, some of the taxi companies
have reduced the call booking surcharge from $4.00 in 2005 to the
current $3.30. Taxi companies have also delayed the commencement
of the evening peak surcharge period from 5.00 pm to 6.00 pm given that
a significant number of commuters now leave work later with the
implementation of a five-day work week in Singapore. On the other
hand, as the demand for taxis in the evenings after 8.00 pm continue
to be high resulting in feedback on the difficulty of getting a
taxi after 8.00 pm, taxi companies have extended the evening peak
surcharge to midnight, instead of ending it at 8.00 pm to better
match the demand and supply for taxi service. Concurrent with the
extension of evening peak hours, taxi companies have chosen to soften
the impact of this extension by reducing the peak surcharge from
35% of metered fare to 25%. </p>

to better match the demand and supply of taxis at different times
of the day, taxi companies have also expanded their fleet size to
meet the general increase in taxi demand. When compared against
the period prior to liberalisation in 2003, the total number of
taxi trips increased by 13% from 2003 to 2011 while in the same
period, the size of the taxi fleet increased by 27%. </p>

industry has also become more vibrant with the entry of new taxi
companies into the market. Consumers can choose among seven taxi
companies, up from the previous three companies prior to deregulation.
The taxi services rendered have also become more varied, catering
to the wide-ranging demands of the commuters. For instance, taxi
companies have brought in many more models of taxis into the market,
including larger taxis with higher seating capacity up to seven passengers,
as well as the introduction of additional modes of fare payment
such as credit card, NETS or stored value card which has brought
greater convenience to passengers. </p>

market is to facilitate its workings and ensure that quality service
is provided. To do this, LTA sets Quality of Service (QoS) standards
for taxi companies to comply and also administers the Vocational
Licence Point System (VLPS) on taxi drivers. </p>

taxi companies are required to meet standards on call bookings,
safety, taxi drivers' conduct, etc. Companies that fail to meet
the requisite standards are liable to be penalised financially.
In October 2011, the LTA tightened the QoS system. Call booking
monitoring was extended to the morning peak period on weekdays, from 6.00
am to 11.00 am. LTA also fine-tuned the computation of call booking
performances from averaging over a three-hour period to an hourly
basis.</p>

companies, the LTA also takes a serious view against any misconduct
on the part of taxi drivers against the interest and safety of taxi
passengers. Regular enforcement checks are carried out by LTA at
various hotspots to nab errant taxi drivers and deter would-be offenders.
Under the Vocational Licence Point System, taxi drivers who infringe
the LTA's rules and regulations will be imposed with composition fines
and demerit points based on the severity of the offence. The accumulation
of demerit points will lead to the suspension of vocational licence
and, in severe cases, the revocation of the licence. Sir, I would
like to take this opportunity to encourage members of the public
to provide feedback on who they believed to be errant taxi drivers
to help LTA step up its enforcement measures and ensure quality
taxi service on the ground.</p>

of the taxi industry has brought about benefits to commuters. Specific
to the recent round of fare revisions by the taxi companies, I acknowledge
the public's expectation for better quality service with any fare
increase. Hence, besides continuing to monitor the performance of
taxi companies with respect to the current QoS, LTA will also study
how the QoS system will need to be adjusted.</p>

the market share of ComfortDelgro's taxis and whether this constitutes

is an important factor, is not in itself a sufficient indicator.
Other indicators, such as presence of any market barriers, contestability
for the industry, degree of service innovation, and so on, should
also be considered, and I believe the taxi industry fares well on
balance. Ms Tin may also wish to note that ComfortDelgro's market
share has declined from 86% in 2003 to about 58% today, indicating

Sir, I thank the Minister for the comprehensive reply. I would like
to ask, in light of the recent episode whereby ComfortDelgro taxis initiated
the rise in taxi fares, a lot of Singaporeans felt that the definition
of "peak period surcharge" has been exaggerated. Therefore, I would
like to ask if the Ministry would consider, if not defining "peak
period", putting other levers in place so as to prevent exaggeration
or irresponsible changes to cab fares. As the Minister has pointed
out, taxis are seen as part of the public transport system in Singapore
which a lot of Singaporeans do rely on to get from Point A to Point
B. </p>

                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
Sir, let me thank the Member for her supplementary question. I think
the genesis of the extension of the peak period in the evening beyond 8.00
pm arose because there was a lot of feedback of the difficulty of
getting taxis after 8.00 pm and prior to midnight. Normally, our
taxis are actually under the two-shift system, although a good number
of them are driven by only one driver. Therefore, the rational behaviour
would be such that the driver would pick the best time to drive
his taxi. And for him, the best time is the revenue that he would
derive as a result. And hence,
with the peak period in the past stopping at 8.00 pm, there was
a lot of feedback on the difficulty of getting a taxi, including
through call bookings. Hence, that was one of the main reasons why
the taxi companies starting with ComfortDelgro decided on the need
to extend the peak surcharge period.</p>

                  </span>: Let me thank
the Member for the supplementary question. It is a good question.
But it is also behaviour that extends beyond the taxi industry.
For example, for those of us who drive, we find it somewhat coincidental
that petrol prices, when they go up, they go up across the different
companies – Shell, Esso, Caltex, and so on.</p>

Commission had actually investigated and explained this in the past.
There are good economic explanations for such behaviours. ComfortDelgro, I
think, now has more than 50% of the market share, dropping from
80-plus percent in the past. We now have more players in the industry.
But I think they also, in a sense, draw reference from the behaviour
of the market leader. So there is a certain harmonisation in that
sense of the fares over time, in terms of, for example, flag-down rate
increases after every 400 metres, but there are also differences.
For example, in the booking fees – in the advanced booking fees
and the current booking fees – there are variations across taxi
companies. It is not a complete harmonisation across the seven companies.</p>

If I can ask the Minister: the constant complaint is that there

whether the waiting time has been cut down ever since the taxi fares
have been increased? How else can LTA help to improve the service?
Would LTA be prepared to review the Quality of Standard service

having so many types of surcharges will confuse most taxi commuters.
Will LTA regulate the imposition of such surcharges?</p>

Sir, let me thank Mr Lim for his two supplementary questions. It
is still early days yet because it has been barely a month since
the increase in the fares. We do not yet have the full picture but
based on what we have been able to gather so far and in some instances
I would also draw comparisons with what took place in 2007 – with
regard to the Member's specific question on waiting times, there
is an improvement in waiting times, both within the CBD and outside
of CBD. It has also been easier to call book for a taxi. So that
is the initial indications that we have.</p>

see how this pans out over a longer period of time because we know
that in 2007, we saw some variations and then over a period of time
it stabilises. This
is similar to the earnings for taxi drivers. In 2007, when fares
were last increased, for the first two months, there was a decline
and after the third month, we saw an increase. And when we compared
it on a year-on-year basis, in the first year, we would see about
a 10% increase in the revenue for the taxi drivers. So, I would
say that it is probably still early days but the early indications
are that, for waiting times, there is an improvement.</p>

and whether this confuses the public: I think the point is that
the demand for taxis varies according to the time of the day and
it also varies according to the location. If you do not have surcharges
that will also influence the behaviour of the drivers as well as
to shift the supply patterns, what you will find is that in some
instances and in some locations, it will become very, very difficult
to get taxis. We saw this before the recent round of fare adjustments,
where we had quite a bit of feedback that it was very difficult
to get a taxi after 8.00 pm. Now, there is hope. </p>

not have the data with me with regard to whether there has been
an increase in complaints. I ought to get back to the Member on
this. We hear the same feedback with regard to taxi service in Hong
Kong that you have taxis waiting for commuters and that it is so
easy to get a taxi. And there are no peak surcharges. From the commuters'
point of view, it is not a bad situation. The flipside of it, as
we also hear from the drivers, is that they find it a lot more difficult
in terms of making a living. The indications are that they seem
to be working much longer hours compared to the taxi drivers in
Singapore. There are two sides to the equation. In the case of Hong
Kong, it may be easier for the commuters to get a taxi but, on the
other hand, quite a lot more difficult for the taxi drivers.</p>

quick comparison in terms of fares, for instance, this is after
the increase that has taken place in December of last year, for
a 10-km trip in Singapore, off-peak period, it is about S$10 and
with the 25% peak surcharge which has gone down from 35%, it would
be about S$12.30, during the peak period. In Hong Kong, they do
not have the surcharge but for a 10-km trip, I think it is about
$14.50. So the fares are higher. It appears to be easier for the
commuters to get a taxi but we also know that it is more difficult
for the drivers to make a living. </p>

I thank the Member for his question. This is an interesting question,
which is why in my earlier reply I said that it is still early days because it has only
been a month since the introduction of the fares. The last time
this happened was in 2007. We also had the same initial feedback
from the drivers that the increase affected their livelihoods, the
takings went down. Indeed, when we looked at the data that we collected,
it was so for the first two months after the last fare increase in
2007. But by the third month, it had actually exceeded the data
prior to the adjustments and thereafter, it went up. Overall, if
you then, in a steady state compare on a year-to-year basis, in
their first year, their revenue actually went up about 10%. That was
the last fare increase. This time round, it is only a month since
the increase took place in December last year, so we will need to
have more time to collect the data and then we will be able to do
a better analysis. </p>

                  </span>: Sir, the Land Acquisition Act requires
the Collector of Land Revenue to post acquisition notices at convenient
places at or near the land to be taken. This is to notify any interested
persons to make their claims to compensation to the Collector. </p>

that the posting of notices on the exterior of the flats is unpleasant
for the owners. Hence, the Ministry of Law is removing this requirement,
and replacing it with a requirement to publish notices in at least
four daily newspapers, one each in each of the four official languages.
This change is in the Statutes (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill,
which will be moved in this House tomorrow. </p>

to state their claims at the Collector's Inquiry, this is to enable
the Collector to take relevant claims and information into account
when determining the statutory compensation in accordance with the
Land Acquisition Act. After the statutory compensation is finalised
and awarded to the owners, should the owners decide to make an appeal
to the Appeals Board, the claims that the owners had earlier submitted
will be considered by the Appeals Board. </p>

Centre, the Housing Development Board is appointed the Collector.
In this role, HDB provides all relevant information and explains
the acquisition process to the residents. For instance, during the
Collector's Inquiry, HDB will invite the flat owners to submit a
claim by asking them to fill up the claim form. HDB will also explain
to the flat owners their right under the Land Acquisition Act. HDB officers
have been working closely with the owners on the ground and helping
them with their questions, including any queries on the compensation
value that residents opine they should receive. The Collector's
Inquiry is on-going and is scheduled to end on 8 March 2012.</p>

                  </span>: I thank the Minister for the
reply, and I really want to thank him for conveying to Ministry
of Law about the need to change the practice of pasting the public
notices on the doors and on the walls of the flats. Just one point
-- my residents who have gone for the Collector's Inquiry meetings
have spoken to me. Is the Ministry aware that some of the residents
who are affected for the first time by Selective En bloc Redevelopment
Scheme (SERS) and acquisitions were asked how much their compensation
of the flats should be. Some of them are quite clueless as to how
to respond and, in fact, such questions do raise the expectations
of some of the residents on how much they would really like to be
compensated. Those who are not educated on this might not be sure
about the amount they should put down, or how their compensation
should be quantified. I think that is also a practice that may need
to be improved. For consideration, please.</p>

                  </span>: The answer
is yes. We should all do our best to help them. These are, as the
Member put it, some fairly old and senior members in our community and
may not be as well clued on what to do. And I think it is an opportunity
for the MPs and grassroots leaders, working together with HDB officers,
to get them to understand their rights under the law. Information
will be quite freely available. For example, the claims will be
very much dependent on what is the prevailing market value of the
flats at the time of acquisitions. On the HDB website, we have published
the resale value of those flats. I am quite sure the residents should
not have too much difficulty making claims. So far, we are halfway
through the process. HDB officers have covered almost half of all
the flats which are affected, and about two-thirds of them have
already filed their claims. </p>

                  </span>: The extent
of compensation that the flat owners at Rochor Centre will receive
is governed by the Land Acquisition Act. Specifically, they will
be compensated based on the prevailing market values of their existing
flats as at the date of the acquisition, which is, 15 November last
year. The market value will be assessed by a qualified and professional
private valuer licensed by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore
(IRAS) after a thorough physical inspection of each flat. In addition,
they will also be given reasonable expenses, which comprise a removal
allowance as well as stamp and conveyancing fees to buy a comparable
replacement flat.</p>

objective, flat owners whose homes are acquired for a public purpose,
like in the case of the Rochor Centre, are given a relocation package,
with benefits similar to those offered under the Selective En bloc Redevelopment
Scheme (SERS). The new replacement flats, with a fresh 99-year lease
-- and I think this is a very important point -- will be offered
at subsidised prices, similar to those applicable to all eligible
public applicants in HDB's sales exercises. However, the prices
will be frozen as at the date of acquisition, 15 November, with
a further 20% price discount, of up to $30,000, for eligible flat
owners.</p>

could be added compensation for those who have bought their flats
at a higher price: we need to be fair to all residents. Hence, the
compensation has to be on the same basis of market value, irrespective
of the original purchase prices. The valuer will take into account
the resale transaction prices just before the acquisition was announced,
as well as the individual attributes of the flats, including the
extent and the condition of renovation, amongst others. </p>

levy can be reduced: we can extend some concessions to help the
flat owners. For example, for those eligible for the 20% price discount,
they can choose to forgo the discount <em class="ph i">in lieu</em> of paying the
resale levy, provided, of course, it is advantageous to them. For
those who are not eligible, they may incorporate $30,000 of the
resale levy as part of the purchase price of the replacement flat,
and defer the balance amount, without interest, until they sell
or they transfer the replacement flat. </p>

by the CPF Minimum Sum, HDB will help them appeal to CPF Board to
use part of the amount to be refunded into the CPF Retirement Account
to pay for the replacement flat. As each case is unique, CPF Board
and HDB will work together to help the affected flat owners as much
as we can, subject to financial prudence.</p>

to give priority to co-occupiers of the flats should they apply for
units under the sale of balance flats in the new Kallang development,
the married children can benefit under the Married Child Priority
Scheme. They will have double the chances compared to other applicants,
once their parents have selected their replacement flats in Kallang. </p>

Sir, to be fair, I think not all the terms of the forced acquisition
and the relocation for my residents are negative. For example, the
fresh lease of 99 years versus the current 60 years. And, of course,
I have been told many times that these practices have been in place
for many years, and that the terms apply to other SERS projects. What
I am asking Minister for is perhaps for Minister to consider a small work
team that comprises some of us to represent the residents' needs,
to see if some of these practices can be updated and improved. Especially
in the case of, I guess, forced acquisitions where residents actually
lose the choice of the time that they would prefer to sell and also
the choice of their preferred dwelling. I think there is a case
for studying some of these practices – which have been told to me
many times – that have been in place for so long. I just ask for
a work team to do that. Some of the practices that may need to be
re-considered are, for example, the valuation of the current flat
– </p>

Would the Minister consider the appointment of, for example, more
than one valuer to value these flats? And for those who have just
reached retirement or in the last few years reached retirement,
relieve them financially without having to top up their CPF Minimum
Sum and then have to use whatever is left in the nett proceeds to
pay for renovation and upgrading, if possible and also to repay
the resale levy at the time that is not of their choice. I know
Minister is very compassionate so I ask Minister to consider allowing
us to work with the agencies and the Ministry to update some of
these practices.</p>

                  </span>: The short
answer is a big yes, since both of us personify compassion. Specifically,
we would definitely want to work with the MP and her activists to
try to find the best way out for the residents who are affected
by this. We are extremely mindful that this is an acquisition and
suddenly all these come along and then you lose your home where
you have stayed for a number of years. We will be as fair as we
can and, at the same time, the fact that this is not a first acquisition
in Singapore, we have to maintain a certain amount of consistency.
Otherwise, the previous owners who were affected would rightly yell
and say, "What is happening? Why do you have inconsistent practices
in place?" But where we can find a good reason to vary or improve on
some of the terms because the situations are unique, we will certainly
try to do so.</p>

valuer versus more than one is quite simple. Whenever valuation
is involved, two valuers may come up with two different answers.
For the same estate, we try to have one common firm. I think that
will help the process of valuation and future disputes. In any case,
for anybody who is unhappy with the valuation, there is an appeal
process involved. There is an Appeals Board in which case probably
the valuation may require a re-valuation by a different firm. So
the opportunity for a separate valuation is out there.</p>

for seniors who are affected, as I have said in my reply, we are
on the same side here. We will work together with the MP and the
residents to try to make a case to CPF to try to help out. As far
as we can see, provided the movement is lateral, in other words,
if you stay in a 3-room flat and you move to an equivalent 3-room
flat, they should not end up having to get money out-of-pocket.
That has always been our experience in previous SERS cases. I see
no reason why, in this instance, that should not also be the case.</p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Gan Thiam Poh's question has to do with whether
the MAS should disallow banks from financing, either fully or partially,
Certificate of Entitlement (COE) premiums as part of the measures
to moderate the rise in COE premiums. We did, in fact, have financing
limits on car loans by banks from 1995 to sometime in 2003. They
were, however, not very effective in influencing COE prices one
direction or another and in particular in stemming an increase in
COE prices. </p>

are not the only financing source. In fact, their share of car loans
today is somewhat lower than it was10 years ago. Individuals can
borrow from other entities such as car dealers and non-bank credit
or leasing companies to get around the rules that are in place for
banks. They can also draw on their own savings to pay COE premiums. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1de09eed-8018-4529-aa2d-1fcb9a700c44">

which impact on COE premiums include the economic outlook which
shapes demand, the supply of COEs which is determined by the allowable vehicle
growth and by car owners' decisions on their own part on whether
they decide to de-register their cars at the preceding period. That
determines the supply of COEs.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ab97be80-3c3f-450b-a1d9-69aabf6bfdd2">

from the perspective of financial stability which is the MAS' primary
concern, car loans granted by financial institutions do not pose
threats to financial stability. These loans form a very small proportion
of total loans in the financial system, or even of total consumer
loans and the proportion of car loans that are non-performing loans
is low – extremely low. Disallowing banks from financing COEs fully or
partially would therefore not be an effective or appropriate tool
for addressing pricing COE premiums. I can assure Mr Gan Thiam Poh,
however, that MAS expects financial institutions to exercise prudence
when extending loans for the purchase of cars, taking into account
the credit worthiness of the borrower, his debt servicing ability,
and the value of collateral.</p>

concerned about is that the rising COE premiums will have an impact
on the cost of living in Singapore. That would translate into higher
transport costs such as taxi fare, bus fare, etc. My point is that
there could be different ways to moderate the rise in COE premiums
in addition to alternate sources of financing for consumers or users.
It could also be fiscal measures, such as cooling measures, to moderate
the rise in COE premiums. Will MAS consider all those measures?</p>

I think part of Mr Gan's question is a broader question about price
inflation and part of it really is the issue for LTA and MOT to address.
The COE system, if I could just say very briefly on behalf of MOT
or LTA, is not one that is designed to stabilise COE prices as such.
It is a system which allows an available supply of COEs as determined
by the allowable vehicle growth rate to be rationed. And depending
on demand, which is itself shaped by the economic climate, we then have the COE price
being determined through open bidding. The policy is not to stabilise
COE prices as such.</p>

a valid concern as we all do about the overall cost of living and
the COE premiums can, if they spike up very suddenly and substantially, influence
the cost of living, indirectly through business costs as well as
directly for those who are purchasing their cars. This is something
that has to be addressed more broadly and MAS does play a role in
addressing inflationary pressures. It is something which we keep
a very close watch on. I would add, however, that the impact of
the COE premiums on the CPI index can sometimes be a little exaggerated
because not many people buy COEs in any particular year, but the
impact of that price spike can be quite significant on the measured
CPI index.</p>

not one that I think should be addressed by re-imposing rules on
bank loans because we have found from the past – and, in fact, I
had a look at the data because of Mr Gan's question – it is quite
clear from the data on COE prices and the restrictions we placed
on bank loans that the measures on bank loans had virtually no impact.</p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Member for his question. The Government
recognises that Ministries as significant buyers of services have
an important role to play in achieving momentum in the Best Sourcing
Initiative. In support of the BSI, many public agencies already
take into consideration quality and not just price in awarding services
tenders. To give just one example, the National Parks Board requires
landscape service providers to adopt best practices such as employing professionally
certified workers and the use of technology to meet expected performance
standards.</p>

also encouraged to adopt recommendations in the Tripartite Advisory

is currently being updated by the Ministry of Manpower and its tripartite

grading scheme for security agencies was started in 2006 and was
made mandatory in 2009. Similarly, the NEA introduced a voluntary accreditation

Sir, supplementary questions. Based on my personal experience in
the past few years with BSI, there are varied outcomes from different
partners that we worked with. SIRD has been very positive, PAP Town
Councils have been very positive. But I believe that there needs
to be some willpower among the Ministries and Government to make
sure this change takes place. So my question is: is an advisory
sufficient for such a will to make things happen so that changes
can come about? Or should there be more than just an advisory, maybe
an SOP or an instruction, to clearly articulate the intent of Government
to adopt BSI?</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mrs Josephine Teo</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
Mr Zainudin has asked a question of how do we get public agencies
to respond to what is essentially a set of guidelines that encourages individuals
to do something rather than imposes it as a mandatory regulation.
He is very right to ask this question. Let me share a little bit
of how procurement practices are supervised. One of the important
things that is issued and Ministries adhered to, is really the Finance
Circular. So when we issue an advisory and supplement it by a Finance Circular,
the instruction and the signalling given to the Ministries is that
this is something to be taken very seriously and we want them to
incorporate it into their procurement procedures.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-677e2743-63bc-4be3-935f-7681acc86c94">
                  <a name="id-09d757ff-7ec5-453d-91d9-7c3f42aae3a0__id-677e2743-63bc-4be3-935f-7681acc86c94"><!--a--></a>And so, when the Member
talked about the SOP, although it is not strictly a set of procedures
that is prescribed, nonetheless, the emphasis is given through the
circular. We have adopted this approach of the advisory because
practices have to be suitable to the circumstances in which the
agencies operate. We also want the agencies to take ownership of
it and not just follow these advisories for the sake of it. We want
them to go beyond it. So the earlier examples that we cited, SIRD
and NParks, are very good examples of how even in the presence of
our advisories, agencies can go beyond what is expected of them.
I want to assure the Member that this is something that we want
to take very seriously. We do recognise that as major buyers, we
have an important role to play to sustain this momentum.</p>

However, the NParks and SIRD's initiatives have been put in place
for a number of years,
and these are just two of the positive examples that we have so
far. So perhaps if I can ask the Minister of State to update the
House, if possible, the proportion of workers on contract with the

the wages of all these contract workers are also being monitored.</p>

I can share with the Member, Mr Yam, is that the Government employs,
through its contractors, about 6,000 cleaners. Now, this is a significant
share of the estimated 46,000 local cleaners in Singapore. I do
not have the exact figures that will respond to his question directly
but what we can say is that what we do in the public sector does
have its significant impact on the private sector. The interest
to continue to support the BSI and the emphasis on its importance
is something that we think and agree is important in moving the
momentum forward.</p>

Sir, some mall operators do require their retail outlets to declare
their revenues or link their point of sales (POS) systems to a mall-wide system.
The revenue data may be used to determine the rents of their tenants

between the mall operator and retailers is a commercial arrangement,
and does not inhibit competition in the retail sector. Such contractual agreements
are best left to the market players to negotiate among themselves.
To support the business environment, the Government maintains an
adequate supply of commercial space to meet medium-term demand and
ensures that businesses do not engage in anti-competitive practices.
The Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of National
Development will continue to monitor the commercial property market
closely.</p>

Yes, Mr Speaker, just one supplementary question. The reply by the
Minister of State is certainly good but the feedback that I get from
the retailers, especially the small ones, is that the practice swings
towards a playing field to favour the developers. So there is little
incentive for the retailers to improve productivity and to reduce
costs because they know the developers will know of their profitability.
What is the Ministry's view on this practice? If landlords increase rental
rates, the costs will also increase and these will be passed on
to consumers. Will this also mean that the retail sector will favour
the larger players and we are seeing the smaller players being a
bit more disadvantaged as a result of this practice?</p>

                  </span>: Sir, to
begin with, the retail sector is a very competitive sector. Competitive
because the threshold for entry is relatively low and many would-be entrepreneurs
would want to begin a business idea from the retail sector. </p>

cycles and what we have observed is that the retail rentals in the
last quarter have returned to the pre-crisis peak in 2008. And the
previous peak was in the 1998. There was 10 years of lull period,
where retail rental was relatively low. The Government's role is
really to ensure that in the median term, there would be an adequate
supply of retail space and, in fact, based on known projects, the
retail space supply would be between 90,000 and 108,000, compared
to the five-year past average of just 85,000. So this is about 27%
more than the previous supply.</p>

supply coming on-stream, the mall operators and their tenants will
work together to cope with the increased space as well as to innovate.
It is a narrow view to say that by participating in the mall-wide
point-of-sales system, there would be a lot of downsides. In fact,
by integrating sales information, I think the mall operators and
the tenants can better share information about their customers,
about what is selling, what is not, about the best-performing stalls
and the least-performing stalls in the mall and from there, they
can decide how to promote the malls to the targeted customer segment. In that sense,
my personal observation is that the better organised malls are the
more successful ones, and are the bigger crowd pullers. </p>

the market dynamics approach that MTI adopts and the issue here
is, for the retailer, with your books being very transparent to
the developer, all you are doing is really running on the treadmill.
You do more, you make more; they increase the rents. There is very
little incentive to invest in better service, better quality for
consumers. That is one. Two, I understand there are market dynamics in
terms of having aggregate rentals going up or down <em class="ph i">vis-a-vis</em> the
market conditions. The only issue is when you have Profit and Loss
statements being put up to the developers, they can target rent
increase, whether to a small segment – </p>

Sir. Well, to put things in perspective, I could probably highlight
one survey. Singapore retail rent is comparable to many other cities
in the world. For instance, compared to New York, we are about one-sixth
or one-seventh of Fifth Avenue rents. We are about one-sixth of
that of Hong Kong and one-third of that of Ginza in Tokyo. Retail
rental is one component of the costs. Apart from just looking at cost
containment, which is something that SMEs retailers must do, they
also must look at value creation.</p>

for being the first speaker today. The Committee headed by Mr Gerard
Ee has spent many months soliciting public feedback and suggestions
on the issue of political salaries and of course MP allowances included
as well. Many passionate Singaporeans have stepped forward during
the course of the consultation process to provide their perspectives
and also detailed ideas on what would be an equitable salary to
ensure both a capable and committed government that continues to
place emphasis on service as an integral part of holding political
office.</p>

full recommendations of the Committee by the Government signifies
a continued commitment to listening to public feedback and concerns
and acting on it. A debate on the issue in this House is an important
one especially if it involves the political leadership of our nation
for the present and the future. However, I hasten to add that whatever
our views on the subtle differences on mathematical formulas and
benchmarks, it is important for us to remember that at the end of
our debate the number of people who will be impacted directly by
the adopted changes will add up to a grand total of just 100. This
includes all eventual Members of this House as well as the President
of the Republic. Only a grand total of 100 will experience the real impact
of the change out of our entire population of 3.26 million Singapore
citizens.</p>

I urge that beyond the debate that we are having now, which is important,

will derive different figures on the current rate increase. One
report indicated that the average increase is about 2.8% for last
year but has dropped to 0.1% if part-time workers as well as contract workers
are also included in the calculation. Another statistic that was
also shared recently at the SHRI conference was a much lower figure.</p>

that the debate we are having now is occurring about the time that
many Singaporeans are receiving news about their annual increments
(AIs). HR consultants in a report by <em class="ph i">TODAY</em> newspaper, at
the start of the work year, projected a modest wage increase of
4% to 5% for this year. Taking into account the laws of averages,
we seem to be on track.</p>

averages do not always tell the full story. This is because in the
same report economists were quoted that the projected inflation
may hover about 2.5% to 3.5%. That brings the target back down.
In my interaction with workers over the past few months, many continue to be genuinely
concerned over prospects for 2012. Some companies have also used
the backdrop of a projected slowdown in the world economy to try
to adjust lower AIs and bonuses in certain sectors. But the companies
in sunset industries have not had an AI for their workers over a
number of years. For these workers, their aspirations for real wage
increase will certainly be a challenge especially with the global
outlook and inflation. Workers wages certainly cannot take a discount.</p>

                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, I will first deliver my speech in English followed
by Malay. I wish to express my concern that this Government is still
pushing the notion that Singapore needs to pay the highest political salaries
in the developed world to ensure an honest government and attract
talented individuals to serve the people. Are we sending the right
message to the next generation that our top leadership may not function
at a desired level if the Ministerial pay is not benchmarked against
the highest income earners in Singapore? Do we really believe our top
leaders will be less capable, less honest, and less committed if
their political pay is not benchmarked against these top 1,000 private
sector earners? Therefore, that the consequence of not paying top
dollars to secure the service of future leaders is an incompetent
and corrupt government? Does this House seriously believe we can
have an honest government and prevent corruption simply by paying
millions of dollars to our
Ministers? If a Minister has a character flaw lurking inside him,
can a million-dollar salary be the cure? How many Members in this
House would have a second thought about serving the people if your
salary is not benchmarked against top earners in Singapore?</p>

said yesterday that there is no right answer to this complex issue
of determining public office salaries. He also said it is a judgement
call. But the message we send in this judgement call is important
for the next generation. We certainly do not want to encourage and
inspire the wrong people to enter politics.</p>

on our human capital and values we want to inculcate in our country.
Yes, we are a small country with a small citizen population and
we operate in an open economy. Our talent pool is naturally limited.
The people's will to succeed is definitely not. This nation was
started with less than two million people. Our forefathers have
worked hand in hand with the first generation leaders to build this
nation and they did well. Now that we have added over a million
more citizens, is our will to succeed a lot less now than we first
started? Have we left our values so far behind that we are beginning
to believe that the best incentive to attract people to step forward
to serve the community is just money?</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-51cf031a-1e2b-466f-ad46-1a2d84ee2b5e"><!--a--></a>In my experience as a counsellor,
people who are passionate about serving the community do not quantify
their sacrifice in dollars and cents. Likewise, people of the right
calibre will not be deterred from stepping forward to lead the country
even if they have to take a pay cut in the process.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-08bb41ed-4a6a-44fa-b609-764ab522d0e2">
                  <a name="motion__id-08bb41ed-4a6a-44fa-b609-764ab522d0e2"><!--a--></a>Given that the ethos of
political service encompasses a fair amount of sacrifice, to think
that we can quantify that sacrifice by a 40% discount to the median
income of the top 1,000 earners in the revised salary benchmark
for Ministers, may be bordering on insult to many people who are
serving the community at meagre wages.</p>

ethics and sacrifice? Is the 40% discount in this revised pay formula
a sacrifice on the part of the Ministers? Is there even a sacrifice
to begin with when some of these potential talents are not even
featured in the list of top 1,000 earners in Singapore before they
entered into politics?</p>

wish to inculcate in the next generation? This is precisely why
the Workers' Party is advocating a different approach in determining
the benchmark for political salaries rather than starting the benchmark
at the median income of the top 1,000 earners. The rationale is
simple. Not everything is about money. </p>

President's Address last October, there was a call to build an inclusive
society. The proposal by the Workers' Party takes into consideration
this notion. We call for a whole-of-government people up approach
in pegging the salaries of Ministers and MPs to the salaries of
senior executives in the civil service. The civil service pay is
competitively pegged to general market conditions and any market adjustments
made to this benchmark, positive or negative, will be reflected
in the political salary. This approach I believe has the hallmark
of an inclusive society as compared to the proposal to peg Ministerial
pay to the top 1,000 earners. By aligning the political salary structures
to the civil service, the empathy gap between our political leaders and the general
population will narrow over time. As selected leaders, we should lead
by example in an effort to build an inclusive society.</p>

address the points brought up by some Members of this House yesterday.
MP Mr Inderjit Singh has highlighted that, unlike politicians in
the UK, our elected Members here are not given additional perks
on top of our salary. We cannot compare apples to oranges. Looking
at the geographical size of the United Kingdom, we can probably
understand why political leaders there are given such perks like
housing, a chauffeur-driven car, meals and even laundry allowance.
We do not need to travel long distance and spend time away from
our family to attend parliament sittings, but our UK counterparts
do.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-aaf23090-be52-4749-8c28-7a5f2fd9c89a"><!--a--></a>The Workers' Party has studied
and deliberated on the issue of perks and other forms of allowances
which are not implemented here. That is why we propose to peg the salary
of the Ministerial salary at five times the salary of an MP. This
multiple is more than what is being practised in some of the countries
we surveyed, which ranges from 1.2 to 4.6 times.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-063bbf37-17ee-46c6-b4c4-7a0a9c79ab2c">
                  <a name="motion__id-063bbf37-17ee-46c6-b4c4-7a0a9c79ab2c"><!--a--></a>Next, I share the view of
Member Ms Denise Phua about perception. That a glass can be seen
as either half empty or half full. I still believe there is no right
answer to the formula put up by the Review Committee. However, we
need to remind ourselves that we are servants of the people. We
need to remind ourselves to be humble, compassionate and sincere.
The whole-of-government people up approach to benchmarking political
salaries, as proposed by the Workers' Party, is a step towards building
the emotional bond with the people we serve. It is a step towards
creating an inclusive society. It is also a step towards inculcating
good values in our future generations.</p>

people of the right values to lead this nation. While we cannot
leave the recruitment and development of leaders to chance, we certainly

way to get competent people to enter politics. For many of us, our
journey to this august Chamber began with a dream to build a better
Singapore for all. This journey is certainly not going to end just
because we are not benchmarked against the highest wage earners
in Singapore. Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to continue in Malay.</p>

agree with my colleague, Mr Chen Show Mao, that the move to reduce
the salaries of Ministers and political leaders should be welcomed.
However, the formula put forward by the Committee to Review Ministerial
Salaries is inaccurate or dissatisfactory. The recommendation by
the Committee to use the median income of the top 1,000 Singaporean
earners, less a 40% discount, is still a top-down approach. We are
of the view that this approach does not really show the inclusive
and concerned character that the Government wants to inculcate.
We believe that this approach can result in an emotional gap between
our political leaders and the general public of Singapore. </p>

important that Singapore be led by political leaders with competency
and skills that are good and appropriate. However, salary alone
should not be the main factor to attract competent individuals.
The involvement in politics should come from sincerely wanting to
contribute and serve the people. So, we believe that the formula
and criteria used for the ministerial salaries should be based on
community service
and inclusiveness. We propose that the whole-of-Government approach
or a bottom-up approach be used. </p>

of political service are in line with the objectives and principles
of the civil service. With this similarity, we propose that the
ministerial salaries be based on the allowance of Members of Parliament,
and in turn, the MP's allowance should be based on the salaries
of the senior executives in civil service. In Singapore, the civil
service pay depends on the general market conditions. Based on this
proposal, the salaries of Ministers and political leaders will experience
the same rise and fall that is experienced by a larger number of
Singaporeans, and not tied to the top 1,000 Singaporean earners.</p>

I would like give a reminder, especially to myself as well as to
the leaders in the House, that this leadership position we hold
is a trust given to us by the people. In carrying out this trust,
we should emulate the spirit of community service, sincerity and
humility. We must learn from the eminent world leaders, and understand and
internalise the principles held by these leaders. Among the examples
of eminent leaders is Mr Sun Yat Sen, a leader who sacrificed his
career as a doctor in order to devote himself to change the lives
of the Chinese people. He did not care or worry about leaving his
job as a leader for sake of the people. The second example is Mr
Mahatma Gandhi, who sacrificed his heart and soul for the people
of India. I think that his virtues speak for themselves. Thirdly,
Mr Umar Al-Khattab, an eminent leader in the Arabian Peninsula is
famed for his humility and devotion to the people. He was a leader
who chose not to have a throne or palace. He was more comfortable
having the same living conditions like an ordinary citizen because
of his highly cohesive nature and his wish to be in touch with the
people's lives. He had also rejected the proposal that his son take over
the leadership after he is gone. He rejected it firmly by saying
that it is sufficient that just one member from his family becomes
the leader. </p>

Mr Speaker, serving as a Member of Parliament is indeed an honour.
I was nervous when I first ran for elections because I recognised
it was a heavy responsibility. The job was certainly not easy, but
the sense of fulfilment one gets from making people's lives better
is more than anything money can afford to buy. I am humbled and
touched each time a resident comes over to say "thank you" or expresses
appreciation for what our team members have done for them. At the
same time, I recognise that if one wants to be a Minister, one would
also need skills in managing large budgets in organisations and
in making decisions involving complex considerations. In some Ministries, such
as law and finance, it is necessary to have Ministers who have strong
technical skills in the areas, too. </p>

because Ministers and office holders require special skills that are
quite different from the skills of ordinary MPs, that many countries,
including the US, have office holders who are appointed rather than
elected. Even in the UK, which is probably the closest we have to
our system, office holders are sometimes placed in the House of
Lords because they have the necessary technical skills even if they
are not MPs. </p>

do not think I have the skills or experience to run a Ministry and
I am sure many other MPs would share that view. We are happy to
serve and fight for our residents, but the running of Ministries
requires people who are not only MPs but who also have the necessary
skills and experience in making decisions at that level.</p>

we want Ministers who are motivated by money. I also have the fullest
confidence that both our party and the electorate are sophisticated
enough to weed out such people. At the same time, though, we do
not want money to be an obstacle to people entering politics. I
think many of our current office-holders probably took pay cuts
to enter politics at the various levels they entered at. </p>

emotional topic. When dealing with divisive issues, I always think
it is helpful to start on common ground. Surprisingly, notwithstanding
the language used, I think there is actually a lot of agreement
between people in this House. When I listened to some of the debates
yesterday, they reminded me a little bit of the story in Gulliver's
Travels. When Gulliver landed in the land of Lilliput, there was
a big divide between people who wanted to break soft-boiled eggs
at the top end and people who wanted to break the eggs at the bottom
end. But at the end of the day, what you arrive at is a cracked
egg. So, what is interesting here is: the Workers' Party has used very
strong language to criticise the proposals of the Committee, essentially
calling it "elitist" for pegging Ministerial salaries to the top
1,000 income earners. They then put forward their own rather precise
proposal of pegging MPs' salaries to the MX9 pay grade in the civil
service using a five-time multiple for the Minister's salary.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4da7196f-4e48-4b8c-ba0f-ec332f278f7f">
                  <a name="motion__id-4da7196f-4e48-4b8c-ba0f-ec332f278f7f"><!--a--></a>When I asked the Workers'
Party if they had made this proposal known to Mr Ee's Committee,
it was only out of fairness because I myself have not heard that
before. The first time I heard it was yesterday. And if they are
going to level such strong criticisms at Mr Ee's Committee, the
least they could have done was put their ideas forward before the
Committee came out with its proposals, rather than slamming them
afterwards by saying, "Why did you not think of this before?" The
public consultation was open for many months, and I think many Singaporeans
had written in. I understand they received about 500 emails and
messages. And that will probably mean there were 500 different opinions
on what should be done. So in that sense, I think the Committee
had a very difficult job.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d6db39c7-5b9e-4243-a43d-386293e4a8dc">
                  <a name="motion__id-d6db39c7-5b9e-4243-a43d-386293e4a8dc"><!--a--></a>However, in examining the
exact principles used by the Workers' Party in its calculation,
I actually think there is not that much difference between what
the Workers' Party is proposing and what the Committee, in fact,
put forward, except there is a small discount at each level. The
Workers' Party has also come a long way from their previously-held
public positions and pretty much abandoned most of them. So, in
that sense, I think that the gap between Members in this House has,
in fact, become extremely narrow. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 947</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-239a9006-9a41-41c7-a0b5-a65e00188dab">
                  <a name="motion__id-239a9006-9a41-41c7-a0b5-a65e00188dab"><!--a--></a>The Workers' Party said at the starting
point, that calculation of MPs' allowances should be pegged at MX9
civil service pay grade. I am not a civil servant myself, so I just checked.
From what I understand, this is, in fact, not a wage that is at
par with the average working level as the Workers' Party has tried
to represent. In fact, this is the wage, I understand, that of a
Superscale in the civil service. I think less than 2% of people in
the civil service get this. So, the Workers' Party's starting point
is certainly not the average wage level as they have represented.
It is, in fact, much higher than that. I also disagree that an MP's
allowance should be compared with a civil servant's pay because, for
one thing, I do not know about the Workers' Party, but I know certainly
most PAP MPs do not pocket the entire allowance. It is, in fact,
a large part of the expenses we incurred in running our constituencies
as well. I mean, in other countries, MPs get expense accounts. We
do not get that. The allowance is, in fact, the sum total of the
expense account and if there is anything left then that could be
considered a "salary", but I would hardly consider it that. So,
in that sense, thinking of the MP's allowance as a salary is, perhaps,
the wrong starting point because I do not think that is what it
is. It is, in fact, an all-in package that encompasses an amount
you have to give back to the community as well. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-71b4fcae-b4f0-474a-b4d9-22ceafef9216">
                  <a name="motion__id-71b4fcae-b4f0-474a-b4d9-22ceafef9216"><!--a--></a>But having said that, while
I may disagree with them using that as a starting point, the number
they come up with is not too far away from what we have right now.
So, again, we may disagree on how we want to crack the egg but,
at the end of the day, I think the number we arrive at is not too
far apart. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-450487b4-0b35-4d1e-a0f5-48c9197f2400">
                  <a name="motion__id-450487b4-0b35-4d1e-a0f5-48c9197f2400"><!--a--></a>The next point: the Workers'
Party says that the Minister's salary should be pegged at five times
the MP's allowance. This basically means the MP's allowance is about
20% of the Minister's pay. In fact, the Committee recommended 17.5%.
Again, not very far off – a 2.5% difference. And the Workers' Party
does not explain why it came up with the multiple of five times
rather than four or six times. It could be any number in the air,
but they decided on five, which miraculously, brings them very close
to what the Committee came up with.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-bfe49ea5-d699-4dc3-ae77-5c2fcca06a5f">
                  <a name="motion__id-bfe49ea5-d699-4dc3-ae77-5c2fcca06a5f"><!--a--></a>Another point that is interesting
is the Workers' Party suggested that the benchmark we use for an
entry-level Minister be $55,000. What is interesting is this: the
Committee recommended $55,000 monthly salary as a benchmark, but
the entry level was actually lower than that. In fact, it was precisely
$46,750. So, in fact, the Workers' Party is proposing a higher starting
salary for Ministers. And this is interesting because the difference
in salary for one month is about $8,250. If you multiply that over
the course of a year, the Workers' Party's proposed starting salary
for Ministers amounts to about $99,000 more than what the Committee
recommended. $99,000, incidentally, is about a two-month bonus based
on the base salary of $46,750. The Workers' Party has raised a big
ruckus about the quantum of the bonus. The starting salary they
have proposed incorporates a two-month bonus based on the current
starting salary. So, they have, in fact, proposed a higher starting
salary for Ministers than even the one the Committee recommended.
While the Workers' Party kicks up a big fuss about the bonus right
now, it is important to keep this in mind because any bonus they
calculate, for an entry-level Minister, would also be based on this
higher starting salary.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-41dec0c6-2166-4db1-ba5e-c64b48ca8590">
                  <a name="motion__id-41dec0c6-2166-4db1-ba5e-c64b48ca8590"><!--a--></a>Now, on the other point:
this is where we deal with the bonus itself. Mr Giam says that the
average bonus should be pegged at three months rather than the six
months that the Committee recommends. Now, one of the interesting
points is this: my initial reaction
to the bonus component also was that it was extremely high. And,
to be fair, that is a larger sum of money most ordinary people would
ever get. But when I looked at the targets that were set for the
National Bonus, I would also say that those targets are extremely
hard to achieve. And I believe that the Deputy Prime Minister also
clarified that the individual bonus component would be determined
not only by the Minister's contribution to his own Ministry but
also by how much he contributed towards achieving the national bonus
matrix. In that sense, the national bonus matrix has become the
target that our Government has set out to achieve. This target is
a target I do not think leaders of any other countries have set
out to achieve. And if you look at recent history, I do not think
leaders of any other country have achieved.</p>

of the targets. In order to achieve, say, the six-month bonus –
the so called average bonus – this sounds like a big number. If
you look at the targets, the GDP has to grow, and in real terms,
by 3% to 5%. The income of the lowest 20% has to grow by 2% to 3%
in real terms, and the median income has to grow by 2% to 3% in real
terms. The word "real" basically means that this has to take into
account inflation. Inflation, as at November, I believe, was about
5.7%. And inflation is pretty much a worldwide phenomenon. Central
banks all over the world are printing money, commodity prices are
shooting through the roof. Controlling inflation, in itself, is
a challenge.</p>

has undertaken actually involve not only making sure that incomes
rise in line with inflation, but exceeding it. What that basically
means is that GDP growth, in actual terms, may have to be – well,
if it is 3% to 5% in real terms, that would be 8.7% to 10.7%. Incomes,
likewise, will have to grow between 7% and 8%. If inflation comes
down, those targets would come down. But the real point is that
inflation is incorporated into all of these targets. And I do not
know of any developed country, anywhere in the world where the government
has been able to achieve these targets. So, indeed, even the target
to get the so called "average" bonuses is a very difficult one. And
if our office holders achieved that, I think the benefits to Singaporeans
would be tremendous, especially to the average Singaporeans and
also to those in the lower income groups. So, in that sense, I would
not begrudge them that.</p>

also makes a big issue about the so called "13-month" maximum bonus,
needless to say the targets to achieve that would be astronomical, especially
when inflation stays at the current levels. If our Government is
able to achieve that, then I think the people of Singapore would
be so much better off and that a couple of months' difference in
pay is probably not that big a deal to divide this House over. </p>

when Mr Giam ended his speech by saying he opposes the motion. Because
given how much common ground there is between the parties, it is
stunning that he would actually want to oppose a motion that, in
my view, is extremely progressive, and brings us much closer to
the Workers' Party's ideas than anyone that has ever proposed before.
Because by opposing the motion, what he is actually saying is that
he would rather keep the existing pay scales, than to move forward
with the proposal the Committee has put up. And I do not think anyone
here would agree to that. </p>

little bit with some of the previous positions taken by the Workers'
Party because I actually think this proposal touched on a lot of
the principles that were brought up back then as well. In 2006,
for example, in an interview, Mr Low Thia Khiang said that the Ministers'
salaries should be set at about a hundred times that of a worker
in the lowest 20th percentile. At that time, he believed that this
figure was $800.
So back in 2006, Mr Low was actually comfortable with a salary of
$80,000 a month for a Minister. He also took out the implication
of this. What he said then was that it also meant that if the income
of the person in the lowest 20% group rose by $1,000, the Ministers
would get $100,000 more, not just a year but a month. So, he was
actually quite comfortable with having the Ministers earn more,
if the lowest-income workers earned more back in 2006.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 949</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-aaeeddac-8b2a-4898-8042-755a8635054b">
                  <a name="motion__id-aaeeddac-8b2a-4898-8042-755a8635054b"><!--a--></a>In many ways, the Committee's
proposal actually takes this principle into account. It, in fact,
pretty much says that the income of the lowest 20% has to rise.
It is, in fact, even less generous than Mr Low in two respects.
One, the base pay is lower; and, two, the actual bonus is capped
– it is not unlimited, whereas in Mr Low's example, the upside would
have been unlimited. So, in fact, the salaries are less generous
than what the Workers' Party proposed in 2006 in many ways. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a65ea57a-cae6-4851-a1c2-8b0195f86af0">
                  <a name="motion__id-a65ea57a-cae6-4851-a1c2-8b0195f86af0"><!--a--></a>Now, in the Workers' Party's
manifesto, the position was slightly different. They actually said,
both in 2006 and 2011, that the Ministerial salaries should actually
be pegged to the salaries of foreign leaders with all their expenses
and so on taken into account. But the reality is this: this is a
notoriously difficult exercise and I notice that the Workers' Party,
despite having said this for the last five years, has not come up
with a single proposal on what the numbers would actually be if
this formula was applied. And they have had five years to come up
with this.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-58b841f6-f6a1-4a98-ae04-fe8a9c089d83">
                  <a name="motion__id-58b841f6-f6a1-4a98-ae04-fe8a9c089d83"><!--a--></a>I myself tried to do this
exercise and it was very, very difficult because a lot of the actual
bonuses and perks are actually very obscure. I took a stab at Australia
just now because it was the first country on the list. Over there,
I think, the Prime Minister receives an annual salary of $495,000
a year, which obviously looks more, compared to what our Ministers
earn. But the Prime Minister has two official residences while she
is in office. In previous sessions, the Members of Parliament of
the Opposition had said, "We are quite happy to have our Ministers
live in bungalows." The rental of a bungalow in Singapore, according
to <em class="ph i">Property Guru</em>, checked as of this morning, was between $25,000
and $42,000 a month. So, if we include that as part of the pay package,
as one of the perks, just monetising that perk alone would probably
amount to $300,000 to $400,000 more a year. And this excludes other
perks such as free first-class travel for herself and her spouse
for the rest of their lives, a fully-paid-for office for the rest
of their lives and, of course, all the expenses involved in keeping
up the house, and so on, would also be paid for by the state. And
these are just some of the perks. There are, of course, lots of
other perks – I have not had the ability to find out the values
for all of them because they are found in so many different pieces
of legislation and are so difficult to put together. So in that
sense, our clean wage system – what you see is what you get – is,
in fact, one of the most transparent you would find. And because
of that, our Ministers come under flak. But I think that is fair
game because people should know exactly what the cost of public
office is, nothing hidden.</p>

emotive issue. I think the fact that the two sides of this House
do not, in fact, differ that much in the ultimate outcome is a good
start and I hope that we can all get together and support this proposal
because, ultimately, it seems like we have more similarities than
differences. [<em class="ph i">Applause.</em>]</p>

Show Mao and other MPs from the Workers' Party said that pegging
ministerial salary to the salaries of the top 1,000 earners is not
appropriate. I think we must try to understand why the Committee
made this decision from another angle. I believe all of us accept
that a Minister's responsibility is no less than that of the one
thousand people. We use this benchmark to affirm the importance
of political appointments because they relate to the welfare of
3.5 million Singaporeans and this country's future as well as our
expectations and the requirements for these positions.</p>

common populace to understand the required responsibilities and
accountabilities of Ministers for Singaporeans, we can try to look
at the issue from another perspective or angle, as suggested by
some Singaporeans, for reference. The Prime Minister is our leader
and he must be responsible for the well-being of 3.5 million Singaporeans.
Therefore, his salary can be based on our population, say, one person
$1 per year, so that is $3.5 million per year. With that, perhaps
all Singaporeans are able to feel the balance at a more comfortable
level. Regardless of our ethnic, religious , language and cultural
background, we are all Singaporeans. Poor or rich, we are all Singaporeans.
As long as you are Singaporeans, the Prime Minister looks after
your well-being. Notwithstanding, some may say $1 per year is not
much, some may say it is not little. The Prime Minister takes a
pay cut of, say, 37%, so as to remind himself there is a need to
work even harder to improve the livelihood of the 40% lower middle-income
Singaporeans. With that, the figure was adjusted downwards to $2.2 million,
which is not much different from that recommended by the Committee. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-28917893-fa67-44da-bebc-1c8337102fd9">

ministerial salary as half of the Prime Minister's because his responsibility
is half, that will work out to be $1.1 million. And this is similar
to the amount recommended by the Committee so the result is all
the same. The difference is just a matter of angle/perspective. </p>

compensation for political decision makers is a sensitive topic
and it is not easy to reach 100% consensus. Everybody has a different view
and everyone's line of reasoning has its valid points, and we should
respect them.</p>

from the election results and is willing to accommodate public opinion,
hence the establishment of the Committee to Review Ministerial Salaries.
No policy is 100% perfect. I believe that the report has presented
sufficient and convincing data and basis for their recommendations,
and it is transparent. The pay recommendations are based on three
principles. I support these principles and thank MPs from the Opposition
party for their support as well. </p>

                  <a name="motion__id-47294e55-d7b2-4db5-9135-1c7dafef00cf"><!--a--></a>Firstly, the pay must be
considerably competitive to attract talent. I think we should adjust
our focus, not to look at numbers alone, but on the requirements
of the job, the responsibilities and contributions towards our country,
society and all Singaporeans. Scouting for the best talent is not
something that only the Government will do. Even in our daily life,
we often try to get them. For example, many of us hope to find a
capable, hardworking domestic worker to do the household chores,
take care of the young and old; those running a business will hope
to find a good helper to bring in profits for the company, expand
the business and create more jobs; at hawker centres, we look for
the best food, the most value for money and the most economical;
when we see a doctor, we will look for the best to cure our illness;
when we look for a wife or husband, we also hope to find a good
partner. Hence, to want the best is understandable. Many even pray to
the gods and hope to be granted their wish. In order to get the
best, some of us are even willing to pay for a premium, in the hope
to avoid risking paying an even higher price in future.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-f8addbb9-4694-4a04-a6b2-e109d5eeaaaa"><!--a--></a>In China, there was a story
about buying bones with a thousand gold. A palace official went
to buy a splendid steed, but returned with the bones of a dead horse
instead. The emperor was enraged. The palace official explained
that if everyone saw that the emperor was willing to pay a thousand
gold for the bones of the steed, they would believe that the emperor
genuinely intended to pay a premium for a splendid steed, and would
voluntarily send their horses to him. In the end, what the palace
official said came true, within less than a year, thousands of horses
were sent to the palace.</p>

resources, there is little room for mistakes. We must attract top
talent to join the civil service. It is difficult to decide on the
basis of choosing talent. One cannot underpay talent as we would
then end up with an ineffective government, but one cannot overpay
or it will trigger feelings of unfairness. The recommendations by
the Committee actually reflect the realities of governing a country and
the needs of the changing political scene.</p>

be at a discount of market rate, in order to exhibit commitment
and dedication. Those who enter politics must have a strong sense
of mission and responsibility, with moral integrity. It does not
mean that if one is rich, he will be happy. Only with a clear conscience
will one enjoy peace of mind. Whether it is the Government or private
sector, both are hungry for talent and cast their net for talent, but
with different goals. The private sector also tries to attract talent
with better pay, so that it will achieve maximum result for the
company. Entering politics is a sense of mission, to serve the people
wholeheartedly and is a long-term goal.</p>

wage without hidden perks. In this way, the actual wages of those
in political office will be simple and transparent. One gains happiness
from doing good, and gains freedom and ease when one uses wisdom
to follow good advice. By
doing away with the pension scheme, those in political office will
use CPF funds for retirement, just like ordinary Singaporeans. </p>

world around us. The salaries of politicians in many countries do
not reflect their actual income. In Italy, their sovereign debt
has hit 1.9 trillion euros, and according to their MP salary committee
report, their Members of Parliament are paid a basic salary of S$19,000,
and enjoy many additional perks, like tax-free monthly living allowance
of 3,503 euros, free flights, etc. There was an ancient Chinese
saying: "A magistrate of a prefecture could accumulate a fortune
of at least 10,000 taels of silver in three years." Low-ranking
officials are able to ''earn'' such a fortune not because of their
pay but because of their many corrupt practices. This situation
is common in many countries.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-f3b62147-2ffa-4600-8762-4e88b74ff767"><!--a--></a>The amount of salary is
not the primary consideration – and it is hard to benchmark the
pay – nor the only objective of talent selection. We have other
stringent criteria for choosing talents. The salary can be taken
as an appreciation or a reward for a job well done. Nevertheless,
we should give recognition to the hardwork of the Committee to Review
Ministerial Salaries, because these recommendations have incorporated
the expectations of Singaporeans from all walks of life, and will
be the cornerstone for the long-term development and prosperity
of Singapore in future. It is not a policy to serve the ruling PAP,
but one that serves the long-term interests of our nation as a whole,
and puts in place a code of conduct that is stable, fair, transparent,
reliable and highly efficient for Singapore's political system.
With this comprehensive Ministerial pay system that is basically
acceptable to the public, the eventual winners are all Singaporeans.</p>

has its valid points. However, with everyone having his own perspective
and opinion, it is difficult to satisfy all. Allow me at this point
to share the well-known Aesop fable of "The miller, his son and
their donkey" to highlight the difficulties a community faces in
agreeing on a course of action. A miller and his son were on their
way to town to sell their donkey. They had not gone far when they
passed a group of girls who suggested that one of them rode it.
The father then put his son on the animal. After travelling some
distance, they went past some old men who criticised the boy for making
his elderly father walk. So the boy dismounted and the miller got
on the donkey instead. Soon after, a group of women berated the
miller for making his young son walk while he rode on the donkey.
So the miller put his son up onto the saddle and they rode on happily
until they met another group of travellers who scolded them for
over-burdening the poor animal. "You should carry the poor animal
instead," they suggested. The miller and his son got off the donkey,
tied its legs together, turned it over on its back and carried it.
Soon, a crowd gathered to watch the strange sight. As they were
crossing a bridge, the poor animal became frightened at the chatter
and noise made by the crowd. It panicked, broke loose, fell into
the river and drowned. The classic story is a cautionary. It is
important to listen to feedback and suggestions but it is even more
important that implementation be carried out wisely in a way suitable
to one's circumstances.</p>

that monetary reward should not be the only prime consideration
for people who come forward to serve. However, I do get feedback from
colleagues, friends and residents that capable people may prefer
to stay on in their existing well-paying jobs while continuing to
contribute to and serve the nation in many, many other ways. Some
Singaporeans may have specific capabilities and skill sets we need
for running Singapore. Indeed, this is a job. Running a country

the issue of salaries of political office holders has brought about
widespread discussion among Singaporeans. I understand their concerns.
Although the eight-man Committee has proposed that the salaries
be reduced by about one-third, it is still difficult for the ordinary
people to fathom the amount of pay obtained by the political office
holders. The public also wanted to see a strong link between this
group's pay and the Government's performance, in terms of how it
contributes to improving the lives of the people, especially the
low-income group. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4788e65a-7d1a-45e5-a0f2-85b03da5745a">

has played an important role in providing social services for its
people. Besides the major investments made in education, health
and housing, social assistance schemes such as Workfare, ComCare
and Medifund and study bursaries have also ensured that opportunities
for advancement are available to everyone.</p>

showed that social mobility, which is the ability of an individual
to climb up or move down the social ladder compared to his own parents,
was found to be satisfactory. It showed that Singaporean children
from low-income families have good opportunities to secure better
achievements. As education is the key to social mobility, the strong
support from the Government towards early childhood development
and providing education at all levels has brought results. Strenuous
efforts have also been made to improve and upgrade the skills of
lower skilled workers so that this group of people will be able
to do jobs that require higher and more productive skills, and subsequently
help them to generate a much higher income. </p>

when we discuss this issue, we will look at it in the proper context.
We need to link this salary system to the Government's performance,
especially in the effort to assist those who are less well-off.
In fact, the Government has also enhanced support to the middle
classes. As the proverb goes: the political leadership that fights
for the people is like a big piece of wood in the middle of the
field that provides protection from the sun and shelter from the
rain. </p>

is no difference, I feel, between the proposals of the Workers'
Party and our views in that leaders should possess humility, put
the people's interests first and have a strong desire to serve.
The weakness in the Workers' Party's opinion and the difference
compared to our view is that the Workers' Party feels that by paying
competitive salaries, the attitudes of the political office holders
will change whereby they would immediately no longer possess humility,
responsibility and will also work solely for the pay. I feel this
is a wrong and unfounded view, and is not in line with the reality
today or in the past. This is more so if we look at the amount proposed by
the Workers' Party, which is almost similar and, in fact, higher
than the Committee's recommendation. </p>

only as good as the people that comprise it, this proverb also captures
very nicely the kind of leaders that are fit to hold public office.
They have to be selfless, above board and completely clean. They
also have to be prepared to take all the punches and to cushion
the impact of any adversity on their people, because as the piece
of wood sheltering their people from the heat and the rain, they
have to bear the consequences and carry the pain.</p>

Sir, I hope that we do not lose sight of this human angle that we
are talking about individuals who have decided to come forward to
serve and to put the interests of the people above their own, sometimes
at a cost to themselves. My fear is that if we turn this debate
into a mechanical discussion about dollars and cents, it will become
much harder for us to attract good people as office bearers. Let
me just take the example of Mr Tharman, our Finance Minister and
Deputy Prime Minister. He brought
a lot of glory to Singapore when he became the first Asian to be
appointed as the Chairman of the International Monetary and Financial
Committee – a policy-steering committee of the IMF. This shows his
calibre, quality and the amount of respect he commands in the IMF.
We certainly want to attract more people of that calibre to hold office
in the Government.</p>

Sir, I also urge you to look at the outcomes that we had achieved
over the years and how this leadership had served the people. In
just one generation, this Government had completely transformed
Singapore. I used to frequently share with my residents about my
"toilet" story. Do not worry. There is nothing, you know, inappropriate.
It is all entirely appropriate. When I was young, for a number of
years, I lived in a government quarters. There were about 15 families
living together but there was only one communal toilet. There was
no piped water in every home and we had a central kitchen for all
the families to cook in. As we had only one toilet, there was a
pecking order for the use of the toilet, especially early in the
morning. First, the men would use the toilet because they had to
go to work, followed by the children because they had to go to school
and, finally, the women would do the washing and cleaning. I am
really not sure what happened if anyone had weak bladders and jumped
the queue, but I suppose that sometimes the back lanes did come
in handy. </p>

                  <a name="motion__id-275bab1d-ae8e-4a28-b01a-1a47d1a103a8"><!--a--></a>Today, our HDB homes have
not one, but two toilets, and we are constantly improving our homes
through the various upgrading programmes. Occasionally, we find
ourselves in an awkward situation where we had to persuade residents
to support the upgrading programmes, like what I had to do in a
recent visit to a block that is due for the Home Improvement Programme
(HIP) in my area. </p>

good and visionary political leadership totally dedicated to the service
of the people that has brought us to where we are today. And we
must continue to attract good people into political office so that
our children and grandchildren, mine included, can continue to enjoy
the same, if not a better life. We all know that no society can
remain static, either we continue to progress upwards or we slide
downwards and we need people with vision and dedication to bring
us to the next lap.</p>

is not a welfare state but we have to acknowledge that our Government
has done much for the welfare of the people, without pinning that
label on ourselves. The Government plays a major role in re-distribution
to ensure fair opportunity for everyone. And as we move ahead, I
can see that re-distribution role expanding. Other than heavy investments
in education, healthcare and housing, we also have subsidies in
the form of Workfare, ComCare, Medifund and educational bursaries, to
name a few. I was also very happy to read about the Ministry of
Finance's recent study which shows that social mobility, a subject
close to my heart, is still very alive in Singapore. The study shows
that children from poor Singaporean families stand a good chance
of moving up in life. The son of a father in the bottom 20% of the
income earners has at least two-thirds chance of breaking out of
his low-income group. And he has a 10% chance of moving all the
way up to the top 20% of income earners in Singapore.</p>

is closely related to educational achievement, strong Government
efforts to uplift educational standards and help needy students
have paid off. And we are not standing still. Like housing, healthcare
and social assistance, education too has gone through a lot of changes,
benefiting our people. And I welcome the recent announcements by the Minister
for Education that it is looking at ways to help students study
in private educational institutions pay for their education, as
I know that parents of children who cannot get into the public universities
really struggle to support their children. Again, such efforts require
leaders in public service with vision and foresight as education
is a long-term investment and we need to attract more of such people
into public office. </p>

of the proverb which I had cited, which is that good leaders and
a good government is like the big piece of wood in the middle of
the field that shelters its people from the sun and the rain, is
another Malay proverb which cautions us to avoid at all costs leaders
that, and I quote, "<em class="ph i">Harapkan baga, baga dan makan padi</em>".
In English, this means that we placed our trust in the fence around
the field to protect the padi but as it turned out, it was the fence
that ended up eating the padi.</p>

independence at the same time as us but not all have seen much progress
in the lives of their people. We can argue that it could be because of
our geographical location or other reasons that have contributed
to our progress. But the point remains that it was astute leadership
and good governance that have brought us to where we are today.
Pay, Mr Speaker, Sir, should never be the incentive to get people
into political service but it should never become a disincentive
either. Even in the social service sector, we have had to review
the salary package as the sector was finding it extremely difficult
to attract people to work in the sector. And we understand because social
service workers do have families to take care of, they have to eat,
they have to plan for the future, they have to plan for their retirement.
Even social service workers do have to have their remuneration package
reviewed time over time, and we had done so in the last few years. </p>

the most valuable assets that we have built over the years is the
deep trust that the people have in our Government's leadership.
In fact, I would say that this is a very important reason for our
success. We had to brave many changes together but people were behind
the Government because they had seen their lives improved. In the
2008 recession, the Singapore Government was the fastest compared to
other countries in coming out with SPUR and Jobs Credit to help
workers keep their jobs. That action alone had persuaded a number
of companies in the electronics sector that I was working with at
that time, to change their investment decisions. Instead of investing
elsewhere, they were able to persuade their headquarters to invest
in Singapore. I remember the envy of a Japanese MNC executive shaking
his head miserably when I asked him about how his headquarters in
Japan was faring and what support they were receiving from the government.
He said that months after the crisis that hit the world, they were
still discussing the measures to put in place.</p>

debate, Sir, over the last few weeks with mixed feelings and a fair
amount of misgiving. On the one hand, it is really important that
we have a public discussion of this issue so that people could express
their views candidly. On the other hand, my biggest fear is that
if this discussion is not managed properly, and if views are not
expressed carefully, it could erode the trust that has been so painstakingly
built over the years and this can only be detrimental to Singapore
regardless of which party we belong to. Worse still, it will deter
good people from entering politics regardless of the pay that is
offered to them. </p>

benchmarks are used, it will still not be perfect and it will be
subject to dispute and challenge as elitist and an attempt to monetise
the value of political
office. Although, on a latter point, my MP colleague, Mr Vikram
Nair had gone in great length to raise this question as to how do
we decide whether and why we should peg political pay to the salary
of a civil servant and why should it be a multiple of five times,
why not less and why not more. It is the same debate. The same questions
that are asked even in relation to the benchmark set by the Committee
could also be asked about this suggestion that it should be pegged
to the salary of a civil servant. It could also be asked as to why
this benchmark is more acceptable than the one recommended by the
Committee. And would this benchmark not also attract the same criticism
that it would monetise the value of political office? I think the
same arguments will be applied, whatever benchmarks we use. However,
I agree with Mr Nair that a more important point is that even by
the benchmarks used by the Workers' Party, the quantum derived as
the fair amount is very close and, in fact, higher than what the
Committee had suggested. </p>

                  <em class="ph i">Straits

So, in conclusion, Sir, I hope that at the end of this debate, we
can put aside our differences which, as I have mentioned, are not
so different after all. We should try to reach a consensus on this
issue so that we can then focus on the really important task of
taking care of the welfare of our people.</p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, we have discussed the issue of Ministerial salaries
many times over the years in this House and it is always a very
difficult and very emotional issue, for completely understandable
reasons. First, because you are talking about pay, which is always
sensitive. Second, you are talking about significant amounts of money especially
as it would appear to the ordinary man-in-the-street – millions
of dollars. And thirdly, because you are talking about what elected
Ministers are earning; representatives of the people, serving their
people and being paid out of the taxes of the people. So, it is
a subject on which people have strong views – strong views not only
on what is the "correct" and "incorrect" salary, but strong views
on what is right and fair for Ministers to be paid and whether the
basis is proper and legitimate.</p>

is never finally settled is because there are two radically different
approaches to this problem.</p>

Party, at least in principle, though not in their sums, that public
service is its own reward. People entering public service should
not even think about the pay, and all the sacrifice and hard work
will ultimately benefit the general good of the public, and that
by itself should be greater satisfaction than any salary package.</p>

that we should pay whatever is necessary to assemble the best team
for Singapore. To consider the difficulty and the importance of
the job of Ministers, to think what quality of people we are looking
for to be Ministers, and to look at what capable Singaporeans are
earning in the private sector and pay commensurately to get the
best team possible for Singapore.</p>

versus the pragmatic one. And each has its merits. Neither can be

will accept.</p>

get a pay system which works for us. Because this is not just about
how much money Ministers will get, but it is about Singapore's future.
It is about ensuring that Singapore always has a good government,
leaders who care for our people and our country, who have strong
abilities to carry out the responsibilities of Ministers and to
have more than that, the character to handle pressure and the mettle
to provide steady leadership in a crisis. If we can get that right,
then we can protect what we have achieved and build better lives
for all. If not, then the little dot will become the little black

for a good MP but also for much more than a good MP. The search
process is extensive. You have read about it in the newspapers,
we have talked about it – tea sessions trawling systematically for
potential talent. But beyond the general trawl, we also go rifle shooting.
Talent spotting individuals, specifically seeking out people with the
abilities, with the right combination of background and skills and
aptitudes to be potential office-holders because we found from experience
that if you just do a general trawl, you do not catch the whales.</p>

a long runway in order to master their job, to get the feel of it

they still have time to build bonds with Singaporeans, with the
grassroots, with fellow politicians. And eventually become good
Ministers while they are still vigorous and have energy to do things

office-holders, ask yourself: whom have we brought in, from where?
We have got several from the private sector. We have brought in
Shanmugam, top lawyer, he was an MP for many years, eventually we
persuaded him to come in in his late 40s at the peak of his earning
powers, when he took a very substantial pay cut to come in, even
to our pre-committee salaries.</p>

surgeon, also coming in with a significant pay cut. Gan Kim Yong
in NatSteel, previously in the Administrative Service; Grace Fu
in PSA. People successful, proven, now making a leap into what for
them must be an uncertain new path and not just their career, but
their mission. In Cabinet, they are all making a far bigger contribution
than they were making in any of their previous jobs. But in Cabinet, they
are all earning much less than they were before they entered politics.
I wish I could find more of them. I have not succeeded. I did not
find it easy and I will not find it easy either.</p>

the public sector, from the civil service, from the SAF: Teo Chee
Hean, Tharman Shanmuguaratnam, Lim Hng Kiang, Lim Swee Say, Khaw
Boon Wan, Heng Swee Keat and many other younger ones brought in
this recent general election. Had they stayed on either in the civil
service or the SAF, they would most probably have risen high and
gone far. We looked for the most promising ones, and we raided the
civil service and the SAF knowing that they would leave the service
weaker, but understanding that unless you have a good government
and a good set of Ministers, however strong your civil service is,
it is not going to be able to perform. And we have to make this
balance and take this choice, and take them out. And now they are
in and making bigger contributions to Singapore.</p>

was there in the first place because the civil service pays properly
from junior officers all the way up to the Permanent Secretary.
And had the civil service not paid properly, I think we would have
lost many good officers to the private sector long ago. For both
those coming in from the private sector, and the civil service and
SAF, these were very tough decisions. For the private sector, you
are coming in from a career where you are known, where you are doing
well, where you have your network, you are on the up, and if you
stay on, you know what you are going to do. It is not just the earning
power, it is also the excitement, the challenge, the success, the
thrill of being at the top of your career and your profession. You
come in, you may succeed, you may fail. You cannot say for sure
because however successful a person is in the private sector, public service
as a Minister is a different proposition. You need different aptitudes,
different skills. If you do not have the right touch and you do
not transfer from being a specialist doctor to being a policy-oriented
Minister, whatever your psychomotor skills, whatever your many years
of learning and experience, it has gone to waste.</p>

the private sector and rejoin your profession. Five years later
or 10 years later, you are not as young, five more years of bright
young people have come along, filled up the places, taken your clients
or patients, and when you go back out, you are in a different path.
So, it is an irrevocable change of course. And, of course, there
are family and privacy considerations as well, especially if your
family is still young. How will they be affected? Will I have time
for them? Can they cope? Will their financial prospects be affected
if I come in because I have to calculate the implications?</p>

the public sector. In a way, it is easier because policy-wise, they
have been working on policies, contact-wise, they probably have
more contact with the Ministers so they know what the Ministers
are doing and the Ministers know what they are doing, but for them
also it is a one-way ticket because they have to resign from the
public service. You go out, it is diving into the ocean. The Chinese
say "下海", meaning the private
sector but here you are diving into the ocean, into politics. And, likewise,
no assurance of success because writing policy papers for a Minister
is quite different from standing up in Parliament and expounding
and defending and persuading and carrying a policy which you have
had to take the lead to set and to work out. If it does not work,
they also have to start afresh, completely new in the private sector somewhere.
Those who come into politics but did not become Ministers straightaway
– and sometimes that happens – have immediately to find new jobs
outside of Government and make a living for themselves.</p>

to come in from the point of view of their own calculation, from
the point of the responsibility which they are taking on. It is
not a simple matter either because you are going to be, as a Minister
of State or Minister, responsible for the futures, the lives, the
security, the prosperity, the education of several million Singaporeans.
And if you are not up to it, several million people are going to
suffer the consequences, quite apart from any mortification or embarrassment
which you may feel. But the responsibility which you are taking
on to you, to do this on behalf of Singaporeans. If you do not pause
and take a deep breath and think it over for several days, you are
not fit for this job.</p>

in, I have the passion, I will proceed. If only life were so simple
and passion was sufficient for everything. You need the passion,
but you also need to be circumspect to think and consider carefully:
am I up to it? Can I really make that contribution? Therefore, you
are not talking about huge numbers of people, you are talking about
a few dozen possibilities in Singapore, finally when they boil it
down in each election, we have never brought in more than six or
seven.</p>

with the potential candidates who are coming in either from the
private sector or from the public sector because if money had been
their principal consideration, we would not even have fielded them
as MPs, much less appointed them as Ministers. But I asked them
to join politics because they have the right values, because they
were capable, and I believe that they could make meaningful contributions.
And they agreed to come in because they wanted to serve and after searching their souls
and consulting their families, they felt: Yes, I think I can make
a contribution.</p>

were a make or break issue for any of them who have come in. But
I have no doubt that proper salaries have made it easier for me
to build the team which I have today and to provide the best service
which we can to Singaporeans to govern the country. But I also recognise
that there were others too who might have been able to contribute
but who declined when I asked them. They cited desire for privacy
or they may say, "Sorry, politics is not for me" or they say, "Thank
you very much, I will contribute but I will find my own ways to
do it." Nobody will ever say, "Sorry, the pay is too low", but we
need to be honest with ourselves. For some of them, it must have
been a consideration, especially the younger ones with young families
and young children. And when they say, "I don't mind but my husband
is not keen or my wife is not keen", well, we know how to interpret
what it means. Because even if they do not worry for themselves,
they must think about the financial impact on their spouses and
children, and they must think what their responsibility is to their
family and to provide the best they can for their family and what
the impact would be in terms of exposure and in terms of normal
life as well as financially.</p>

successful bringing in people from the public sector than the private
sector. Partly as I said, because the civil servants are more familiar
with policy. But also it is more difficult for the private sector
to adjust, to come in and to be a Minister because there is a greater
difference between Ministerial and business or professional skills
sets. From being a surgeon to being a decision maker. From a lawyer
arguing a case for your client to being a Minister, deciding what
are the right laws which should prevail in the land. And to change
from being a very successful lawyer or banker, to being a very successful
Minister is not so easy.</p>

of course, and that is that the civil service pay, while competitive,
is not quite as high as the private sector pay. So, when the civil
servant comes in, the impact financially is not so great. But even
then, when I bring in a senior officer like Heng Swee Keat, he will
take a substantial cut, and now, with this recommendation, a further
reduction. It is not a light decision to bring in somebody like Heng
Swee Keat from the civil service. He has been a Permanent Secretary,
he was Managing Director of Monetary Authority of Singapore – he
was responsible for the whole financial system and financial sector
in Singapore, one of our top Permanent Secretaries. If he had not
come in to politics, every chance of becoming Head of Civil Service.
It is a big sacrifice for the civil service to lose a person like
that. It is a significant sacrifice to him to come in from where
he was and the grade he was, which he fully justified to start as
a new Minister at the bottom and work his way up. But I was fortunate,
I talked to him. Last time, he was not ready – children still young.
This time, he was ready – he proceeds – and, fortunately, I have
now got a good Minister for Education. But can I do that a dozen
times and get 12 such people into my Cabinet? If not, how do I fill
the Cabinet? How do we make sure that it is just not education but defence,
transportation, national development, foreign affairs – the whole
range – are all staffed with top quality people? </p>

answer. Not the whole part, but part of the answer. And I have been
involved with pay as well as salaries for a large part of my working
career. My first involvement was in the SAF in the 1980s. I was
in the general staff and the Government was planning a major increase
of salaries proposed. I think Mr Goh Chok Tong was then the Defence
Minister, and we discussed it. I think it was about 20% to 25% increase
for the officers, and I argued against it because I thought it was
too much, too fast. There was no need to be so generous and perhaps
to change the spirit of the service. But that was my perspective,
which changed over the years. </p>

Parliament, I watched how Mr Lee Kuan Yew argued and defended the
policy of paying realistic wages to Ministers. I remember particularly
in 1985, during the Budget, Committee of Supply, when there was
a full debate with Mr J B Jeyaretnam. Mr Low Thia Khiang was not
yet in Parliament, but it was Mr Jeyaretnam and Mr Chiam. Minister
Mentor, or then Prime Minister, came with a stack of papers and did
battle. He never looked at the papers but for three hours, he argued,
explained, made the case with Jeyaretnam, with Chiam See Tong, with
several other MPs participating, in a way which only Minister Mentor
can do. Why this is being realistic, why you have to be honest and
not hypocritical about this matter, why it is necessary to have
the best man to be the Chief Justice, to be Judges, to be the Attorney-General,
to be Permanent Secretaries and Ministers, and how important it
is to do that right rather than argue over a few million dollars
of salary. But even Minister Mentor, after three hours of a bravura performance,
could not settle the matter permanently. It is not possible, and
every few years we came back to it, and each time we have to argue
the matter again. </p>

Deputy Prime Minister and in charge of the civil service, Public
Service Division. And I saw how, at that time, with rapid economic
growth and rapid increases in salaries, civil service pay and remuneration
were lagging behind the private sector, and the service was rapidly
getting depleted. Young officers were leaving, paying up their bonds
or leaving soon after their bonds, not waiting to be underpaid in their
40s, but calculating ahead that by the time I am 40, I am going
to be behind. I am now 30, this is my moment to make the move. And
people calculating even ahead of that. </p>

                  <a name="motion__id-5e4305db-0d3d-4f96-8fc2-1e81dcaa55be"><!--a--></a>The civil service put up
a proposal to make a 5% or 10% pay revision. I told them it was
unrealistic, we have a serious problem. We have to move drastically
on pay, we have to move drastically on promotions. Because if every
time I pay faster, I promote slower, you will end up going nowhere,
and that was the problem because of the system then, without personnel
boards. I was convinced we needed a major revision. And so in 1993,
we made major revisions to the pay for Ministers, for the civil
service, especially at the Administrative Service and the Legal
Service. At the same time, we came up with this idea that you are
going to have this problem repeatedly over the years, the arguments
remain the same, we should settle the argument, try and make a benchmark and
then we just follow the benchmark. If it goes up, we go up. If it
goes down, we go down. And the logic remains the same. The formula
has been agreed, the calculation – that is a matter of arithmetic. </p>

our White Paper in 1994 and introduced the idea of a formula. And
the formula was two-thirds of the average of the top 24 people in
six professions – two-thirds average 24. Later on, we modified it
and made it two-thirds of the average or the median of the top 48
people in the same professions. And over the years, we made successive
revisions to improve the scheme to adapt as circumstances change,
and each time we explained fully in Parliament and to the people
of Singapore what
we were doing. It is really above board, completely open, fully
argued. And Mr Low Thia Khiang was here for many of those and we
engaged on this issue repeatedly. </p>

of benchmarking not just to the Ministers, not just to the Administrative
Service, but throughout the civil service and the SAF. So it is
officers, soldiers, policemen, teachers, nurses, administrators,
clerks. Every level, what could you earn in the private sector,
what can you earn in the public sector, we will try and match that,
but always lagging a little bit because we do not want to set the
pace. We want to be lagging. But we made sure it is competitive,
and this led to major salary adjustments. For the teachers, one
year, we made a 30% increase, and then we followed that with successive
adjustments over the years. Had we not done that, we would not have
the civil service we have today. We would not have teachers who
are good graduates, we would not have principals who are in their
late 30s, early 40s, vigorous. We would not be able to staff our
hospitals and healthcare system. We would not have people in every department
on top of their job, thinking what to do next, what to do better. </p>

over and it continues today because if private sector moves, we
have to continue to move. And the Legal Service, we continually
are under pressure because in the private sector, lawyers' earnings
are going up. Doctors and nurses, the private sector is doing very
well. There is a review going on for doctors and nurses. MOH is
making their case to the Ministry of Finance. All and other departments
and other services too. All these are continuing revisions which
are necessary and, in the same way, Ministerial pay also has to
remain competitive and realistic as circumstances change.</p>

Ministerial pay remains an issue. Some of them disagree with the
principle of looking at the private sector or some of them may have
reservations about the formula which we have set, whether it is
too narrow, whether you are looking at the wrong group of people,
whether it is stable enough, what if the group changes. Many technical
arguments can be rehearsed. Some people just feel that the salaries
are just too high. Whatever it is, that is too much and less is
better. Others may be unhappy that the Ministers have to take the
responsibility to decide their own salaries rather than have somebody
else impartially deciding it for them. And then there are the concerns that
highly paid political leaders would lose the ethos of caring for
Singaporeans first as their main motivation and priority, and may
lose touch with the problems which average families with average
incomes feel. So, all these came to a head in the General Elections in
2011. And I would say that these are, in principle, reasonable concerns.
No government can function unless it is functioning and serving
the interests of its electorate and Singaporeans. But in Singapore,
the PAP's track record of Government can stand up to scrutiny. Bonus
or no bonus, year in, year out, we have looked after the interests
of all Singaporeans, especially the poor, which is how we have got
here today, as Mdm Halimah Yacob reminded the House just now.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-de0db66f-2e6b-4376-8b7d-e06778dcc04a"><!--a--></a>But these are not issues
easily settled in the heat of a campaign, and we certainly do not
want an auction to the lowest bidder. People saying, "I will serve
for less" and the other person, "I will serve for even less". And
you think that if you choose the cheapest one, you will get the
best value for money? It has to be considered carefully and thoroughly
with Singapore's best interest at heart, and then we reach a judicious decision
which will serve Singapore well for the longer term.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-ac8d831c-2ed5-4be6-84a4-06f3c3754de9"><!--a--></a>Therefore, after the General Election,
I appointed Mr Gerard Ee to head a Committee. He put together a
competent and respected team with broad experience. They consulted widely,
they analysed the issues thoroughly and from a fresh perspective,
and they have submitted, what in my view, is a well-judged report.
In terms of quantums, there is a major reduction, more than one-third
reduction for Ministers, no more pensions, the formula is changed.
But it reflects the Committee's judgement of the right balance between
paying competitively to assemble a good team and setting a reasonable discount
for public service – to recognise public and, particularly, political
service. This is significantly different from the balance which
the Government set when we last revised the benchmark 12 years ago.
But the situation has changed. Since then, we appointed the Committee,
we accept their judgement and we will work on its basis. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-df761ec2-f561-49b0-8fe2-82dd43591318">
                  <a name="motion__id-df761ec2-f561-49b0-8fe2-82dd43591318"><!--a--></a>But equally important as
a formula and a number, the Committee reviewed and reaffirmed the
fundamental principles for setting salaries in the public sector.
They examined many alternatives during the consultation, considered
them all carefully, but ultimately decided that the basis should
be what Singaporeans can earn in the private sector, include a discount
to recognise that this is political service in the interest of the nation,
and to pay a clean wage.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-682ea64f-bcf9-468a-b732-405cf8b7d320">
                  <a name="motion__id-682ea64f-bcf9-468a-b732-405cf8b7d320"><!--a--></a>In other words, the Committee
reaffirmed the basis on which the Government has been working all
along, although with a new formula and a bigger discount. And I
am encouraged to see that the Workers' Party also accepts these
basic principles, although they have a different formula and a different
notion of what the numbers should be in the same ballpark as what
the Committee has recommended. But of course slightly lower because
having looked at the Committee's report, they decided as the Opposition party,
surely they must recommend something a bit less. But my Government
accepts the Committee's recommendations. We will do our best to
make it work. I hope the public will accept the Committee's proposals
as fair and right for the future.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-f3cbff30-cbcd-4e66-ac93-295466bd758d"><!--a--></a>Why is pay such a critical
issue? Because pay goes to one of the core requirements for Singapore
– to assemble the best team to serve Singapore. And if you have
the wrong system of pay, you will have the wrong team. And as the
Prime Minister, this is my constant worry.</p>

the impact of the salary revisions on my present team of Ministers.
They have come in, they have committed themselves. They are in for
the cause. This pay cut is not going to affect their dedication
to serve. But my bigger concern is for the long term, for future
Cabinets and potential office holders. People who have not yet come
in, people who must make that decision and that commitment. Can
the future Prime Minister continue to get the best and most committed
people to serve as his Ministers? In fact, can we get the best possible
future Prime Minister for Singapore? How can our pay system support
this important goal? And if we have a pay system which supports
this, how can we get Singaporeans to accept that?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f2c425ca-0bfa-493d-9de1-41ba592a4873">
                  <a name="motion__id-f2c425ca-0bfa-493d-9de1-41ba592a4873"><!--a--></a>The ethos of service is
critical if you are coming into politics. Ideally, we should take public
service as being inherently different from the private sector. Public
service has its own rewards and we just set salaries sufficient
to support Ministers at a reasonable standard of living, independent
of what the private sector earns. And there is no shortage of talent.
Bigger monetary sacrifice will not deter more public-spirited Singaporeans
from serving. In fact, some people have argued that the bigger sacrifice will
encourage more public-spirited people to come forward.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 965</p>

our hearts we would wish and hope that it were true. In reality,
we know it is not so simple. Our own experience and the experience
in other political systems provide a reality check. Yes, there will
be always some able Singaporeans who are willing to serve regardless
of the terms. And we treasure people like that, and when we find
them, if they are suitable, we field them because they are very
special. But will there be enough of them to produce a whole team
of Ministers, a whole of Cabinet, equal to the task and with the
standards which we have come to expect? And can we afford to risk
the future of the country on the assumption that there is no trouble,
we will find them, salaries do not matter? From my experience working with
the system, I know it is not so easy. We are talking about a small
group to start with and every additional hurdle you put, every additional
burden on the step forward to come in, you make it more difficult
and you narrow your choice.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-a29a25ce-62c2-49f7-9e66-d50afd308c15"><!--a--></a>Even without competitive
pay, some people will come forward. Those who do not care about
money and they are doing good work. You see them at charities, you
see them at the VWOs, some are in religious service. I think our
society is the richer for them. We will be very much poorer without
people like that. But they are not enough and not all of them have
the combination of attributes and skills which we are looking for. </p>

in with wealthy backgrounds, as Mr Alvin Yeo pointed out yesterday
– happening in other countries where politics is dominated by those
who can afford to participate and not to be paid. Like in America,
where many of the politicians are of means, they are not poor people
– Mitt Romney, billionaire many times over; Michael Bloomberg made
his fortune. If you are not rich, you are not likely to be running
for President. Even Barak Obama who came from humbler backgrounds
is not a poor man. And so too, in UK, where the Cabinet is a cabinet
of wealthy people, as Mr Alivn Yeo pointed out.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-6b460b97-7756-4cc6-8df7-e4e2505374c0">

who have been successful in their careers, who have become financially
secure and who are now at a stage in their lives when they are ready
to do public service. They will come in. We had Dr Richard Hu who
served with distinction many years ago. We have Shanmugam come in
as a lawyer in his late 40s and there will be others, too. And I
see on the Opposition side, Mr Chen Show Mao has come in, aged 50
after a successful career. Now he is ready to do public service.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2ea55bcf-4bc6-4520-a036-30c14d46e507">

with this background who have been successful and are now ready
to make a career switch and do <em class="ph i">pro bono</em> work. But they will
be older, 50-plus years old. They can serve one, two terms and if
the whole Cabinet is 50-plus years old, I think it is going to be
a less future-oriented Cabinet, less energetic, less in touch with
the new generation. We want people who are younger, who are vigorous,
for whom this is not just something you do after you have done other
things in your life but the main commitment for the prime years
of your working life.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-77ce72ba-a1d2-4775-940f-bdfabfbd39e7">
                  <a name="motion__id-77ce72ba-a1d2-4775-940f-bdfabfbd39e7"><!--a--></a>We have nothing against
Singaporeans who have wealthy backgrounds or who have made a successful
private sector career. They will have meaningful contributions to make
or they may have meaningful contributions to make but we cannot
afford to have our whole system based on this. We need a mix of
talent, different ages and backgrounds, people who represent the
diverse needs and aspirations of our population. And to do that,
you need to have a proper system. As Ms Denise Phua acknowledged
yesterday with a regretful tone but she has run a VWO; she has herself gone in and committed
herself, running Pathlight. She recounted her experience gathering
a team for Pathlight School. She can persuade her banker to switch
over and do this work for the love of it but she could not assemble
a whole team of volunteers who did not need a salary. She needed
to take a pragmatic approach and we need to have that pragmatic
mindset too.</p>

worked well for Singapore. It has enabled us to assemble a strong
and committed team. We have governed effectively, cleanly and fairly.
We fostered a harmonious multi-racial society and we have improved
Singaporean lives and transformed Singapore from third world to
first. Whether you are a wealthy person, whether you are professional,
whether you are low-income Singaporean, your life today is better
than it was 10 years ago and totally different from what it was
one generation ago.</p>

and Singaporean Ministers have earned respect and esteem worldwide.
Singapore stands high. When people look for models of what to emulate,
where are the solutions, where are the ideas. They look to Singapore;
whether they are looking at traffic; whether they are looking at
healthcare; whether they are looking at housing; whether they are
looking at clean and efficient government. And they look at Singapore
Ministers also with healthy respect. As Mdm Halimah reminded us,
Deputy Prime Minister Tharman is chairing the International Monetary
and Financial Committee. It is the main Committee of the IMF. What
rights have we Singapore to be there chairing the Committee? We
are not just a traffic policeman inviting people to speak. You are
there because you have views, you understand the issues, you have
a contribution to make. Therefore, you are respected and people
are happy to work with you because you can help them to solve their
very difficult problems.</p>

has worked well. I am not saying it is perfect. Ministers make mistakes,
the Government sometimes makes mistakes. We always try to do better but
overall, this is the system which has worked for Singapore. Getting
the best possible leadership for Singapore is vital for us because
Singapore is different from other countries. Our survival and success
will always be based on our ability to be extraordinary. We are
a little red dot, unlike the US, even unlike Finland or Switzerland. No
one owes us a living. If we run into trouble, we are not going to
be as fortunate as Greece or Portugal. There is no EU to be the
uncle. You are on your own.</p>

in a turbulent and uncertain region. Hong Kong is as small as us,
about the same population. Hong Kong always has big brother on the other
side – one country, two systems. China is there, and China will
take care of them. Switzerland and Belgium – small countries. They
make do with either invisible or low-key government. Belgium went
without a government for about 500 days. Switzerland, Ministers
take turns to lead the government and the country runs itself because
it is in the middle of Europe and nothing can go wrong.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-69ee2ea0-9fd4-4e1a-ad35-461cbddacf89">
                  <a name="motion__id-69ee2ea0-9fd4-4e1a-ad35-461cbddacf89"><!--a--></a>But we in Singapore are
not like that. We are young, multi-ethnic, always needed to change
directions, to think, to fly faster, higher, lower, different angle,
different route because we are in a different situation. And therefore,
we will always need a highly competent government to make up for
our other disadvantages, to run a high-functioning system whose
sum is more than the parts which make it up, to constantly adjust
to changes and to meet the needs of our population, including the
lower-income group. It has been so up to now and I think it is going
to continue to be so in future, in a more challenging external environment.</p>

we can follow other countries, how they pay their Ministers. Let
us look at that – many alternatives to choose from and the Workers'
Party, somewhere in their documents and their pronouncements also
take this line. But we are different from them because our situation
is different. We are different from them because we have set an
approach to public sector, public service and to government and
to remunerating government which is different from the approach
they have taken. They have gone for complicated wages. We have gone
for clean wage. They have gone for wages, in many countries, which
bear no relation to the private sector. We have decided we have
to be realistic. We have to look and see what it is which Singaporeans
can earn, what it is which is necessary to make this system work. </p>

                  <a name="motion__id-8cb7aa9a-82bf-4793-bbc5-3f38ccc1ed62"><!--a--></a>They have their problems.
It is not that other countries do not have problems and we can just
take out what they are doing and all will be well. We are not trouble
free but I think we avoid many of the problems which they have.
You see the financial scandals, not just in emerging markets countries,
not just in the third world. You see frequent resignations when
things go wrong with Ministers. You see unstable governments. Italy has
had one government every 18 months since the War. That means, over
60 years, they have had about 40 governments. Japan has had six
Prime Ministers over the last five years, roughly. I may have lost
count but they are talking about those orders of magnitude.</p>

often privately admit to us that they wish they could have followed
us. Unfortunately, their politics do not allow them to follow us,
in the way we deal with the public sector and with Ministers' pay.
Foreign visitors tell us the same, how impressed they are with our
Ministers; how they impressed they are with our system. I have had
many foreign visitors who tell me, "Your Ministers are different
and I have worked with Ministers in many countries and I have not
met a team like your team."</p>

after the Elections, "Don't change your system." We look at other
this big Asian country and he named. He says the Ministers are paid
nothing but every single one of them is at least worth $200 million.
They know it because they see working here. Therefore, they invest.
Therefore, they have faith in us. Therefore, Singaporeans benefit
from this reputation and this confidence which the world has in Singapore.</p>

from them. I do not need to go into details but I will just skim through
quickly. You look at the US – the President is paid less than me.
Yes. And the last time I had the revision, the newspapers reported
a certain anonymous high level resident of the White House saying
that he wished he was paid the same. But the high level resident
of the White House travels in Air Force One, lives in the White
House, vacations at Camp David. And after they retire, they earn
many times their salaries. All they have to do is to turn up for
an appearance, make a few remarks, a hundred thousand dollars a
time.</p>

has earned US$15 million since retiring; Bill Clinton who retired
a decade ago has earned US$75 million. His fees are about US$200,000
each time. And it is not just the President, but it is a revolving
door system for many of their top officials. People who come in,
serve a short while, go back out and often go back out to be lobbyists
and consultants or to serve in the industries and businesses which
relate to what they were working on when they were inside – whether
it is defence, whether it is
communications, whether it is energy. And so, you lead to conflicts
of interests. And so, you lead to problems when you are not quite
sure whether the policy is "straight" or not "straight". Why is
he doing it? Dick Cheney had to answer many questions because he
used to work in petroleum, he became Vice President, he has gone
out, he has links with big companies. So when he makes decisions
and Haliburton benefits, many questions are asked, fairly or unfairly. </p>

Low official salaries topped up by generous benefits. Just now,
Mr Faisal Manap says, "Well, because they live in London. That's
why they are given these benefits". That is the explanation. The
reality is they are given these benefits because they could not
be given the pay and so it was presented as benefits and the understanding
was these are claims you can make and so long as you submit some piece
of paper, well, we would pay the claims. Because this is just a
way to work the system so that you can be paid what you really truly
need to be paid. And the MPs took it literally. They submitted claims
for maintaining the swans in their ponds, for cleaning up the moat
of their castle. Somebody submitted the claim because he was watching some
exciting movie in his home. And when all these came out, there was
a humongous scandal and they have to chop all that down. And now
they have a very serious problem because now they cannot pay MPs
via this route, neither can they raise the MPs' allowance because
MP's standing has sunk rock bottom in people's esteem.</p>

with the economy doing badly, David Cameron recently proposed to
make Ministers pay more for their pensions so they have to deduct
more for their co-payments to show solidarity with the people because
people are suffering from spending cuts. One of his Ministers accused
him of "jester politics"; and another Minister said "We all know
what sort of earning potential Cameron will have after he leaves
office and it won't be small." And in fact, you have seen former
politicians in Britain leaving office who had gone in to subsequent
careers and it has become controversial because they have to earn
a living for themselves and the question is: how are they doing
it?</p>

different. We have deliberately not followed that model. I think
we should not follow that model. Good government is going to remain
critical to Singapore in future. This is not just during the first
phase, as we take off, you need a strong government, after that,
you can fly on auto-pilot. In fact, I think in the next phase, we
will need even more skilled pilots. We face important domestic challenges: sustaining
growth in a more mature economy; maintaining security in a volatile
and uncertain world; strengthening our social bonds and our racial
harmony in a society which is becoming more diverse.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-0c187253-22cc-41cf-b993-fac992594b56"><!--a--></a>Domestically, it is complex;
externally, it is challenging. We see the competition from China
and India and it is not just at the bottom. We see the fragile global
economy and that is not going to be secured within one or two years.
We see the trends in technology, eating into middle-class jobs,
white-collar jobs and we ask ourselves: how do we avoid this tsunami,
where can we find high ground to shelter and to protect our people?
None of these can be done on auto-pilot. We need a government which
will constantly be able to adapt, to respond, to seek new opportunities,
while it is addressing the challenges in front of you. And if you
want an example of a country which is on auto-pilot and when the
auto-pilot does not quite solve the problem, you look at Japan.
Very advanced country, very strong civil service, highly qualified
civil servants – many from Tokyo University, Todai, the <em class="ph i">crÃ¨me
de la crÃ¨me, </em>but with a dysfunctional political system – unable
to have a strong government with the Permanent Secretary knowing
more than the Minister
and Ministers changing frequently, sometimes within days of taking
office because they misspeak, they resign, new Minister comes along;
infinite supply but infinite confusion.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-53ff9379-499a-4ebf-8800-eb822b96aa21"><!--a--></a>And the deeper lesson of
that is that however strong your civil service, without good Ministers,
the civil service cannot act. Because governing a country is not
a matter for technocrats, it is a matter for political leaders who
will decide, who will persuade, who will carry the ground, who will
set the direction and who will make things happen. And if the Minister
cannot sell the policy, your Permanent Secretary may be first-class,
the policy cannot fly. So it is quite useful to have smart, very
good Permanent Secretaries and civil service, but to believe as
Mr Chiam See Tong used to believe that if you have a good civil
service, you do not need a good government. That is just plain wrong. </p>

we are going to find it easier to get good Ministers in future. I
think the contrary is the case. First of all, Singapore politics
is beginning more complex, more uncertain; it is not a sure ride,
it is not a career move; you can lose and even if you win, the job
of politics – persuading people, arguing with people, dealing with
the brickbrats – is a lot more complicated than before. On the other
side, there are many more exciting career opportunities available
for able and ambitious young Singaporeans here and abroad. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c094a13c-bead-47eb-9b4f-3234cc2cce13">
                  <a name="motion__id-c094a13c-bead-47eb-9b4f-3234cc2cce13"><!--a--></a>In the early 1990s, when
I was worrying about the civil service brain-drain, we were only
concerned about the civil servants going out into the private sector
in Singapore – maybe one or two will go to Hong Kong or the region.
Today, the world is your oyster. You go to an Ivy League University,
you are targeted by recruiters in your first year. You spend time
in Silicon Valley; one internship; at the end, you are good, they
make you an offer. You go to New York, Wall Street – you do not
have to go – if you are good, somebody will pass them your name,
the recruiter will come to look for you, interview you, make you
an offer. Free T-shirts are the least of the benefits they give
you. And it is tremendously exciting – round, worldwide opportunities.
It is exciting not because of the pay. It is exciting because these
are young people who think that they are going to change the world.
And when we say, "Come back, change Singapore, that is as important
and challenging", they will say, "Well, I'll think about it".</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-abe6c31f-07a5-4e6f-927d-b83278cfb1e6">
                  <a name="motion__id-abe6c31f-07a5-4e6f-927d-b83278cfb1e6"><!--a--></a>So in that situation, I
think it is going to take a lot of persuading to get young people to
give up these opportunities and enter politics, whatever Ministers
are going to get paid. And if the pay is not competitive, then there
is just another obstacle to people who have got something valuable
to add to Singapore. Grace Fu was completely right in this point
when she posted on her blog to say that this salary revision is
okay but if you go too far, I think there is going to be a problem
for many Singaporeans. She got flamed online, but she was right
and she was honest to point this out. Singapore has to maintain a
high quality of government otherwise we are going to go back down
and we are going to be a mediocre country. I have said this many
times, I think, perhaps, it has not been completely understood but
certainly it is not completely believed, but it is absolutely true.
We are different and because we are different and exceptional, therefore Singaporeans
have reaped a Singapore dividend – not something which the Minister
for Finance distributes during Budget but a Singapore dividend by
virtue of your carrying a pink IC and therefore your value in the
world has gone up. You are in demand. People want to hire you, opportunities
are opened. When you go places, your standing is there. Doors open
and people know of Singapore and people have high regard for Singapore.</p>

year in November and I met some young people from the National Youth
Council. There was a young people's gathering on the side of the
APEC meeting and we sent a delegation – seven of them, university
students, some postgraduates – bright, young, idealistic, seeing
the world almost for the first time. And one girl said to me that
she was astonished at how high Singapore's standing was, how much
respect people had for Singapore. She never realised that. I said,
"Please go home and tell your friends", because in fact, this is
an important fact and this is something which is precious and which
we must not compromise and lose. Because if people stop having that
opinion of Singapore, I think we are in trouble. So I cannot send all
our bright young students to Honolulu but I think we need to know
that while we have reasons to be dissatisfied and to want to do
better, in fact, we have not done badly, and we should be careful
not to lose what we have already gained. </p>

                  <a name="motion__id-61f62dd4-1ef1-4f05-be5c-d40ee2175e31"><!--a--></a>One important argument that
people have raised is accountability. Since Ministers are paid well,
so they have to be held accountable to perform. I would say "Yes, Ministers
have to be held accountable". But I would say the Ministers have
to be held accountable, whatever they are paid – whether you are
paid $1, whether you are paid a million dollars, whether you are
paid $10 million. You are the Minister, you are serving the people,
you have to perform to the best of your ability. We are elected
by Singaporeans. It is our duty to uphold the trust which they have
reposed in us and to serve them the best that we can. And if we
are unable to perform to their expectations, then we have to give
way to a better person, or to a better team. And as Prime Minister, my
responsibility is to ensure that individually, each Minister performs
up to expectation and collectively the Cabinet delivers the best
Government for Singapore. So my duty is to set objectives for Ministers,
assess them, hold them to account and to do this carefully and comprehensively;
to take into account, not just what the Minister does in his main portfolio,
but also his broader contributions to our overall team and to Singapore.
And it is not always possible to reduce this to a simplistic formula
or to a finite set of KPIs which you can just measure the numbers
and then calculate the bonus. Because Ministers have responsibilities
in many dimensions, often intangible ones, for example, building
the SAF and Home Team is the work of more than a generation. So
is keeping Singapore safe from terrorism.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-60711197-2eca-4a05-850d-9d6cb86f7be9">
                  <a name="motion__id-60711197-2eca-4a05-850d-9d6cb86f7be9"><!--a--></a>When a new Minister comes
in and takes over and the performance is good, it is maybe his good
work, it is maybe his predecessor's good work. We are safe today,
we have not had war for the last 30 years, but we have been preparing
the SAF, building up our security, making sure that we are safe
for longer than 30 years. So what the Minister does today is not
measured in tomorrow's output or even next year's output but in
the results – 10, 20, 30 years from now, if he is doing a good job. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1ef9831d-4594-4a6f-85fa-868d5e92781f">

providing school and university places today, but building an educational
system that prepares students to work in the economy of the future.
When will I know that our Ministers have done a good job? When today's
15 year-olds are 55 and still working 40 years from now. So if we
talk about deferred bonus, I would have to defer Heng Swee Keat's
bonus for 40 years.</p>

Building public housing. Yes, everybody knows how to count: how
many HDB flats are completed last year. But also planning the city, conceiving
a new Marina Bay, creating green corridors and spaces all over Singapore. You
put that into a KPI? So many kilometres, so many new Marina Bays,
so many new IRs – cannot be done.</p>

what the Prime Minister tells him to do. A good and entrepreneurial
Minister expands the scope of his responsibilities, imagines things
which he could do and embarks on projects which nobody asks him
to, but which turn out to be good ideas and deliver outstanding
results for Singapore. So, it is not possible to have a preset formula
to determine the performance bonus. The national bonus, yes, and
that is about half of it. That is about the same size as the performance bonus.
That you can measure – GDP, median income, 20th percentile income, unemployment.
For these, the Department of Statistics can churn out the numbers.
But the Minister's responsibility, his core responsibility as well
as his broader responsibility and contributions, that cannot be
reduced to a formula.</p>

I have to make after consulting my senior colleagues and to decide
who has made the greater contributions, who has been the more effective Minister.
Not every Minister is equal. The Ministers know it, the public knows
it. And we have our own relative assessments, the public have their
own relative assessments and sometimes the public is not shy to
tell us what they think. They may or may not be right, but different
Ministers have different contributions, in terms of their responsibilities,
in terms of their abilities, in terms of their judgement and the
ability to work in a crisis. Therefore, the Ministers need to be
at different grades and be paid different performance bonuses. But
they are all part of one team, and each one has a contribution to
make so that the team as a whole functions well. I have to decide
the Ministers' performance bonuses and grades.</p>

showing you what the Ministers' grades are currently: Two Deputy
Prime Ministers, one Minister on MR3, 10 Ministers on MR4 and I
also give the grades for the Ministers of State and the Parliamentary
Secretaries. So, presently, nearly all the Ministers are on MR4
because the Cabinet is still new, it is really in transition, still settling
in. But I expect in the steady state, to promote more Ministers
to the higher grades and to build a strong team which will comprise
three tiers of Ministers across the different grades in Cabinet:
The newer Ministers who are being developed for heavier responsibilities
in future, the more experienced Ministers overseeing major Ministries or
areas of work and then the senior Ministers, I do not mean senior
Ministers as a title but Ministers who are more senior, who help
me coordinate more than one Ministry and oversee whole-of-Government
issues. So, there will be a hierarchy, but, together, we are a team.
And the Ministers who do well will get heavier responsibilities
and may get promoted.</p>

evaluate the Ministers fairly. And they have to take into account
both the contributions and the shortcomings, and you have to look
at it objectively and holistically because quite often, contributions
may be silent. But when something goes wrong, it goes wrong with
a bang. We must try to keep that perspective.</p>

then, of course, they must take responsibility and put things right.
We cannot expect the Ministers to never make mistakes or never to
have mistakes happen on their watch in their Ministries. It is not
possible, this is a very big organisation and it is a very complicated
world and with the best intent in the world, from time to time,
things will go wrong. And when things go wrong, you have to put them
right. And if it is your responsibility, you have done it wrong,
then you apologise and you answer for it.</p>

then, of course, he has to be sacked. I have not had to do that,
but if a Minister does not perform well despite all his best efforts,
then I may move him to a less demanding portfolio where he is able
to perform or, if necessary, I may have to phase him out discreetly.
It is not always visible, but it is necessary to do and it is necessary
to understand why not everything can be done in the full glare of
the spotlights.</p>

time to time, not every person who comes into Government will succeed
as a Minister. It is a difficult job. You never know until you are in
it whether it will work or it will not work, and sometimes you have
to give it a try. I can make two types of mistakes. I can put in
somebody and it did not work, or I may decide I do not want to try
somebody and he could have been a good Minister. So I think I have to
accept that when people come in to be Ministers, sometimes it does
not work out, in which case I need a graceful way to disengage and
part amicably.</p>

changes, and we have to do this with the Ministers too. I hope Singaporeans
understand this.</p>

is not individual Ministers. The accountability is the Cabinet,
collectively responsible for what we have decided and what the Government does.
All Ministers are collectively responsible for the Cabinet decisions,
whether it is building houses, whether it is building train lines,
whether it is setting taxes, whether it is setting immigration policies.
That is the doctrine. It is a collective responsibility. All Ministers
are party to this and all Ministers are held to account ultimately
when next we go to General Elections (GE) and the public is the
final judge of the Government's record. I hope that when we go to
elections, we will have a good record and the voters will assess
the Government fairly, based on overall results for the whole term.
That is how a democratic system has to work, and to work well, it
depends on the Government performing well and it depends on the
electorate making the right judgements.</p>

Review Committee headed Mr Gerard Ee, I have only two major points
to make. My priority in Parliament remains to be on sustainable
economic growth and healthcare costs. My remarks in Parliament,
including this statement, are ultimately geared towards speaking
up for Singaporeans in these areas. My first point relates to the
formula of pegging the Ministers' base pay to 60% of the median
income of the top 1,000 Singaporean income earners. Mathematically,
it is not clear how the salaries will go from here. Yes, this is
a huge cut from now but there is a possibility that the new formula
may even result in a higher base pay than what the old formula could provide
on a long-term basis. There are many ways that the median pay for
the top 1,000 earners can rise substantially in the next five years.
Wealthy foreign business people could be given Singaporean citizenship <em class="ph i">en
masse</em>. It could even be that the median pay for this group will
rise much faster than the median of the top 48 earners. But for
me to form a more accurate opinion, I would need to see how the
old and the new formulas will apply to the period from the year
2000 to 2010 on a back-dated basis. To do so, the Government would
have to provide us with these figures. More importantly, are the figures
for the Ministers' bonuses as paid out each year according to the
old and new formulas. If the Government and the Review Committee
are truly serious about promoting a clean wage approach for Singapore
Ministers, without additional perks and allowances, then they must
follow through with a spirit of that approach. All this data on salaries
and the specific amount of bonuses paid out each year must be published
and made transparent for public scrutiny. To-date I believe such
data is never released. In the UK, the Freedom of Information Act
allowed for the release of details of MPs' expenses claimed for
the British public in the year 2009. If we in Singapore want to
talk about clean wages, let us all go the way: Publish the bonuses
paid out every year. Mr Speaker, if the Government does not wish
to follow the practices of Ministerial pay in other countries, may
I remind that hon. Members of this House at least show some respect
for our friends and neighbours and how they decided to remunerate
their leaders in their own countries. Let us show some humility.
We should not be telling them how to run their countries. There
is no need to jeopardise our relationship with them. </p>

                  <a name="motion__id-1fe8d44d-21a7-4bed-adbb-abc52c8b1ad8"><!--a--></a>My second point, in my opinion,
is even more important for the good of Singapore. Ministerial pay
should be primarily driven according to KPIs that are specific to
their Ministerial portfolio. Each Ministry should create a set of
KPIs for the Minister and the Minister's pay is to be objectively
decided by a formula that is Ministry-specific. As a guide, the
KPIs for the Permanent Secretary of the relevant Ministry as the
most senior civil servant should be taken into account. Yes, I know
that there is a performance bonus component which is rewarded based
on the individual performance of Ministers. But it is not clear
what the criteria are in attaining this performance bonus. The Review Committee's report
says that the performance bonus' quantum will be reduced substantially.
I am not sure whether the bonus formulas are well structured to
drive Ministers towards fulfilling their portfolio's KPIs and for
the purpose of accountability. The Committee recommended formula
for the national bonus may be an improvement on the old GDP bonus
formula. But it is still too broad. Some cynics have even speculated
that the recommendation for the old formula to be changed has come
at a time when Singapore's GDP growth will be slowing down. For
example, the Minister for Trade and Industry's KPI for all his bonuses
could be Singapore's wage growth. The Minister for Transport's KPI
could be tied with the Minister for National Development's KPI to
control population growth and thereby vehicle numbers.</p>

will give me discomfort. For example, our transport system might
be in disarray or a major terrorist might escape from prison but
the Minsters responsible for these incidents may still collect a
full national bonus, just because the economy has done well through
the good work of other Ministers like the Minister for Finance and
the Minister for Trade and Industry.</p>

for Singapore and that brings me to the overarching point. If the
Government's decision is still to match Ministerial pay to the top
earners of the private sector, then their accountability measures
and KPIs must also match the rigour of the public sector.</p>

the junior Ministers' new recommended starting salary of about $1.1
million per annum, bonuses included. Mr Chiam See Tong once worked
out what Ministerial pay should be, in order that the Ministers
will still be able to enjoy a comfortable lifestyle with hardly
any financial sacrifices. He calculated that the figure would be
$50,000 per month, taking into account the mortgage and cost of
a bungalow, or whatever residence, the hiring of servants, two cars,
annual holidays and the children's education. This proposal was
also supported by the then NMP Prof Walter Woon. At today's levels,
the figure would be about $60,000 per month or $720,000 per year.
That amount including bonuses would be a good benchmark to prove
their worth for a young Minister with a young family. Moreover,
they still have their MPs' allowances of $192,500 to top it up.
This represents an approach that can be explained to Singaporeans
and be accepted by them. For some of the new Ministers, this new salary
could be much more than their last drawn salary. Moreover, there
is no risk factor in the job like, for example, what the stockbrokers
face. </p>

first generation of Ministers have set up the Government apparatus

with their job and even enjoy the support of a credible and efficient
civil service. Distinguished senior servants like Mr Ngiam Tong
Dow had also played a major role in building our country.</p>

elected the MP for Potong Pasir back in 1984, people were afraid
of associating themselves with him. His law firm began to suffer
from a loss of business. He was ridiculed and mocked by various
people for his involvement in politics. He was even at the receiving
end of such comments from judges when he was simply doing his work
in the Courts defending clients. But he never thought these as sacrifices
throughout the years. He took it all in his stride. He saw it as
part and parcel of his mission to fight for a democratic Singapore

leader entails. The spirit of public service is a calling, an honour,

that the Prime Minister's mandate for Mr Gerard Ee's Committee was
bound to comparing Ministerial salaries to private sector salaries
through the terms of reference. So that conclusion was already set
before the Committee met, unfortunately. The Singapore People's

                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
Sir, our Prime Minister was right. He would not be the last one
to speak on the issue, but how I wish he had been the last one.
Our Prime Minister has explained very well the rationale and intent
on the approach taken with regard to Ministerial salary. The independent
Ministerial Salary Review Committee, headed by Mr Gerard Ee, has
conducted a thorough review and made many recommendations.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d0a5dcf1-fec7-4a70-a315-1527024fdfcd">
                  <a name="motion__id-d0a5dcf1-fec7-4a70-a315-1527024fdfcd"><!--a--></a>Overall, I am in support
of the recommendations but would like to suggest a minor tweak.
Sir, I would like to focus on one significant recommendation which
is the replacement of the GDP Bonus with the National Bonus. I support
the recommendation to remove the GDP Bonus. Pegging the bonus of
political office holders to the GDP has its inadequacies as the
impact of national economic growth may not be equally shared across
the board. The National Bonus is a more inclusive measure of how
economic growth impacts Singaporeans, especially low- and middle-income
Singaporeans. It moves away from merely taking GDP growth as an
absolute and looking at it in a more holistic manner as the growth
itself does not mean that everyone is better off as a result of
it or has higher salaries. </p>

to propose that the indicator involving the real growth rate of
the wages of the lowest percentile of Singapore citizens be given
a higher weightage of about 40% to give greater emphasis on the
importance of increasing the wages of this group of workers. Should
this indicator be given 40%, the other three indicators should be
given an equal weightage of 20% each. This is important as it will
signal a greater need for emphasis to be placed on increasing the
income of those at the 20th percentile of working Singaporeans as
these people are the ones most in need of income growth. In fact,
statistics have shown that incomes of those in the lower end of
the strata have stagnated or seen very little growth over the last
decade, even as our economy continued to prosper. </p>

like our Government to send a clear signal that we are a caring
Government which places low-wage workers as one of our top priorities.
I acknowledge that our Government has tried through many ways to
improve the lot of low-income workers, for example, through schemes
like the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS). But more can be done
by Government agencies and statutory boards to have a more systemic
impact on raising the real income for low-wage workers.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-dd09bcda-d776-44a4-ad8f-4daddd3f1508"><!--a--></a>We are aware that there
are inflationary economic pressures and structural changes in business
practices such as the practice of outsourcing and employing cheaper
foreign workers that
resulted in the real income of low-wage workers declining. Outsourcing practices
for some jobs usually result in workers having low salaries and
very limited employment rights such as they are placed on contracts.
Sometimes, workers, especially in jobs like cleaning, securities
and landscaping, work in the same place but keep having to change
their employers as contracts are renewed. There have been cases where,
due to a change in contracts, workers earn less doing the same job
because the company or organisation had chosen a lower quote. Many
of them do not enjoy any annual increment, or Annual Wage Supplement,
or more commonly known as the 13th month bonus. </p>

weightage for this component of the National Bonus will result in
a mindset change amongst our policy makers to take cognisance of
the impact on low-wage workers in formulating and implementing national
or Government policies. For a start, I think it is imperative that
all Government Ministries, agencies and statutory boards review
their outsourcing practices to ensure that they do not contribute to
the plight of low-wage workers that I have described earlier.</p>

speech, I called for the drive towards achieving sustained real
wage growth for low-wage workers to be a Key Performance Indicator
for every Ministry, Government agency, statutory board and social
enterprise. We must do this as a shared national initiative to help
our fellow Singaporeans. Increasing the weightage for real income
growth for low-wage workers may tilt the balance of any policy impact
in favour of this group of workers. I feel for the plight of these
workers and we must show that our concern for this group of workers
exceeds the others as low-income workers are the most vulnerable
in our economy. This 40-20-20 formula I suggested might be the little
push needed to get more attention being focused on the plight of
low-wage workers. Mr Speaker, Sir, please allow me to address this
issue in Malay.</p>

have been raised on using various formulas that can be used or different
criteria to determine Ministerial salaries. The issue of Ministerial salaries
is not just about figures or formulas but an emotive issue which
is difficult to address fully. In any case, the Committee's recommendations

debate on this topic will not end. </p>

in politics should not be based on money but the reality is that
we want to attract the best talent. Not everyone is prepared to
take such a big pay cut. If the salary is set too low, it will limit
the number of talented individuals who will consider the offer to
enter politics.</p>

allow me to conclude in English. Sir, with the salaries that we
are according to our political leaders, what our political office
bearers must do is to make sure that the outcomes of their work
are of the highest standards possible. We must continue to do good
work that will benefit all Singaporeans and in particular, make
sure that those who are at the bottom rungs of our society move
along and benefit from the country's progress. Our leaders must

to Singapore and that while we prosper, we will look after the needs
of the most vulnerable in our society and help them as much as we

not endorse the White Paper on Salaries for a Capable and Committed
Government. We reject the White Paper as the basis for the setting
of salaries of political appointment holders because we are of the
view that the formula used to derive the benchmark for Ministerial
salaries is flawed. The basis of setting salaries benchmark based
on the top 1,000 private sector income earners is unsound. The outcome
of this formula based on the salary benchmark could potentially

monthly payout between the WP and the White Paper's positions may
seem to differ little at this point of time. Yet it is a well-known
fact that the top earners' rate of income will rise faster than
that of ordinary Singaporeans, over time. Even though the entry
level benchmark for the MR4 is $55,000 now, if it is pegged to the top
1,000 earners, we have estimated that it will increase by 51% by
2020. Under our WP's formula, our estimate is that the rate of increase
will be about 41%, a more modest rate.</p>

recommended maximum bonus is 13.5 months, whereas for the WP, we
recommend not more than 5.5 months. This means in a typical bonus
scenario, the Committee's proposed pay cut benchmarked against 2010
levels for MP, an entry grade Minister and the Prime Minister would
be just 3%, 31% and 28% respectively. WP's proposed cuts would have
been more substantial at 28%, 46% and 50% respectively. In a maximum
bonus scenario, the Committee's proposed pay cut benchmarked against
2010 levels for MP, an entry grade Minister and the Prime Minister would
be merely 3%, 8% and 5% respectively. Compare this to WP's proposed
cuts which would have been consistently substantial at 28%, 37%
and 42% respectively. The WP's proposed cuts in the MP's allowance
and Ministerial salaries would result in savings of about $21 million
in a conservative estimate of the typical bonus scenario. The savings could then
be redirected to fund aids to our needy and elderly. Mr Speaker, Sir,

colleagues from the Workers' Party have elaborated on the Party's
view of the Political Salaries Review Committee Report and given
our suggestions. They have also explained in detail their formula
for calculating ministerial salaries and other details.</p>

principles that the Government should apply when deciding on political
salaries, and how they should be accountable to the people. I will
also give suggestions on what kind of salary review mechanism should
be put in place and how it can be scrutinised by Parliament, to
ensure that the Government continue to be accountable to the people
when they decide on political salaries in future.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-0c5b223d-ba7b-4b27-a9ee-feb11e80802e"><!--a--></a>We all know that Singapore's
political system is modelled after the Westminster system of government.
The Salary Review Committee Report also mentioned that under the
Westminster system of government, Ministers under the administrative
system will not only be paid a salary, but also allowances granted
to Members of Parliament. Under the Westminster system, the judiciary,
legislative and administrative bodies, that is, the government,
are independent of each other. The legislative powers of the Parliament
is the country's highest authority. In other words, motions and
policies drawn up by Ministers under the administrative body, have
to be discussed and passed by the legislative body – the Parliament
– before a decision is made.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b46c665f-622a-4d6b-ab2c-d8bb6362b1c7">
                  <a name="motion__id-b46c665f-622a-4d6b-ab2c-d8bb6362b1c7"><!--a--></a>We also understand that
Members of Parliament are representatives voted in by voters of
various constituencies. Once given the mandate, we have to be accountable
to the people. The structure of the legislative body of Singapore
is different from that of many countries, we do not have an upper
house to act as an additional check and balance. All members of
the administrative body come from the legislative body. The Ministers
and the Prime Minister becomes a Member of Parliament first, before
being made a Minister. Therefore, I believe that our legislative
body should act as a check and balance against the Government administration.
In his speech during the 12th Session of Parliament debate on the
President's Address, the Prime Minister said that "the Government
is accountable to the Parliament, we welcome Members of Parliament
to raise any sharp questions, and debate them in Parliament".</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-30dbb47a-5271-4978-ae48-80da9263b6e2">

the transparency of the Government is also important. In order to
have rational debates and an effective system of public accountability,
information must be made public. Hence, disclosing the salaries
of political leaders should be considered a reasonable request.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e874c5b7-ebc1-48f9-aae4-64965a54d160">
                  <a name="motion__id-e874c5b7-ebc1-48f9-aae4-64965a54d160"><!--a--></a>
                  <span class="ph hcInline hcLang">(<em class="ph i">In English</em>): </span>Mr Speaker, Sir,
I will continue my speech in English. This is especially so given
that the taxpayer pays for the salaries of our political leaders.
Therefore, how much they are paid and the process of how their pay
is determined has to be open, transparent, and accessible to the
general public. Members throughout the course of this debate also
brought up these principles. Indeed the Committee's report also mentioned
on many occasions that transparency and accountability to the public
was key in their determination of political compensation. This was
also the guiding principle under which the Committee recommended
a clean wage.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-74e13a03-a3ca-4f65-93b9-8e87c6f75434">
                  <a name="motion__id-74e13a03-a3ca-4f65-93b9-8e87c6f75434"><!--a--></a>These principles are in
line with practices common to the dozen countries and territories
in our survey that my colleagues have already mentioned. Only with transparency and meaningful
information available can Singaporeans be, and remain, convinced
that changes to the pay of our political leaders are not undertaken
solely to advance their material interests, and any changes must
first be and always should remain respectful of the costs borne
by taxpayers.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 979</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c51a9382-01a1-4bcd-9f3a-203ba096691c">
                  <a name="motion__id-c51a9382-01a1-4bcd-9f3a-203ba096691c"><!--a--></a>Therefore, we have three
proposals to ensure that the twin towers of accountability and transparency
are enhanced in the political compensation process. First, we call
for an independent commission to be appointed each time the Prime
Minister seeks to change the terms by which compensation is determined.
Second, that the findings of the independent commission be always
made subject to debate and also approval by the Legislature. Third,
a complete list of political salaries should be published on an
annual basis.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ab87fe2d-b195-4813-950c-ad93d231c7db">
                  <a name="motion__id-ab87fe2d-b195-4813-950c-ad93d231c7db"><!--a--></a>Taking each point in turn,
we note that the Committee has recommended that an independent committee
should be formed every five years to review the salary framework.
The Prime Minister would determine the members of the committee.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-52e6593c-aa57-4a9a-a1c7-d4d4711f7e38">
                  <a name="motion__id-52e6593c-aa57-4a9a-a1c7-d4d4711f7e38"><!--a--></a>We would like to see this
taken one step further. We think that it is important that an independent
– by which I mean non-partisan – commission free from executive
direction be appointed each time any changes to the formula for
political compensation is sought by the Prime Minister. This is
in line with practices in many jurisdictions. I will return to a
detailed analysis of the practices in some of these countries later.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-599a2ffd-c627-4c8c-97ab-0cbc08ee1be9">
                  <a name="motion__id-599a2ffd-c627-4c8c-97ab-0cbc08ee1be9"><!--a--></a>It is also not enough that
such a committee is formed each time changes are proposed. The committee
must be accountable to and take directions from Parliament. To respond
to Mr Vikram Nair's point on Workers' Party's contributions to this
debate, I would like to reiterate that "all roads lead to Parliament",
and this is most true here. The principle of Parliament sovereignty
is of utmost importance: the report should be published to Parliament
and thus to the public – not first for the Prime Minister's eyes only,
and certainly not first to a ruling-party caucus.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8092536f-dfd2-49f3-a9ef-8be92625dce0">
                  <a name="motion__id-8092536f-dfd2-49f3-a9ef-8be92625dce0"><!--a--></a>The findings of the independent
commission must each time be subject to debate, modification and
approval by Parliament. As the Committee mentioned a Westminster system,
we should take a look at some of the systems that evolved from a
Westminster system of Parliament.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-bd4d7fb8-11fc-46fa-83e1-1bc76a2eb60b">
                  <a name="motion__id-bd4d7fb8-11fc-46fa-83e1-1bc76a2eb60b"><!--a--></a>In Australia, there is an
independent Remuneration Tribunal which has three members appointed
by the Governor-General. Its determinations are subject to Parliamentary
oversight. In Canada, a commission to review the salaries of Parliamentarians
is formed within two months after each general election. The report
of the Commission must be published within six months of its formation,
and the report must be tabled in Parliament for debate and approval.
Finally, in the UK itself, in response to our Prime Minister, while
it is true that a widespread abuse of expenses by MPs was uncovered
in 2009, like all good leaders, politicians in the UK learnt lessons
and sought to improve. The Parliamentary Standards Act 2009 was
passed by the Westminster Parliament to reform the way MP expenses
were dealt with, and to increase the transparency and accountability
of the process in order to ensure that such an issue would not recur
in the future. There is also a Senior Salary Review Board, which
is an independent body that advises on the pay and benefits due
to politicians. Because all of this is regulated by statute, Parliament
ultimately retains oversight.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 980</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-db18bf31-e23c-407f-bb8a-b8113c2724a5">
                  <a name="motion__id-db18bf31-e23c-407f-bb8a-b8113c2724a5"><!--a--></a>We propose that all reports from the committee
should always be open to public scrutiny via the legislative process.
Citizens can give their thoughts and feedback on it to their MPs,
who are their elected representatives. Such public scrutiny would
increase transparency and enhance public trust in the procedural
rigour of determining political pay. It would also reinforce the
position of the Legislature as the one of the gatekeepers for the
nation's finances. I would also like to emphasise that seeking public
feedback before the report is published is not the same as subjecting
the report to public scrutiny via the legislative process before
it is debated, amended if necessary, and finally approved by Parliament.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c13d19bc-fd19-4390-b755-7b71c8e8c4f4">
                  <a name="motion__id-c13d19bc-fd19-4390-b755-7b71c8e8c4f4"><!--a--></a>Finally, I would like to
bring us back to the Committee's proposal that we maintain a "clean
wage" for political salaries in Singapore, particularly to ensure
transparency and accountability to the public. My colleagues have
already spoken on how we think that a whole-of-government approach
should be taken when determining a set of goals and bonuses for
our political leaders. I will instead focus on the criteria to which
we think transparency should be upheld.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-22f6eab3-2a37-4724-8801-40656e4120e1">
                  <a name="motion__id-22f6eab3-2a37-4724-8801-40656e4120e1"><!--a--></a>We note the list of salaries
published in the report, and it is a step in the right direction.
Our proposal is, however, that a list of political salaries should
be published on an annual basis in the Government <em class="ph i">Gazette</em> and/or
on the Parliamentary website. There should also be a disclosure
of the amounts of national bonuses paid to office-bearers. The list
should also clearly state which categories the national bonuses
relate to. This will be in line with the "clean wage" principle.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-dd07b51a-b1ba-4841-b02a-5bbb743ee9c9">
                  <a name="motion__id-dd07b51a-b1ba-4841-b02a-5bbb743ee9c9"><!--a--></a>Coming back to the three
Westminster countries I spoke of before, all three publish detailed
lists relating to political pay. While it is true that each country
has a different system of remuneration, with a series of allowances
and expenses, we are still able to find a common thread running
through these systems. That is, a thread of transparency.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c7e42c54-ca49-4fdf-a957-aa72bf889593">
                  <a name="motion__id-c7e42c54-ca49-4fdf-a957-aa72bf889593"><!--a--></a>In Canada, one is able to
easily retrieve information sorted by year on the amount of compensation
each office-bearer is paid. Car, rent and other forms of salary
and allowances are clearly laid out in one website. For Australia,
this information is available from the Remuneration Tribunal's website.
A series of annual reports from the Tribunal lay out the salaries,
allowances and entitlements of each MP and office-holder. The UK has
in the last couple of years increased the scrutiny and transparency
standards in relation to political pay. A full list of salaries
and allowances for all office holders is available on the UK Parliament's
website. The UK Parliament also recently set up a new independent
body €” the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority – to ensure that
there is rigorous regulation of and oversight over MP's expenses.
With a few mouse-clicks, a complete list of all expenses claimed
for each individual MP is downloadable from the website. Expenses
are published on a bi-monthly basis.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-dee01527-d7d8-4456-8255-63478fdd78d1">
                  <a name="motion__id-dee01527-d7d8-4456-8255-63478fdd78d1"><!--a--></a>Regardless of how the compensation
of political leaders is determined by these countries, the bottom-line
is that we have stringent disclosure rules relating to the use of
taxpayer funds relating to the compensation of political leaders.
It is this level of transparency that we are holding up to be the
gold international standard. It should be the standard to which
Singapore should hold itself up against.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b0e6a4f1-d080-449d-999c-dbf72d1a7d6d">

are manifold. First, it would help to ensure that misleading, speculative
information is not circulated in the public domain about how much
our leaders are paid. Second, this will keep lawmakers accountable
to the electorate in respect of their compensation throughout their
entire five-year term in office,
not just at the ballot box. Third, an annual publication of salaries
with disclosable national bonuses will allow Singaporeans to be
able to see in the "then-and-now" how their leaders have performed
and how the pay of their leaders is tied to the fortunes of the
nation.</p>

this debate, we have heard several Members draw comparisons with
other countries, which may not score very highly in terms of transparency
and accountability of their political systems. Instead of using
these countries as examples of how Singapore is different, is exceptional
or is better than them, I think that we should instead be focusing
on learning from them. We should use their experience and add to
it the rigorous standards from well-governed jurisdictions in our
quest to ensure our system is robustly and proportionately answerable
to our people.</p>

that we have a well-informed, intelligent electorate whom I trust
will be able to draw their own sensible conclusions from meaningful
data made available to them. Singaporeans are not clamouring to
know how much the net worth of politicians is, but instead their
chief motivation is to ensure that their wages are both fair and
commensurate with the performance of their Government. And Singaporeans
have a right to know how their leaders are being compensated €” and rewarded
€” out of taxpayer monies. We in this House must have faith in our
people that if we follow the proposals above to improve transparency
of political pay, we will come out stronger for it as a nation.</p>

all in agreement that lawmakers should have a strong sense of responsibility,
accountability and service towards all Singaporeans, and should

now, I understand that the Workers' Party has no quarrel with the
Committee's starting salary of $46,750. In fact, its own starting
salary is $55,000. So, am I right to say that your main quarrel
now is that over the next five years, the benchmark for the salaries
used by the Committee will rise by 50%, whereas your benchmark will
rise by 41%? Is that the main concern? That is the first question.
Is that a yes?</p>

one was the bonus, which I think we addressed earlier. Okay. My
second question is this: I have done the sums. If we look at the
salary of $55,000 that you have proposed, a rise of 41% on that
will arrive at salary of $77,550 a month. A rise of 50% on the sum of $46,750
will arrive at $70,125. So in fact, even if you accept that the
Committee's benchmark will rise by 50%, and the Workers' Party will have
its benchmark rise by 41% over the next five years, the point is
that over the next five years, the salaries proposed by the Committee
will still be less than the Workers' Party's base salary. Do you
agree with that?</p>

arrive at in nine years will be, say, $77, 500 as a base salary
from the Workers' Party's calculation, whereas it would be $70,125
on the Committee's. Even if we accept your rate of rise, which I
do not necessarily accept because I do not have the basis for it.
But even if we accept that, the Workers' Party's position is that
the Ministers' salaries will be higher over the next nine years,
based on your own proposal. </p>

1,000 Singapore earners. The Salary Review Committee was given the
terms of reference by the Prime Minister to "take into account salaries
of comparable jobs in the private sector and also other reference
points such as the general wage levels in Singapore".</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f11d6139-903b-44d1-8dea-a233e2c00d56">
                  <a name="motion__id-f11d6139-903b-44d1-8dea-a233e2c00d56"><!--a--></a>The assumption this Government
began with is that political talent is synonymous with career success;
that office holders must have comparable pay with top private sector
earners. So the Committee arrived at the median income of the top
1,000 earners, less a 40% discount to "signify the ethos and sacrifice
that comes with political service". It implies that our political
office holders must come from this pool, or that their ability and
job scope is equivalent to the top 0.06% of the working Singapore
population. This sentiment has indeed been expressed by the Deputy
Prime Minister and by various Members over the past two days.</p>

this mindset since 1994, when Ministers' pay was first revamped
to tie it to the top earners' in the private sector. While the Committee's
new formula is better than that of the previous one which had been
narrowly tied with only the top eight earners in six professions,
it is nevertheless still an elitist thinking that only those who
are top in their professional careers can make it to hold political
office.</p>

different from being able to run a country. Perhaps this Government
has treated running this country too much like running a business
that we have often been referred to as Singapore Inc. So we also
tie political work to that of running a very big company. I believe
this is a flawed model.</p>

message since 1994, we have created an expectation amongst potential
political office holders that political office is a career progression
for them, and that reaching a Minister's position is like reaching
the pinnacle of one's career. It creates an expectation amongst
potential office holders that they need a safe route to parachute
into Parliament or they would not risk their career. This has made Singapore
politics uniquely Singapore. It is a model of politics that despite
years of attempts to justify and fine-tune, many have yet to accept.
I for one, do not accept this model.</p>

the nature of running this country. We need to constantly remind
ourselves that we have been elected by the people into this House.
It is totally different
from being headhunted to be a hired top management of a company. We
should never forget it is a noble calling to serve the public.</p>

aspires a person to take the difficult route of politics? Four years
ago, I read with interest about how President Obama as a young student
in an Indonesian school, stated that his ambition was to be the

such an aspiration?</p>

post-independent Singapore, I have been influenced by several of
our first generation leaders whom I had clearly seen have made great sacrifices

become Ministers and to be the future Prime Minister of Singapore.
I certainly hope it will not be for career progression.</p>

concern that Singapore needs good and high ability people to be
able to protect what we have. Now, we have often heard that Singapore does
not have enough for two teams. I do not agree with this thinking.
I have more confidence in our people. During the debate on the President's
Address, I had called for political education in schools. It is
to strengthen the knowledge of our youths in the functioning of
Parliament and of the Government. I believe it is important to instil
this sense of public service and political awareness in our youths
to give them a better understanding of issues important to our country.
We should aim to create aspiring future politicians who will believe
strongly in the importance of leading the nation, and that they
wish to play a part in it.</p>

have constantly looked for political talent from amongst a narrow
pool of top career performers that has perpetuated lack of interest

pond for people that fit as career elites. We should instead talent
flood with people from all walks of life.</p>

describes the 40% discount as a sacrifice for political service.
I personally do not like the word "sacrifice", a term that has been
used by various Members throughout the past two days. Being a politician
should be an aspiration and an honour. It is the nature of politics
all over the world that there will be public scrutiny; there will
be challenges balancing family and work; there will be setbacks
such as loss in the electoral votes. The reluctant will deem these
as sacrifices. Those who aspire to lead will welcome these as challenges
to be overcome. Singaporeans do not expect politicians to lead a
spartan life with a religious calling. I believe Singapore politics
has been more than fair to our political office holders for the
past two decades. Even with the levels proposed by the Workers'
Party, the political office holders can lead very dignified lives.</p>

former US and UK and other political leaders earning a lot after
retirement. I think life has been fair to our retiring political
leaders as well. We see that retiring Ministers are sought after
by our Government-linked companies and some by multinationals. I
believe the experience they have gained while in office have also increased
their market value. Some Members have said that the Workers' Party's proposal
supports the level of salaries proposed by the Committee, just because
we happen to arrive
at roughly the same basic monthly salary for an entry level Minister. The
differences are several but important.</p>

the allowance for a Member of Parliament because, firstly, a Minister
is a Member of Parliament. It is a reminder that we are elected
by the people, not selected by a powerful committee to become Ministers.
Secondly, the base salary for entry-grade senior civil servants
at MX9 grade in less subjected to fluctuation compared with incomes
at the 500th and 501st top income earners, which is the median of
the top 1,000 earners. Over time, by comparing with the top, we
could again see the salaries of Ministers rising faster than are
acceptable to Singaporeans, as my colleague Mr Yaw has shared earlier.
Thirdly, we oppose the huge bonus payout. Again, I would like to
say that while we like Singapore to be well run, Singapore is not
just a very big company.</p>

the Prime Minister for acknowledging that the Workers' Party's pay
formula works out to be less than what the Committee has proposed.
I believe Mr Vikram Nair and Mdm Halimah Yacob could check with
the Prime Minister on how he arrived at the calculations. In our
computation, the benchmark point annual salary for an entry level
Minister with 13th-month bonus and an average 2.5 months bonus is
$852,500, compared with $1.1 million as recommended by the Committee.
This is a 46% cut from the 2010 annual pay. Furthermore, a portion
of the bonus is deferred into a bonus bank. Under our proposal,
the Prime Minister with the 13th month bonus and 2.5 months bonus
will receive $1,534,500, compared with the recommended $2.2 million.
This is a 50% cut from the 2010 annual pay.</p>

just like to address a point that Mr Vikram Nair has brought up.
He seems to have harped twice on what we have contributed to Mr
Gerard Ee's Committee. My colleague, Mr Gerald Giam has already
shared that he has met with the Committee and he has given me permission
to share that he has spent more than two hours with the Committee.
Now, I wonder how many hours did Mr Vikram Nair spend with the Committee.
During the discussion, Mr Gerald Giam shared many of the principles
that are in the current Workers' Party proposal including deferred
bonus, KPIs, our benchmarking practices and so on. Now, we do not
feel that we have to give everything to the Committee and this is
precisely what the Parliament is here for. The Parliament is the
place where we will debate the whole proposal. I am not sure if
Mr Vikram Nair expects that we are here to just "rubber stamp" the
proposal. We are here to debate the proposal and, according to his
speech, he said that if we are to oppose, then we are supporting
the previous pay level. I believe Parliament is where we come up
with another proposal to be decided upon.</p>

levels that we have proposed are not the same as that of the Review
Committee. More fundamentally, we object to the principles used

oppose the motion.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr
Lim Biow Chuan</strong>
                  </span>: Sir, the report from the Ministerial
Salary Review Committee led by Mr Gerard Ee emphasised three important
principles. First is that salaries must be competitive so that people
of the right calibre are not deterred from stepping forward to lead
the country. The second, political service ethos entails making
sacrifices and hence they should be a discount in the pay formula
and, third, there should be a clean wage with no hidden perks. The
report also recommended a new benchmark with various cuts to the
salaries of the President, Prime Minister, Ministers, Speaker, Deputy
Speakers, political appointment holders plus cuts to the MPs' allowances.
The salary of an entry level Minister was benchmarked to the median
income of the top 1,000 earners who are Singapore citizens. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b44b15d9-6333-4ffd-944a-65217c3ad631">
                  <a name="motion__id-b44b15d9-6333-4ffd-944a-65217c3ad631"><!--a--></a>The first question before
this House is whether the three principles for determining Ministerial
salaries are a suitable basis for determining the salaries of our
political leaders. If the answer is "yes", then we go on to discuss
how best to implement these three principles. Sir, I agree and support
these three principles. In the debate on civil servants' salary
back in April 2007, I took the position that Singapore should pay
our Ministers and senior civil servants competitively, otherwise
we risk the situation where you have a poor quality and incompetent
government and possibly corruption. I also called on the Government
to look for a formula to compensate our Ministers and civil servants
well and yet allow our citizens to appreciate the sacrifices that
our leaders are making. In other words, we need to strike a fair
balance such that the Government does not pay million-dollar salaries
to the Ministers, which is politically difficult to accept for any
citizen.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-76e2aa1d-008c-4a52-9c0b-71207e3c2c63">
                  <a name="motion__id-76e2aa1d-008c-4a52-9c0b-71207e3c2c63"><!--a--></a>Like several other speakers
before me, I believe that politics is a calling. It is a calling to
serve the country without the usual motivation of high financial
returns. It is a calling that requires a person to put the country
above self. Sir, I agree with the hon. Member for Aljunied GRC,
Mr Chen Show Mao, that it is indeed a privilege to be called upon
to serve country. In fact, this point was also raised in the report
of the Committee. I am certain that all Members in this House are
also serving because they feel the call to serve, the call and the
need to make positive difference in the lives of fellow Singaporeans
and not that there is a high salary or allowance to be paid to them. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-63c33d2e-8ca0-4aa3-bc99-afed20376263">
                  <a name="motion__id-63c33d2e-8ca0-4aa3-bc99-afed20376263"><!--a--></a>I submit that one of the
political objectives of any government would be to promote unity
and common bonding amongst its citizens. By paying our political
leaders too high, the Government may inadvertently have caused unhappiness
and division amongst its citizens. So I believe it will be a right
step for us to consider revision of the salaries so as not to cause
division amongst our citizens. For that reason, in 2007, I had expressed
my reservations about the salary tag of $2.2 million for an entry
level, MR4 Ministerial grade. However, even though most of the politicians
in this House have served out of a sense of calling, there is a
need to balance the need of political office bearer, to provide
fairly and reasonably for his or her family. Like every other Singaporean,
our Ministers, too, owe a responsibility to provide as well as they
can for their spouse and their children. Thus, we should be mindful
that we should not ask our Ministers to sacrifice more than what
the country can afford in terms of Singapore's political objectives. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b4e84b3b-e52b-4dad-bd74-aa578875565b">
                  <a name="motion__id-b4e84b3b-e52b-4dad-bd74-aa578875565b"><!--a--></a>This then begs the question
– what is a fair salary to pay for the political leaders? And like
Ms Denise Phua, I think that everyone, everyone of us has an opinion
as to what is a fair salary to be paid to our political leaders.
From the many discussions with fellow Singaporeans, I conclude that
most Singaporeans do not expect our Ministers to be paid too lowly.
For the heavy responsibilities that Ministers undertake, they do
deserve a fair and
competitive amount of compensation. I feel that it is not in the
interest of Singapore for our Ministers or office bearers to have
to constantly worry about their family income or the welfare of
their family. They should have the freedom to concentrate on their
jobs of managing their Ministry and planning for the future of Singapore
with full assurance that they can provide for their families in
the same manner as the majority of their contemporaries. </p>

if our salary formula only allowed those persons who have attained
a high degree of success in their career to enter politics. It may
mean limiting our choices of Ministers to only a very select few
businessmen who have either inherited their wealth or have already
attained success in their career and hence do not need the money.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-549de9b1-deab-40af-b92d-a66e6dcdc12a">
                  <a name="motion__id-549de9b1-deab-40af-b92d-a66e6dcdc12a"><!--a--></a>It will also be wrong for
our Government to set a salary structure so low that it makes it
difficult for the Prime Minister to challenge potential leaders
to serve the country or to find suitable men or women to take on
such a heavy burden of ensuring that Singapore success story continues.
And it would also be disastrous if we adopt such as poor salary package
such that our political leaders will feel tempted to illegally enrich
themselves so that they can keep up with their peers. There are
many examples in other countries where this has happened. Thus,
in some countries, where ministers who despite being paid poorly
can still afford to accumulate assets that are many, many times
their salaries.</p>

sacrifice, I agree that the ethos of public service would require
some form of financial sacrifice from the Ministers. Hence, even
though the consultants had assessed, based on the closest comparison
that CEOs in private sectors holding similar-sized jobs to entry-grade
Ministers are paid a median salary of $2.29 million. It would generally
not be acceptable for most citizens to expect that their political
leaders are paid such an amount. </p>

of the personal sacrifices made by Ministers, who have given up
huge pay packages in the private sector to join the Government,
simply to answer the call of service for the country. Ministers
like Dr Ng Eng Hen, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, the late Dr Balaji,
Mr Gan Kim Yong, Ms Grace Fu and just earlier I heard Mr Heng Swee
Keat, have decided that the privilege of serving the country is
a higher calling than to continue their pursuit of material success
in their individual chosen fields. I believe that if the Workers'
Party look at the calibre of this Cabinet, they will acknowledge
that this Government does not over-commercialised the running of
this country. But instead, the Government goes to great extent to
ask suitable candidates to answer the noble calling.</p>

great admiration our former Prime Ministers, Mr Lee Kuan Yew and
ESM Goh Chok Tong, both of whom gave up their private sector career
to serve the country many years ago. Even to this date, Mr Goh Chok
Tong continues to serve the nation as Emeritus Senior Minister.
He travels, he promotes Singapore without collecting any salary
as a government Minister. Such is the ethos of the current Cabinet Ministers
and I believe that Singaporeans can be proud of the fact that our
political leaders do make sacrifices to answer the call of duty,
to make a difference to the lives of other Singaporeans. </p>

had engaged the services of a consultant who is a leader of global
provider of human resources, Mercer Singapore Pte Ltd. They are
experts in remuneration issues. After the report was issued, several
other human resource consultants were interviewed and many of them
had also described the recommendations as fair and reasonable. Whilst
each one of us have our own individual views of the right pay package,
I think that it is wisdom in leaving this issue of compensation
package of political leaders to the human resource experts in the
field. We set the basic principles that we believe in and then we
leave it to an independent panel to make the recommendations on
the correct level to peg the salaries. Otherwise, we can spend days
and weeks debating on what is an appropriate salary for our ministers
and other political leaders, all of which will be based on our own
individual assessment, our own individual judgement.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9f6fba75-7856-4b56-b1e9-c53e2d1460f1">
                  <a name="motion__id-9f6fba75-7856-4b56-b1e9-c53e2d1460f1"><!--a--></a>Sir, allow me to make a
few other points. I am appreciative that there has been a review.
For the Government to ignore unhappiness of the voters against the
salaries of ministers would be insensitive. The fact that this review
took place is a very strong message that the Government does take
into account the views of the people. The fact that the Government
is also accepting the recommendation of the independent Committee
is also a right step. There have been substantial cuts to the salaries
of the President, Prime Minister and Cabinet Ministers. At the end
of the day, based on the salary of about $55,000 per month for a
MR4 Minister, as a judgement call, I feel this is a reasonable sum
for the level of responsibilities that a Minister holds. However,
I would urge the Government to find ways to formulate policies that
will help all Singaporeans improve their lives. I am of the view
that if every Singaporean is able to say that their life has improved
after five years, they will not begrudge the salaries payable to
our political leaders.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-03b002ca-c4af-4cd4-b428-0fa90db1f3bb">
                  <a name="motion__id-03b002ca-c4af-4cd4-b428-0fa90db1f3bb"><!--a--></a>Next, Sir, I ask the question:
should we peg the salary of an entry grade Minister MR4 to the median
salary of the top 1,000 earners who are Singaporeans? Or should
we peg the salary to the median income of the lowest 20% group of
Singaporeans as has been suggested by some parties? I have never
been comfortable with a peg to the top earners – whether it is to
the top 1,000 earners or bottom group of earners. If you peg the
salary to the top earners, when these top 1,000 earners earn more,
then the salary of the political leaders will invariably increase.
This will again create some degree of unhappiness. As for the peg
to the bottom, the question is how to apply the multiple. The multiple
is really arbitrary and regardless how you see it, it is not realistic.
I would prefer to have a fixed salary without a peg and then make
adjustments for inflation every few years. If there is a mechanism
for the salary to be reviewed every five years, then perhaps the
Government can consider forming an independent committee comprising human
resource experts to review the salaries of political appointment
holders every five years. The salary for the Government would then
be fixed for that five-year period. Whatever the formula is, I would
submit that we should find a formula that will assist Singapore
to find capable and committed leadership over the long term. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-6898ce0d-2177-4ba8-9768-7b65418d96ec">
                  <a name="motion__id-6898ce0d-2177-4ba8-9768-7b65418d96ec"><!--a--></a>Sir, I am in agreement with
the recommendation to scrap pensions for Ministers. In fact, I would
go further to ask that we scrap pensions for the civil service as
well. There is no reason why any member of the civil service should
have such differential treatment. After this review is passed by
Parliament, we may have an absurd situation where our Permanent
Secretaries and other key civil servants are earning more than their
Ministers, will be having their pensions and to add to that, they
take no political risk. Would we in the future be able to persuade
capable civil servants to give up their careers to join in the political
service? Hence, I join Ms Denise Phua to ask the Government to consider
forming an independent committee to assess whether we are pegging
the salaries of the Administrative Service to the right level. Their
high salaries have caused some degree of unhappiness amongst other
civil servants who are not Administrative Service officers. For
the sake of the entire civil service, we should review their salary package
as well.</p>

times that Singapore is an aberration. For a small country like
ours to be so successful is due in large part to our people's hard
work and in part to our having good political leadership. Good government
cannot be left to chance. It would be risky for any government to
wait for 10, 20 capable and passionate people with integrity to
step up every five years and say that they would give up their careers,
they would take major financial sacrifices to serve the people of
Singapore. Sir, having heard the Prime Minister, I understand his
concerns and the need to find capable, competent men and women of
integrity for the future of Singapore. Hence, Sir, I would urge
the House to accept the recommendation of the Committee to pay our
political leaders fairly with a significant discount to reflect
the point that politics is a calling and not just a career.</p>

is used to determine a patient's eligibility for Government subsidies,
taking into account his ability to pay. It helps the Government
to be more targeted in channelling Government subsidies to those
in greater need. </p>

care (ILTC) sector which includes community hospitals and nursing
homes uses per capita family income as the criteria for means-testing.
This is an equitable basis as it takes into account the patient's
family circumstances. For example, a sole breadwinner supporting
his wife and children would require more financial support than
a bachelor earning the same level of income and who has no dependants.
On the other hand, an elderly patient who has no family support
is less able to pay for his bills than another who is receiving
financial support from his children. </p>

we have adopted a simpler means-test based on a patient's individual
income from work, and does not take into account the rest of the
family members. If the patient is economically non-active, the means-test
will be based on the annual value of his residential property. This
is more practical and easier to administer given the much higher
patient volumes and short stays at acute hospitals. However, hospitals
do have the flexibility to assess the patient based on the per capita
family income approach similar to that used in ILTC sector, if specific
patients feel that the simplified approach based on individual income
is disadvantageous to them. </p>

of commercial and industrial spaces have risen following the economic
recovery from the global financial crisis in 2009. However, the increases
for office and shop space have been moderate, with prices as at
3Q 2011 being only slightly higher than their last peak in 2Q 2008.

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Gan Kim Yong</strong>
                  </span>: The Ministry
of Health (MOH) takes a serious view of this incident. To summarise
what happened, in August 2011, the Health Sciences Authority's (HSA)
DNA Profiling Laboratory (DNAPL) discovered that a reagent of higher
than usual concentration ("the Reagent") had been used as part of
the DNA testing process from October 2010 to August 2011. The key
scientific impact of the Reagent was a marginal reduction in the
sensitivity of the DNA tests when low levels of DNA were being analysed.
This did not cause any false positive results leading to wrongful
identification of any person. Re-testing of DNA samples was initiated
as a precautionary measure. For the concluded cases, the Attorney-General's
Chambers (AGC)'s assessment is that there were no wrongful convictions
due to the use of the Reagent. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4a500963-7324-4b61-b38a-c94f7ad8025b">

of the incident in August 2011, an inter-Government agency group
comprising the AGC, the Singapore Police Force (SPF), the Central
Narcotics Bureau (CNB) and HSA was established to assess the impact
of the Reagent on the DNA tests affected. </p>

the incident has been established to be minimal. Foreign experts
have confirmed that there would have been no false positive results
leading to wrongful identification of a person, and no one wrongly
identified as a result of the incident. The inter-Government agency
group studied each and every case which may have been affected by
the incident and identified cases for re-testing as a precautionary measure.
The re-tests are expected to be completed in March 2012. </p>

and has dealt with the incident in a professional, objective, and
timely manner. It took prompt action in August 2011 to tighten reagent preparation
by using the prior established method of weighing powdered chemicals
and dissolving in water. The Laboratory now no longer prepares the
particular reagent in house but instead uses a commercially-prepared
reagent which only became available after the affected batch had
been prepared. The same approach is also adopted for other steps
in the Laboratory's testing processes where such commercially-prepared
reagents are available. </p>

now also sent to HSA's Chemical Metrology Laboratory for chemical
composition analysis to verify their contents and concentration
prior to use. This now goes beyond the existing internationally
benchmarked quality assurance system and quality control checks. </p>

                  </span>: Since
the 1990s, there have been several cases involving Singapore Citizens
committing corruption offences overseas and prosecuted in Singapore.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0b616051-14bb-462b-82be-95e37c0d0a30">
                  <a name="hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-0b616051-14bb-462b-82be-95e37c0d0a30"><!--a--></a>	The Corrupt Practices Investigation
Bureau (CPIB) may conduct investigations into Singapore Citizens
who have committed offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act
(PCA) in any place, even if it is outside Singapore. This is provided
for under Section 37(1) of the PCA. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-83d2b35c-0185-49f8-aa38-0c84bc1daa83">
                  <a name="hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-83d2b35c-0185-49f8-aa38-0c84bc1daa83"><!--a--></a>However, any investigation
in a foreign state requires the latter's permission and co-operation.
Hence, the approach taken has to be practical and is based on the
premise that the state where the act of corruption takes place is
usually best placed to investigate and deal with the matter. If
there is a Singapore nexus, the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC)
would consider any mutual legal assistance requested by that foreign
state and CPIB would extend its assistance where appropriate.</p>

approach, in cases where Singapore is better placed to investigate
and deal, we will prosecute in Singapore. Examples of such cases
are civil servants in our overseas missions committing corruption
offences. </p>
