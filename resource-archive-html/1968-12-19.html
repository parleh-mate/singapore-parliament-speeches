difference between the purchase price of a flat  that

has  been previously rented out and that of a similar

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, there is no difference in the

similar type built by the Housing Board. In the  sale

of  existing  flats, necessary repairs, redecorations

and  repainting are carried out before the flats  are

offered for sale.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, an old flat is an old flat,

irrespective of the repairs that are carried  out  to

it.  Can  the Minister say whether there  will  be  a

change  in the prices of Housing Board flats  in  the

future?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> For the moment, there will be no change.

An  old  flat is an old flat, but the prices of  land

and  buildings  have  gone up in Singapore  with  the

passing of time. Anyone in occupation of an old  flat

is  not  forced to buy it. If he thinks the price  is

not  reasonable, he can always apply  to  buy  a  new

flat.

he  will consider extending dental services to Government-aided schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, at the present moment, no school dental

clinics  have  been  established in  Government-aided

schools,  like  those  already  established   in   43

Government  primary schools. However,  students  from

Government-aided schools who require emergency dental

treatment  are  catered for at the  following  dental

clinics:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Pegu Road School Dental Centre;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Institute of Health School Dental Clinic;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, a few smaller Government-aided schools

outside  city  limits  are being  visited  by  mobile

dental clinics on a regular basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to date, only one Government-aided primary school

has applied for a dental clinic to be established  in

its  premises.  This  school  has  provided  suitable

clinic  accommodation and the Ministry has agreed  to

provide  dental  staff  and  equipment  to  run  this

clinic.  It is the policy of the Ministry  to  extend

dental  services as far as is possible to Government-

aided  schools  which  can  provide  suitable  clinic

accommodation, so long as dental staff and  equipment

are available to operate new clinics.

funds from the Development Planning Sub-Committee  to

enable my Ministry formally to operate Market II.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No itinerant or static hawkers are allowed in Taman

Jurong.  As  there appears to be a  need  to  provide

marketing  facilities to the residents of the  blocks

of  flats near Market II, an early opening of  Market

II  is  proposed and is expected to be done early  in 1969.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1204 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The same  amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ho Kah Leong.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I only wish to seek information on the total

area  of  land now held by the British Armed  Forces,

and  whether  plans are being made  well  in  advance

before the reversion takes place rather than to  wait

till the end of 1971.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I wish to draw the Minister's attention

to   three  matters.  Firstly,  in  order  to  create

employment  for our people, we have already  embarked

upon our industrialisation programme. As a result  of

this,  we  have selected Jurong as the  site  for  an

industrial estate which is in my constituency. In the

process,  some  rural folk have to be  resettled  and

problems usually arise in relation to resettlement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, generally speaking, the rural people do not

quarrel  with  our industrial development  programme.

They  are quite prepared to make some sacrifices  and

move to the resettlement areas



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>



provided, of course, that they are given adequate and

reasonable  compensation. The resettlement  problems,

however,  are usually complicated by some  Government

officials  who  mishandle the situation.  I  wish  to

quote one instance. In my constituency, there is  one

island  known as Pulau Ayer Chawan which, as  Members

are aware, has been chosen as the investment site  of

Esso  (Singapore) Limited who will establish  a  $200

million refinery there. The people living there  will

have  to  be resettled on other islands. But for  one

reason  or  other,  the  Commissioner  of  Lands  has

allowed  one  family to move to an  island  known  as

Pulau Ayer Merbau. As a result, the other families on

Pulau Ayer Chawan have also asked to be resettled  on

the  same  island, but their applications  have  been

rejected  because the island has been  earmarked  for

further industrial development



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they are dissatisfied; they think it is not fair.

There are now seven families still staying in

Pulau  Ayer  Chawan. Is this not  a  case  where  our

industrial  development is being hampered because  of

mishandling  by  Land  Office  officials'?  I  wonder

whether  there is any inter-departmental liaison,  in

my opinion, the Commissioner of Lands should at least

get  in  touch  with  the Director  of  the  Economic

Development Board to ensure that the island  which  I

have  mentioned  will  not  be  used  for  industrial

development  before  he  allows  any  family  to   be

resettled there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, some Government officials do not collect

revenue on due date and allow arrears to

accumulate. This gives rise to inconvenience  to  the

public  and probably a loss of revenue to Government.

I  have  noticed with growing concern that there  are

more and more cases of arrears in revenue collection.

This  happens not only in the Property Tax Department

but also in the Land Office.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I know, there are about 50 sand-quarry

operators  in  Singapore and, under the  regulations,

they  are  required  -to pay a royalty  to  the  Land

Office.  I  do  not know whether it  is  due  to  the

oversight  of the Commissioner of Lands or  for  some

other   reasons  that  this  royalty  has  not   been

collected  for  the  past  few  years.  But  somebody

recently   discovered   this  and   the   sand-quarry

operators  were asked to pay the arrears  in  royalty

amounting to about $500,000 for five years. It is not

reasonable to expect them to pay this amount  in  one

lump  sum. In fact, many of them were unable  to  pay

such  a huge sum of money and some of them have  even

stopped operation. I do not know whether it is  still

possible  to recover the arrears from those who  have

ceased operation. I wish to ask the Minister why such

arrears have been allowed to accumulate. Is it due to

the negligence of the officials concerned?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, in my constituency, many areas have been

earmarked    for    industrial    development,    and

construction  of public works is going  on,  such  as

repair  of soads, construction of bridges and so  on.

There  are usually some difficulties in the  approval

of  these  works. One of these relates to  the  undue

delays  by  the  Land  Office  in  the  clearance  of

applications  for certain projects. Sir,  I  wish  to

amplify  on this point. It will be a waste of  public

money for people to develop areas which are earmarked

for  development. Some people from development  areas

have recently been resettled in my constituency,  and

it  is  unreasonable for the authorities to  resettle

them  once more in another area in such a short time,

because  the  areas in which they live  now  will  be

developed.  So  there is actually no reason  for  the

delay  mentioned  above.  In fact,  applications  for

clearance  of construction projects will be  answered

only after a period of six months or one year. I  had

on the same occasion here last year complained of the

inefficiency  of the Land Office and I am  mentioning

it  again  in  order to catch the  attention  of  the

Minister.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I wish to draw the Minister's attention

to some of the complaints made against the Land

Office. In my constituency, there was an instance

which gave rise to-unnecessary inconvenience to the

people due to the inefficiency of the Land Office. At

the 15th milestone of my constituency there is a

village which has about 100 families. One of them

applied for permission to renovate his-shop, but his

application was rejected because that area has been

earmarked for agricultural development. I have

already mentioned that my constituency is in the

rural area. I fail to understand why the Land Office

has classified this area as a development area. I

think the officers must be blind to realities. As a

result, unnecessary trouble has been created and the

officers concerned should be held responsible. In

fact, in the surrounding areas, permission has been

granted for the rural folk to build their huts and

houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Minister give appropriate-instructions to

his  officers to look further into the matler so that

the   rural   folk  will  be  given   the   necessary

facilities?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development (Law Division) (Mr S. Ramaswamy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me-first deal

with   the   queries  raised  by   the   Member   for

Mountbatten. The United Kingdom Services occupy about

14,603  acres of land in Singapore. A total of  1,177

acres of defence land have so far been transferred to

the  Singapore  Government.  The  rest  of  the  land

occupied  by  the  Services will be returned  to  the

Singapore Government at the end of 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong complained of the

discrimination  in  resettling, families  who   were

living  in Pulau Ayer Chawan. I would like to  assure

him  that  there was no discrimination in  resettling

these  families. One isolated case was a resident  of

Pulau  Ayer Chawan who was allocated a site in  Pulau

Ayer Merbau. The decision was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>



taken on or before the whole of Pulau Ayer Chawan was

considered to be cleared for industrial development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other families total nine in number. When it was

decided  that Pulau Ayer Chawan was to be  leased  to

Esso  (Singapore) Limited, the Land Office offered  a

piece of land to the remaining nine families in Pulau

Merlimau  which  has  already  been  laid  out  as  a

resettlement area by the Economic Development  Board.

Of  these  nine families, four of them have  accepted

this  offer and the other five families have  erected

houses on the foreshore of the island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to royalties paid by the sand-quarry

operators, the question of arrears is a long-standing

problem  with the Land Office. It appears  that  this

has  not  been  successfully resolved. In  fact,  the

Ministry  is  investigating the  circumstances  under

which  these arrears have been allowed to accumulate.

The collection of royalties in respect of the current

year has been very- satisfactory and it is hoped that

some  reasonable arrangements can he  worked  out  to

collect  the  arrears of royalty  due  to  the  state

without causing undue hardship to the operators.  The

Land  Office,  in consultation with the  Ministry  of

Finance,  will be prepared to consider any reasonable

arrangement  to settle the outstanding arrears  in  a

manner which will not cause any undue hardship to the

operators or landowners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong raised the question of repair

of roads and so on. This is not the responsibility of

the  Land Office, if the Member is complaining of the

delay in approving applications for erection of  huts

or repair of houses, then certain formalities have to

he   complied   with,  and  in   most   cases   these

applications  have been approved by the  Land  Office

within   a  period  of  four  to  six  weeks.   These

applications have also to go through the Chief  Build

ing~  Surveyor's Office and this will take a  further

six to eight weeks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang complains of the refusal of

permission to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>



renovate  a  shop  at  the 15th milestone  Sembawang.

First  of  all, if the shop is on private  land,  the

Land Office does not come into the picture at all. If

the shop is on Temporary Occupation Licence, that is,

the  shop premises are on state land which is  leased

to  the  occupant on a Temporary Occupation  Licence,

then  there  should  be an application  to  the  Land

Office.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been no refusal of any application for

renovation  or  renewal  or  reconstruction  of   any

shophouses in his area on the ground that the land is

zoned  for agricultural purposes. But the area he  is

talking  about  is  actually zoned  for  agricultural

purposes and the applications should be refused.  But

there  has  been no application and it has  not  been

refused.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, 1

am  not satisfied with the reply of the Parliamentary

Secretary because he has not answered to the point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point is this. Why did the Commissioner of

Lands  fail  to consult or liaise with  the  Economic

Development  Board  before he  allotted  resettlement

land  to  the  people? He allotted various  areas  to

people  at his whim and fancy, an-d later on when  he

discovered  to his surprise that the areas  were  ear

marked  for  development, he had to refuse subsequent

applications  for  these areas. So  the  people  feel

there  is injustice and indiscrimination. As a result

of  his  mishandling the situation,  our  development

programme has been delayed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, why should the collection of royalties or

revenue  fall  into  arrears?  Is  it  due   to   the

negligence or oversight of the officers? The name  of

every operator of sand quarries is listed in the Land

Office  and he is required to pay royalties annually.

So  the collection of royalties should not have  been

left in arrears for five years. Can the Parliamentary

Secretary be certain that he will be able to  collect

the arrears in full'? If not, there will be a loss in

our revenue.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point relates to road repairs and road

construction.  It has nothing to do with  repairs  to

houses.  The Parliamentary Secretary has not answered

my point. My complaint is this. Applications for road

repairs  and for the construction of bridges have  to

be  cleared with the Land Office, because  the  areas

are   earmarked  for  development,  before  they  are

referred  to  the Urban and Rural Services  Committee

for  consideration. It happens that the Land Office

takes  a  lot of time to reply. The roads  are  in  a

state  of disrepair and they become worse because  of

the undue delay. As a result, more repairs have to be

carried  out and this means more expenditure  by  the

Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> In the resettlement of one family

from  Pulau  Ayer  Chawan to Pulau Merbau  and  other

families  to  Pulau  Merlimau,  there  has  been   no

negligence on the part of the Commissioner  of  Lands

and  there has been proper liaison between  the  Land

Office  and  the Economic Development Board.  I  will

give  the  full details of this case, and I hope  the

Member will be satisfied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 1967, an application was received by the

Land-  Office from one islander who had been residing

in Pulau Ayer Chawan for seven years. The application

was  in  the  nature of regularising his unauthorised

occupation  of a hut on the island. The  Licence  Com

mittee approved the application on 3rd August,  1967,

and a proper house site was allocated to him on Pulau

Aver Chawan. All this happened before this island was

considered for an oil refinery site.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this was going on, investigations had

commenced to establish the suitability of Pulau  Ayer

Chawan  as  an  oil refinery site. As there  was  the

possibility  at  that time that the island  would  be

taken   over   for   industrial   development,    the

Commissioner of Lands decided to freeze the  position

on  the island regarding the issue of a new Temporary

Occupation Licence to this particular person who  had

already been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>



allocated  a  site.  Therefore,  this  applicant  was

reallocated  a  site in Pulau Ayer Merbau.  By  March

1968,  the suitability of the island - that is  Pulau

Ayer   Chawan   -  as  an  oil  refinery   site   was

established. Therefore, it was necessary to  consider

the  resettlement of all the nine families living  in

Pulau Ayer Chawan. It was decided to resettle them in

Pulau Merlimau which had already been laid out  as  a

resettlement  area by the Economic Development  Board

when  it had to clear the land in Jurong. As  I  have

said  earlier,  the  nine families  were  accordingly

offered   houses  already  built  by   the   Economic

Development Board on the island. Four of  these  fami

lies   have  already  accepted  and  the  other  five

families have elected to have house sites only on the

foreshores of the island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the sand quarries, here again, I

have  to take up the time of the House to relate  the

history of the arrears of royalties. The Member wants

me  to give an assurance that the Government will not

lose  any  money  and that it will  collect  all  the

arrears. Of course, the Government or the Land Office

will  do  all it can to collect the arrears.  At  the

same  time,  as the Member has complained that  there

will  be  hard-ship  to  the operators  of  the  sand

quarries,  we  are prepared to come to some  kind  of

arrangement to collect these arrears.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go into the details of the sand quarries. The

Sand Quarries Ordinance, 1961, came into operation on

the  5th  of December, 1962. This Ordinance  requires

all  operators  to  be licensed by the  Public  Works

Department. There had been indiscriminate removal  of

sand with harmful effects on adjoining dwellers, such

as   the  drying  up  of  wells,  mosquito  breeding,

blockage  and  siltage of drains, etc. The  Ordinance

was  designed to ensure adequate control  over  sandquarry operations. Briefly, it appears that following

the  licensing of sandquarry operators under the Sand

Quarries  Ordinance, 1961, the Land Office called  on

these operators to furnish returns on the quantum  of

sand  removal.  In 1964, all licensed operators  were

asked by the Land Office to declare their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>



gross  produce figures to enable an assessment to  be

made on the royalty to be charged. The response  was

unsatisfactory.  Many sand-quarry operators  did  not

supply  this information and some forms were returned

undelivered. Meanwhile, field inspections  were  made

and  consultations  were conducted  with  the  Public

Works  Department  on  the method  and  procedure  of

assessing the produce of the various quarries and the

quantum  to  be  charged for royalty.  Unfortunately,

this was not followed up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Why?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> That is why an investigation is going

on  now. In 1966, some operators were again asked  to

declare  their gross produce and others were required

to  make  royalty  payments. Further  representations

were made that the produce figures quoted by the Land

Office  were excessive. Many of the operators claimed

that  the figures they themselves had quoted  to  the

Public  Works  Department at the time of applications

for licences had been deliberately over-estimated  in

order  to  ensure that they got licences.  The  sand-

quarry  operators have themselves to blame for  this,

They  seemed to be very unreasonable. It would appear

that  between 1964 and 1967, there was an ineffective

follow-up  on the part of the Land Office.  We  admit

this  in  the  matter  of collecting  royalties  and,

coupled  with  the negative response from  the  opera

tors, this has led to an accumulation of the arrears.

Action  has been taken by the Land Office  to  ensure

that  the 1968 royalties are paid promptly.  The  res

ponse has been fairly satisfactory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has said that there are about 50 sand

quarries.  There  are only 46 sand-quarry  operators.

Forty-two of the 46 operators licensed by the  Public

Works  Department have paid a total  of  $106,709  as

royalties  for  this  year.  Royalties  amounting  to

$13,947 for this year are due from four operators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong spoke on repairs of roads. The

Land Office has nothing to do with this subject.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): r Speaker, Sir,

I am not satisfied with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>



the reply of the Parliamentary Secretary. Perhaps  he

has  not  investigated  those  applications  for  the

reconstruction   of   houses   which   were   refused

permission.  I  hope he will give me  a  satisfactory

answer that he will look into the matter again.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Parliamentary Secretary has spoken quite a  lot,

but he has not replied to a particular point of mine.

I  do not wish to waste time arguing with him. I wish

to  ask  him  a  few  questions. The  first  question

relates to the allocation of land by the Commissioner

of  Lands to those affected by resettlement to  Pulau

Ayer Merbau. Does the Commissioner of Lands know that

this island will be used for industrial purposes when

he  allocates  land to the affected family  in  Pulau

Ayer Chawan?



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that he said that the Land

Office has nothing to do with the repairing of roads.

I  think  he has been sleeping. I have said just  now

that  part  of the land in my constituency  has  been

earmarked   for  industrial  purposes.   Before   any

repairing of roads can be undertaken, clearance  must

he obtained from the Commissioner of Lands.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswam (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ramaswamy, can you be even briefer

in your reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> The Member for Sembawang asked me

whether I knew of any refusal of applications for the

reconstruction  of  houses.  Yes,  there  have   been

investigations.   There   have   been   only    three

applications from house owners on state land for  the

reconstruction or repair of their houses. Two of them

have  been  approved. One application  has  not  been

approved because the applicant has not complied  with

certain requirements. If the Member for Sembawang was

speaking  about some other application, I  will  tell

him  that  the applicant did not have the landowner's

permission   and   the   Chief  Building   Surveyor's

Department might have refused to approve it.  As  far

as  state  land  is  concerned,  there  has  been  no

refusal.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong asked me whether I knew that

Pulau  Ayer Merbau was going to be affected  by  some

industrial  programme. Yes, there is a  proposal  but

Pulau   Ayer  Merbau's  suitability  has   not   been

established yet. Investigations are still going on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to getting clearance by the Land Office

for  the  repairing  of roads which  the  Member  for

Jurong  is  complaining of, it may well be  that  the

Commissioner  of  Lands  has  got  to  consult  other

departments, like the Resettlement Department and the

Public  Works  Department, before the applicants  can

get  the  clearance. That may be  the  cause  of  the

delay.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,096,530 for Head 1204 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1207 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 207 be reduced

by 510 in respect of subhead 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In speaking on this head, I would like to range over

the   general  development  of  agriculture  in   our

country. I understand that our national policy is  to

industrialise speedily and only thus can  we  have  a

future.  At the moment, there are still about  20,000

people   engaged  in  agriculture  in  our   country.

Agricultural produce is worth about $200 million  per

year.  Of course, the actual figure will have  to  be

estimated  by the Primary Production Department  when

they  have  gone through the farm licensing exercise.

However,   agricultural  activity   should   not   be

neglected in our economic development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that while we are industrialising, we

should  also pay careful attention to the development

of agriculture. All along the Government has not been

paying equal attention or given equal emphasis to the

development of agriculture. There is a Primary Production



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>



Department but it is always passive. It may  be

of  benefit to large-scale farmers, but it is not  so

to  small  farmers. The present farming  methods  are

very backward and the method of selling farm produce,

too,  is  not  scientific. May I  ask  what  kind  of

assistance  has  the  Primary  Production  Department

given  to  the  farmers in this respect?  At  present

kelong fishing is in a retrogressive state. Fishermen

get  very little fish from off-shore shallow  waters.

Many farmers and fishermen have been forced to change

their   means  of  livelihood  and  seek   employment

elsewhere.  What kind of assistance has  the  Primary

Production Department given to them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am quite aware that because of the weather and the condition of the soil, we can only produce certain crops to supplement our food. As for staple items of food- like rice and wheat, we have to depend on imports. The supplementary foodstuffs we produce are vegetables, fruits an-d

tobacco. Our livestock is poultry, pigs, cows,  goats

and  other  farm animals. These are what  the  people

need  for  their  food. As I have pointed  out,  this

agricultural produce is worth $200 million per  year.

If  our agricultural production is in a retrogressive

state,  not  only will we have to import  our  staple

food,   but   we   may  even  have  to   import   our

supplementary food. Every year there will be  a  loss

of  $200 million. If there is a change for the  worse

in  our  situation, we may not even have  tapioca  to

eat.  There are 20,000 people engaged in agriculture.

How can our industry absorb all of them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel there is a retrogression in agriculture.

There are two signs to show this. First, our land  is

limited  and  land for agriculture is  also  limited.

According to the 1967 statistics, the acreage of land

taken  up  by  the  planting of  fruits,  vegetables,

potatoes  and tobacco is only 12,240 acres.  This  is

about  19  square  miles. The land  used  for  animal

husbandry  is slightly less. There are no  statistics

on  this.  But, generally speaking, land  for  animal

husbandry  should be about six square miles.  We  can

see  from these figures that the total land taken  up

for agriculture and animal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>



husbandry  is  about 25 square miles. More  and  more

land is being acquired for industrialisation and  for

military  purposes.  There is also  the  question  of

urbanisation.  There will then be  very  little  land

left  for  agriculture. Even the land  allocated  for

each  resettled farmer cannot be more than two acres.

As  far  as I know, most of the farmers are allocated

about  one  acre  of  land each. The  land  area  for

agriculture is, therefore, decreasing day after  day.

Consequently, agricultural produce will also decrease

in quantity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, because of the backwardness of their

agricultural  production and the unscientific  method

of  selling  their produce, many farmers  who  depend

solely on farming as their livelihood are living at a

subsistence level. Many of their children go  out  to

seek other employment. For instance, many of them  in

my constituency have gone to work in the factories in

order to get additional income for their families. It

takes almost the whole day, from four or five o'clock

in the morning until seven or eight o'clock at night,

for  one  to engage in agricultural activity.  Modern

youths  find  that they can get a better income  from

other  jobs than farming. They have, therefore, given

it up. Consequently, there are fewer and fewer people

engaged   in   agriculture.  All   this   shows   the

retrogressive  state  of  our  agriculture.  If  this

condition  continues,  then  I  dare  say  that   our

agricultural production will deteriorate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government is really sincere in wanting to

assist the development of agriculture, then it should

take  measures  to  stop the drift into  agricultural

retrogression.  The  least  the  Primary   Production

Department can do Is to help the farmers to modernise

their  agricultural production and introduce  a  more

scientific method of selling their produce.  This  is

very  necessary In the light of our local conditions,

and  is the only way to get the best returns from our

limited land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has given great assistance in

industrialisation,  for instance,  by  setting  up  a

Development Bank. The Government can also set



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>



up a financial organisation to assist the development

of agriculture. This organisation can provide farmers

with  interest-free loans so that they can  modernise

their agricultural equipment.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswam (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho, the head to which you are

speaking  is "Director of Primary Production".  I  do

not   think  the  question  of  providing  loans   to

agriculturists comes within his province.  Could  you

please relate your remarks to the head that is  under

discussion?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): According to my

understanding, the Primary Production  Department  is

also in charge of agriculture. I was merely trying to

advance   my  suggestions  on  agriculture  for   the

Minister's consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswam (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Subject to your being correct, I have

no  objection,  but as you will see  lower  down  the

Order Paper Supplement, we have an amendment relating

to  urban and rural services which, from last  year's

experience, is going to interest many Members.  Could

you try to wind up very quickly, please?



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, thank you for

your  indulgence.  Just now I was talking  about  the

assistance given by the Primary Production Department

to farmers. This has not been without any faults. The

Primary  Production Department has not done  well  in

disseminating agricultural knowledge to the  farmers.

Take,  for  example,  the articles  in  the  Bulletin

published by the Department. They are normally  quite

specialised  in  nature.  Radio  broadcasts  to   the

farmers  are also quite sophisticated and the farmers

do  not  understand them. I suggest films  should  be

made    showing   the   technique   of   agricultural

production.  These films should have an  accompanying

commentary  in  simple  local dialects  so  that  the

farmers  can benefit from them. There should also  be

frequent exchanges of opinions and views between  the

Primary Production Department and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>



the  farmers.  In  order that  the  farmers  are  not

exploited   by   middle  men,  I  suggest   that   an

agricultural  co-operative society  be  set  up.  The

Government  should  assist in  the  organisation  and

administration  of the society as  the  farmers  lack

experience in these matters.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development (National Development Division) (Mr Ho Cheng Choon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, first of all, I feel that  Members  of

Parliament  of rural constituencies should understand

that,  in  the past, our country depended on entrepot

trade  which provided us with the sinews of  economic

life. But because of the growth in our population, we

have  to  industrialise at a quick pace in  order  to

create  employment for our people. We should  not  be

under  the wrong impression that Singapore's  economy

is  dependent on agriculture. Our discussions  should

not   be  based  on  that  and  we  should  not  view

Government's  measures from  the  point  of  view  of

agriculture alone. Unfortunately, Singapore has  only

224  square  miles of land. She needs more  and  more

land  for  industrialisation which is more  important

than any other project. Therefore, the land that  can

be  allotted  for agricultural purposes  is  limited.

This means that resettled farmers who are affected by

our  various  schemes can only be allotted  up  to  a

maximum   of  two  acres  of  land  each  for   their

agricultural  activities. The farmers should  not  be

dissatisfied because they must understand  that  land

is  limited  in  Singapore. In  future,  the  Primary

Production Department will introduce farming in multi-

storey  flats. This is one of the measures to  remedy

our shortage of land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has just now mentioned that

our  farmers  are quite backward in their  method  of

agriculture   and   that   the   Primary   Production

Department  has not looked after their  interest  and

welfare.  He  also  says that the total  agricultural

produce per year



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>



amounts to $200 million. If our agricultural

production is backward, how is it that it can amount

to so-much a year? This clearly disproves, what the

Member has said. The reason is that we have been

providing the farmers with modern scientific methods

in agricultural activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the rapid progress in industrialisation, many

youths from the rural

areas will have to give up agricultural activities

and take up jobs in the factories. I feel there is

nothing wrong in this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has also-suggested the

setting up of a financial organisation to give

interest free loans to the farmers and the setting up

of an agricultural co-operative society. As regards

the agricultural co-operative society, I must say

that the Primary Production Department did encourage

the farmers to form such a co-operative society. This

met with some success. But, unfortunately, the

organisers lacked experience. There were also some

irresponsible people in the society and, because of

their improper activities, the society was not

successful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, the Primary Production

Department provides the farmers with the latest

techniques in agriculture mainly through farmers'

forums, radio broadcasts and also through the

Bulletin published by the Primary Production

Department. This has benefited the farmers very much.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

do not entirely share the views expressed by my

colleague, the Member for Jurong. But I think some of

his points are quite valid. As far as agricultural

research is concerned, I think we are doing quite

well and the Primary Production Department should be

congratulated. I am also inclined to agree with the

Member for Jurong when he said that there is some

thing lacking in the liaison between the Primary

Production Department and the farmers. At times, the

officials responsible for the so-called extension

services do not appear to understand fully the

mentality and outlook of the farmers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned the Bulletin published by the Primary Production Department. I think we must bear in mind that the majority of the farmers are not sufficiently educated to be able to understand it. This is the point made by the Member for Jurong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with the Member's suggestion that in

order to remedy the position, there should perhaps be

regular discussions between the senior members of the

Primary Production Department and the farmers.  I  am

quite  sure this will go a long way towards promoting

better  mutual  understanding. Such sessions  can  be

held  at  community centres and I am quite  sure  the

rural  Members  of Parliament will be very  happy  to

participate in them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adequate research and proper liaison is still not

enough unless the farmers have the means to carry out

the new methods and techniques which we are trying to

introduce to them. The results of extensive  research

might  very  well be wasted. Hence the need  for  the

setting  up of a credit agency to serve the needs  of

the agricultural sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very pleased to hear that we are going in for

multi-storeyed    farming.   In   our    agricultural

development, I think we can draw inspiration from the

success  of Israel. If the land-hungry Israelis  can,

out  of  waste  land, produce and export  the  world-

famous  Jaffa oranges, I am quite sure  we  can  rear

enough  pigs  and  poultry in  multistorey  flats  to

export them to neighbouring countries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am not quite

satisfied  with the reply given by the  Parliamentary

Secretary  as he has not answered my various  points.

Perhaps he was not paying attention when I spoke.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswam (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Ho, I appreciate your

difficulties.  But  if  you look  at  the  number  of

give other Members an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>



opportunity  to speak. May I suggest that  you  raise

this  topic  for an adjournment debate  on  the  23rd

December,  or the first sitting in January,  when  we

can have a full debate on the agricultural policy  of

the Government?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> We welcome his motion!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I merely want

to say something briefly.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswam (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho, if ten Members say that they

want  to  say something briefly and each  speaks  for

three  minutes, half an hour is taken up. That is  my

difficulty. By "briefly", do you mean two minutes?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Yes, Sir. Thank you

for your indulgence in providing me with two minutes.

The   Parliamentary  Secretary  seems  not  to   have

understood  my point. I was saying that  although  we

are industrialising at a quick pace, we must also  at

the  same  time  pay attention to the development  of

agriculture and not neglect it.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary has said that there has been a great amount of agricultural produce every year. This shows that the Primary Production Department has helped the farmers a lot. I would like to ask him what kind of assistance the Primary Production Department has rendered to the farmers in

the teaching of scientific methods of agriculture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also mentioned the improper management of the

agricultural  cooperative society which  was  set  up

some  time ago. That is why I have suggested  that  a

new  agricultural co-operative society should be  set

up  with the assistance of Government. No forums have

so far been held in my constituency.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswam (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho, you have not indicated whether

or not you are withdrawing the amendment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would like to have a reply from the Parliamentary

Secretary.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswam (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If you want a further reply, there

will be a dialogue. That is what I am trying

to avoid.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

if  the  Member for Jurong has paid attention  to  my

reply and grasped my point, he need not have to raise

minor points. If I were to give in detail the kind of

assistance   rendered  by  the   Primary   Production

Department  to the farmers in the teaching  of  scien

tific  agricultural methods, we might not be able  to

finish by 8.00 p.m. If he wants details, I may oblige

him on some other occasion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point that no forums have been held in his

constituency  and  that improper services  have  been

rendered,  if  the  Member can  supply  me  with  the

necessary details, these matters will be looked into.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, though I am not

satisfied  with  the  reply,  I  am  withdrawing   my

amendment due to shortage of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1207 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1321.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the abattoirs at Jurong were built on very

lofty  hopes.  They were supposed to be  the  centre-

piece  of  a  complex  of  the  meat  processing  and

packaging  industry in Singapore. The abattoirs  were

completed  quite some time ago and yet they  are  not

fully  operational today. I would like  to  know  the

reason for this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in order to answer the

Member  for  Havelock  on the  abattoirs,  perhaps  I

should  refer  him to our efforts  to  get  the  fish

merchants  from  Ellenborough Market and  Beach  Road

Market  to  go  to  Jurong  with  which  he  is  well

conversant. Sir, in order to progress, Government has

to take certain measures and these measures are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>



usually not popular with those having vested

interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as fishing is concerned, when we started

this project of the fishing port plus a central

market at Jurong, there was opposition from the

Ellenborough and Beach Road Markets and several

Members of Parliament joined in this opposition.

Hence, the fishing market has not been started. The

Ellenborough Market has now been burnt and the fish

merchants are anxious to go to Jurong. So if there

is any delay, it is not the fault of the Primary

Production Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give this as an example of the reason why the

abattoirs at Jurong are not fully operational.

Perhaps I should first state the facts. Cattle

slaughter was started in Jurong in October 1967,

which is more than one year ago. The slaughter of

sheep commenced in early January this year. About 50

head of cattle and about 350 head of sheep are being

slaughtered daily in the abattoirs. What about pigs?

There was opposition to the move to go to Jurong and

we have not yet overcome such opposition. The

slaughter of pigs in Jurong - if I can call them rural pigs commenced in

June 1968, and about 200 head of pigs from the rural areas

are being slaughtered daily in Jurong. Pigs are still

being slaughtered at the French Road Abattoir and

about 1,000 head of pigs are slaughtered there a day.

There has been strong opposition to move the

slaughter of pigs from the French Road Abattoir to

Jurong, as there was opposition to the move as far as

cattle and sheep were concerned. All sorts of red

herrings are drawn. One such red herring is that the

meat of pigs slaughtered in Jurong becomes a little

paler and this is bad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Member to he patient as efforts are

being made to complete the transfer. There is delay

because of the opposition and the further

requirements demanded by pig butchers in respect of

the slaughter of their animals. They want additional

facilities and we are providing them with these

facilities. They want a separate room to clean the

guts of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>



pigs,  and we provide them with a room. But I  assure

the  Member  that  in five to six  months'  time  the

abattoirs will be fully operational.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng:</b> Sir, the Minister has touched on

the  Ellenborough Market fish auctioning  centre.  He

will  recall that I was not there when the Government

were  trying  to get the fish merchants out.  I  only

came  into the picture after Ellenborough Market  was

burnt down. I shall come to this later on, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswam (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> After that, I may have to ask the

Minister to withdraw, rather than the Member!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswam (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member for Serangoon Gardens has

the  written  authority of the Member for  Changi  to

move amendment (3)*. Mr Rodrigo.

<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker,

<hr size="2" noshade>

* The same amendment also stood in the  name of Mr Teong Eng Siong

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this concerns car parks and I have been asked

by   the  Member  for  Changi  to  stress  this  most

fearlessly.  The result of the present trend  in  car

parking  in  the  city is the displacement  of  taxi-

drivers   from   their  usual  yellow  line   parking

facilities.  What makes the situation much  worse  is

that when licensed taxi-drivers attempt to park their

vehicles  in  the paying parking lot, they  are  told

that  they  may  not  do so. This  not  only  imposes

inconvenience but also hardship upon them. I am asked

to  try  to adduce an explanation for this move.  Why

should  taxi-drivers be urged to be  continuously  on

the  move  throughout? They will have to  stop  their

vehicles some time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi has also asked me to remind

the  House  that  when the people of  Singapore  were

requested to indicate their loyalty to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>



the   country,  the  taxi-drivers  came  forth   with

$100,000  for  the National Defence Fund.  These  are

values   which  the  country  should  encourage   and

recognise. In view of the hardship that appears to be

imposed  upon  the taxi-drivers without any  rational

explanation,  and  their  response  to  the  National

Defence  Fund,  the  Member  for  Changi  would  like

consideration on their behalf.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  wish  to  raise one point under this subhead,  and

that  is  the  car park at the People's Park.  In  my

view,  it  is not proper to collect parking  fees  at

night at the People's Park because car owners already

have  to pay parking fees during the day. I feel that

parking  fees  should  not be  collected  during  the

night.  For  example, if the Minister wishes  to  buy

something at the People's Park, he has to pay  a  fee

for  a  parking  lot. I think this will  be  a  great

inconvenience  to him. Therefore, he should  consider

exempting  car  owners from paying  parking  fees  at

night.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

ever   since  the  completion  of  the  new  shopping

building in the People's Park, many people have  been

attracted  to  this area. We have provided  about  63

parking  lots  there.  The  original  provisions   of

parking  lots  was 63, but because  of  demands  from

various  quarters, we have increased  the  number  of

parking  lots  and also introduced a  paying  parking

system in this area.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have extended the time of pay parking from 9.00

a.m. to 4.00 p.m, for the first shift and from  4.30

p.m. to 11.00 p.m, for the second shift. As a result

of  the  pay  parking system which was introduced  in

October last year, we have collected about $40,000 in

parking  fees up to November this year. We have  also

been able to provide employment for about ten parking

attendants.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I will deal with the queries raised by

the  Member  for Serangoon Gardens on behalf  of  the

Member  for  Changi.  I was asked  whether  I  had  a

rational  answer.  My  answer  is,  "Yes,  I  have  a

rational  answer." But perhaps, as the  Minister  for

Defence  is  not here, I should state in  this  House

that  the  Government  is  indeed  grateful  for  the

$100,000  or  more  which was  raised  by  the  taxi-

drivers. But I am sure that the taxi-drivers, who are

reasonable  men,  will understand that  because  they

made a generous gift to the Defence Fund, it does not

mean  that they should be allowed to flout the  rules

of the road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the law lays down that taxi-drivers are not

allowed  to  park  in places where the  ordinary  man

parks  his  car.  The reason is quite  simple.  Taxi-

drivers are given their own taxi-stands and you and I

park  in different places. When you want a taxi,  you

know  where  to  find one. But the  taxi-drivers  com

plained. They said that they might take a tourist  to

Arab Street where there are no taxi-stands around and

that  therefore  they should be allowed  to  park  in

places  where  you and I park our cars.  So  the  Car

Parks Division relaxed this rule some time this  year

and  allowed taxi-drivers to park in places where the

law does not allow them to park. But they abused this

privilege.  Instead  of  parking  there   and   doing

nothing,  they parked there and plied for  hire  from

those  spots. There are places provided for  them  to

ply  for  hire. They abused the privilege  after  the

rules  were relaxed. As a consequence, the  privilege

was withdrawn. But the taxi-drivers continued to park

in  places  where  they should not  park  and,  as  a

result, about 255 summonses were issued and now there

is  a  lot of correspondence between their solicitor,

the   head  of  the  Taxi-Drivers'  Association,  the

Traffic Police and the Car Parks Division. Hence  the

query in Parliament.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer given by

the  Minister was rational, but not rational  enough.

It was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>



rational  in  so  far  as breaches  of  the  law  are

concerned.  I have been informed that this  has  been

due  to  the  fact that the lawful parking facilities

that  are normally accorded to taxi-drivers are being

drastically reduced and that, as a result,  they  are

forced  to  park in the parking lots  meant  for  the

ordinary drivers.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswam (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Barker.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> There has been no reduction in the

parking  facilities for taxi-drivers. I hope  Members

of this House will also be rational and reasonable. I

also  hope  that the Member for Serangoon Gardens  is

not as stubborn as the Member for Jurong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we increase parking spaces in Singapore,

we have to answer questions in Parliament. I remember

answering  several supplementary questions front  the

Member for Bras Basah who was very concerned that  we

were  marking out more car parking places in  various

parts  of  Bras  Basah. When we  did  that,  we  were

criticised. But now an allegation has been made  that

we  are cutting down on the number of taxi-stands  in

Singapore. I assure the Member for Serangoon  Gardens

that  this  is not so. Instead, representations  have

been  made  for  an increase in the number  of  taxi-

stands.  They are being seriously considered  by  the

Car Parks Division, and if a case is made out for  an

increase  in  the  demand for  taxi-stands,  we  will

provide more taxi-stands. When we do, I hope  I  will

not  have to answer questions in this House as to why

I am taking away some hawkers' pitches?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of that

explanation, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1207 be

* The same  amendment also stood in the name of Madam Chan  Choy Siong.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to speak on the subject of gotong royong. We

know  that the Urban and Rural Services Committee  is

responsible  for  construction  work  all  over   the

island.  We  also know that a lot of money  has  been

allocated  for  construction  work,  including   road

repairs,   bridge   construction   and   water    and

electricity supply to the rural people because of the

Government's determination to improve their lot.  The

roads  in  the rural areas are normally  longer  than

those  in  the city areas. Laterite roads  are  in  a

worse  state  of disrepair than metalled  roads.  The

roads  in  the rural areas are not always kept  in  a

good  state  because  of the  limited  sum  of  money

allocated for road repairs in the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the U.R.S.C, started on a campaign of

gotong   royong,  which  means  the  undertaking   of

voluntary road construction and road repairs  by  the

rural people. The advantages of gotong royong are  as

follows.  Firstly,  if  the  people  are  engaged  in

voluntary  rural  construction work,  the  Government

will be able to save some money which can be used for

other  more urgent projects. Secondly, gotong  royong

will  promote  a sense of national consciousness  and

patriotism  and  foster friendship  among  the  rural

people.  As  a  result  of toiling  and  sweating  on

construction work in the rural areas, the people will

develop a particular love for their areas as well  as

for the country as a whole. Thirdly, we know that the

state  of disrepair of rural roads is due to lack  of

care and maintenance. The drains are clogged and  the

water  in  them overflows on to the roads  which  are

further  damaged.  If the people make  up  their  own

roads  and  drains, they will naturally  pay  special

attention to maintain them in good condition, and the

Government will therefore save a lot of public  funds

of  maintenance. Fourthly, the collective  effort  of

villagers  of  different races in a common  endeavour

will promote better understanding among them and help

to establish a multi-racial society.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>4.09 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the rural areas have responded in

great  numbers to the call made by the  U.R.S.C, for

the setting up of gotong royong. The people living in

Bukit  Timah, Bukit Panjang, Tampines, Sembawang  and

other  areas  have already, on their own,  undertaken

road  repair schemes and the results have  been  very

satisfactory.  But, unfortunately,  I  have  recently

been  given to understand that the U.R.S.C, will  no

longer  encourage gotong royong. I do  not  know  why

there  should be a change of mind on their  part.  My

guess  is that probably the people in charge want  to

avoid  the work that they will have to put  in.  They

will  have to liaise, organise, supply tools and take

part  in opening ceremonies. All this takes a lot  of

time  and trouble. It is easier for them to  ask  for

tenders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have indicated earlier, gotong royong is of

great  significance, particularly  at  this  juncture

when  we  are faced with a standstill Budget.  Gotong

royong is, in fact, necessary. Therefore, I appeal to

the U.R.S.C, to continue with it. They should not  be

afraid to face any difficulty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will explain why gotong royong

is not being encouraged further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng)</b>: Madam Chan?



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta):</b> I am not speaking.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,   Sir,   undoubtedly   a   great   deal   of

construction  work has been undertaken in  the  rural

areas.  This  has  had a marked  improvement  in  the

appearance  of  the  rural  areas.  In  spite  of  an

increase in defence expenditure, about $2 million has

been  allocated for rural development. A sum  of  $12

million  has  also been allocated for the  supply  of

electricity to the rural areas in the next few years.

We should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>



be  proud  of this scheme. However, I feel  that  the

work  in  the  rural  areas is not  progressing  fast

enough.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, it takes about a year or more

before work can be started on any scheme approved  by

the  U.R.S.C. I think some improvement should be made

in  this  regard.  If  the  Ministry  will  note  the

administrative inefficiency or causes of  delay,  and

take  action  to  remedy it, I think  work  could  be

started earlier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is in relation to the rural roads.

For some reason, roads in the rural areas are not  as

durable as those in other areas. For example,  in  my

area, after a period of eight years we find a lot  of

potholes  in  the roads. It is probably  because  the

roads  were not properly made up, or it may  be  that

the contractors did not carry out their work well and

the materials were not according to specifications. I

think  Members of Parliament in the rural areas  have

received  a great many complaints in this connection.

The  situation is rather serious because public funds

are  involved. We must see to it that the contractors

undertaking road construction and road repairs in the

rural areas carry out their work with materials  that

are  according to specifications. All the Members  of

Parliament  in the rural areas have their  eyes  wide

open  and  you  cannot  bluff them,  especially  when

complaints are forthcoming from the country folk.  If

any  contractor  is guilty of any failure  to  comply

with  the specifications, we must see to it  that  he

does not do it again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I endorse the views expressed by the Member

for Jurong on gotong royong. I think the work done by

the gotong royong people is much better than that  of

the  contractors. They use materials provided by  the

Government.  These  are genuine  and  up  to  specifi

cations.  If the work costs, say, $20,000  if  it  is

done by a contractor, it will only cost about $10,000

if it is done



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>



by  the  gotong  royong people.  The  roads-too  have

greater durability. Therefore,, we have no reason not

to encourage gotong royong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  on the question of gotong royong raised  by

the  Member for Jurong, the explanation is  this.  In

the past, gotong royong members were charged with the

responsibility of road building in the  rural  areas.

The  enthusiasm  shown  by the  volunteers  was  very

impressive.  We  were  very  appreciative   of   such

enthusiasm.  But the making of roads  by  the  gotong

royong  members  was  not  properly  organised.   For

instance,  in  the  first two days,  the  performance

would be very impressive. But after the third day  on

the  job,  which  would require a week  to  complete,

there  would be less and less workers. And the people

who  deserted their jobs included the M.P.s! So  what

did  you expect us to do? The work was only half done

when  the workers started running away. As a  result,

we  had no choice but to get in touch with the P.W.D.

to engage casual labourers to complete the work. This

was  the  problem we had to face. Of  course,  gotong

royong by itself is good and it has significance. But

the members of gotong royong were not able to sustain

their  enthusiasm  throughout the  period  needed  to

complete  the work. There was a lack of organisation.

If  the  Member for Jurong can assure us that he  can

start gotong royong in his own constituency and  make

sure  that  the  work can be completed  according  to

schedule  without  any  problem,  we  will  have   no

objection.  In  fact,  we  will  give  him  all   the

necessary  encouragement. We will also encourage  the

Members   of   Parliament   in   the   other    rural

constituencies to carry on with their gotong royong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the allegation that we are not encouraging

gotong royong because we are afraid of trouble,  this

is  unfounded. As I have already explained, there is

a good reason why gotong royong can not be encouraged

further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang complained of the one-year

or more delay



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>



in  the  commencement of work after plans  have  been

approved.  We have approved seven plans in  1968  for

the Sembawang area. Six of these schemes have already

been  completed. The remaining one is  about  80  per

cent completed. One scheme has not been completed. It

was  approved  only on 6th October  this  year.  They

allegation  of the Member for Sembawang is  therefore

totally unfounded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I must admit that he has made a

very  good suggestion on another aspect. He said that

the roads built by the contractors are not as durable

as others. If Members of Parliament or members of the

Citizens'    Consultative   Committees    in    their

constituencies should come across work undertaken  by

a  contractor  on tender, then I would urge  them  to

supervise the work from time to time. They could make

a  spot check, and the contractor would therefore  do

more  satisfactory work. I have to remind the  Member

for  Sembawang  on one point. When a  road  has  been

repaired,  the contractor doing it has  to  guarantee

for  a  period  of six months that any damage  to  it

would  be his responsibility. If the Member has  come

across  any such cases, he can draw our attention  to

them. We will then make the contractor pay for it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am still not

satisfied  with the reply given by the  Parliamentary

Secretary. He alleged that people started to run away

when the work was only half done. I do not think this

can he the general situation. There may be one or two

such  cases,  but  he cannot generalise  and  make  a

sweeping allegation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for his allegation about gotong royong, I would

say  that in my constituency we have on two occasions

completed  the  work according to schedule.  What  is

wrong with that?



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> Sir, on a point of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1207 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3101



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know that a farm school was set up in

August 1965. The main purpose was to give farm youths

basic training in agriculture. With the knowledge and

skill acquired, they could impart their knowledge and

train  the  farmers  as well. I understand  that  the

Government is spending about $90,000 per year on  the

school.  About  a dozen graduates are produced  every

year.  On the average, about $8,000 is spent on  each

graduate every year. This school also trains teachers

in the rural areas. However, the expenditure on these

teachers  is  borne by the Ministry of  Education.  I

would  like to ask whether it is worth while  to  use

this allotment on this farm school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a few more questions to ask the Minister.

First,  can the youths who have acquired a  knowledge

of agriculture



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>



from this farm school put it to good  use?  If

so,  can  the Minister tell me how? Second,  has  the

farm   school  taken  any  measures  to  enable   the

graduates  of  the  farm school to  return  to  their

former  work,  that  is,  to engage  in  agricultural

activities? According to my understa.nding, as I have

stated  a while ago, these youths for various reasons

try  to  seek other jobs. This means that the  $8,000

that  is  being spent on each graduate is  wasted.  I

would  like  to  ask the Minister to look  into  this

problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  the  farm  school  organised  by  the

Primary Production Department started in August 1965.

Since  July  last year, there have been 63  graduates

from this school. Forty-six of these youths were from

the  rural  areas. They received one year's training.

The  other  17  were  trainees  from  the  Teachers'

Training College.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were given a two-year training course. After

this,   they  returned  to  the  Teachers'  Training

College to do one more year's training. Now they have

already  become  qualified  teachers  and  have  been

posted  to the vocational schools in the rural  areas

teaching subjects on agriculture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the other 46 graduates, namely, those

youths from the rural areas, the employment situation

is  as  follows. Thirteen of them returned  to  their

farms. Seven were employed in farms doing farm  work.

Another   seven  were  engaged  in  the  fish-rearing

business.   Two   were  engaged  as   phar-maceutical

salesmen.  Six of them got other jobs.  Ten  of  them

took  up  jobs relating to farm work. There  was  one

whose  occupation  was not clear.  This  is  how  the

graduates from the farm school were employed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expenditure on the farm school for the three

years  1965  to  1967 amounted to  $200,000.  On  the

average,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>



for every student we have to spend about $2,232. This

shows that the Member for Jurong was dreaming when he

said that $8,000 was spent on every student. This  is

too  large  a  figure. There is  a  great  difference

between $2,232 and the $8,000 quoted by the Member. I

do  not  think that the running of the  school  is  a

waste  of public funds. I feel that the farm  school,

under  the  supervision  of  the  Primary  Production

Department, is able to impart agricultural  knowledge

to  our  rural folk and that it is very popular  with

the  farmers.  I  feel that the expenditure  on  this

school is worth while.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the

Parliamentary Secretary said that $2,232 was spent on

each  student.  But I understand  that  ten  of  the

graduates did not take up farm jobs. In this respect,

we have wasted about

$20,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng):</b> May I remind

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this subhead, I would like the Minister to

supply me with certain facts. I want to know on  what

new primary production projects will the expenses  be

incurred and what good will these projects do to  the

farmers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Sir, the projects which are

expected  to  be  officially opened in  1969  are  as

follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Fishing Port and Auction Markets at Jurong;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Pig and Poultry Research and Training Institute at Sembawang; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Southeast Asian Fisheries Research Development Centre at Changi.





<br><br>Some  of the above projects have already been started

but  have not been officially opened. A sum of $1,000

has  been  provided for these official  openings  but

this sum is hardly enough for one official opening.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1207 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3201.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the project of a Fishing Port and Auction

Markets was mooted for quite some time. The buildings

for  these  purposes  at Jurong were  completed  some

months ago. The Minister has told this House a  while

ago  of  the resistance met by his Ministry in trying

to  resite the fish auctioneers from Ellenborough and

Beach  Road  Markets to Jurong. I am  sure  that  the

removal of the Ellenborough auctioneers to Jurong has

been  made  easier when the Ellenborough  Market  was

gutted  by  fire  in  January  this  year.  Will  the

Minister enlighten the House on what steps have  been

taken in this respect?



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>4.39 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, as I said, initially there was

resistance  from the fish agents at Ellenborough  and

Clyde  Terrace  Markets. In fact,  there  was  strong

resistance  and representations were made to  several

Members of Parliament, including the Member for Kreta

Ayer.  For  that  reason, the move  was  delayed.  My

officials  have been very patient in this matter  and

have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>



not  used  the  big  stick. Rather,  they  have  used

methods of persuasion and now all fish merchants  are

anxious to go to Jurong. But to show their bona fides

and in order that the allegation is not made that the

Director of Primary Production is forcing them to  go

to  Jurong,  he has asked them to pay  a  deposit  of

$500.  This  money has been paid and shows  that  the

fish  agents and merchants are not being  forced  but

that  they  want to go. But then when they agreed  to

go, they asked for more space at the Fishing Port and

Auction Markets, and this is being provided.  I  have

the  figures  here. In fact, an initial  area  of  11

acres   has  been  developed  and  another  28  acres

reserved for future expansion. Seven hundred feet  of

wharf  is ready for immediate use. The fish merchants

want  more  office space and 73 units of offices  are

now  being  constructed  for them.  The  building  of

office  space is taking a little time and so also  is

the  building of extra market space. But the Director

of   Primary   Production  assures  me   that   these

requirements will be met early next year  and  it  is

expected  that  the  move can take place  immediately

thereafter; I would say, at the earliest, in  January

and, at the latest, in February next year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1207 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3203.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this expenditure is for the Fishing Training

Centre. I think the centre will be giving courses  on

deep-sea fishing. I want to know whether it  will  be

giving  instruction to the trainees  on  the  use  of

weapons because, in the past, our fishermen have been

threatened by pirates when they have gone out to sea.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Training Centre

has  not  begun  operations yet,  but  we  expect  to

commence courses in the middle of next year. Two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>



types  of  courses will be provided. One is  a  short

course  of three months' duration for people who  are

already  fishermen, and the other is a longer  course

of  one year's duration for those who have no fishing

experience. For the short course, about 20  fishermen

will  be trained at a time and for the longer  course

about  50  "school-leavers", if one can put  it  that

way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong suggests that trainees should

also  be  instructed in the use of firearms in  order

that  they  can protect themselves from pirates  when

they are at sea. This would appear to be a reasonable

suggestion  provided the firearms  are  not  used  on

Singapore  island  and increase  the  number  of  kid

nappings  that  we already have here. A  better  idea

would  be  to provide them with training in  firearms

not  for use at sea but for national defence. We  are

seriously considering training these fishermen in the

use  of  arms by sending them for a short  period  of

military  training with the Ministry  of  Defence  as

soon   as  their  training  as  fishermen  has   been

completed.

<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 1207 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to speak on the National Development

Division,  particularly in regard to the Housing  and

Development  Board  and the urban renewal  scheme.  I

wish   to  express  my  views  and  also  make   some

criticisms on these topics. No one can deny that  the

Government has achieved great success in its  housing

programme. Even some members of the Barisan  Sosialis

have admitted that the Government has been successful

in  this field. This success can be attributed to the

efforts of the National Development Division and  the

Minister for National Development.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board has built

thousands  and thousands of flats all over Singapore.

Generally  speaking,  the flats  constructed  by  the

Board  are  of  the low-cost type and people  in  the

middle  and  lower income groups are  able  to  enjoy

modern  housing  facilities.  We  can  now  see   the

materialisation  of  the  Government's  programme  in

providing  low-cost  housing  for  the  lower  income

group. The Government has fulfilled its promise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the standard of living in Singapore has

improved, it is probable that those in the middle  or

upper  middle income groups will be able to buy their

own  houses,  and, in view of this, the  Housing  and

Development  Board  has started  the  home  ownership

scheme. The tenants of Housing Board flats can either

buy  or  lease their flats. But beginning  from  this

year  there  has been a slight change in the  Board's

policy.  I understand the Board have decided to  sell

as  many  of  their flats as possible to the  people,

irrespective  of whether they are new  applicants  or

existing tenants. The people are allowed to make  use

of  their deposits in the Central Provident  Fund  to

buy  flats  constructed by the Board  in  order  that

those  in  the lower income group may own  their  own

houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wish to raise one point. Not everybody in

Singapore  has  sufficient deposits  in  the  Central

Provident  Fund  to  buy a flat. For  example,  those

hawkers  who  are  self-employed  do  not  have   any

deposits  in the Central Provident Fund and  so  they

cannot buy their own houses. The same also applies in

the case of widows who are riot working. Furthermore,

those who are casual workers may not necessarily have

C.P.F, contributions.  As  far  as  I   know,   the

Government's  policy  is  that  all  the  flats,   if

possible  should  be sold. In these circumstances,  I

wish  to ask the Minister what consideration will  be

given  to  the  categories  of  people  that  I  have

mentioned.  Will  they be allowed to  continue  their

tenancy  in the Board's flats if they are  unable  to

buy  the  flats they are occupying? If they  are  not

allowed to continue tenancy in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>



their  flats, will they be asked to leave  the  flats

they  are  occupying and move to some rural area  far

away  from  their places of work? in my constituency,

about  90  per  cent of the tenants living  in  these

flats  are rather worried about this policy.  I  hope

the Minister will answer the queries I have raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next point I wish to deal with is in regard

to  the urban renewal scheme now being undertaken  by

the  National  Development Division. No  sane  person

will  oppose this scheme, but the question  is  this.

How  are we to improve the technical aspects  of  the

urban  renewal  scheme?  This question  deserves  our

attention.  We  all know that most of the  people  in

Singapore  are  concentrated in the  city,  in  areas

around  Robinsons and Collyer Quay. These places  are

occupied by large business enterprises, but the small

businesses   are   found  in  Chinatown,   in   areas

surrounding  Kreta  Ayer. The  small  businessmen  in

these   areas   have   a  long-established   business

inherited  from  their  ancestors,  and  they  depend

entirely  on  their  business for a  livelihood.  The

premises  in  which they operate their  business  are

very  old and the rent is therefore very cheap. There

are  some  misgivings among these  small  businessmen

because they fear that their places of business  will

be  affected  by the urban renewal scheme.  They  are

worried  that if a certain area in the city is  zoned

for  urban  renewal, they will have to  be  resettled

elsewhere.  Where  they will be resettled  remains  a

question.   In  other  words,  there  is   no   prior

indication of where they will be resettled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we know that socialist democracy means that the people must work for what they get. As the urban renewal scheme is being undertaken vigorously, these small businessmen have to be resettled elsewhere. If we do not pull down the old buildings, we cannot have new ones. I wish to

elaborate   on  this  point.  On  the  principle   of

socialism -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswam (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Before you elaborate, may I inform you

that we have just seven minutes left?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> I will cut short my speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>(In Mandarin)</i>: The people made sacrifices when the

Government took over a valuable piece of land for the

Golden  Mile  project. What did the  Government  give

them  in return? Of course, they were allocated flats

and  shop-houses, but they have to pay rents at about

$500  to  $600  per  month for the  new  premises  as

compared  with  only $100 per month  rent  for  their

former  premises. Therefore, they prefer to  stay  in

their old premises. Furthermore, the new premises are

in  the  outlying  areas and so  their  business  has

slackened.  Great hardship has been caused  to  these

people  as  a result of the resettlement.  We  should

therefore  set  up  an  agency  in  the  Ministry  of

National Development -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswam (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Madam Chan, the matter is in your

hands.  The  whole question is: do you just  want  to

speak or do you want a reply as well?



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> Can I ask another two or

three more questions?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswam (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You can take as long as you like until

five minutes past five o'clock if you

do not want a reply. If you want a reply -



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> I will take one minute more

and the Minister can then reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The Parliamentary Secretary will reply.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, may I ask

the  Minister whether he will consider setting  up  a

resettlement  agency  in  the  Ministry  of  National

Development  to  look after the  interests  of  those

people  affected by the urban renewal scheme  and  to

consider  the  complaints  and  grievances  of  those

affected.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I am afraid there is not much time for me to reply.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta is worried that some people who

do  not  contribute  to  the Central  Provident  Fund

cannot  afford to put down deposits for the  purchase

of  Housing  Board  flats. I will  enlighten  her  by

saying  that the Government will not force the people

to  buy  their  rented flats if they  are  not  in  a

position  to  do  so.  Of  course,  the  Housing  and

Development Board will reduce the difficulties to the

minimum.  The  sale of flats in Delta is  now  in  an

experimental  stage and has not been  finalised  yet.

Only a proportion of the flats are being offered  for

sale.  At  the moment, we have 100,000 Housing  Board

flats of which only ten per cent have been sold.  The

Government does not adopt a rigid and harsh  attitude

towards the occupiers of the flats which we intend to

sell.  We welcome those who are able to buy the flats

in  which  they are staying. But the Government  will

not force the people to buy such flats if they cannot

put  down  the required deposits from their  contribu

tions  to  the Central Provident Fund. We  can  offer

alternative accommodation to those who cannot  afford

to buy such flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta has also said that the owners

of  shops  affected by the urban renewal scheme  were

offered alternative premises in out-of-the-way places

and  that they suffered a loss in business.  I  would

like   to  state  the  policy  with  regard  to   the

allocation  of  alternative accommodation.  Generally

speaking,  the  affected shop-owners  are  given  the

choice  of  locality to which they  want  to  remove.

Normally,   we  do  not  force  them  to  remove   to

localities  which they do not like.  Therefore,  they

cannot  blame the Housing Board if they make a  wrong

choice  of  locality where there are not many  people

and their business is adversely affected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reiterate the policy of the Housing

Board -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1208 -



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1208 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The same  amendment also stood in the names of Mr Tay Boon  Too and Mr P. Govindaswamy.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have some views to air on the subhead

"Director  of Public Works, Grade C". This department

is spending a great deal of money on the construction

of    roads   and   bridges.   In   view    of    our

industrialisation programme and national development,

I feel that this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>



department  should  have  close  liaison  with  other

Ministries,  such  as the Ministry of  Communications

and  the  Ministry of Defence. Roads  and  pedestrian

bridges are being built by the P.W.D, involving great

sums  of  money.  We often find that soon  after  the

roads  have  been repaired, they are  damaged  again.

They  will thus need repairing again. The P.U.B, will

dig  up the road to lay down cables. In the end  they

will have to make up the road again. This will result

in a great loss of money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also certain hazards for road users under

these  conditions. Many accidents occurred in  Scotts

Road when construction work was going on there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pedestrian path was built along the road. One or

two months after its completion the authorities found

it  necessary  to widen the road. As  a  result,  the

pedestrian  path was broken up. After  the  road  was

widened, the pedestrian path was again constructed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction of side walks and roads costs a lot

of  money. If there had been proper liaison among the

Ministries concerned, large sums of money could  have

been  saved. They would not have squandered money  in

that manner. The construction of a road should not be

done  in  an ad hoc manner. It is a long-term project

and   there   should  be  co-ordination   among   the

departments concerned to ensure that there will be no

waste of public funds. In addition, there will be  no

traffic  congestion at the places where  construction

work  is being undertaken and there will also be less

accidents.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I support the Member for  Delta.  The

number  of vehicles in Singapore is increasing  every

day.  The  roads  seem  to be  getting  narrower  and

narrower.  They do not seem to be able to  cope  with

the  increased number of vehicles, especially  during

the  peak  hours  when people go to  and  from  their

offices.  The  Government, of course,  realises  this

position  and has taken steps to wi~1en the roads  in

order  to  improve traffic conditions and  solve  the

problem



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>



of  congestion.  This  responsibility  falls  on  the

Public Works Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the engineers in the Public Works Department adopt only temporary measures to meet the present circumstances. Their only means of improving the roads is to widen them. Of course this will temporarily solve the problem of congestion on the roads. But in the long run, the widening of the roads

is  not  a permanent solution as a means of improving

traffic  congestions.  The  number  of  vehicles   is

increasing  every  day. Does it mean  also  that  the

roads  will  have to be widened every day?  When  the

engineers in the P.W.D, try to widen the roads  every

year, they should consider the fact that Singapore is

only  an  island of 224 square miles. On the average,

about 8,000 people live in a square mile. Our land is

very valuable. The widening of roads will encroach on

many other areas. There will be no problem if a place

has  few  people. But the areas where the  roads  are

being  widened  are  usually crowded.  Demolition  of

structures will have to take place. We will then have

to   resettle  people  to  another  place  and   also

compensate  them.  From the  point  of  view  of  the

people,  it  is  an encroachment on  their  right  of

property and freedom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me enumerate the disadvantages of widening

roads.  First, it will cause a feeling of  resentment

in  the people. When part of the land is affected  by

the  widening  of  a road, the people  affected  will

always find difficulty moving to another place.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, they feel that the widening of roads will

inconvenience  them and they are disgusted  with  it.

Road  widening also adversely affects their business.

We  are  aware  that  quite  often  a  whole  row  of

shophouses are affected and the shopkeepers  find  it

difficult  to carry on their business. As  a  result,

their  livelihood is affected. I wish to  inform  the

House of an instance of the people in my constituency

who are affected by the widening of roads.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, parts of Paya Lebar Road need widening. At Paya

Lebar,   there   is   a  road   which   is   in   two

constituencies. This is rather strange. The  engineer

of  the Public Works Department who was in charge  of

this  project  either  purposely  or  unintentionally

constructed the road to lead into two constituencies.

But  only  the portion of the road in my constituency

was affected by road widening. I do not know why this

was so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The widening of Upper Paya Lebar Road has created a

somewhat odd situation. The main part of the road  is

very  wide.  But  before reaching Paya  Lebar  Police

Station,  it is very narrow. Therefore,  there  is  a

bottleneck  at  this  end and  very  often  there  is

traffic  congestion. And it will be strange if  there

are  no  accidents at this place. It is not difficult

to  imagine what will happen there. I have  consulted

the   engineer   concerned,   but   he   evades   his

responsibility. He says that the plan  has  not  been

finalised.  Until  today, nothing has  been  done  to

improve  the  situation, and I am sure  Members  will

agree with me that this is rather odd. If there is  a

bottleneck, how can you expect to have a free flow of

traffic? Just fill a bottle with water, then plug  up

the neck of the bottle and try to pour out the water.

See whether it can flow out freely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In principle, I fully support the widening of roads.

But   we   should   take   into   consideration   the

topographical  condition of  the  area  affected.  We

should  also  take into consideration  the  financial

means  of our people. If the project is not suitable,

we  should think of some other schemes. For instance,

we  can  build a traffic network above the ground  or

build underground tunnels. This new plan is worth our

consideration. Of course, I realise that the  traffic

problem  is  a  major problem in all big  cities.  In

London  and Tokyo, the number of vehicles  cannot  be

less  than  that in Singapore. I am sure it  is  many

times  more. But I do not see how the roads in London

can be any wider than those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>



in  Singapore. From this fact, we should consider our

problem especially when it relates to the size of the

land   and  when  the  problem  affects  the   people

financially.  We  should try  to  solve  the  traffic

problem  in  this  light. We must  not  be  like  the

engineer  who  is in charge of the Upper  Paya  Lebar

Road road-widening project. He ordered the demolition

of houses as he wished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, I hope that the P.W.D, road engineers

will  learn  a lesson from London, like  building  an

underground railway system which, in my opinion, is a

very  good  system. The underground  tube  system  in

London  provides  the  major  means  of  transporting

millions  of workers in London with great  speed  and

almost  without any accidents. It is  both  fast  and

safe.  I feel that our engineers here should  take  a

cue from them. I must say that Rome was not built  in

a  day.  Of  course, time is necessary to  solve  the

traffic   problem.  Anyway,  we  have   to   consider

carefully our plans to solve it.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswam (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tay, there is one more Member who

has  signed  his  name  to  his  amendment.  And  the

Minister has to reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I have almost

finished. I have only two more sentences left.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswam (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am sure the House will be grateful

if those two sentences can usefully be omitted?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

only  wish  to  say a few words. The construction  of

roundabouts  at  cross-roads  costs  Government  some

money  and  also causes inconvenience to the  public.

The   demolition  of  such  roundabouts  again  costs

Government  some money and also causes  inconvenience

to the public. I would like to know from the Minister

if care can be taken in planning the roundabouts. One

example  is the roundabout at the junction of Rochore

Canal Road, Jalan Besar and Bencoolen Street. It  was

constructed only a few years ago and now it is to  be

demolished.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I deal with each

Member  in turn? In the case of the Member for Delta,

may  I say that, in my view, there was much substance

and  common  sense in what she said  about  the  road

digging  that  goes  on  in Singapore.  When  my  pre

decessor, Mr Lim Kim San, took over the Ministry  of

National  Development, he was not satisfied with  the

combined efforts of the Public Works Department,  the

Public   Utilities  Board,  the  Singapore  Telephone

Board,  the  Traffic Department and the  Registry  of

Vehicles at either digging up or defacing the road or

drawing lines on the road. It was then common to  see

a road being resurfaced and then a week later another

statutory  department digs a trench either along  the

road  or  across it to lay pipes for water or  cables

for electricity, gas or telephones. The then Minister

for National Development formed a committee called  a

Liaison Committee whereby the heads of various depart

ments  in the statutory boards would meet - in  fact,

they  have  since  met every month -  to  co-ordinate

their  plans in an effort to cause less inconvenience

to  the  public.  There has been  co-operation,  but,

unfortunately,  it has not met with one  hundred  per

cent  success  and  there have been  instances  where

roads have been dug up immediately after resurfacing.

This  is  highly undesirable. Only last week,  I  had

occasion  to  call  the heads of  departments  for  a

meeting  to  try  once  again  to  co-ordinate  their

efforts  at  road digging. I asked them whether  they

all  could  use one trench. They said, "No."  It  was

dangerous  to  put  gas pipes too close  to  electric

cables.  I  am  no expert. Some had to dig  one  foot

under   the  road  and  some  had  to  go  six   feet

underneath.  And they said that they  could  not  dig

together.  Otherwise the public would  be  even  more

inconvenienced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To go back to the law, it provides for - statutory

boards to dig a road as and when they please to lay a

gas   pipe  or  water  main.  I  think  the  law   is

reasonable.  Otherwise  you  and  I  will  not   have

electricity, water or gas. So



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>



roads must be dug up. I think we must accept that.  I

can amend the law and take away these powers and only

allow  statutory  boards to dig up a  road  when  the

Director  of Public Works gives them permission.  But

what  happens  in  the  case of  an  emergency?  What

happens if there is a gas leak and the road is likely

to  explode? What happens when there is a water leak?

Do  we wait for a flood? There are cases of emergency

which  must be met at once. Hence this law.  But  the

net  result of this meeting was a decision that, when

a road is newly surfaced, nobody can dig up that road

without  the  permission of the  Director  of  Public

Works except in cases of emergency.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given this direction and we will see how it

works. There is apparently a considerable measure  of

co-ordination but in a few cases there  is  not.  The

Member  for  Delta  has mentioned  Scotts  Road.  She

passes there every day and I am in sympathy with her.

I  pass along other roads which have been affected in

the  same  way, and I am sure Members here pass  some

other  roads,  like  the Member for  Paya  Lebar  who

appears  to  be  against the widening of  Paya  Lebar

Road. He says there are lots of vehicles in Singapore

and  we  should  meet this increase  in  our  traffic

problems  by  other processes, for instance,  digging

under the road or going overhead. He mentions London,

which  has  an  underground system, and Tokyo,  which

also  has an underground system and a monorail system

over the ground.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have considered these possibilities. A monorail

is  a very expensive mass transit system and, for the

moment,  it  is out of the reach of our pockets.  The

underground system has been looked into and  we  have

the  reports  of several experts. I will  not  bother

Members  with these reports, but for the  benefit  of

the  Member  for  Paya Lebar, the difference  between

Paya  Lebar and London is this. In London,  when  you

dig, there is no water; but in Paya



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>



Lebar, when you dig one foot, it is flooded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar also complains of the

bottleneck at Paya Lebar Police Station. Last year he

made  representations on behalf of  his  constituents

living  along  Paya Lebar Road who were very  unhappy

about  having  their houses or part of  their  houses

demolished  for  the sake of road widening.  This  is

natural,  but I think I can deal with the  Member  in

one   sentence,  by  telling  him  that  if  all  his

representations  were accepted,  the  whole  of  Paya

Lebar  Road would be like the junction at Paya  Lebar

Police  Station. You will have a road  which  is  in,

out,  narrow and wide from Paya Lebar Police  Station

to Geylang Serai.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson is upset by the fact that

roundabouts  are  going to be disturbed.  There  have

been other circuses in Singapore which have also been

eliminated.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> There are so many of them!



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> One of them is in front of the Istana

and  another  one  is  Grange Road  circus,  and  the

experts have apparently changed their thinking  about

the  Rochore  junction. Recent traffic  studies  have

indicated that an improved circulation of traffic can

be  attained  by  turning Jalan Besar  and  Bencoolen

Street  into  a  one-way  system.  For  this  to   be

feasible,  the  traffic circus has to  be  abolished,

just  like the circus in front of the Istana and  the

Grange Road circus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I end on one note by asking Members of

Parliament to let me know if there is too  much  road

digging  in  their constituencies,  or  a  road  just

surfaced has been dug up the next day or next week. I

only  travel  along certain roads. I do  -not  go  to

every  constituency. I shall be grateful  if  Members

will  let  me  know if our road-digging efforts  have

upset their constituents so that I can see to it that

something is done to reduce the inconvenience caused.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I think the

Minister is at fault in one part of his reply. He, of

course, has the right not to accept the repre

sentations which I made on behalf of the residents of

my constituency. But why does he not demolish Paya

Lebar Police Station so that the road can be widened,

otherwise there will be a bottleneck? The police

station should be demolished so that the sides of the

road can be parallel. The residents will not complain

if the police station is demolished because it is on

Government land. But it is the residents' land which

has been acquired while the Government land is left

alone.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, if the land on which Paya Lebar

Police  Station stands is to be acquired  I  have  to

take  on the Minister for Defence. This is the  first

time a bottleneck at Paya Lebar has been drawn to  my

attention  and I assure the Member that I  will  look

further  into  it and perhaps accept  his  submission

that the road at this junction should be widened.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw

the amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1210

be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that the land area in our Republic is

only  224 square miles. But like other countries,  we

still  have  the  division between  rural  and  urban

areas. According to a survey held in 1967, there  are

about 550,000 people living in the rural areas,  that

is to say, about one-third of our population is found

in   the  rural  areas.  They  live  in  unauthorised

structures built some 10 to 20 years ago. They had no

building plans for the construction of their huts  or

houses.  But now, 20 years later, their attap  houses

have  to be repaired and the same materials were used

for  repair. Since there were no building  plans  for

their structures, their applications for repair  were

invariably  turned down. The rural people  then  took

the  law  into  their own hands by carrying  out  the

repairs without applying for permission to do so, and

when  the  repairs  were completed,  the  authorities

served  summonses on them. Action was promptly  taken

by the authorities to demolish whatever was put up by

them.  As a result of this drastic action, the  rural

folk  are suffering great hardship. They do not  know

where to air their grievances. Will the Minister give

special  consideration to their applications for  the

repair of their huts built 10 to 20 years ago?  There

should  be  a relaxation of the regulations governing

the  applications  for repairs. In other  words,  the

authorities should not insist on the production of  a

building  plan  and evidence that the structures  are

more than 10 years old.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next point I wish to raise is this. In

rural areas like Paya Lebar these have been cases  of

natural  calamities such as houses being  crushed  by

fallen coconut trees and the roofs being blown off by

the wind. It is, of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>



course,  not  possible to stop these  calamities  but

there  is one thing we can do. In the event  of  such

calamities,   can   the  authorities   give   special

permission  for immediate repairs to be  carried  out

without  going through the rigmarole of applying  and

waiting  for approval? Otherwise the people  affected

may have to sleep on the road or even in the pigsties

before approval is finally given. I hope the Minister

will,    in   these   circumstances,   give   special

consideration to such cases instead of  insisting  on

compliance with the routine procedure.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Member  for Paya Lebar raised matters concerning

attap  huts  in  the rural areas. He  suggested  that

attap huts which are in existence for more than 10 or

20   years  should  be  given  special  consideration

without having to comply with the normal procedure of

application for repairs. I am afraid I am  unable  to

give  a definite answer to this query. But, generally

speaking,  the age of attap huts in the  rural  areas

can be proved by the owners by way of rent receipts.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they are more than ten years old and require

repairs, we will give consideration to the merits  of

each  case,  depending,  of course,  on  whether  the

structures  were  put up legally or  whether  special

permission ha-d first been obtained. I do  not  think

it  is  difficult to get approval for repairs  to  be

carried  out  if  the procedures have  been  complied

with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of damage to huts as a result of natural

calamities,  I think prompt permission is  given  for

repairs  to  be  carried out. This, of  course,  will

depend  on  whether or not the houses  are  numbered.

Usually  special permission is given in the  case  of

numbered houses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, 1

wish   to  raise  another  point.  The  Parliamentary

Secretary  has not paid attention to what I  said.  I

referred to unauthorised structures put up 10  or  20

years  ago.  This  means that they  are  un-numbered,

otherwise the occupiers will have no problem at all.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>



The  Parliamentary Secretary was rather  cunning  and

equivocal  in his reply. He said that it depended  on

this  and  on  that.  But when the  application  goes

finally  to  the  Chief  Building  Surveyor,  it   is

rejected.  Ninety-nine out of  a  hundred  cases  are

rejected.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

if  the  Member for Paya Lebar will spend  some  time

studying  the  existing  regulations  governing   the

repairs  of  houses, such as the Integration  of  the

Local Government Ordinance and other related laws,  I

think  he will appreciate that there must be  certain

prerequisites  before repairs  can  be  carried  out.

According to the law, the Chief Building Surveyor can

give special permission without adhering strictly  to

the normal procedure for repairs to be carried out if

a  structure is in a state of disrepair and a  hazard

to human life. But an application has to be made, and

we will give sympathetic consideration to it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In view of the

satisfactory  reply,  I  beg leave  to  withdraw  the

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,571,540 for Head 1210 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1301 -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1301 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judging from the large number of advertisements of

medicines  in  newspapers and  magazines,  one  would

think that Singapore is either a very sick nation  or

a   nation  that  thrives  on  medicines.  I  am  not

objecting  to these advertisements, but I would  like

to  know  from the Minister whether all the medicines

advertised  have any effect, even harmful effect,  on

the  sick. Can he enlighten me on the measures  being

taken to eliminate useless or harmful medicines  from

the market an-d what measures are taken to test these

medicines before allowing them to be put on sale?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Joo Chiat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

understand that it has always been our policy to pro

mote local staff whenever there is a vacancy and a

suitable local person is available. I take it that

this policy has not changed in the Ministry of

Health, although Ministers may change.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether the Minister is aware of the recent

occurrence  of a promotion exercise of  the  surgical

staff  in  the Outram Road General Hospital when  our

local  surgical registrars were ignored and the  post

of a Grade `G' Surgeon was given to a non-citizen. If

the  local  surgical registrars  measure  up  to  the

foreigner,  it  is  possible that there  has  been  a

miscarriage of justice in this exercise. Perhaps  the

Minister   can   indicate  the   reasons   for   this

occurrence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the Member for Anson  has  said  that

people  get the impression that Singapore is a nation

of  sick  people  because  of  the  large  number  of

advertisements of medicines in the newspapers.  I  do

not think I can agree entirely with him on that point

because,  on the contrary, it can also be interpreted

that   Singapore   is  a  nation  of   vigorous   and

enterprising people who try to exploit every means to

effect a sale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, turning to the offensive types of medical

advertisements,  with the passing  of  the  Medicines

(Advertisement and Sale) (Amendment) Act  which  will

come   into   force  in  the  future,  advertisements

relating to medicines and- remedies for the treatment

of  a number of diseases as listed in the Schedule of

the  Act  will be banned. In addition, it  will  also

prohibit  the  advertisement  of  medical  skills  or

services pertaining to medical matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is no specific legislation requiring

the  testing  and approval of drugs before  they  are

offered for sale in the state, the provisions of  the

Sale  of Food and Drugs Ordinance require that  drugs

conform  to  the standards laid down in  the  British

Pharmacopceia  and  the British Pharmaceutical  Codex

which specify standards for a wide range of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>



drugs  sold  in compliance with these standards.  All

drugs  which  are considered in any way injurious  or

toxic are controlled under the Poisons Ordinance  and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance and are only available  for

sale   to   members   of  the   public   on   medical

prescriptions.  These controls  ensure  that  harmful

drugs are not made available to the public except  on

competent  medical  advice.  A  measure  of  indirect

control is also exercised in that invoices and  drugs

packages  imported  are checked to ensure  conformity

with  our laws. If the Member for An-son comes across

any drugs which are being sold -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> I am not a drug addict.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> - and which he considers may be

harmful  to consumers, he can give me the information

and I will see whether I can apply the provisions  of

the Ordinances which I have just outlined.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Joo Chiat spoke on the promotion of

an  expatriate  officer  in  preference  to  a  local

officer.  It is always the policy of the Ministry  to

promote  local people, but it must be  based  on  all

things being equal. On the other hand, if we have  an

outstanding expatriate officer who is far better than

the  other  applicants who may be local officers,  we

must  adopt the policy that the best person gets  the

post.  But  we  did  not make the  selection  in  the

particular  case referred to by the  Member  for  Joo

Chiat.  The  selection was made by an impartial  body

called  the  Public Service Commission and  how  they

judge  a  person's competence and ability  is  within

their knowledge and is not subject to question by the

Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1201.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to speak on the services in the emergency war-

d of the General Hospital. As outpatient services are

provided in all clinics, the outpatient clinic in the

General  Hospital has fewer emergency cases  to  deal

with.  A person need not go there if his life is  not

in  danger. But if he is a casualty in an accident or

he  meets with a sudden mishap, he is admitted to the

emergency ward of the General Hospital for treatment.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the officials in the clinic appear not to have

the correct attitude in rendering their services.  It

may  be because the clinic is short of staff.  I  can

recall several incidents. As a result of the shortage

of  staff in this particular clinic, many people  who

were  brought there in an emergency died because they

were  not  treated in time. Had the number  of  staff

been  increased, the mortality rate  would  not  have

been  so  high. The lives of some people  might  have

been saved. We should provide the necessary staff for

this  clinic  so  that they can cope  with  emergency

cases and render medical help to the needy. Otherwise

we  will  receive more and more complaints about  the

services rendered by this particular clinic.  I  hope

the  Minister  will pay attention to this  particular

problem.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to

the  Member for Della, I would say that it is  rather

interesting  to hear her allege that,  because  there

was a shortage of staff in the emergency clinic, many

people  had died. I am just wondering how  she  could

know  these  people  had died  because  there  was  a

shortage  of  staff.  People  have  died  from  other

causes.  This is the first time I have heard of  such

an  allegation  coming  from her.  If  she  had  made

specific  complaints to me, certainly  I  would  have

looked into the matter.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I will provide

the Minister with the necessary evidence later. I beg

leave to withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 1302 be

reduced by $l00*.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The   same  amendment also stood in the  name  of Madam Choy Chan Siong.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, hospitals and- clinics are supposed to provide

facilities and services to people who require medical

treatment.  But I regret to say that these facilities

and  services are often not available to the  people.

As  a result of the discourtesy and arrogant attitude

of  the nurses and other members of the staff -  they

sometimes  utter unbecoming words -  people  who  can

afford  it prefer to go to private clinics or private

hospitals. They cannot stand the discourtesy and arro

gant attitude of the nurses and other members of  the

staff in Government hospitals and clinics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to cite the case of a mother who took

her   child  to  a  Government  clinic  for   medical

treatment.  Unfortunately for her, she had  forgotten

to  bring the child's birth certificate when she went

to  the  clinic.  She was scolded by  the  nurse  who

attended to her. The nurse uttered these unkind words

to  her,  "Why have you forgotten to bring the  birth

certificate,   whereas   you   do   not   forget   to

`manufacture' children?" This, Mr Speaker, Sir,  was

most disgraceful



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>



as  the hospital staff are Government servants.  This

was  embarrassing to the mother, although  both  were

women.  Such incidents have also occurred at  Kandang

Kerbau Hospital. I hope the-Minister will take  steps

to  improve the situation and see that such incidents

are not repeated.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would like to

raise  two  points regarding Kandang Kerbau Hospital.

We all know that in the past a good percentage of the

mortality  rate was due to tuberculosis, but  now  in

most  cases  people -die of cancer. Many  women  have

died  of womb cancer. This is about one-third of  the

female mortality rate. The situation is very serious.

We  do not know what steps the Ministry of Health  is

taking  to  remedy the situation, especially  against

womb cancer. In the case of tuberculosis, there is  a

semi-Government   body,  S.A.T.A.,   which   provides

facilities for the prevention and treatment  of  T.B.

At  the moment, there may be a cancer centre but  the

services  rendered are slow. No prophylactic measures

have been taken to prevent the occurrence of cancer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that a cancer preventive centre be set up

in  Kandang Kerbau Hospital so that people  suspected

of  having cancer or even people who do not have  the

disease  may  go there for examination. According  to

medical  science  cancer  is  curable  in  the  early

stages. I hope the Minister will set up such a centre

in  Kandang Kerbau Hospital. I know that the  doctors

in  this  hospital agree with me on this point,  but,

according  to them, it may well be that the  Minister

did  not  set  up  this centre  because  of  lack  of

finances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I wish to speak on the services rendered by

Kandang  Kerbau Hospital. Many pregnant  mothers  who

went there found that there were not enough beds  for

them  in  the wards. Very often they had to sleep  in

beds  along  the  corridor after their  delivery.  It

would  be several days before they could get beds  in

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>



wards.  This  is a very dangerous situation,  because

after  delivery a mother may suffer an ailment caused

by  being  exposed to the unfavourable  elements.  If

there  is no special care for these women after  they

have  given  birth, their health may be impaired  and

even  their  lives may be endangered. I do  not  know

whether  the  Minister has any plans  to  remedy  the

situation. I hope he will give an answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first

reply  to  the  allegations made by  the  Member  for

Geylang  Serai. I cannot agree more with  the  Member

that  it  is  important to ensure high  standards  of

courtesy  among  our  public  servants.  However,   I

believe  there  has been an all-round improvement  in

this  respect.  In  a  large Ministry,  such  as  the

Ministry  of Health which has about 20,000  employees

approximately  one-third of all Government  employees

there  are  bound  to  be complaints  against  a  few

employees now and then. Where details have been given

in specific complaints, investigations have been made

and  appropriate  action has been taken  against  the

offenders.  I can assure Members that should  any  of

them   have  any  complaints  to  make,  these   will

certainly  be looked into. In fact, the  Ministry  of

Health   will  be  extremely  grateful   to   receive

authenticated complaints. They must be  specific  and

not   general   or   vague,   so   that   appropriate

disciplinary action can be taken against  the  offend

ers.  By this means, the Ministry of Health hopes  to

raise  the standard of efficiency and service of  its

staff to higher levels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the question of cancer in women brought

up  by the Member for Delta, I cannot agree with  her

more  that  cancer  is a major and grave  problem  in

Singapore. Unfortunately, medical experts would  tell

us  that  the cancer research carried out up  to  the

present  has  not been able to tell us what  actually

causes  cancer. Perhaps the Member for Joo Chiat  can

elaborate further on this. Therefore, as long as  the

basic cause of cancer is unknown, preventive measures

will, therefore, not be possible.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we in the Health Ministry have been giving

a  screening service for detecting cancer in women in

Kandang   Kerbau  Hospital.  This  was   started   in

September  1964.  To  date there  are  three  doctors

Cytologists  and nine cytotechnicians providing  this

service in the Cytology Department of Kandang  Kerbau

Hospital. The staff are pooled together from  Kandang

Kerbau  Hospital an-d the Family Planning and  Popula

tion  Board,  and screening smears from  patients  of

Kandang Kerbau Hospital an-d selected cases from  the

Family Planning and Population Board clinics are sent

to the Cytology Unit.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I elaborate by giving Members some figures

regarding the work of the Cytology Laboratory in Kan-

dang  Kerbau Hospital. The number of smears  done  in

1965 was 464. In 1966, it increased to 1,744. And  in

1967, it reached the figure of 3,957. From the smears

which  were  done, 42 confirmed cases were discovered

in 1966. In 1967, 88 cases were discovered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The returns from the Cytology Laboratory of Kandang

Kerbau Hospital concerning cases from the Family Plan

ning  and Population Board are as follows. The number

of patients screened in 1967 was 5,713 and the number

of confirmed cancer cases discovered was 17.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, presently, it is not possible to screen all

patients  attending  Kandang  Kerbau  Hospital  as  a

routine step, and only indicated patient screening is

practised. This is not part of the programme  of  any

cancer  research centre, although research pertaining

to  obstetrical and gyncological problems is going on

in  Kandang Kerbau Hospital. As the Member for  Delta

has  said, it is possible to effect a cure  in  early

cases of cancer of the womb by excision surgery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point brought up by the Member for Delta

concerns  the  services rendered  by  Kandang  Kerbau

Hospital.  She  mentioned that there are  not  enough

labour  wards in Kandang Kerbau Hospital. Of  course,

she would like to know



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>



what measures we are taking. I would say that, at the

moment,   the  Ministry  of  Health  is  starting   a

Maternity  Unit in the Thomson Road General  Hospital

in order to increase labour ward facilities. However,

I  wish  to  point out that the position  is  not  as

serious  as  it was two or three years ago.  This  is

largely  due  to  the  fact that  there  has  been  a

substantial decrease in our birth rate in  Singapore.

As  a  result, the pressure on the use of the  labour

wards  in  Kandang Kerbau Hospital has  substantially

decreased this year.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, with the assurance of

the  Minister  for  Health that  he  is  prepared  to

receive all complaints, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $58,472,820 for Head 1302 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1303 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1303 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on public health, I wish to express my

appreciation of the Minister's enthusiasm in  wanting

to  make Singapore a clean and healthy place for  all

of us to live in and for our visitors to be delighted

with  the environment. We all want clean and  healthy

surroundings. Who does not? In order to achieve this,

the Minister will have to make laws. This is granted.

Laws are necessary. This is all right. Such laws have

been enacted and we have seen a lot of teeth in these

laws. For myself, I have even found some fangs.  This

is  not  all right. I recall the Minister's statement

earlier this year that he is determined to make  this

place  clean and healthy. By this time, I am  getting

worried. My constituency is not a place which is that

well  off as first impressions seem to convey.  Seran

goon  Gardens appears to be a middle-class area. But,

in  fact,  there are a lot of rural folk fringing  my

constituency.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>



You   can   classify   them  as   poor   people.   My

understanding  of the application of  these  laws  is

that  if  it  becomes necessary, they must inevitably

fall  upon the poorer classes, because the conditions

under which they live are such that they attract  the

application of these laws.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>6.53 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must state that I am mindful of the fact that the

Minister   intends  to  apply  these   laws,   should

application  become necessary, only to incorrigibles.

But  then the conditions of living of poor people are

not  of  their  choice. When daily living  becomes  a

matter  of daily urgency, they do not tend to  attach

much  importance to a little dirt around  the  place,

because  these are conditions which obtain  daily  in

their  lives.  My  fear is that they  can  be  easily

classified   as   incorrigibles   and   attract   the

application of these laws. Of course, this will  make

the  situation  much  worse and create  hardship  for

them.  The  point of this observation  is  purely  to

appeal  to the Minister always to have this in  mind,

that laws of this sort usually apply to these classes

of people, and to request that summonses for offences

under these laws be issued only when his Ministry  is

really satisfied that the recipients of summonses are

really incorrigibles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I wish to raise concerns what I may

term  the  new  expose that is going on around  town,

especially  in the centre of our city. I notice  that

the  concrete  slabs which have all  this  time  been

covering  the  main  drains in  the  city  are  being

removed,  and permanently too. Of course, there  must

be a reason for this. My first reaction is to ask why

we  are exposing the bowels of our city to the public

or  to  visitors  of  our fair city.  There  must  be

certain hazards that the Minister is trying to avoid.

But  if the Minister's fear is rats, I do not see why

large  numbers of these slabs which cover the  drains

ought  to be removed permanently. I still think  that

if his Ministry wishes to go on regular sprees of rat

extermination, they can still do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>



so  without  permanently  removing  these  slabs.  My

simple  understanding  of city development,  Sir,  is

that the drains in the city are covered. I think this

is  the  development in large cities  in  progressive

countries. Here we have a reverse situation where  we

are exposing the subterranean affairs of our city  to

public view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point that I wish to raise is a matter

which  concerns my constituency - Serangoon  Gardens.

We  have a market called Serangoon Gardens Market. To

date,  I  have discovered that there are 51 vacancies

in  the  market. For some obscure reason, the Hawkers

Department in the Public Health Division has  refused

to  issue licences for these vacancies. I do not know

whether   they  are  awaiting  what   is   called   a

constituency-to-constituency registration of  hawkers

in  markets.  I will be much obliged if the  Minister

can enlighten me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, during the debate on the

Environmental Public Health Bill, I put a question to

the  Minister which was not answered. I think we were

getting on rather late that evening and it must  have

escaped his attention. My question is on the disposal

of  rubbish in the rural areas. I was just  wondering

whether   any  plan  has  been  drawn  up   in   this

connection.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first,

I  would like to touch upon the first point which the

Member  for Serangoon Gardens has made. He said  that

the  burden  of the application of the public  health

law  that  we have passed- would mainly fall  on  the

poor people. Being a lawyer, the Member for Serangoon

Gardens should know that every person is equal before

the  law whether he is poor or rich, a big towkay  or

just an ordinary workman.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to bring up in reply to

his  statement is that it does not mean that the poor

people are dirty and the rich people are clean. As  a

matter of fact, poor people who live in a humble  hut

can  be  very clean. In my coilstituency tours during

the "Keep



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>



Singapore Clean" campaign, I saw people who  live  in

humble  huts keep their places very, very  clean.  On

the  other  hand, I passed big compound  houses  with

Mercedes  cars  parked inside and I found  that  they

were quite dirty. It is not true that poor people are

dirty  or will have dirt around their houses.  I  say

that cleanliness is something which should be pursued

by everybody, whether he is rich or poor.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to bring up is in

reply  to the Member for Serangoon Gardens who wanted

to   know  why  the  Ministry  of  Health  has   been

unslabbing  the drains. The answer is quite  obvious.

We  have  done  so as a health measure to  facilitate

public  cleansing,  prevent  choking  of  drains  and

reduce  mosquito breeding. The mosquito nuisance  has

been  in  existence in Singapore for many years,  but

following  the  increase and  rapid  tempo  of  urban

development  and the extensive covering  of  roadside

drains, especially in the more congested areas in the

city,  the preponderance of mosquito complaints  from

1958  onwards has emphasised the mounting seriousness

of the urban mosquito problem. There has also been  a

corresponding increase in mosquito-borne diseases  in

Singapore, especially over the last six years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent survey of the breeding habitat of nuisance

mosquitoes showed that out of a sample of 2,852 areas

in  which these mosquitoes were found breeding,  over

60  per  cent of such breeding was found in  concrete

drains  and  culverts. There is no doubt that  drains

are   the   favourite  habitat  of   these   nuisance

mosquitoes,  and  where such drains are  choked  with

refuse  and  have  stagnant pools of water,  mosquito

breeding  is  usually prolific. It therefore  follows

that  regular and thorough public cleansing  work  to

dig  up  and remove the refuse, debris and silt  from

the  drains,  to  clear  choked  -drains,  drain  off

stagnant  pools  of water to ensure  an  unobstructed

flow  of  water in these drains, will  be  a  primary

requirement in the prevention



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>



of  mosquito breeding in the drains. For  such  drain

cleansing work to be effectively carried- out,  there

has  to  be unimpeded access to all sections of  open

drains  for the public cleansing worker to  get  into

and  to  work  in. Concrete slabs on the drains  will

deny  access  to  the drains and will accordingly  be

physically   obstructing  and  impeding   this   very

necessary  and routine cleansing work.  As  a  public

health  requirement, drains should therefore  not  be

covered  and  where -drains have been  slabbed  over,

then  such covered- slabs should, as far as possible,

be removed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens said that we should

not expose the drains to the view of visitors. If  we

want a system of closed drains, then there must be  a

system of sewers as they have in other countries. But

in  Singapore we do not have such a system.  We  have

only a system of monsoon drains.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point which was brought up by the Member

for Serangoon Gardens concerns vacancies existing  in

Serangoon Gardens Market. At the moment, there are 50

vacant  stalls  in the market for which  applications

will  be  open  as  soon  as the  island-wide  hawker

survey,  which  was launched on the 2nd  of  December

this  year,  is  completed. It is expected  that  the

survey,  when  completed around the  end  of  January

1969,  will give us an accurate picture of  how  many

licensed and unlicensed hawkers in approved sites  or

otherwise  are conducting their business.  With  such

information, it will be possible for us to  plan  and

suitably allocate stalls to the hawkers in the  order

of priority as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) licensed hawkers in the vicinity;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) registered unlicensed hawkers in the

vicinity; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) other hawkers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to allocate any of th-e stalls before the survey is over would lead to difficulties later on, as more deserving hawkers are likely to be left out. It must be remembered that the long-term solution to the hawker

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>



problem  is  for all hawkers to conduct  their  trade

within  premises.  Steps  have  been  taken  in  this

direction,  and with the co-operation of the  Housing

and   Development   Board  and  the   Urban   Renewal

Department,  it  is hoped that all  hawkers  will  be

housed in suitable premises in the next five years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short answer to the question raised by the

Member  for Serangoon Gardens is that it is  expected

that  the 50 stalls in Serangoon Gardens Market  will

be  open  for balloting and occupation in  the  first

quarter of 1969.

I  did not impute that poorer people are unclean.  It

would be simply unthinkable. What I did say was  that

the  conditions  of their life tend  to  attract  the

application of these laws, which is quite a different

matter. But for the life of me, I would never  impute

that poorer people are unclean or unhealthy.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The points I wish to raise concern the hawker

situation  in  my  constituency. There is a hawker

congregation at Old Kallang Airport Estate.  Although

107  unlicensed  roadside  hawkers  were  resited  at

Guillemard Road Market in October this year,  only  a

few  cooked-food hawkers have taken up their allotted

pitches  in  this market, whereas the  other  market-

produce  hawkers  who  sell vegetables,  meat,  pork,

etc., have so far not taken up the stalls allotted to

them  in Guillemard Road Market except the two exist

ing  stall-holders. Prior to the  resiting of these

hawkers,  this market was occupied by only these two

existing  stall-holders who actually used the market

as  their transit stalls. There are 34 stalls in this

market  and 32 of them have been left vacant for,  as

far as I know, about eight to nine years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the resiting took place, the majority of these

hawkers,   who  now  possess  licences,  have   again

resorted to illegal hawking on the Estate's roads  or

car  parks from where they were earlier cleared. Some

of  them  have  migrated  to other  housing  estates.

During  the  "Keep  Singapore  Clean"  campaign   the

Minister for Health toured the market and he knew the

situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, you may wish to know why

these  hawkers have refused to take up their allotted

stalls and pitches in and around Guillemard



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>



Road  Market.  This  market, which  is  an  open-shed

structure  and  can accommodate only 34  stalls  (not

counting  the pitches outside it), was built probably

in  1953  or  1954 after the completion of  the  low-

terrace  houses around Guillemard Road  by  the  then

Singapore Improvement Trust. These low-terrace houses

were  used to rehouse the families from the clearance

site  at  Beach Road to make way for the erection  of

Merdeka  Bridge.  Later in 1958, when  the  Singapore

Improvement  Trust developed the Old Kallang  Airport

Estate  which  is  adjacent to  the  Guillemard  Road

Estate,  another standard market, now  known  as  Old

Airport  Road  Market, was also built. When  the  Old

Airport  Road Market was completed, hawkers began  to

desert  Guillemard Road Market. Some of  the  hawkers

took  up stalls at the Old Airport Road Market  while

others  who  were not so successful took  to  hawking

along  the  roadsides  around the  Old  Airport  Road

Market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not very optimistic about the success of

any future attempt to offer the stalls and pitches at

Guillemard  Road Mark-et to hawkers,  nor  will  they

have  any  confidence  in a  market  which  was  once

deserted for eight to nine years. I do not understand

why the Hawkers Department has allowed this state  of

affairs to go on for such a long time. It reflects on

its efficiency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was approached by the Hawkers Department in

July  1967  on the problem of the hawker congregation

at Old Kallang Airport Estate, I gave my comments and

some  suggestions  on  how to resite  the  unlicensed

hawkers,  but  resiting  was not  carried  out  until

October  this year. The congregation of  hawkers  was

allowed  to  continue unchecked.  It  was  not  until

January  this  year, when the powers  to  tackle  the

hawker  problem were transferred to the  Housing  and

Development  Board, that some action was  taken.  The

hawkers were harassed and cleared. But harassing  and

clearing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>



alone are not the solution to the problem. After some

persuasion,  these unlicensed hawkers  agreed  to  be

resited  at  Guillemard Road Market for a  period  of

three  to  four  months. When the  survey  of  vacant

stalls  and pitches in and around Old Airport  Market

has  been completed, they have been promised priority

in the consideration of stalls and pitches at the Old

Airport  Market when these vacancies are thrown  open

for application.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, may I ask the Minister a few

questions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Has the survey for vacant stalls and pitches

in and around

the Old Airport Market been finalised, and,  if

so, are they ready for application?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Are there any previous applications from

residents  of  the Old Kallang Airport  Estate,

and,   if   so,  will  these  applications   be

entertained?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Will additional hawking lots be provided at

the  surrounding concourse of the  Old  Kallang

Airport  Market to accommodate and resite  more

unlicensed hawkers?



<br><br>I  sincerely  hope that the Minister for Health  will

give  satisfactory answers to the  questions  I  have

just raised.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now wish to touch on Guillemard Road Market.

I  have  just  mentioned that any future  attempt  to

offer stalls and pitches at this market to unlicensed

hawkers  will again be a failure because  hawkers  do

not have any confidence in this market. There will be

no  business  in  this market as  a  standard-, size

market, i.e., the Old Kallang Airport Market, is just

less  than  200 yards away. Although these unlicensed

hawkers took out licences for their ballotted  stalls

and  pitches,  so far only a few cooked-food  hawkers

are  doing their hawking trade there. They  have  com

plained of poor business and sometimes no business at

all. I doubt very much if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>



other  unlicensed hawkers will accept any  stalls  or

pitches in this market that are offered to them. This

being  the  case, I suggest to the Minister  that  he

accept  a  proposal  to convert this  market  into  a

recreational  hall for the benefit of the  residents.

This  at least will serve some useful purpose instead

of  allowing the market to be deserted again. In this

case,  the People's Association can be asked to  take

over  this  market and develop it as  a  recreational

centre particularly for the children.





<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>





<br><br>7.18 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also find out from the Minister for Health

whether the Government or the Housing and Development

Board has any plan to build a hawkers' centre in  the

Old  Kallang Airport Estate to accommodate unlicensed

hawkers?



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  a month ago, the Hawkers Department of the  Min

istry    of   Health   carried   out   an   extensive

investigation  into the conditions and  licensing  of

hawkers  and  the  problems-relating  thereto.  Human

beings  are  very emotional and sensitive. Therefore,

the    hawkers   are   rather   worried   about   the

investigation.  There  is a  Chinese  saying  to  the

effect that when a dog raises its rear leg, it is  an

indication  that  it wants to ease itself.  In  other

words, certain signs foretell what is coming. In  the

same  way,  the  hawkers have certain misgivings  and

suspicions.  They wonder what is behind the  move  to

investigate  their  conditions.  They  know  that  un

licensed  hawkers are not allowed to  hawk  and  that

normally  hawkers  should  have  licences.  So   they

suspect  that there is something cooking because  the

Government is carrying out a full-scale investigation

into  the  conditions of hawkers. There is talk  that

hawkers may lose their licences because they  are  an

eyesore in the context of Singapore as a garden  city

and  of the environmental public health measures that

are  being taken. This is what the hawkers - especially

those who are non-citizens -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>



are worried about. I hope the Minister will inform us

of  the  purpose of the survey that is being  carried

out  into the conditions of hawkers so that they need

not be worried about their-future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that is worrying them is that it is

possible that hawkers holding blue identity cards may

have  their  licences revoked. I hope this  will  not

materialise as hawkers with blue identity cards  are,

after  all,  long  residents  of  Singapore.  I  have

touched  on  this point some time ago in this  House.

These  hawkers with blue identity cards are not  able

to  obtain  Singapore citizenship although they  have

applied for it. So they have no other alternative but

to resort to hawking for a living. It is not possible

for  aliens  who  do not even possess  blue  identity

cards to hawk in our city.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Minister answer two questions: one, what is

the  purpose of the investigation into the conditions

of  hawkers? two, what is the policy with  regard  to

hawkers  who  possess blue identity  cards  and  will

these  cards be taken away from them if they  do  not

have hawking licences?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will reply

first to the Member for Mountbatten. He spoke on  the

unpopularity of Guillemard Road Market. According  to

him,  only a few hawkers who have been resited  there

are still in the market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guillemard Road Market was built in 1955 at a cost

of  about  $18,000. It was so built that it would  be

convenient  to  all householders in the  vicinity  as

they  would not have to travel very far to  do  their

marketing. For some reason or other, this  market  is

occupied  by only 25 licensed hawkers although  there

is  room, for a total of 109, and 102 licences have.~

in  fact, been issued. As it is physically impossible

for  25  licensed hawkers ~o cater for the  marketing

requirement$  of  the people in the vicinity,  it  is

inevitabIe  that  they  will rather  go  to  the  Old

Kallang Airport Market to do their marketing as every

marketing  item can be purchased there. This  has  re

sulted in less patronage of Guillemard



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>



Road  Market  and, therefore, it is  unpopular.  This

state  of  affairs  can fairly be attributed  to  the

hawkers  themselves. It is a vicious  circle.  Unless

all  the hawkers who have been allotted pitches there

go  and  occupy them so that a person  who  wants  to

purchase a list of items can do so in that market, it

will  not be desirable for the people in the vicinity

to  make  their purchases there. Therefore, it  is  a

vicious  circle.  The fault lies  squarely  with  the

hawkers themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is the building of markets which are

rejected  by  the hawkers. The Member for Mountbatten

has  suggested that such markets can be converted for

some  other  useful  purpose. Land  in  Singapore  is

scarce. The conversion into recreational halls of mar

kets which are sited and specially selected for their

central  location  will be a sheer  waste  of  public

funds.  Once the hawkers' survey is over, all  vacant

pitches in all markets will be filled and each market

will  cater  for  almost every type  and  variety  of

market  produce. Those who do not take this excellent

opportunity  of  occupying stalls in the  market  but

persist  in illegally occupying sites outside  it  or

occupying unauthorised pitches will be prosecuted. It

is,  therefore,  the intention of the Ministry  event

ually  to  have  all the hawkers in  Singapore  trade

within  premises, otherwise Singapore  cannot  become

the  clean  and green garden city that it should  be.

Further,  it is ridiculous and unfair for the  stall-

holders  in markets to pay licence fees if  we  allow

unlicensed  hawkers to hawk outside  the  market  and

steal away the business of those inside the markets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I for one will admit that the hawker problem is a most difficult one. But we must be realistic and practical in tackling it. We must look at the long-term interest of the community as well as of the hawkers themselves. In order to attain these objectives, we have unfortunately to carry out

unpopular measures. To quote a good example, when the

Hawkers  Department in the Ministry of Health  wanted

to clear



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>



the  hawkers  in  the Koek Road  area  and  get  them

resited  at  the Orchard Road Car Park, all  of  them

protested.  Some  of them alleged  that  the  Hawkers

Department  was  trying to take away their  rice-bowl

and  that they could only "catch mosquitoes" -in  the

Orchard  Road Car Park. As Members know, the  Orchard

Road  Car Park is now the most popular hawker  centre

in the whole of Singapore.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to take unpopular measures at the moment.

Some of the hawkers are perhaps short-sighted and  do

not  see the advantages of what we propose to do, and

invariably  they  oppose  us  at  first.  But,  again

quoting the case of the Orchard Road Car Park,  I  am

told that not only are the Koek Road hawkers who were

resited  at  the Orchard Road Car Park happy  because

they  are  making a lot of money, but there are  many

other  hawkers also who are trying to get pitches  in

the Orchard Road Car Park.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we in the Health Ministry, perhaps unlike some Members, are quite prepared to take unpopular measures to protect the long-term interests of the community as well as the hawkers. We are not out for praise or popularity. We are not in this political business for personal gain.. If we know

that what we do is right, we will do it. We prefer to

be  cursed now and praised later, rather than  to  be

praised  now  and cursed for the rest of  our  lives.

After the hawkers' survey, we shall work out a scheme

in  which  all  hawkers  will be  resited  in  proper

premises.  I cannot say that we can do so  overnight.

It  will take some time. But we are determined to  do

what is right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten brought up the question

of  the  Old Kallang Airport Market and asked whether

there are any vacancies there and what plans we  have

to fill the vacancies now existing. Mr Speaker, Sir,

the survey of the Old Kallang Airport Market has been

completed. It has been ascertained



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>



that the following number of stalls are available:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) inside the market, 38 stalls;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) covered pitches outside the market, 115 day

stalls and 194 night stalls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, the resiting exercise will not,

however,  take  place  until the  island-wide  hawker

survey,   which   commenced  on  2nd   December,   is

completed.  It will be around the end of  January  or

middle  of January next year, depending on  how  fast

progress  is  made. It is expected that the  resiting

exercise in respect of this market will take place in

the latter half of February 1969..



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is, how do we intend to allocate

these  vacant pitches? They are as follows, in  order

of priority:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Licensed hawkers in Guillemard Road and Old Kallang Airport Markets;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Registered licensed hawkers in the vicinity;

and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Other applicants.



<br><br>I would like to point out, particularly to the Member

for  Mountbatten, that it is advisable for those  who

applied  for these pitches years ago to apply  again,

as some records were destroyed in the fire which took

place in the Hawkers Department some years ago.  This

is  to  make  doubly  sure that their  names  are  on

record.  The  other point is whether the Housing  and

Development Board intends to build another market  in

the  Old  Kallang Airport Estate. I cannot speak  for

the  Housing and Development Board. But I would  like

to  say that unless vacancies in the existing markets

are  filled, I do not think it is justified  to  have

another market built.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to the observations made by the Member

for  Delta. She raised the question of what we intend

to  do after we have completed the island-wide survey

of  hawkers, and expressed certain misgivings on  the

part  of  hawkers at large. She said that  they  were

suspicious  of  our intentions and would,  therefore,

like to have a categorical statement from the Health



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>



Ministry  of  our intentions. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the

answer  is quite simple. As a matter of fact,  before

the  island-wide survey of hawkers commenced, a press

statement   was   issued.  It  clearly   stated   our

intentions.  I  do  not think  there  should  be  any

justification  for any suspicions of our  intentions.

If  I  may  quote certain paragraphs from  the  press

statement  which  was issued just before  the  survey

commenced. These are as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The long-term solution to the hawker problem can be

achieved  if  hawkers  accept that  it  is  in  their

interest  to trade in proper licensed premises,  such

as  markets,  shop-houses and indoor hawker  centres,

which  have essential facilities such as pipe  water,

electricity and other sanitary facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health, in close liaison with the

Ministry of National Development

and  the  Housing and Development Board, have decided

to tackle the problem jointly in an effort to find  a

long-term  solution  to  the  problem.  One   primary

objective  is  to ensure the provision of  reasonably

satisfactory  indoor  or  covered  accommodation   to

replace  present  hawker sites in streets  and  back-

lanes. However, to what extent such facilities should

be  provided and where they should be located  cannot

be   accurately  planned  ahead  unless  an  accurate

censorship of hawkers is taken.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our intentions are clearly stated here.

I  do not think there should be any suspicions of our intentions.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point brought up by the Member for Delta was in

regard to non-citizens who apply for  hawker

licences. The policy on this has been laid down  with

great  care  to  protect the rights  and  welfare  of

Singapore  citizens. Hawker licences for non-citizens

already in possession of them are being renewed on  a

temporary  basis,  that  is,  from  month  to  month,

provided  they hawk at authorised sites. This  refers

primarily  to  holders  of blue  identity  cards,  as

applications for the renewal of licences of those not

in  possession of blue identity cards or with foreign

passports  are  rejected outright. Moreover,  a  non-

citizen  hawker  may transfer his or her  licence  to

another member of his or her family if that member of

the family is a Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>



citizen  and is unemployed. The Government cannot  in

the public interest allow fresh applications from non-

citizen hawkers, even those with blue identity cards.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will speak briefly. Singapore is a young country. Because of her beauty, progress and cleanliness, she has succeeded in attracting tourists. Nevertheless, there are some shortcomings in the rural areas. A few months ago the Health Ministry organised a "Keep Singapore Clean" campaign.

It  received  an overwhelming response and  full  co-

operation   from   the  masses.  This   proves   that

cleanliness is accepted by the people as an every-day

responsibility.  Hence  the  success  of  the   "Keep

Singapore  Clean"  campaign.  However,  a  state   of

cleanliness cannot be achieved if we depend solely on

members  of the public to maintain it. The  staff  of

the  Cleansing  Department have failed  to  discharge

their duty on the grounds that there is a shortage of

garbage  vans and manpower. As a result, many  places

have  not been thoroughly cleaned. Rubbish heaps have

not  been removed. It is, therefore, unfair to charge

the  people  with  neglecting to observe  cleanliness

when,  in  fact, the machinery for keeping  Singapore

clean  originates  with  the Health  Department.  The

Ministry  for  Health has seen fit to  prosecute  and

fine  only  members  of  the public  for  failure  to

maintain  cleanliness. But it has  not  taken  action

against the staff of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>



Health Ministry for their negligence and sluggishness

in  the execution of their duties. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

this  is  equivalent  to the Malay  saying,  "A  crab

instructing its young to walk straight." I  hope  the

Minister  for Health will note this and take remedial

measures to improve the existing state of affairs  in

the Health Department



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> I am not speaking.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to

the  Member  for Geylang Serai, I must  say  that  in

Geylang  Serai  Constituency, 30 additional  premises

have  been  taken over by the Katong District  Office

and have given service since the new Local Government

Conservancy  Regulations were brought into  force  in

July this year. It has to be admitted that during the

year,  there  have  been times  when  difficulty  was

experienced in refuse collection caused partly by the

breakdown  of vehicles and partly by the shortage  of

wagons.   Some  of  these  difficulties   have   been

overcome.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I enumerate the figures of refuse removed

and   the  productivity  of  labour  for  the  Katong

District, it will definitely prove to this House that

since  the  middle of this year, an effort  has  been

made  by  the  workers of the Ministry of  Health  to

increase  productivity. This will disprove  what  the

Member  for  Geylang Serai has said, that the  Health

Ministry  is  not putting enough effort  into  making

Singapore  one  of the cleanest cities  in  Southeast

Asia.  However,  I  am  not in  a  position  to  give

detailed figures.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswam (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> At this stage, on the last day of the

Budget  sitting,  I  do  not think  the  House  wants

detailed figures!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> But I can assure Members that

the  tonnage  collection of rubbish  in  the  Geylang

Serai Constituency has increased tremendously in  the

last three months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the need for additional vehicles is

recognised    by   the   Public   Health    Division,

approximately  $45,000  is  being  spent  each  month

during  and after the "Keep Singapore Clean" campaign

on  the hire of lorries to remove refuse. A case  has

been made to the Ministry of Finance for the purchase

of   148   new  refuse  collection  vehicles  costing

approximately  $4 million over the  next  two  years,

i.e.,  1969 and 1970. Some of these vehicles will  be

for  the  Katong District and will lead  to  improved

services. The Katong District includes Geylang  Serai

Constituency.  In  the meantime, hired  lorries  will

continue to be used.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if there are any specific complaints

against  workers who neglect their  duty  or  do  not

work, these will be investigated and firm action will

be taken. Since the Operations Room was set up on 1st

October,  1968,  there have been only two  complaints

applicable  to the two sectors within which  the  con

stituency  lies. None of these has reflected  on  the

work  of  the labour force. If the Member for Geylang

Serai can give specific cases, severe action will  be

taken   against  the  offenders.  Sir,  I  personally

welcome specific complaints and allegations but I  do

not  welcome, to put it picturesquely, indulgence  in

belly-aching.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because of the shortage of wagons that the

regularity  of refuse collection is sometimes  upset.

However,   when  new  transport  becomes   available,

routings  of  vehicles and collection  times  can  be

improved.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I am satisfied with

the  Minister's  explanation  and  I  beg  leave   to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill  be  now  read a Second time." The Minister  for

Finance has

explained  in  his  Budget Speech  that  Government's

intention  is  to  adopt  a new  financial  year  and

explained  the reasons for this change.  At  present,

the  financial year for budgetary purposes  coincides

with the calendar year and the Budget sitting is held

in  November  or December each year to  consider  the

Budget for the ensuing year. Our statistics on trade,

industries, etc., are also based on the calendar year

and  are  only  available after  the  close  of  each

calendar year. Hence such statistical data and useful

aggregates such as the gross domestic expenditure are

not  available  for  the Budget sitting  which  takes

place in November or December.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In presenting the Annual Budget, a review of the

state  of  the  economy  for  which  these  data  are

essential  would  be  better made  if  the  year  for

budgetary purposes be changed to close at 31st



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>



March  of each year and that this be introduced  from

the  next financial year which will then extend  from

1st  January, 1969, to 31st March, 1970.  Our  Budget

sitting can then take place in March each year.  This

will  give  us  January  and February  to  study  the

statistical data of the previous calendar year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has been taken to clarify the power

of  the  Minister  in  respect of  the  write-off  of

redundant  stores. Although section  19  (a)  of  the

Financial  Procedure Act, 1966, enables the  Minister

for   Finance  to  write  off  the  value  of   lost,

deficient,   condemned,  unserviceable  or   obsolete

public  stores, it does not provide for the  disposal

of  stores  on  the ground that they  are  no  longer

required   for  the  purpose  for  which  they   were

originally purchased. Clause 3 of the Bill  seeks  to

remedy this defect and to make clear the power of the

Minister  for Finance in respect of the write-off  of

redundant public stores.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.-[MrTang See Chim].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.



<br><br>8.00 p.m.
