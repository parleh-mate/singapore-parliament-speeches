<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>TOA PAYOH MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH CLINIC</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Provision of outpatient services)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee</b> asked the Minister for Health

whether  he will consider extending the facilities  at

the  Toa  Payoh  Maternal and Child  Health  Clinic  to

provide outpatient services for the residents  of  Toa

Payoh New Town.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, it is possible to introduce  outpatient

services  in the Maternal and Child Health  Clinic  at

Toa Payoh by using



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>



two  rooms  in  this  Clinic;  one  for  the  doctor's

examination room and the other for the treatment room.

I  understand  from the Member for Toa Payoh  that  at

present  the Maternal and Child Health Clinic  in  his

constituency  is  underutilised  because  of  a   very

successful  family planning campaign.  His  suggestion

that   it  should  be  converted  into  an  outpatient

services department is a good idea.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The service will be introduced as soon as a medical

officer is available and a few items of equipment  are

obtained. This can only be a temporary measure as  the

long term solution requires a much bigger facility for

the  population at Toa Payoh which is over 200,000. For

this a three-doctor clinic is required.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, residents in Toa Payoh have a choice

of   consulting  private  practitioners  within   the

housing  estate  or, alternatively, they  may  attend

the   nearby   Government  Outpatient   Dispensaries,

namely:-

<pre>

    Pegu Road Outpatient Dispensary;

    Bright Hill Drive Outpatient Dispensary;

    Upper Serangoon Road Outpatient Dispensary.

<div align="center"><b>WORK PERMITS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Policy and Number issued as at 28.2.77)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for Labour what

was the total number of Work Permits issued as at 28th

February, 1977, and whether he is satisfied  with  the

policy  of  issuing  Work Permits to  foreigners  when

there  is  still a large number of Singapore  Citizens

who are unemployed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui) (for the Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, work

permit  holders  constitute  less  than  10%  of   the

approximately 870,400 employed persons in Singapore as

28th February, 1977.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member will recall that in his Budget

Speech,  the  Finance  Minister  has  said  that   the

unemployment rate in 1976 continued to remain at a low

level of 4.5%. As at the end of last year. 30,750 were

on  the  unemployed register at the Employment Service

of  the  Ministry. My Ministry found that the majority

of  those  registered preferred white collar  or  soft

jobs.  For  example, 13,069 or 58% of the  22,413  new

registrants  last  year wanted white  collar  or  soft

jobs. We also discovered that many were choosy turning

down blue collar work offered to them for reasons such

as   long   distance  from  house,  shift   work   and

uncongenial   work   environment.   Many   of    those

registered, therefore, preferred to be jobless  until

something to their liking comes along.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the late 60s the Republic underwent successful

economic  development. As a result, we  experienced  a

tight  labour situation. Given the shortage of skilled

workers  and the preference of Singaporeans for  white

collar



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>



and  soft  jobs,  the Ministry had to issue  liberally

work   permits  to  non-residents  for  work  in   the

manufacturing and construction industries. In the case

of  white collar and soft jobs which Singaporeans  are

fond  of, the Ministry was strict on the issue of work

permits. The hon. Member will no doubt agree that  the

work  permit  policy  adopted was  necessary  for  our

economic development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood on the Order Paper:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD FLATS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Figures as at 1-2-77)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia</b>: To ask the Minister for National

Development  and Communications (i) the number  of  1-room,  2-room  and  3-room flats  rented  out  by  the

Housing  and  Development Board as  at  1st  February,

1977; and (ii) the rate of subsidy in

respect of each of those types of flats.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Yeo Toon Chia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta):</b> Question No. 3, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang (Senior Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Tan Eng Liang) (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as

at 1st February, 1977, the number

of  1-room, 2-room and 3-room flats rented  out  by

the Housing and Development Board is as follows:-

<pre>

	1-room     71,000 units

	2-room     35,000 units

	3-room     19,000 units

                  -------

	Total     125,000 units

                  -------

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rates of subsidy for the 1-, 2- and 3-room flats

vary  from  contract to contract because  the  capital

costs   vary  according  to  location  and   date   of

construction. The rates have generally increased  over

the  years because of continuous improvements  to  the

flats. Taking an average figure for the last



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>



two or three years, the rates of subsidy are as

follows -



<pre>

 	1-room (improved) $60 to $70 per month

	2-room (improved) $55 to $65 per month

	3-room (improved) $50 to $60 per month

<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  and Communications (a) up to  the  latest

convenient  date, how many units of  flats  have  been

sold  by  the Housing and Development Board under  the

"Home-ownership" Scheme; (b) how many of  those  flats

were  purchased outright by the owners;  and  (c)  how

many  of the owners used their Central Provident  Fund

contributions to purchase the flats either outright or

on an instalment basis.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as at 31st December 1976, a total of 110,591 units of

flats have been sold under the "Home Ownership"

Scheme. Of this, 7,685 units were purchased outright,

while 63,148 units were purchased through the owners'

CPF contributions either outright or on an instalment

basis. The remaining 39,758 purchasers paid cash for

down payment and balance of loan settled by monthly

cash instalments.

<div align="center"><b>(Lighting of corridors in the day)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b> asked the Minister for National

Development and Communications, in view of inadequate

sunlight reaching into the common corridors of the

emergency type flats in Apartment Blocks 1, 2, 3, 4

and 5, Tiong Bahru Road



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>



and  Apartment Blocks 108 and 109, Jalan Bukit  Merah,

because of their structure, if he will ask the Housing

and  Development  Board to consider switching  on  the

lights during the day time or providing means for more

sunlight to be admitted into those flats.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Housing  and Development Board will undertake  to

convert  the  above  building  blocks  so  that   more

sunlight can be admitted into the common corridors  of

these  flats. However, as this would involve extensive

demolition   and   alterations  to  the   flats,   the

conversion has been programmed for the end of 1978  or

early 1979.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, common corridors in HDB blocks are

adequately  illuminated in the  evenings.  During  the

day,  there is sufficient natural daylight  along  the

common  corridors  even in blocks of  1-room  flats.

However, in some of the blocks with long corridors the

lighting  may  appear slightly inadequate  in  certain

parts  of  the corridors during rainy days.  The  Area

Officers  in  charge  will investigate  the  need  for

turning on lights during the day, if found necessary.

<div align="center"><b>DEVELOPMENT OF VACANT LAND BETWEEN TOA PAYOH SPORTS STADIUM AND SWIMMING COMPLEX</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee</b> asked the Minister for

National Development and Communications whether  there

are  any  plans  to develop the vacant  plot  of  land

between  the Toa Payoh Sports Stadium and the Swimming

Complex   into  tennis  or  squash  courts  or   other

recreational  facilities  for  the  benefit   of   the

residents of Toa Payoh New Town.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  vacant site between the Toa Payoh Sports  Stadium

and  the  Swimming Complex is reserved for  an  indoor

sports   hall   for  indoor  games,  like   badminton,

basketball, volleyball, etc. It will be modelled along

the lines of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1117</b></font><br><br>



Alexandra   Road   Sports   Hall   which   is    under

<div align="center"><b>POINTS DEMERIT SYSTEM</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Number of driving licences suspended)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for National

Development   and  Communications  how  many   driving

licences  had  been suspended under the  Road  Traffic

(Demerit  Points)  Rules, 1975, as at  28th  February,

1977,  and  if he is satisfied with the implementation

of the Rules.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Senior Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Communications (Mr Ong Teng Cheong) (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Points  Demerit System was implemented  on  1st  March

1975  as  a  means  to identify and  remove  careless,

inconsiderate, reckless and dangerous drivers from the

roads.  Under  this system, the driving licence  of  a

driver  will be suspended for a period up to a maximum

of  six  months  whenever  he accumulates  12  demerit

points  or  more  within any period of 12  consecutive

months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the introduction of the Points Demerit System

in March 1975, a total of 84 driving licences had been

suspended  under  the  Road Traffic  (Demerit  Points)

28th February, 1977. Of this number,

40  driving  licences are still under  suspension.  In

addition,  1,922 drivers had been issued with  warning

notices during this period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the implementation of the Points Demerit

System and the various enforcement measures taken, the

number  of  deaths  caused by road accidents  did  not

decline  but  remained at 288 in 1976. The  number  of

accidents  involving serious injury  dropped  by  8.8%

from  2,674 in 1974 to 2,438 in 1975 but increased  to

2,587 in 1976. To make the system more effective,  the

ROV  and  Traffic  Police are presently  studying  the

possibility  of  expanding the system to  cover  other

traffic offences. The system will also be revised so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1118</b></font><br><br>



that  offences  such  as inconsiderate,  careless  and

dangerous driving will carry more penalty points.

<div align="center"><b>EMPLOYMENT PASSES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Particulars as at 28.2.77)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs and Education (a) how many persons had applied

for Employment Passes up to 28th February, 1977; (b)

how  many applications have been approved; and (c) how

many  of  the applicants who were granted Passes  have

applied   for  permanent  residence;  how  many   such

applications  have  been approved and  what  were  the

reasons for the rejections.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Home Affairs and Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs and Education (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Employment Passes were

issued as far back as 1959 and no records were kept in

the  earlier  years. Prior to 1974 there was  also  no

distinction  between applications for  new  Employment

Passes  and  applications for extension of  Employment

Passes. I will therefore give only the statistics from

1974 onwards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last three years up to 28th February, 1977, the Immigration Department received a total of

31,351 applications for new Employment Passes. Out  of

this  total, 29,666 were approved. A total  of  13,893

applications  for  extensions were  also  received  of

which 13,793 were approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the same period, a total of 1,919 Employment

Pass  holders  applied  for  permanent  residence   in

Singapore. 1,321 of these were approved. Those refused

were mainly on grounds of:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) lack of qualifications;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) lack of working experience; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the type of qualifications or skills possessed

by  the  applicants  being  not  in  short  supply  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figures supplied do not include the Employment

Passes granted to holders of work permits processed by

the Ministry of Labour.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case the Member may be wondering why the big gap

between the number of people granted Employment Passes

and  the  number  of  people  applying  for  permanent

residence, let me explain that the grant of  permanent

residence, being the first step towards the  grant  of

citizenship,  is  more stringent  than  the  grant  of

Employment  Passes.  It stands to  reason,  therefore,

that  not all Employment Pass holders are eligible  to

apply  for permanent residence. Further, many  of  the

Employment Pass holders are here to work only and  are

not  interested to take up permanent residence.  They,

of course, do not apply for permanent residence. Those

who are interested must generally have worked at least

a few years in Singapore before they can apply.

<div align="center"><b>PRICE OF REFINED SUGAR</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia</b>: To ask the Minister for Finance

what are the reasons for the prevailing high price  of

refined  sugar and whether it will be reduced  in  the

near future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Question No. 10.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, sugar prices often fluctuate

rapidly  on  the world market. To ensure uninterrupted

supplies  of raw sugar and to help maintain  a  stable

domestic  selling price for refined sugar,  the  Sugar

Industry  of Singapore has had to enter into long-term

supply contracts. The current long-term contracts with

Australia  and Fiji, concluded towards the  end  of 1974,

assured us of raw sugar supplies fully for 1975 -

77   and   thereafter  up  to  85%  of  our   domestic

requirements  until  1980. The  contracted  price  at

S$689  per  metric tonne was then extremely favourable

compared  with  the prevailing market price  of  about

S$2,580 per metric tonne.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the Sugar Industry of Singapore was able to

maintain the domestic retail price of refined sugar at

75  cents  per  kati since 1974 to  date.  Otherwise,

Singapore consumers would have had to pay as  much  as

$2.25 for their kati of sugar if we had to buy on  the

open  market  at the peak of world price fluctuations.

Taking the period between 1974 and now, the price paid

by  our consumers on the average is about 24 cents per

kati  lower  than  the average world  price  of  white

sugar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are no doubt aware that the price of raw

sugar  on  the world market has fallen. The  price  of

sugar  paid  under the current contract, however,  has

increased  because  of the escalation  index  tied  to

prices  paid  by  the Australian sugar  industry.  The

Sugar  Industry of Singapore is at present  trying  to

discuss with Australia some improvements in the  terms

of the contract. Apart from a lower price, it would be

desirable  that the new contract should enable  us  to

diversify our sources of supply,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1121</b></font><br><br>



especially to buy from other ASEAN countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Sugar Industry of Singapore is making a

loss  at  prevailing prices, I have  no  proposals  at

present  to ask SIS to make any revision of the  price

downwards,  If necessary, I will consider whether  the

Sugar Industry of Singapore may be allowed adjustments

to the domestic retail price of sugar when discussions

are completed. However, any adjustments made will have

to  take a long term view of the market rather than to

follow the erratic movements of world sugar prices.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may

I  ask supplementary questions? First, why did we  not

attempt  to  re-negotiate  the  agreement  very   much

earlier  when we knew that world prices were dropping?

Second, we had a price escalation clause. Why  did  we

not  negotiate for a price reduction clause? Third,  I

believe  Malaysia retails their sugar at  65  cents  a

kati  and  we have the same sort of contract with  the

countries mentioned by the Hon. Minister. Why is  that

so? Why are we retailing our sugar at 75 cents a kati?

Fourth,  why did we not have the foresight to  realise

that the sugar prices could have dipped and so have  a

shorter term instead of that long-term contract?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer is

simple.  The  Sugar  Industry  of  Singapore  made   a

commercial  judgment  and  decided  that  a  long-term

contract was desirable. Therefore, it entered into the

terms  of  the  present contract.  At  that  time,  of

course,  it was favourable. As I have said, the  price

was  then  very low. The escalation clause  was  built

into  the  contract, because this was related  to  the

cost  of  labour in Australia. The intention was  that

the  long-term  contract  would  enable  Australia  to

expand their growing of sugar cane and that the  price

would  be  sufficient to enable their growers  to  pay

their labour at the expected escalation in wages which

would  result  in the following years.  There  was  no

possibility of a reduction in price downwards  because

of the nature of the contract.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1122</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why we are paying 75 cents in Singapore

instead of 65 cents as in Malaysia is that we kept the

excise  tax  at  a  level which we  have  always  been

charging,  that  is,  10 cents,  while  the  Malaysian

Government thought it possible for them to  waive  the

tax  altogether. That is the reason for the difference

between  their  price and our price. I  think  I  have

answered all the questions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> A further supplementary question.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, what will be the effect on the price

of  sugar  in  Singapore as a result  of  the  ban  on

saccharine in the United States?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would think that

the  tendency would be upwards. Of course,  there  are

other  factors in the world sugar market which  decide

the  price from time to time. Some of these  are  what

prices  are  being negotiated, the effect on  growers.

that  is, whether they grow more sugar cane, and  also

the effect of the new processes of making liquid sugar

of a different kind, not cane sugar but from wheat and

corn.  All  these have an effect on prices. If  anyone

can  tell  me  whether the price is going  upwards  or

downwards,  I  would be very pleased. I  am  sure  the

Sugar  Industry of Singapore will also be very pleased

if  anyone  can give a guaranteed forecast  of  prices

over the next five years.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Dhanabalan (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a

supplementary question. If the Minister  is  satisfied

that  an  increase in the price of  sugar  has  to  be

allowed in order to enable SIS to cover its costs  and

make  a marginal profit, would he consider a reduction

in  excise  duty first, so that the price of  such  an

essential  commodity like sugar can be  maintained  at

present levels?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not the

policy of the Singapore Government to reduce taxes  in

order to maintain prices I think we need our taxes and

the  revenues from them in order to satisfy the  needs

of   our   country.  MPs, social  services, economic

development and other requirements.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Khe Bong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a

supplementary question. In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>



view  of  the protection for the SIS, as a  result  of

which the people of Singapore have to pay higher sugar

prices,  will  the Minister not consider allowing  the

import of sugar?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer is no.

When  the  price  went up to about $2,300  per  metric

tonne,  I  found  no  pressure in this  House  for  an

increase in sugar prices. I think the fact is that  we

have been able to maintain over the last three years a

sugar  price which has been entirely stable and I  can

see  no  reason  why the public cannot pay  this  same

price of 75 cents. We hope to be able to maintain this

price  because discussions are now going on  with  the

Australians and if the parallel negotiations in  Japan

and  Malaysia  are favourable, I think  we  will  also

benefit  to the same extent that concessions are  made

to these countries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would the Minister not

like to see the consumers getting a cheaper price  for

their  sugar, and this could be done by getting,  say.

the NTUC Welcome to import sugar from overseas?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the NTUC

does  not  have  any  special expertise  in  importing

cheaper sugar. Anyone can do it at world prices.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a

supplementary question. First, to what extent  is  the

Singapore  Government still interested  in  the  Sugar

Industry  of  Singapore?  I am  quite  sure  that  the

Government   has  still  got  a  considerable   equity

interest  in that company. Secondly, the Hon. Minister

has  gone  to  great lengths today to  explain  or  to

inform this House of the administrative decisions  and

actions taken by that company. This does seem to be in

contradiction  to what he has told this  House  a  few

days ago, that is, he is not accountable to this House

for  the administrative actions of all companies owned

by Government, either wholly or partially-owned. Would

he explain the apparent contradiction?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will explain the

apparent  contradiction. In this particular  case  the

agreement with Australia and Fiji was brought  to  the

notice  of the Government and we were asked to give  a

letter of awareness. As representing the Government of

Singapore, I think I am also involved other than as  a

shareholder of the Sugar Industry of Singapore. In the

case of the particular question as to what interest we

have,  we  have 40% interest in the Sugar Industry  of

Singapore.  So  we  are not in control  of  the  Sugar

Industry  of Singapore except to the extent  that  40%

gives any particular shareholder control.

<div align="center"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b> asked the Minister for Finance

(a)  what are the various rates of property tax levied

on  residential  property; (b) how  much  revenue  was

collected  in respect of each category in FY  76;  and

(c)  what is the estimated revenue in respect of  each

category for FY 77.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is

divided  into several zones for purposes  of  applying

property tax assessment rates as prescribed under  the

Property  Tax  (Rates) Order, 1971.  These  zones  are

shown in the Property Tax Rate Plan which is available

for  inspection  by  members  of  the  public  in  the

Property Tax Office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this Plan, the highest assessment rate of 36%

is  levied  on residential properties in  the  central

city  areas  and  in  the southern islands  comprising

Sentosa, Sarong Island, Pulau Brani. Pulau Selegu  and

Pulau  Hantu.  Residential  properties  in  the   less

developed areas are assessed at 27% while those in the

rural  areas, including all other surrounding islands,

at 18%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All HDB owner-occupied flats purchased under the

Board's  Home  Ownership Scheme are  assessed  at  the

concessionary  rate  of 23%. For other  owner-occupied

dwelling  houses, concessionary assessment  rates  of

14%, 16%, 18%, 19%, 20% or 23% apply.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>



Properties  with  annual  value  of  less  than  $240.

whether owner-occupied or not, are also subject to the

same  rates. The assessment rate of attap  and  wooden

houses is $6 a year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Residential properties developed under approved

urban  redevelopment  projects  are  assessed   at   a

concessionary  rate of 1 2% for 20  years  before  the

full assessment rates applicable are imposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For FY 76, the revenue collection for all

properties,   excluding  contributions  by   statutory

boards,  is  expected  to reach  $265  million,  which

includes  a  substantial  amount  of  back  tax.   The

estimated  revenue  collection  for  FY  77  for   all

properties, except statutory boards, is $230 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No records of collection according to the different

assessment rates for residential properties are  kept.

I  regret,  therefore, that I am unable  to  give  the

required breakdown.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, is the

Minister  aware  that not all HDB  dwellings  get  the

concessionary  rate  of  23%?  There  are   some   HDB

dwellings  in  Stirling  Road,  Queenstown,  and   St.

Michael's estate which draw a rate of 36%.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> I believe that may be so. I am not

quite informed of this particular instance. But I will

look into it. Did the Member say HDB houses?



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Yes, at 36%.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, in view of the steady drop in

property  values over the last few years, particularly

in the last few months, would the Minister consider  a

downward revision in the rates of property tax?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I assume the rates would also

go  down with the values and with the rents which  are

collected.  Since this is a percentage of  the  annual

value,  and  the  annual value is based  on  rents,  I

assume there would be a reduction. I do not propose to

reduce the rates as well as the annual values.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, the Minister used the word

"assume". He said that he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1126</b></font><br><br>



assumes  the annual value, being based on the  rental,

therefore  the  annual value would come  down.  But  I

think the existing practice is that, quite independent

of what the rented value of the property might be, the

Property Tax Department lays its own assessment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, this may be due to the kind-heartedness of the Property Tax Department which does

not  always raise the annual values in accordance with

the rents which property owners receive.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Neither do they reduce!



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> So if they are to be encouraged to

base  the  annual values on rents, then I  think  they

should  raise  it  upwards  as  rapidly  as  they  are

expected to bring it downwards.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Dhanabalan:</b> Sir, since the annual value

already  reflects the worth or value  of  a  property.

taking into account the type of property, the location

and  so  on,  would  the Minister  consider  having  a

uniform  rate  of  property  tax  for  the  whole   of

Singapore except in cases where specific exemptions or

reductions are to be given for promotional purposes?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, that is a consummation devoutly

to be desired. I think the Property Tax Department and

the  Ministry  of  Finance have been trying  for  many

years  to  rationalise the rates of property  tax.  If

Members  will  have  noticed  when  I  read  out   the

concessionary  rates, it varies from  14%,  16%.  18%.

19%.  20% to 23%. I cannot myself imagine that a  fine

distinction can be drawn between properties which  are

only  worthy  of  14% and other properties  which  are

worthy  of  15% rates. Members will also notice  that

there are attap houses where the rate is $6 a year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been trying to revise the property rates to a

uniform  consistent  rate. The difficulty  is  not  to

revise the rates downwards from the higher rates of up

to  36%, as I think most Members would like me to  do.

The difficulty is really raising the other lower rates

upwards, so that there will be a uniform rate

yesterday when I spoke I had only a few more lines  to

go, but according to Standing Orders I was not allowed

<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am allowing you to speak now, Mr

Govindaswamy.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Thank you, Sir.

Regarding  the site of the Somerset Road Hindu  Temple

which has been acquired by the Government, it is  true

we  cannot  object because the site  is  required  for

development  purposes.  But the  compensation  is  not

sufficient. Why is this so? If that piece of  land  at

Somerset Road is auctioned, it should fetch $30 or $40

per square foot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> More!



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Yes, more than that. I am not a

land  valuer.  The  Government  should  compensate   a

charitable organisation like the Hindu Endowment Board

adequately. This is a charitable organisation and  not

an   individual  land  owner.  The  Government  should

consider paying reasonable compensation for the  piece

of land at Somerset Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an alternative site, the Government has offered a

piece of land at Toa Payoh for $8



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>



per   square   foot.  But  for  the  other   religious

organisations the Government is charging only  $4  per

square foot. The Hindu Endowment Board is a charitable

organisation  and  is  under the  Ministry  of  Social

Affairs.  It  is not a private organisation  that  the

Government can charge $8 or $10 per square  foot.  The

Government should consider charging a reasonable price

for  the land at Toa Payoh. Sir, I am bringing up this

matter  because it has not been resolved  for  a  long

time.  Furthermore, when the Board gets the money,  it

has  to  construct a temple there, which may take  one

year  and the cost will be at least $100,000. And  the

Board  has  to pay for the land also. It is  not  land

given free by the Government. We are going to pay  for

the  land.  Most probably, it will take  another  year

before  we  have  to  vacate  Somerset  Road.   I   am

mentioning  this  because the  Minister  for  National

Development  is here. Could the Minister  settle  this

problem  of alternative site for the Hindu  temple  as

soon as possible?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have also received a complaint which was

addressed to the Minister and copied to me by a  Hindu

temple  authority at Woodlands which states  that  the

temple  has been closed down by the Government without

first  informing  the  Social Affairs  Ministry.  Even

though  the land belongs to the Government, it is  not

supposed  to close down the temple before the devotees

are  informed.  This  action is unfair  to  the  Hindu

religious community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if you have the time you should go

and  see  the  Woodlands  temple.  I  think  the  Hon.

Minister has been to the Woodlands temple. Besides the

Hindu  temple, there is a mosque and a church.  It  is

unreasonable to lock up the Hindu temple straightaway.

This  action amounts to victimising Hinduism? I cannot

think  of  another word, therefore I have to  use  the

word "victimising".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these matters must be considered by the

Minister  for  Social  Affairs. He  is  looking  after

religious matters. I think he is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1129</b></font><br><br>



capable  of  handling these matters. I also  hope  the

Minister  for  National  Development  and  the  Senior

Minister  of  State  for  National  Development   will

consider  and  resolve the question of an  alternative

site for the Somerset Hindu temple as soon as possible

because  the Hindu Endowment Board wishes to  commence

building  a  new temple. Before we start building,  we

have  to  get  suitable men. It is  not  easy  to  get

suitable men to build a temple.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am the

Chairman  of  the Hindu Endowment Board. That  is  the

reason why I have to bring up these matters.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, I would like

to  ask the Hon. Minister to consider the old people's

plight.  Our old people are generally quite  proud  of

their  self-respect and they are not really interested

in  public  assistance. And with more and more  people

moving  into Housing and Development Board flats,  the

old  extended family system is breaking  down.  It  is

unfair  to  get  the  children to support  their  aged

parents all the time because their own income may  not

be   sufficient  to  give  support  and  the   parents

themselves feel the same way too. There are many cases

of  old people in my constituency who feel that it  is

unfair  for  them to rely entirely on their  children,

and  I  feel  that  they are quite justified  in  this

feeling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this problem, I do not think the right answer is

to  build  more  old  people's homes.  But  would  the

Minister perhaps consider giving opportunities for the

able  old  people  to  at  least  be  partially  self-supporting?  The  Member for  Sembawang  made  a  good

suggestion yesterday of extending the retirement  age.

I  would qualify that a little by suggesting that  the

extension  should be granted not to  everyone  but  to

those  whose extension of service will not  jeopardise

the  promotion  prospects of the younger  staff  Apart

from this, perhaps in conjunction with the Ministry of

Labour, part-time jobs could be obtained for them. And

in conjunction with the Ministry of the Environment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1130</b></font><br><br>



perhaps a hawker licence on a co-operative basis could

be  granted  to  five or six old  people  who  may  be

staying  in  the same block or in two or three  blocks

and  who  are willing to run a stall on a co-operative

basis.  They  could be granted a hawker  licence  with

certain safeguards, i.e, these licences should not  be

transferable and that the old people themselves should

do  the  work  rather than delegate the job  to  their

children. In this way, they might be able to earn some

money  for  themselves and help to pay for the  extras

they want, while the children themselves could provide

for them the accommodation and food.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Encik Othman Bin Wok):</b> Sir, may I have your indulgence in first

answering  the points raised by the Member for  Anson?

He has brought up about a dozen points and if I do not

answer them all, he will accuse me of victimising him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The award of the Sportsman and Sportswoman of the

Year  in itself is an effort to raise the standard  of

sports   in  Singapore.  There  has  been  very   keen

competition  since  its inception.  The  selection  is

based on certain criteria and no award is made if  the

standards  set are not met. Other incentives  provided

for  those representing the Republic in sports include

time-off  for  training, unrecorded  leave  with  pay.

several  centralised training stints which  were  very

necessary  for the period of the international  games,

provision of uniforms, attire and equipment.  However,

being  amateurs they are restricted in the receipt  of

monetary rewards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point it would be useful to reiterate the

guidelines  set by the Prime Minister in 1973  on  the

need to be pragmatic in sports promotion. As far as  I

am   aware,  the  officials  of  the  national  sports

associations  have  been performing  good  work.  They

serve in an honorary capacity and are doing their best

under the circumstances. Some of the associations with

good  programmes  have been able  to  obtain  sponsors

while others



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1131</b></font><br><br>



unfortunately  find it a little difficult  to  achieve

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding newspaper publicity, all mass media run

regular columns in the majority of sports. The  Sports

Council  itself  has also two house magazines  devoted

entirely  to sports, one in English and the  other  in

Chinese, There is no Tamil edition yet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the National Stadium, I can assure the hon.

Member  that it is in no danger of collapsing  despite

the   Kallang  roar.  The  stadium  proper  is  firmly

entrenched  on  a suspended floor built  under  strict

engineering standards. Those cracks visible  on  walls

and floors have appeared in those parts of the stadium

lying  beyond the suspended flooring and have subsided

due   to  settlement.  We  anticipated  this.  Regular

remedial  works  are  being undertaken,  as  and  when

necessary, until 1979 when the subsidence is  expected

to  stop. I would also like to assure the Member  that

the  grounds  of  the National Stadium  are  safe  for

people to walk. I have not received any report of  any

serious accident of anyone falling into open drains.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding crowd discipline at football matches,

meetings  are  held with the Police before  and  after

every game. As far as I am aware, the police have been

and  are in full control of the crowd situation at the

National   Stadium   during  football   matches.   The

Singapore Sports Council together with the Press,  FAS

and  the  Police will in various ways  appeal  to  and

educate  the spectators for sportsmanship and courtesy

to be shown to the visiting teams.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master Plan for sports facilities is to examine

the  availability  of sports facilities  in  terms  of

population centres up to 1 982 It has enumerated those

sports  facilities which are likely to  be  deficient.

There  is  a deficiency of only three football  fields

because  there are many school fields which could  and

should be made available to the community. It has been

estimated that, in addition to public fields, numerous

school fields will need to be used by the community by

1982. The Singapore Sports Council has presently



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1132</b></font><br><br>



reached  an  agreement with the Ministry of  Education

for  constituency sports clubs to use  52  fields.  On

flood  lighting  of  fields,  this  will  be  examined

together  with  other  priorities  before  a  plan  is

submitted to the authorities concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the decline of badminton, the Singpore Sports

Council has little jurisdiction over the officials  of

the  controlling  body. However, SSC has  a  badminton

training scheme sponsored by a commercial organisation

to  benefit the youths of Singapore. At least  80%  of

the  present  national  squad players  came  from  the

scheme.  The  responsibility of winning  international

honours  lies  within the province of the  controlling

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NFX was introduced some years' ago but gradually

declined  in popularity. Some of the reasons  for  the

decline  may  be due to the unsuitable time  when  the

programme  comes on the TV screen and the radio,  that

individuals  tend to be unmotivated  when  alone,  and

that  others  would  prefer the  outdoors  and  social

atmosphere  of  exercising in company.  On  the  other

hand,  jogging  and  other free calisthenics  outdoors

seem  to  have  increased  in  popularity,  simply  by

choice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards temples, Government's policy with regard

to  the allocation of sites for religious institutions

is  to  reserve adequate sites in each satellite  town

for  the  building  of mosques, temples  and  churches

where there is a demonstrated need for such places  of

worship. For Toa Payoh, the Government has allocated a

site  of  about  5,000 sq. ft. to the Hindu  Endowment

Board  for a Hindu temple. The Hindu Endowment  Board,

of  which  the hon. Member for Anson is the  Chairman,

has  rejected  in June 1976 the offer on  the  grounds

that the area allocated was too small, that the siting

of  the land was poor, and that the land was shaped in

such  a  way that no proper construction was possible.

Since  then,  the Hindu Endowment Board  took  up  the

matter   with   the  Housing  and  Development   Board

independently,  without  any  success.   However,   my

Ministry has taken up the matter with the Ministry  of

National  Development last month  The  Member  may  be

pleased to know that it has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1133</b></font><br><br>



been decided to allocate a different site with an area

of 10,000 sq. ft. to the Hindu Endowment Board for the

construction of a Hindu temple at Toa Payoh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not aware that the Housing and Development

Board  is charging $8 per sq. ft. for the land at  Toa

Payoh  and also that the compensation for the Somerset

Road  Hindu Temple has not been settled. I  will  take

this up with the Ministry of National Development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the temple at Woodlands, the

Housing and Development Board has informed my Ministry

that the land and the temple thereon were acquired  by

the  Board  with vacant possession two  years  ago.  A

vacant   possession  award  was  paid  to  the  former

landowners.  In  November 1975, the caretaker  of  the

temple  handed  over  the keys to the  Housing  Board.

Since  then the premises have been locked, until  some

time  in  late January 1977, when another  person  who

claimed  to be the new caretaker of the temple shifted

into  the  premises  without  the  permission  of  the

Housing  Board. I do not know how he got  in  He  must

have  broken the lock. A notice was, therefore, given

to  him to quit because he was an unauthorised person.

Subsequently  he vacated the premises.  The  HDB  then

1st March, 1977

that time there was no one in the premises However, my

Ministry is still looking into this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer the Member for Telok Blangah, old people

who  have  been  cast  out by their  families,  either

because  their  families are poor  or  their  children

cannot  provide  for them, can always seek  assistance

from the Social Welfare Department. In cases of severe

hardship,  they will be referred to certain  voluntary

organisations for additional assistance in cash and in

kind  and, wherever possible, old people are  assisted

to  find  employment.  But most of  them  cannot  work

because of poor health and only some are fit for light

work.  Because of this, it is felt that  there  is  no

necessity for the Government to specially provide jobs

for  them. From 1976 up to the end of February  1977,

the Social



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>



Welfare  Department found jobs for 441 welfare  cases,

including residents of the Homes. Of these, 159  were

public assistance recipients and 156 were destitutes,

disabled or aged persons. I would like to stress  that

it  should  be the duty of the children to look  after

their  aged parents. In many instances, the old people

are  not altogether a burden as they can help to  look

after the grandchildren or attend to household chores.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his suggestion that the old people be given a

hawker   licence   and  operate   something   like   a

cooperative, this is a matter for the Ministry of  the

Environment to look into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has raised some matters

about  the  old  people's home and  the  aged.  Mutual

benefit organisations are being encouraged not only to

look  into death benefits but to adopt programmes that

will  benefit the living as well. A few  of  the  more

prosperous  ones  with a large reserve  fund  will  be

starting old people's homes and they will not need any

subsidy.  My Ministry will assist them to set  up  the

homes.  Those  old people receiving public  assistance

who  are  admitted  to these homes  will  continue  to

receive their allowances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of extending the age of retirement

for  old people from the present 55 years to 60 years.

this  is  a  matter  for  the Ministry  of  Labour  to

consider.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think there is a necessity at this stage to

have  a  campaign  at  the  national  level  aimed  at

instilling  respect  for  the  aged.  Generally,   our

citizens are aware of the need and care for the  aged.

Various  Members of this House have already spoken  in

public  on  the importance of caring for the  aged  by

their young. The schools are also stressing this point

in  the  educational programmes I understand there  is

also a move to form an association for old people, and

this   association   and   other   related   voluntary

organisations  can  work together  towards  instilling

greater respect for the aged people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me deal with the Member for Boon Lay.

Yesterday  I have been wrongly accused by  the  Member

for Boon Lay



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1135</b></font><br><br>



However, I forgive him as he is new to this House.  He

is young and inexperienced.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He will know when he gets old.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> He has also much to learn of the

ways   of  the  world.  I  will  give  him  a   better

perspective   of  the  issues  that  he  has   raised.

Obviously, he is laying his new broom to sweep  clean.

I will help him to sweep in the right direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been portrayed, Sir, as being heartless,

unsympathetic  and  a man with a stony  heart.  It  is

obvious that the Member has not done his homework  and

at  the  same time he does not even know  me  at  all.

Those Members who are associated with me in one way or

another, particularly the Member for Sembawang in this

House, and those outside this House, will know that  I

do  take a personal interest in my work. Although I do

not  read the Chinese newspapers myself, I can  assure

the  Member  that  I am perfectly  aware  of  what  is

reported  in all newspapers, particularly of  personal

and  other  tragedies. Members in this House  will  be

able  to  enlighten  the Member for  Boon  Lay  of  my

concern  for cases which have been referred to  me  by

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every case of tragedy which comes to our notice,

either  from MPs, from members of the public  or  from

newspapers, the Social Welfare Department investigates

immediately.  Where I am aware of  such  cases,  I  do

personally  instruct my officials to look  into  them,

investigate,  and then inform me of the action  taken.

My  Senior Parliamentary Secretary can vouch for this.

The  case  that  was mentioned by the Member, of  the

mother  and  daughter  who committed  suicide,  is  an

unfortunate  one.  If they had approached  the  Social

Welfare  Department for assistance, then  the  tragedy

would not have happened. In cases of genuine tragedies

and   distress  where  assistance  is  required,   the

Department will render all possible assistance to help

them. The Social Welfare Department will also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>



consider  these  cases for public assistance.  We  can

assist  needy cases and there is no need for a special

fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Sir, there are some who would

rather  get  public sympathy through the press  first.

There  are  genuine  cases  of  hardship  which  merit

sympathy  and  assistance. There are,  however,  other

cases  which  take  the public for  a  ride  including

gullible MPs. To quote just one example. A few  months

back nearly all the newspapers portrayed some children

being evicted from their flat by the authorities.  The

impression   given  was  that  the  authorities   were

uncaring  and  heartless and the family was  suffering

from  poverty and hardship. It was even reported  that

the father was jobless and suffering from cancer. As a

normal   routine,   the  Social   Welfare   Department

investigated  the  case  and it  was  found  that  the

parents  were working and had refused to pay the  rent

and were staying away from home to avoid creditors for

gambling debts. It was also discovered that, far  from

suffering  from cancer, all he had was a boil  on  his

buttock.  In  this  case, the money collected  by  the

newspapers went to the wrong people. So not only  were

the  public  taken  for  a ride  but  the  newspapers,

including the newspaper in which the hon. Member is, I

understand, a director, were also taken for a ride.  I

would  like  to stress, Sir, that people  who  are  in

distress  should  not hesitate to contact  the  Social

Welfare Department for help.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to liaison between the Ministry and other

statutory  boards  and authorities, there  has  always

been   close   liaison  between  the  Social   Welfare

Department and the authorities such as the Housing and

Development   Board  and  the  PUB.  I  have   already

mentioned previously in this House that my Ministry is

setting up a coordinating committee of officials  from

various Ministries and departments to see what can  be

done for these cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the hon. Member that I do not

aspire to be a TV star of the stature of Justice  Pao,

but  my  Ministry  will continue  to  look  after  the

welfare  of those in need and to reach out to  prevent

tragedies



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>



from happening. If Members in this House are aware  of

any  case  which merits immediate attention  and  feel

that intervention is necessary, they only need to pick

up  the  telephone and speak to me and if they do  not

know the telephone number, it is 914111. If the Member

for  Boon  Lay should need a sympathetic ear  for  his

journalistic sensation. I can promise him action if he

will  ring up the same number 914111 when there  is  a

need.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Chong Tee (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with

your  permission, may I be allowed to say a few  words

on  the  subject  of Hindu temples? In Changi  Village

which is in my constituency there is a Sri Rama Temple

which  has  been  there  for more  than  30  years.  I

understand   that  with  the  Government   development

projects going on in Changi, this temple will have  to

make  way  for development in the near future.  A  few

days ago the Hon. Minister for Finance has stated that

Changi  Village  will be used as  a  tourist  stopover

point  and  that  Changi Prison will be  made  into  a

tourist attraction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, I would like to ask the Minister

for  Social Affairs whether the Sri Rama temple in  my

constituency will be allowed to continue to remain  in

Changi Village as one of the tourist stopover points.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, I am not aware of this temple

in  Changi and I am also not aware that it is going to

be  pulled down, or whether it is to be preserved  and

thus allowed to continue its activities. If the temple

is allowed to remain there, then it is up to the Board

of  Management to decide whether or not they  want  to

invite tourists to visit it as an attraction.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is also

another  problem  to  me, but I  did  not  mention  it

earlier because it is in Changi. If the Government  is

going to acquire that place, the Government must  give

an alternative site so that the temple can be resited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the 10,000 sq. ft. mentioned by the

Minister, most probably they will give the alternative

site right at the corner or near a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>



rubbish  dump.  I must emphasise that  it  must  be  a

suitable  site and it must have the agreement  of  the

Board of Management.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, after hearing the speech of the

Member  for Boon Lay yesterday in which he accused  my

Minister as being one who has no sympathy and one with

a stony heart, I would not have spoken had it not been

for the fact that this accusation is levelled not only

at my Minister but also affects the Ministry of Social

Affairs  as  a  whole, So our image will be  portrayed

adversely as one not carrying out our duty well. As  a

person  who  is  also involved in  the  work  of  this

Ministry, I know that the majority of problems that we

deal  in  our daily routine come from members  of  the

public,  sometimes  through MPs, or from  journalists.

Whenever an issue or a problem arises, we look into it

immediately  or  send  somebody  to  investigate,   if

necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Boon Lay has said that this matter

has not received our attention, as though we would not

want to help anybody in distress. He even went to  the

extent  of  describing  us as not  being  aware  of  a

tragedy. I say that everybody has some difficulties at

home   and   all  matters  or  problems   have   their

priorities.  Sometimes it may appear  that  a  problem

presents a challenge or a lesson or an experience that

everybody has to undergo. Some can overcome it; but to

those  who  cannot, it may seem to be the end  of  the

road for them when everything is not lost yet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Boon Lay thinks that whenever there

is  any  problem facing any member of the  public,  we

must  immediately go to his aid. I think this  is  not

the  way.  When  a newspaper publishes  such  hardship

stories,  the journalists, of course, report  it  with

good  intentions.  We hold nothing  against  them  but

there  are  certain things behind such  stories  which

they might not be aware of. The publication of news of

a  tragedy in the newspapers will arouse the  sympathy

of  many kind-hearted people in our society, and those

in sympathy, particularly charitable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>



philanthropists,   would  respond   quickly   to   the

newspaper's  appeal  to  come  to  the  aid  of   such

distressed  people. It sometimes happen that  when  we

send investigators to look into the matter asking them

to first approach us for help, these people would say,

"No.  You  had better not take any action to  help  us

until  the newspapers have published our news so  that

we  can get more financial relief from members of  the

public.  Then we will contact you for any help."  This

is  a  very  common occurrence. This is a weakness  in

people  who want to get more money for the  family  by

creating a tragic story.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes we have occasion to discuss this with the

journalists. After establishing the untruth of such  a

story,  we  ask the journalists to publish corrections

in  their newspapers but they refuse because it  might

reflect a very poor image of the journalists as  being

harsh  or immoral to such people. That is why we often

read  such tragic news in the newspapers but  never  a

correction  of the story if there was one. To  publish

corrections  to those incorrect cases  would  seem  to

affect  the  image  of integrity or  morality  of  the

newspapers  concerned. As Members  of  Parliament,  we

used to meet with such instances. Of course, when more

genuine  cases  are  brought  out  people  would   not

criticise  us  for  what we do, but  whatever  dubious

cases  that we have uncovered, the people would  close

their eyes and regard us as being immoral.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, there is always some difficulty with

every family. How do we educate our people to overcome

the difficulty? I feel that if there is any problem or

difficulty, it should be taken as a challenge  to  the

family concerned, as a training or testing ground  for

them to steel their spirit as well as their ability to

survive. The strong-willed will overcome it while  the

feeble  will succumb to charitable aid. So, as Members

of  Parliament,  we should understand this  spirit  of

struggle for life and try to teach the people the idea

of self-reliance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has mentioned Justice Pao. Actually he is

a symbol of an honest and a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>



just  judge.  It is a legendary story in which  he  is

being deified. Even in the film that we see, one  side

of  his face is black and the other white, and between

his  eye  brows  there  is  a  mystical  symbol  of  a

talisman. The black side of his face signifies that he

is  also a judge in Hades, so that while he judges the

living world he can also judge the spirit of man after

death.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also heard stories that even the emperor

gave him a regal sword authorizing him to cut off  the

heads  of  high  officials or close relatives  of  the

emperor without prior decree of the emperor if such  a

person was adjudged to have committed a serious  error

or  offence. We see Justice Pao hearing cases  in  his

court  and easily cut off the prisoner's head to  mete

out   justice.  This  never  happens  in  our  present

situation. Here, we even have heated debate over  such

a  small matter as "barbed wire". But Justice Pao  was

never   able   to  solve  the  problems  on   economy,

employment construction and other matters of  national

interest. I feel that the present MPs are more capable

than  Justice  Pao who was only able to  preside  over

fictitious cases. Our MPs are more capable than  these

things;  they  can also take part in  nation  building

besides other things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to clarify matters today by posing two

questions.  The  first question is whether  we  should

encourage the habit of reliance on others? The  second

question is whether we should encourage the people  to

be  self-reliant in order to be able to help  or  look

after themselves?



<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi (Kampong Kembangan):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  let me first say that in  my  dealings

with the Hon. Minister for Social Affairs I found  him

to  be  an amiable person. In fact, I had the pleasure

of  being  his constituent because I was  residing  in

Pasir Panjang before I shifted to Marine Vista. I also

had  the pleasure of working very closely with him  on

sports   promotion.  Therefore, when   I   heard   my

colleague's remark that he is such a heartless person,

I thought it was a bit of an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>



overstatement.  I  also  found  that  the   Minister's

pleasantness  seems to have sieved down  his  Ministry

because my dealings with his officials have also given

me  extremely pleasant experiences and I have had  the

pleasure  of receiving excellent service.  However,  I

found  that the counter attack by the Minister on  the

Member for Boon Lay was also a bit harsh, Perhaps  the

seriousness of the matter may have really provoked him

into  choosing words which, to my mind,  can  mar  his

pleasantness.  But  if  it is really  true  that  this

problem  had gone to the extent where the  Member  for

Boon Lay being a person of position and power -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Encik Mansor, I am sure the Member for

Boon Lay can defend himself. There is no need for  you

to defend him.



<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> I am really trying to ask

the  Member to clarify so that we can have a true  and

better picture of the situation. That is my request.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ngeow Pack Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ngeow Pack Hua (Boon Lay)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, yesterday evening at about 7.45 p.m.  I

spoke  for  five minutes. The Minister had  the  whole

night  to  think over what I said. Today he,  together

with his Parliamentary Secretary have joined hands  to

counter  attack me, and they fired a broadside.  So  I

will   now  take  the  opportunity  to  make   a   few

clarifications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Minister should have replied to my points

when I said that the main function of the Ministry  of

Social  Affairs was to look after the welfare  of  the

people.  But  the  Minister dealt  with  sports  first

instead of welfare. That means he was not paying  much

attention  to welfare work. He has paid more attention

to  football  and  sports. He has got  his  priorities

wrong. The next point is that it has been said that  I

have described him as a man with a stony heart. I  was

not  describing him personally. What I was  trying  to

say was that he was so occupied with other things that

he  did  not  pay  adequate attention to  the  welfare

aspect  of  his work. I am not saying that  he  is  by

character a man with a stony heart. What I was  trying

to  say  was that he might have appeared not  to  have

paid



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>



adequate attention to welfare work in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, talking about the white side and black side of

the  face of Justice Pao, as far as I am aware, there

is  only  one  colour on the face of Justice  Pao.  In

fact, we can look into this further. I hope that after

I  have  said this, the Minister and his Parliamentary

Secretary will not use the regal sword against me.  If

there is nothing more, I shall withdraw my amendment.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to assure him that I have already forgiven him. There is nothing for him to worry about.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ngeow Pack Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ngeow Pack Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head S be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead ACA 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is understood that the Registry

of  Cooperative  Societies has been reorganised  on  a

functional  basis  with  an  additional  four   staff,

including  two of executive officer grade.  Could  the

Minister give some facts and figures to indicate  that

after  this reorganisation what the Registry has  done

so  far in respect of promotional and educational work

for the benefit of the cooperative movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the idea of a Cooperative training centre to be

set  up  by the Registry is a wise one. I am  sure  it

will   be   welcomed   by   the  various   cooperative

organisations. In fact, this training centre  is  long

overdue.  But what I want to know is where  will  this

cooperative training centre be located, when  will  it

be in operation, and who will be in charge of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a fact that when members of trade unions

affiliated  to the NTUC are selected for seminars  and

courses conducted abroad and locally, they are granted

special  leave to attend these seminars  and  courses.

This  is  in  a way good in promoting trade  unionism.

Even cooperative societies were given this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>



privilege many years ago. But now I gather that  when

cooperators go for courses or seminars either  abroad

or locally, they are now not entitled to this special

leave.  Why is this so? I wonder whether the Minister

will  consider  recommending  the  granting  of  this

special leave for participants who go for cooperative

training.  This  will  in a way help  develop  better

cooperators  in  the  various cooperative  movements.

Sir, besides being a Registry, what encouragement and

moral   support  does  the  Registry  of  Cooperative

Societies   give  to  ensure  that  the   cooperative

societies  function properly? Sir, I would also  like

to   know  how  many  cooperative  societies  are  in

existence  in Singapore. How many of them are  really

active?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Registry of Cooperative Societies have a

proper  set of rules to run the various cooperatives?

If  it  has,  how  is  it that  some  societies  have

financial  problems?  I  suggest  that  the  Registry

should  play  a greater role in the interest  of  the

various   societies  and  ensure   that   a   healthy

environment exists. Even in the case of the Singapore

Government Officers' Cooperative Housing Society,  we

do  not know whether or not it is really functioning.

If  members request for a refund of their  money,  no

reply is given. I do not know what they are doing.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for  Anson is correct in saying that the Registry  of

Cooperative Societies has now been reorganised as the

Registry of Cooperative Societies and Mutual  Benefit

Organisations.  The  earlier  reorganisation  of  the

Registry,  which  he has referred  to,  involved  the

setting up of two sections, one on administration and

audit and the other on promotion and training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the promotional and educational work

undertaken  by  the Registry for the benefit  of  the

cooperative  movement, the hon. Member  may  wish  to

know  that  the Registry has conducted  a  number  of

courses  for  the staff and officials of  cooperative

societies. Last year, a basic book-keeping course was

organised  for 63 cooperators. A similar course  will

be organised next month



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1144</b></font><br><br>



for  officials of Malay cooperative societies.  There

will  also  be  a  basic audit  course  for  internal

auditors.  The  Registry also  conducts  co-operative

study tours for secondary school pupils and publishes

pamphlets  and bulletins on cooperative matters.  The

promotional work of the Registry is primarily one  of

giving   advice  and  guidance  to  individuals   and

organisations    intending   to   form    cooperative

societies.  Last year 14 groups were given assistance

by  the  Registry to set up cooperative societies  in

Singapore. Four more cooperative societies have  been

set up as a result of consultation and discussion led

by  the  Registry  staff. Several courses  are  being

planned  by the Registry to fulfil particular  social

roles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the proposed Cooperative Training Centre, my

Ministry is re-examining this project in view of  the

difficulty in forming the apex cooperative body which

was  supposed  to  take over this project  after  the

Government has set it up. Originally, we intended  to

establish the centre at the Command and Staff College

building  at  Fort Canning. But since  this  building

will   be   allocated   to  another   Ministry,   the

implementation of this project will be delayed.  This

project  is  also  tied up with the revision  of  the

cooperative legislation wherein provisions  are  made

to  ensure  the viability of this project and  unless

there is support for the project and the formation of

an  apex  body to run it, it may not be  prudent  for

Government  to do the ground work for the  apex  body

which  may  not  materialise.  In  the  interim   the

Registry  will continue to run courses on cooperative

subjects  on an ad hoc basis in cooperation with  the

cooperative societies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member has also referred to the granting

of  special leave for cooperators to attend  training

courses  and  seminars. I am afraid that  this  is  a

matter  for the employers to consider. As far as  the

Government   is  concerned,  leave  is  granted   for

recognised seminars and training courses. I do  agree

with  the  hon.  Member  that  this  is  one  way  of

developing  the  cooperators  and  thus  helping  the

cooperative  movement to progress. I would  certainly

like to see employers in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1145</b></font><br><br>



private  sector encourage their staff who are involved

in cooperative work to develop themselves by attending

seminars and courses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, Sir, there are 78 cooperative societies

in  existence.  The  number of  cooperative  societies

belie the fact that the cooperative movement is not an

active   one,   since  most  of  the  new  cooperative

societies  serve  a  large segment of  the  population

especially  those  formed and run  by  the  NTUC.  The

Registry over the last few years had been pruning down

the  cooperative societies. During the period 1972-76,

21 cooperative societies were deregistered. During the

same period the Registry completed the liquidation  of

65  cooperative societies. This is part of the process

of  consolidation of the cooperative movement  started

in 1970.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of the hon. Member, all

cooperative  societies operate under  the  Cooperative

Societies  Act and Rules. Besides this, they  have  to

operate  within  the ambit of their own  constitutions

and  by  laws as approved by the Registry and modified

from  time  to  time according to the requirements  of

their membership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial problems faced by the cooperative

societies are usually the result of bad management  or

poor  judgment  in  embarking upon financial  ventures

which  prove  to  be  non-viable. The  Registry  gives

advice  and  assistance  to cooperative  societies  on

financial  matters.  But  decisions  with  regard   to

investments which are allowed by law are made  by  the

members  themselves.  By and large, most  cooperative

societies are financially healthy. The hon. Member  is

obviously   referring  to  one  or   two   cooperative

societies which are facing financial difficulties  due

to  certain  projects  which failed  as  a  result  of

circumstances beyond their control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head S be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead ADA 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as you are aware, the volunteer probation

officers,  since  the  scheme  was  initiated  by  the

Ministry of Social Affairs sometime ago, have been and

are  performing  a  very useful community  service  in

preventing  crime  and delinquency and  in  preventing

offenders   placed  on  probation.  The   handful   of

probation  and aftercare officers of the  Ministry  of

Social Affairs, one of whom I know personally, have by

tradition   and  dedication  continued  without   much

publicity   in   shouldering   responsibilities    for

rehabilitating  offenders  and  drug  addicts  in  our

community.  With the increasing problem of drug  abuse

on  our  hands,  the  burden of  rehabilitating  these

offenders will fall on the shoulders of these officers

and the volunteer probation officers. I would like  to

know, Sir, if the Minister could inform the House  how

many   such  volunteer  probation  officers  are   now

attached to the Probation and Aftercare Service of the

Ministry  of  Social Affairs, and what  has  been  the

dropout  rate  during the past five years?  Are  there

plans  and sufficient resources to further expand  the

service    to    the    various   constituencies    or

neighbourhoods?  Will the Minister  consider  granting

incentives  and  privileges  to  volunteer   probation

officers  in  appreciation  of  their  services,   for

example,   transport  and  out-of-pocket   allowances,

concession   on  extramural  study  courses   of   the

University  of Singapore which are relevant  to  their

work?



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, there are now 284

volunteer  probation officers to assist the  full-time

probation  officers. The community  probation  service

was  launched  in  1971. Between 1971  and  1976,  797

persons   applied   to   become  volunteer   probation

officers.   290  of  them  or  36.4%  were  ultimately

selected. The Department is highly selective in  order

to  preserve the standard of work, image and integrity

of the service. Up to the end of last year, only 58 or

20%  have  opted out of the programme, an  average  of

3.3% a year. Of these, 17 resigned



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>



on  their  own accord because of personal commitments;

39  were  found unsuitable and two died. 72  volunteer

probation   officers  have  been  in   the   community

probation  service  for  more  than  five  years.  The

dropout rate is, therefore, minimal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member for Bedok that incentive

schemes are necessary to sustain the interest  of  the

volunteer  probation officers. But it is not desirable

to grant monetary incentives like transport allowances

and  out-of-pocket  expenses as  it  will  defeat  the

spirit  of  voluntarism among our citizens.  The  best

incentives are the satisfaction of a job well done and

the  recognition  given for such  voluntary  work.  My

Ministry intends to issue commendation certificates to

volunteers who show dedication, continued interest and

success in voluntary work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year the Department proposes to embark on

another  two neighbourhood projects in Bedok New  Town

and  Marine  Parade.  While these projects  have  been

found  useful  in  involving the  local  community  in

rehabilitating  offenders in their midst,  it  is  not

possible  with the limited resources to  take  on  too

many constituencies or neighbourhoods at a time.



<br><br><!-- Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin:</b> Sir, in view of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have received a request for an extra Tamil-speaking kathi, for the Shariah Court which at the

moment  has  only  got  a  Malay  speaking  kathi.   I

understand that some of the Indian Muslims who have  a

lot  of  dealings in this court find it  difficult  at

times to communicate with the Malay kathi. Perhaps the

Department  would not mind providing a  Tamil-speaking

kathi  to  solve the problem. Could the Minister  look

into this matter?



<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek Bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek Bin Saniff (Kolam Ayer)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir,

marriage  is one of the most important events  in  the

life  of  man.  This  is a natural  inclination.  Even

animals  have  this instinct. The only  difference  is

that  as human beings we are guided by rules. Our mind

forms the basis of our ability to strike a balance. We

are  then  able  to recognise what is permissible  and

what  is  forbidden. Permissible cohabitation  in  the

eyes  of Islam and other religions is through marriage

or  wedlock.  Cohabitation between a man and  a  woman

outside  marriage is known as adultery. Sigmund  Freud

who   laid   much  stress  on  the  significance   and

overwhelming  urge of sex in human nature  has  caused

many  people to hold the view that one of the  factors

for  the unbalanced world situation at present can  be

attributed  to  sex.  At present,  we  find  that  the

problem  pertaining to sex has become more  widespread

so much so that it is causing anxiety both in the West

and in the East. Morality has been adversely affected.

Incidence of VD is rising. Some people have even  been

saying, "Why should we own a cow if we can find  cow's

milk  everywhere?" In fact, this figure of  speech  is

different  from what the Member for Telok Blangah  has

said.  There are women who totally reject the idea  of

marriage but continue to cohabit with men after taking

steps  to  ensure that they would not become pregnant.

They  would  say. "Why should we trouble ourselves  by

becoming pregnant and bear children?" They say this as

if  they have forgotten that by the grace of God  they

were  delivered unto this world by their mothers.  The

course  of  pregnancy and child bearing involves  much

sacrifice on the part of the mother or wife.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1149</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all of us certainly want our marriage to last.

In  the Al-Quran it is stated that the one thing which

God  allows  but  dislikes is  divorce  of  a  married

couple.   This   is  because  divorce   will   present

difficulties particularly to the children. I hope this

will not be made an excuse by those who are afraid  to

get  married.  In  this connection, I  would  like  to

express  my  appreciation for the  good  work  of  the

Singapore  Shariah  Court  which  from  time  to  time

succeeds in reducing the rate of divorce among members

of  the Muslim community in Singapore. I only hope and

pray  that while the two parties are negotiating  with

the  Shariah  Court as an intermediary, no undesirable

events take place. What I mean is that while the Court

is trying to resolve the divorce cases, it should keep

track of every case in great detail to ensure that  no

delays  are caused as this may result in either  party

committing  an  act which is forbidden. For  instance,

should  quarrels develop the feeling of hatred on  the

part  of  the  husband may cause him to  do  something

drastic against the wife. Or what is worse is that  if

there  is  a  third party involved, then an adulterous

relationship which is deplorable may develop. In  this

connection, I think it would do well for the  Ministry

to issue a statement for the benefit of members of the

public  informing  them  as to  which  authority  they

should   submit  their  appeal  to  should   they   be

dissatisfied  with the decision of the Shariah  Court.

For  instance, can they appeal to the Singapore Muslim

Religious  Council (MUIS), or is there  any  board  of

appeal  for  this  purpose? It is a common  occurrence

that  whenever  a  quarrel  develops,  the  wife   who

constitutes the weaker party is usually victimised  by

the  husband. Bruises on various parts of the body are

usually  cited  as strong grounds for divorce  by  the

wife.  This  is  usually  made  the  main  point   for

consideration by those concerned. There may  be  cases

in  which  a doctor who is called to examine  a  woman

cannot  determine  whether or  not  the  bruises  were

caused  by assault by the husband. In such cases  will

the  Court  rely on the doctor's evidence or  will  it

form its own conclusion?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope such matters as I have mentioned will be

carefully studied so that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1150</b></font><br><br>



there  will  always  be  good  relations  between  the

Shariah  Court and members of the public,  a  kind  of

relationship whereby hopes can be turned into  reality

or  the sanctity of the institution of marriage can be

maintained. Whether a marriage can last or whether  it

breaks  after  a  quarrel has  developed,  every  case

should  be  dealt  with tactfully and  in  the  wisest

possible manner in accordance with the tenets  of  the

Islamic religion.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, the Shariah Court has a

standing arrangement made with the High Court for  the

use of interpreters when dealing with Tamil-Muslim and

Punjabi-Muslim  cases.  The  number  of  Indian-Muslim

cases  handled by the Shariah Court each year is  very

small and most of them can speak Malay. In 1975, there

were  only four cases. In 1976, there were only  three

cases.   Therefore,  this  number  does  not   justify

employing a Tamil-speaking kathi to solve the problem.

The  Shariah  Court  will continue with  this  present

practice  of  using Tamil interpreters from  the  High

Court  when  dealing  with Indian-Muslims  who  cannot

speak  Malay.  But we intend to have a  Tamil-speaking

Naib Kathi or Assistant Kathi to officiate at marriage

ceremonies  and  to deal with cases  involving  Indian

Muslims.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the point raised by the Member for Kolam

Ayer,  firstly, I would like to thank the  Member  for

praising  the  efforts of the Shariah Court  to  bring

down   the   number  of  divorces  among  Muslims   in

Singapore.  The  Shariah Court  has  a  difficult  but

challenging  task in dealing with various  matrimonial

disputes  relating to marriage, divorce, the  division

of  properties  and the payment of dowry,  maintenance

and consolation gifts (matta'ah).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its inception in 1958, the Shariah Court has

been  quite successful in dealing with disputed  cases

of  divorce  and has managed to cut down  the  divorce

rate  from  around 50% before 1958 to 10% at  present.

This  is the lowest divorce rate among Muslims in this

part  of the world. It must be recognised that dealing

with marital disputes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1151</b></font><br><br>



involving couples who disagree with each other  is  by

no means an easy task. The Kathi and the Muslim social

case  workers  furthermore have to  work  within  the

ambit   of   the  religious  laws.  So   far   nothing

contradictory  to religious laws ever occurred  during

the  conciliation  or compromise between  the  parties

concerned.  Also  every  effort  is  made   by   these

officials to settle cases as quickly as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In matrimonial disputes, complaints of assault are

made  by  one  party, usually the  female  party.  The

complainant  will  be asked by the  Shariah  Court  to

lodge a report with the police and to go for a medical

check-up.  The  case  is then referred  to  the  Civil

Court.  Subsequently, in the divorce  proceedings  the

set of evidence obtained from the Civil Court relating

to  the  charges of assault together with the  medical

evidence  available  will be used in  considering  the

case by the Shariah Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is provision under the Administration of

Muslim  Law  Act for appeals to be made to  an  Appeal

Board  constituted from time to time by the  President

of the Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura. Any person who is

not  satisfied with the decision of the Shariah  Court

may  appeal to the Appeal Board. The Appeal Board  may

confirm or reverse or vary the decision of the  Court,

and  exercise any such powers as the Court could  have

exercised,  making such order as the  Court  ought  to

have  made  or  order a retrial. The decision  of  the

Appeal Board is final,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head S be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead BEA 1101* (* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr P. Govindaswamy).



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1152</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although relief funds allocated for these years have

decreased,  however, there are more  people  who  need

welfare  assistance.  In  recent  years,  the   Social

Welfare  Department has promoted a scheme  to  enable

those  under relief aid to get employment. This  is  a

good  measure.  It  will not only reduce  Government's

burden  of relief aid but also enable those recipients

to  increase their income to enjoy a better life.  The

Minister  has  said that last year the Department  had

helped  about 400 people of old age to get employment.

This is a very good move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have received some complaints that the

officers  in the Social Welfare Department in  dealing

with these people have been too hasty or peremptory in

their attitude. They stopped the payment of the relief

aid  to such people before the time was ripe and  even

before   they   could  get  any  employment.   In   my

constituency  there is a 53 year-old woman  who  lives

with  her  mother who is 73 years old.  They  have  no

children to support them, as a daughter had moved  out

upon  her  marriage.  She was  then  receiving  relief

assistance  at  $40  per month. The  officers  in  the

Social  Welfare Department found that the 53  year-old

woman  is still healthy physically and advised her  to

seek  a job or the Department could help her to get  a

job.  She took their advice. But before she could  get

any  employment, they cancelled her public assistance.

Under the circumstances, who is going to support these

two  aged women? This instance shows that the officers

have  been too hasty and the Social Welfare Department

has  been  too presumptuous. I can supply the Minister

with  the  details of this case, so that he  can  look

into it. I would like to say that there are also other

similar cases. I have to mention this case here hoping

that  the  Minister and also the Senior  Parliamentary

Secretary  would pay more attention to it and  to  see

that  the  officers  in the Department  will  be  more

careful in such matters in future.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the Social Welfare

Department which looks after the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1153</b></font><br><br>



welfare  homes  seems to be uncertain particularly  in

its management of Girls' Homes. I have often been told

that   some  of  the  girls  from  these  homes  after

rehabilitation are repeatedly sent back to the welfare

homes  for  the same offences, like running away  from

home,   mixing   with   bad  company,   indulging   in

undesirable  acts, etc. Why is this so? I wonder  what

motivation and rehabilitation is given to these  girls

when they are in these welfare homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know how the counselling of

welfare  cases  is being handled. I gather  that  many

cases   of  family  disputes  are  referred  to   this

Counselling and Advice Section. The cases take a  long

time to settle, and some even take a year, so much  so

that  some  fail to resolve the family disputes.  This

section  is  indeed a very important one. It  is  this

section  which  decides either  the  family  lives  in

harmony or break up. I feel this section cannot afford

to  delay  the  settling of welfare  cases.  I  wonder

whether  this section is running short of officers  or

the  officers themselves have to be given  proper  and

intensive training either locally or abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that some of the offices of the Social

Welfare  Department at Pearl's Hill are badly  housed.

There  are cubicles with wooden partitions which  look

like dungeons, and the atmosphere is uncomfortable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any private discussion going on in one room can be

heard  in  the  other. Private affairs  become  public

knowledge,  because  of the shabby cubicles  provided.

Can  something  be  done  to improve  this  deplorable

situation,  so  that the officers can  deal  with  the

public more efficiently and in a better environment?

(Paper Misc. 3 of 1977), the





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1154</b></font><br><br>



increase of $400,000 in Public Assistance provision is

due to the revised rates. That means from now on those

who  have to depend on public assistance will be given

more.  It  shows  that the Government  especially  the

Ministry  under the care of the kind hearted Minister.

does  take  good care of those who are less privileged

and  less  fortunate. However, no matter how  much  we

increase the amount of public assistance allowance, it

is  really  difficult for the recipients to make  both

ends  meet nowadays. Because of this, I would like  to

see   the  Department  of  Social  Welfare  relax  its

regulations and conditions in order that recipients of

public  assistance allowance can be reasonably allowed

to take part-time jobs from time to time to supplement

their public assistance allowance. In other words, no

recipient  should be disqualified if he  is  found  to

take  on  an  odd job or a part time job  because  the

amount of public assistance allowance that he receives

is not enough.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry has publicly announced a scheme

whereby sums of $1,000 will be loaned without interest

to  those who need to start a small business so as  to

help  them  be  on their feet. I would  like  to  know

whether  the provision for Public Assistance allowance

will  also  be used for this purpose and  whether  the

present recipients of the allowance will be allowed to

participate in this scheme.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Thank you, Sir,I fully share the

sentiments expressed by my colleagues, the Member  for

Sembawang  and  the Member for Delta, concerning  the

question  of public assistance allowances. The  Member

for  Delta  is  correct  in saying  that  due  to  the

revision  of  this allowance, there is an increase  of

$400,000. The point I wish





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1155</b></font><br><br>



to  make may be similar to the points mentioned by the

two  hon.  Members,  but I think it  is  necessary  to

repeat them if we are to get results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that the Social Welfare Department should

consider  the  requests of Members of Parliament  when

they are faced with problems of this nature, that  is,

where a recipient of public assistance has to do  some

odd  job  to  supplement his income  to  maintain  his

family.   There  is  one  case  in  the  Housing   and

Development Board Estate in Punggol. A certain  family

was  receiving about $91 a month in public  assistance

allowance.   The   woman  has   three   children   but

unfortunately  her husband left her. So  she  took  on

some  small  jobs. This was discovered by  the  Social

Welfare  Department  and  as  a  result,  the   public

assistance was withdrawn. I believe this is a bit  too

harsh  because the small allowance could  only  enable

this  family to live, if I can term it, from  hand  to

mouth. Taking the allowance away from her just because

she  is  industrious enough to do some odd jobs,  like

helping  in  the stalls in order to get a few  dollars

more a day to maintain the family, is a harsh act.  In

this  respect, would  not  the  Minister  for  Social

Affairs  consider sympathetically the plight  of  such

recipients,  especially those who have to pay  rentals

to  the Housing Board for the flats they live in?  The

rental  for  a one-room improved flat today  is  about

$37.50.  So that family has to pay, apart from  public

utilities

It  is slightly more than one-third. After paying  for

public  utilities, what remains  for  the  family  is

hardly  sufficient.  I  remember  well,  Sir,  in  the

Addendum to the President's Speech, the Prime Minister

said  that  we are committed to help the  most  needy.

Surely this is one aspect where the Ministry of Social

Affairs can consider. I think there should be greater



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1156</b></font><br><br>



flexibility  in  the rules and they  should  encourage

these recipients if they are able to work to find some

form of employment so that they can earn supplementary

income.  If greater encouragement is shown, I  do  not

think  they  want  to  live on  the  bitter  bread  of

charity.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Sembawang has brought up a case which is more  than  a

complaint during his meet-the-people session.  He  has

accused  our  staff of handling the case in  a  rather

hasty  manner. If it were so, I apologise and ask  him

to give us the details of the case so that we can send

somebody to look into this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come to the points made by the Member for Anson.

In  1976  a  total  of  400 girls were  discharged  or

paroled  from the Social Welfare Girls' Home. Only  43

girls or 10% were readmitted. Many of these girls were

recalled   because  of  an  infringement   of   parole

conditions, such as:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That she shall not involve herself in activities

detrimental to her work;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That she shall not frequent or work in bars;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That she shall not change her address and employment

without the prior knowledge and consent of her  after-care officer;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That she shall take instruction from her after-care

officers when given.



<br><br>The  girls were therefore readmitted for reasons other

than  that  which has precipitated the admission  into

the  Home  originally. In many cases,  readmission  is

necessary to enhance the rehabilitation process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Social Welfare Department has recently

undertaken a reorganisation of this Girls' Home.  This

is  to effect better classification and segregation of

the girls according to their behaviour and the kind of

care  or  rehabilitation required by  each  individual

girl. Rehabilitation programme within the institutions

was   also  reviewed.  Programmes  to  inculcate  more

discipline  and  for  greater  character-building  and

citizenship were introduced. Where it appeared that a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>



girl  could no longer benefit from academic schooling,

training  for  skills  or for work  discipline  in  an

industrial  setting was provided. Thus a work  release

scheme  has  been introduced in Toa Payoh Girls'  Home

where girls who have more adequate programmes and show

good  behaviour  go out to work daily in  an  approved

factory. The girls are encouraged to continue  working

in   the  particular  factory  where  there  is   good

supervision over them on their discharge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mount Emily Girls' Home factory assembly work is

continuing.   This  provides  the   girls   with   the

discipline for working in factory settings.  They  are

encouraged  to continue in such occupations  on  their

discharge.  Apart from more discipline being  stressed

in  training programmes, more interesting  and  varied

educational and recreational programmes are also being

introduced to produce mentally and physically  healthy

young persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expected that more trained staff will be

deployed  on  counselling  programmes  for  girls   in

residential  institutions in the new  financial  year.

Family disputes, whether they are between parents  and

children  or  between marital parents, are  often  the

result  of  relationship problems. These  problems  in

turn  are caused by personality conflicts. Such  cases

require  a considerable amount of counselling  over  a

long period of time. Reconciliation is often temporary

and  problems erupt again each time a family  faces  a

crisis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Social Welfare Department is aware of the

importance of this Counselling and Advice Section  and

attempts  are  being made to upgrade the effectiveness

of  the  work  of  this section. The section  will  be

staffed  with higher grade trained staff  in  the  new

financial  year. One staff member will be leaving  for

special training in marital counselling in the  United

Kingdom  shortly,  and the second  phase  of  the  in-service training programme on counselling for staff of

the section has begun on 15th March this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steps have already been taken to extend the office

space  on  the  ground  floor of  the  Social  Welfare

Department. The extension



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1158</b></font><br><br>



work  will  enable  the Department to  make  available

interviewing rooms so that interviews can be conducted

in  privacy.  Unnecessary wooden  partitions  will  be

removed so that the staff may carry out their work  in

a more comfortable atmosphere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the points made by the Member for Delta, under

the  public  assistance scheme  all  recipients  where

possible,  including  the handicapped  and  aged,  are

encouraged and assisted to take on part-time  jobs  to

supplement their public assistance allowance  so  that

they  need  not  entirely be dependent  on  Government

welfare  relief. However, there has to be a  limit  to

the  amount  of  income  that  the  public  assistance

recipient  is  allowed  to  retain,  otherwise  public

assistance allowance will be taken by these recipients

as  a  supplementary income and it will also encourage

them  to  stay on public assistance allowance  for  as

long as possible. Every encouragement will be given to

assist public assistance recipients to try to be self-dependent  where  possible. The  criteria  for  public

assistance  are stringent and those who are  able  but

unwilling   to  work  are  disqualified  from   public

assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Self-Employment Assistance Scheme, a self-help

project,   was  implemented  by  the  Social   Welfare

Department  in  February  1977.  This  is  to  provide

interest-free  loans to help those in  poor  financial

circumstances  to  stand on  their  own  feet.  It  is

financed  from  a charity fund. The public  assistance

vote is not used for this project. The Self-Employment

Assistance  Scheme  is to cater specially  for  public

assistance  recipients  to enable  them  to  be  self-supporting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the points raised by the Member for Punggol.

I  have mentioned earlier that there has not been much

change  in  the  consumer price index since  the  last

review  to  merit  a further review of  the  rates  of

public assistance. Under the public assistance scheme,

a recipient with a wife is allowed, in addition to his

public  assistance  allowance of  $66  per  month,  to

retain  an  increased income of up to $15  per  month.

Under  the  mean test he gets another  $15  per  month

under a work incentive credit system. This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>



$30 is disregarded in the assessment of the quantum of

public   assistance   allowance  payable.   Also,   an

additional  disability allowance of $10 per  month  is

payable  to  a  head of a household who  is  certified

permanently   disabled.  Fares  are  also   given   to

recipients  who need to attend Government  clinics  or

hospitals for treatment. Public assistance recipients,

particularly   the   aged,  in  addition   to   public

assistance, are also receiving in cash and  kind  from

charitable bodies and voluntary organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherever possible, the Department also helps to find

jobs  for  the public assistance recipients  or  their

families so that they can be self-sufficient and  will

not  have to depend on welfare aid. The Social Welfare

Department is therefore unable to assist further  with

the   payment   of   rentals  to   public   assistance

recipients. Recipients, where possible, are encouraged

to  help themselves as Government alone is not able to

provide  adequately  for  all  the  needs  of   public

assistance  recipients. For 1976  the  Social  Welfare

Department disbursed $3.6 million in public assistance

allowance to a monthly average of 6,640 families.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I am very grateful to the

Senior  Parliamentary Secretary to  the  Minister  for

Social Affairs for his kind reply. But would he assure

this  House that the public assistance allowance would

not  be  straightaway withdrawn if the Department  has

assisted a recipient in getting a job?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Sir, that depends on the salary

that the recipient gets from the job. If the salary is

not  very  big,  then we will certainly  consider  the

case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head S - (cont.)



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head S be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead BEC 1101* (*The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs

Ho Kah Leong and Ahmad Haleem).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the allocation here amounts to some $860,000

which  shows a decrease as compared with last year.  A

creche is mainly to help working mothers with children

to  go  out  and  work. This service is of  particular

assistance  to wage earning parents. This  is  a  very

good  service provided by the Department.  However,  I

would  like to ask the Minister two questions.  First,

will  his  Department consider the  setting  up  of  a

creche  at  Marsiling in Woodlands  which  is  in  the

Sembawang   Constituency,  because  there   are   many

factories   in  this  big  satellite  town   and   the

population is also very big. The creche will  help  to

ease the burden of the housewives when they go out  to

work. Second, why has the number of staff at the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>



creches been greatly reduced? Is it because of a  need

to  reduce expenditure, or is there any other  reason?

If  the  reason  is  good, maybe  it  would  be  quite

acceptable.  But the children need adequate  care  and

the  service  at  the  creches will  ensure  that  the

children are safe.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if my

memory serves me right, the Ministry of Social Affairs

at one time spoke very highly of the creches under its

management.  However,  I  was rather  disappointed  to

learn  that the Ministry has lost interest in  running

its creches, so much so that all its creches will soon

be  handed  to the NTUC and its affiliates.  With  due

respect  to the NTUC, Sir, I have not the least  doubt

that  it  will  be able to run these creches  just  as

well. All I want to say is that if the running of  the

creches  is  regarded  as part of its  responsibility,

then the Ministry should keep its own creches and look

after  them. I have no objection to the NTUC or  other

interested private parties being encouraged to set  up

creches  of  their own to augment social  services  of

this  nature. But I am sure that as more married women

are encouraged to join the labour force, more and more

creches will be needed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point in my mind is that if eventually all

the  creches are handed over to the NTUC,  despite  my

appeal made here, what will happen to the staff? There

is a total staff of 96 in FY 77 employed to look after

the  creches. Will they all be retrenched? I  am  sure

some  of  the members of the staff must have undergone

professional  training. Under such circumstances,  how

would their expertise be put to optimum use?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem:</b> I am not speaking, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Sembawang has asked whether a creche could be built in

Marsiling area, in Sembawang constituency. The  Social

Welfare  Department fully agrees with the Member  that

there must be adequate creche facilities to look after

the  children  of  working mothers. Since  the  creche

services are very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1162</b></font><br><br>



highly  subsidised, the Department  will  have  to  be

convinced that there is a demand for such services  in

a  particular  area  before a  creche  is  built.  The

building of a creche can be considered if the need for

creche  facilities is established. Although there  are

plans to establish more creches, the present policy is

to  encourage and help the private sector  to  set  up

their  own creche in or near their premises to  assist

married  female workers who have young  children.  The

aim  is  to  encourage more married women to  take  up

employment in Singapore. The Social Welfare Department

will advise and assist any private or non-Governmental

organisation  that wishes to start a  creche  for  its

female  workers. It will also ensure that such creches

are properly run.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has said that the staff for

the creches of the Social Welfare Department have been

drastically  reduced. The reduction of  staff  in  the

various  creches  in  1976  was  the  result  of   the

implementation  of  a  new  staffing  norm  which  the

Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Social Affairs

agreed   on  to  reduce  the  high  cost  of   running

Government creches. Except for the few larger creches,

the majority of the other creches are not affected. In

fact,  two  creches, such as Lee Kuo Chuan Creche  and

the  Tanjong Pagar Creche, have increased their  staff

under the new staffing norm.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to the Member for

Jurong's  query, let me correct the  picture  on  the

transfer  of creches to-date. Only the Kallang  Creche

has  been transferred to SILO to run. In the  case  of

the  staff  in the Kallang Creche, they were  absorbed

into  the other 10 creches to fill vacancies.  As  for

the transfer of the other creches to the NTUC, this is

still under consideration and has not been implemented

yet.  Should the creches be transferred to  the  NTUC,

they will have their own trained staff to operate  the

creches.  The  staff of the existing creches  will  be

redeployed.  The  creches and the  equipment  will  be

transferred  to the NTUC on take-over.  However,  rent

and  other  charges  will be met by  the  organisation

concerned.

proposition.  I would like to ask who will  be  taking

the initiative to get the organisations in the private

sector  to  set  up  these creches,  and  whether  his

Department has taken any lead to liaise with them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, if

creches.

rates  to  be imposed by the organisations  on  taking

over of the creches?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir I had intended to

speak  on sports under what I thought was the  correct

subhead. But it has already been spoken by the  Member

for  Anson on a previous amendment. I therefore do not

wish to move my amendment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right. Amendment (8), Mr Yeo is

Amendment (10), Mr Teong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head S be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead AAA 8301*. (*The same amendment also stood in the name of Dr Ong

Leong Boon).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this allocation is for the

Singapore Sports Council. Last year the grant  was  $2

million. For this financial year the allocation is  $1

million.  There is a decrease of 50%, i.e. $1 million.

I  would  like to know the reason. With such a  meagre

sum  of  $1  million it is not sufficient  to  promote

sports  on  a  national scale. If we want  to  promote

sports island-wide so as to build a rugged nation,  we

should have adequate funds to achieve this objective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Sports Council has, in the past few

years,  made certain achievements in the promotion  of

sports  activities, particularly in  ball  games.  The

standards  of the various sports and games  have  also

been raised. For instance, in the recent pre-World Cup

Football  Tournament, Asian Zone, held  in  Singapore,

Singapore  was  placed second.  This  is  quite  good,

though  we  could not get first place.  That  is  some

consolation to us.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1165</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to answer two questions.

The first question is whether he would consider giving

some transport allowance to Sports liaison officers of

the various districts. They have all along contributed

much  to  sports and games on a voluntary basis.  They

have  used  much  of their own time to attend  various

meetings  and  to  go out to help promote  sports  and

games.  Therefore,  we  should think  about  them  and

provide   them  with  some  transport  allowances   to

encourage them.



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  to  make  some comments on the Singapore  Sports

Council.  I  would like to re-emphasise the  objective

that  we  have  always declared  that  in  our  sports

promotion,  the intention is really to promote  sports

participation  at mass level and that  we  should  not

unduly  over-emphasise, over-stress and over-exert  to

produce  world beaters. I must however, Sir, add  that

it  is  to  an  extent  a  necessity  for  our  sports

promoters  to try to achieve some reasonable  standard

for our top sportsmen, at least at regional level. One

of  these  side  effects  would  be  in  the  national

interest, not least politically but certainly, and the

more  important  level,  it  further  stimulates   and

encourages mass interest and mass participation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore note with interest in the Main and

Development  Estimates that the  contribution  to  the

Sports  Council  remains at $4 million  which  is  not

different from that for the previous year. It is in  a

sense  a  static contribution. However,  Sir,  looking

under  the  Development Estimates, I notice  that  the

grant to the Singapore Sports Council has dropped from

$2  million for FY 76 to $1 million for FY 77  with  a

provision  for  revote.  I  would  like  to  seek  the

Minister's clarification as to whether this drop  from

$2  million  to  $1  million indicates  any  declining

interest, if at all, in sports promotion and, if  not,

why this lesser figure. Sir, more importantly, I would

like  to  seek  the Minister's views on the  following

points:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1166</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is in regard to the centralisation of all

national  sports associations under  one  roof.  I  am

aware  that in the past, Sports House at Rutland  Road

was  offered  to  all national sports associations  to

have  their  headquarters, but due  to  a  variety  of

reasons  many  national sports associations  have  not

been  able to maintain an office there. Sir,  I  found

this  most regrettable because this has created a  lot

of   administrative  problems  in  liaison   and   co-ordination   work.   In  fact,   today   most   sports

associations   have  correspondence  addresses   which

change from year to year and sometimes from season  to

season. I notice that some national associations have,

as a correspondence address, the home or the office of

their  office bearers. As a result of this, Sir,  very

often  correspondence is lost and letters do not reach

the  office-bearers in time. And by the time a  letter

reaches   the  office-bearer,  it  may  take   months,

sometimes  three to six months, by which  time  it  is

already a fait accompli. I am suggesting therefore that

the  Singapore  Sports Council should  look  into  the

possibility    of   getting   all   national    sports

associations  housed under one roof and preferably  at

the  Singapore  Sports Council.  This  will  certainly

enhance  the  Sports Council as a  central  point  for

sports   promotion   in  Singapore.   It   will   help

promotional work for the various associations. I  know

that  there  are problems of finance. But  since  this

country is encouraging sports participation on a  very

large  scale, I think the least the Government can  do

is to provide quarters at the Sports Council office at

very reasonable rates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second point relates to the Master Plan for

Sports  for  the next five years. I notice that  there

have  been  some  announcements regarding  the  Sports

Master  Plan. I feel that before the plan is drawn  up

or  made  public, the Singapore Sports Council  should

consult  or  liaise with the various  national  sports

associations  regarding the promotion  of  sports  for

Singapore for the next five years. I think the various

sports  associations in many ways have the  expertise,

the  knowledge,  the interest of sports  promotion  in

Singapore, and I suggest therefore that they should be

consulted where the Master Plan is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1167</b></font><br><br>



concerned. Certainly, when it comes to the question of

provision of sports facilities, they might be able  to

offer some useful suggestions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have really been asked to raise the next

point by some Members who are interested in jogging. I

was  told  that  MacRitchie Reservoir is  a  favourite

jogging  site,  perhaps for reasons of convenience  or

for other particular reasons. Nevertheless, MacRitchie

Reservoir  is a good site. It has changing  facilities

but there have been requests for locker facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other point which I would like to raise under

this  subhead  is  the hope that the Singapore  Sports

Council may take it up. It is that up to today as  far

as  I  know there is no institutionalised form of  co-ordination between the Sports Council and, of  course,

the  national sports associations on the one hand  and

the  Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Defence

on the other. As we know, trying to promote sports and

also  trying  to build a creditable team of  sportsmen

requires training in the schools, national service and

after. As such, because of this lack of co-ordination,

several sports associations have found it difficult to

try   to  get  together  sportsmen  from  the  various

quarters  for  training. The  sportsmen  might  be  at

school or in national service or out working. Hence, I

think  there is a place for some form of co-ordination

to  be  established  between the Sports  Council,  the

Ministry  of Education and the Ministry of Defence.  I

am  suggesting  this. Sir, really in the  interest  of

sports  promotion, and I would like the Hon.  Minister

for Social Affairs to give us his comments.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, may I firstly

correct both the Members for Sembawang and Kim Seng on

this   grant  of  $2  million?  This  grant  was   for

development projects of sports facilities and not  for

sports  promotion. It has not been reduced but the  $1

million is carried over from FY 76 to FY 77.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sports promotion is tempered with prudence and

control in spending



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1168</b></font><br><br>



commensurate with our policy, and I have stressed this

many times here, Sir, that nothing is for free. People

pay   only  a  nominal  sum  for  the  use  of  sports

facilities provided at a highly subsidised cost. ,This

is  to ensure that recreational sports can come within

the reach of everybody.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the suggestion of the Member for Sembawang for

transport  allowances for sports liaison  officers,  I

agree  with  him that the SLOs are volunteers.  If  we

give  them rewards for their services, then as I  said

just  now,  Sir,  the spirit of voluntarism  is  gone.

However,  in  appreciation  of  their  services,   the

Singapore  Sports  Council has already  provided  them

with these privileges:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) free passes to witness football matches at the

National Stadium, including Malaysia Cup matches;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) concession rates for the use of all SSC swimming

pools;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) concession rates at SSC instructional lessons,

either in swimming, tennis, squash;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) special rates for all seminars and courses

organised by the SSC.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now answer the points raised by the

Member  for  Kim Seng. On the question of centralising

all  national sports headquarters under one roof,  the

original intention of the Sports House at Farrer  Park

was  to provide rooms for sports organisations.  There

were and still are some organisations which have rooms

in  Sports  House. However, from our  experience,  the

officials  and  sportsmen  of  each  respective  sport

hardly  need to communicate with those of other sports

except at the annual general meetings of the Singapore

National  Olympic  Council. Meetings  of  such  sports

organisations  are held on voluntary arrangements  and

are   restricted  to  the  officials  of  that  sport.

Therefore,  I  think  there are no obvious  advantages

although  the  opportunities  are  there  for   sports

organisations to get under one roof.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reference to the Master Plan on sports

facilities for the period 1976 to 1981,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1169</b></font><br><br>



this  was  presented to the Ministry  of  Finance  and

approval was given to implement certain parts  of  the

plan. The Plan was conceived in 1974 and completed  in

1975.  Sports  organisations were  consulted  and  the

target of the Master Plan was to arrive at sufficiency

in  sports  facilities  for the more  popular  sports.

Since,  in  principle, approval from the  Ministry  of

Finance  has  been  received, the Sports  Council  has

begun to implement the Master Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of co-ordination between the various

bodies  involving the training of sportsmen,  I  think

the Member has made a good suggestion and we will look

into  this  to find ways and means to co-ordinate  the

various organisations or bodies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding changing room facilities and lockers for

joggers  at  MacRitchie Reservoir,  it  is  true  that

changing  facilities are there but no locker  service.

The  Jogging Association, I understand, has  indicated

this  to the Singapore Sports Council, and the  matter

is being looked into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have provided changing facilities in many of

our  sports  complexes and swimming  pools  at  Farrer

Park,  Queenstown, Toa Payoh Athletic Centre  and  the

National  Stadium.  At Farrer Park squash  and  tennis

courts area, we are providing changing rooms too.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I wish to thank the Hon.

Minister  for his comments. I just want  to  make  the

point  that  I  still think and I hope  that  he  will

consider  it desirable in the long run for the  Sports

Council to get, and I hope he tries very hard, all the

national  sports associations under one roof with  the

blessings of course and assistance of the Ministry  of

Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is with regard to consultation. I

might  like to add that as far as I know at least  one

association was not consulted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I thank the

Minister  for his detailed reply. Although he  is  not

prepared  to  give  better  encouragement  to   sports

liaison officers. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1170</b></font><br><br>



hope next year he will give them better encouragement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head S be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead BEJ 8101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I refer to the

Memorandum which states that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A sum of $400,000 has also been provided for the

construction  of a new Home for Destitute  Persons  to

alleviate over-crowding in the existing Homes'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In FY 76 there was already such a provision and

today  this  House  is  being  asked  to  revote  this

provision.  Sir, I wish to seek further  enlightenment

from  the  Minister as to when this Home for Destitute

Persons will be built? Of course. I must hasten to add

that I have no desire to have such a Home built in  my

constituency. I would like to ask why nothing was done

last  year, and as a result this apparent revote. When

will  this  building be completed? Where  will  it  be

located,  and how many persons will it accommodate  in

the light of the explanation given in the Memorandum?



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, funds for the building

of  this  new  Home  for Destitute Persons  was  first

entered in the Development Estimates for the financial

year 1973, and the sum allocated was $620,000. But  at

that  time  the  Social Welfare Department  was  still

scouting  for  a suitable piece of land. Subsequently,

the Master Plan Committee allocated the former British

Air Ministry and Wireless Station at Chia Keng I as  a

site  for the Home. Unfortunately there was some delay

in  obtaining  the costing for the project.  When  the

estimates  were  submitted, costs had risen  to  $1.13

million.  In view of the high costs and the relatively

short  tenure for the site, the Ministry had no choice

but  to reconsider the project, it was finally decided

to proceed with it by scaling down the requirements to

the  bare  essentials. The estimated cost was  brought

down to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1171</b></font><br><br>



$439,800.  Work is now in progress and it is  expected

that  the Home will be operational by March next year,

i.e, within FY 77, when the funds will not have to  be

revoted  in  the next financial year. The number  that

can be accommodated at this new Home will be about 210

persons.  They  will be able-bodied persons  from  the

Bushey Park Home, and they will be required to do work

like growing vegetables, rearing chickens, and so on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister for his

kind reply, and I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $28,111,410 for Head S ordered to stand

part of the Main Estimates



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $3,137,600 for Head S ordered to stand part

of the Development Estimates,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head T -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head T be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead DAA 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many pieces of land have been acquired by the

Government,  but they have been found to  be  of  very

little use and are therefore left vacant. To quote  an

example,  a  few  years ago I spoke about  the  vacant

ground  of  the old Raffles Institution. The  Minister

had  then  replied that a 70-storey building would  be

constructed  at  this place. Some years  have  already

passed  and  we  are still waiting for  action  to  be

taken. Why is there such a delay? Could not this  land

be  used  more  productively in some  other  way?  The

purpose  of my bringing up this issue is because  many

people have been grumbling when their land is acquired

by  the  Government. In most cases they have to accept

whatever  compensation is given. But  after  that,  we

find the land seems to be left vacant. Why bother  the

people if the land is going to be left vacant? We must

make  sure  that  whatever land is  acquired  is  used

productively.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1172</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Sir, the Member for Anson is playing the same

tune  on  his organ grinder in this House for  several

years.  But then the Prime Minister has got plenty  of

time for him. So have you, Mr Speaker, and so have I.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He refers to land being acquired and then left

unused,   and  he  cites  just  one  example  -Raffles

Institution.  May  I  point out  to  this  House  that

Raffles Institution was not acquired by Government. It

has  always  belonged to us. It is only  that  Raffles

Institution  went to a new site. To put  it  straight.

the   site  itself  was  sold  by  Government  to  the

Development  Bank of Singapore. It is the  Development

Bank of Singapore that is taking a long time to build.

In  the meanwhile, of course, we have not just left it

as  useless  land.  We replanted  the  grass  and  our

younger citizens are having a good time playing soccer

there. The land is being made use of by many schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for other sites, when a site is encumbered, it

takes  a  long  time to clear the land, especially  if

there are squatters. In order to move people, you have

to find them homes. Having found them homes, there may

be  other encumbrances. As far as is possible, we  do

not  leave vacant land alone because it takes time  to

build. We have to get planning approval and we have to

get the finance in some cases



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me assure the Member that the Government

does  not acquire land unless it is required for  some

public  purpose. If any piece of land has been cleared

and  is  vacant, just like Raffles Institution,  which

incidentally  again was not acquired, there  are  good

reasons for the delay. If the Member is interested  in

further details about the Raffles Institution site,  I

am  prepared  to  give it to him. I am just  wondering

whether he is an old boy of Raffles. Would the  Member

like more particulars about what is going to happen to

the site?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Then I had better refer to my file. The

project itself is currently designed for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1173</b></font><br><br>



the  construction  of  a hotel, convention,  shopping,

recreational, and office complex, with a built-up area

of  about 360,000 square metres. The designs have been

substantially completed. In fact, they were  completed

in  the  middle  of  last year  and  plans  have  been

officially  submitted to the competent  authority  for

approval.   Currently, the  project   consultant   is

completing  the  detailed drawings,  as  well  as  the

necessary documents for the invitation of tenders  for

construction   works.  These  are  scheduled   to   be

completed in April 1977. So the Member would not  have

to wait very long.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrent with the submission of plans, a

submission was made to the Ministry of Finance by  the

DBS with a request for Government equity participation

and  credit facilities for the development,  which  is

estimated  to cost about $540 million. The Government.

whilst in favour of encouraging the construction of  a

hotel  and convention centre, has grave doubts on  the

building   of  more  office  and  shopping  complexes,

especially on a scale as big as the project.  We  feel

that  consideration  should  be  given  to  increasing

private  sector  participation in  this  long  delayed

project.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I remember that last year

the  Minister  said that the Government was  going  to

build  a  70-storey building but now he said that  the

private  sector is going to do it. Anyway I beg  leave

to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head T be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead DCA 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this amendment, I merely wish to raise one

or two points concerning the Bases Economic Conversion

Division.  I remember that this Division  was  set  up

because  of  the British withdrawal of  its  bases  in

Singapore. It is already some eight to nine years now,

and I wish to seek enlightenment from the Minister for

Law  and  the Environment as to the scope and function

of this Division.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1174</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>5.58 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the short answer to the Member for

Punggol  is that the British left so much land  behind

that  the Bases Economic Conversion Division is  still

operating.  The British ruled us for over  150  years.

They occupied the best parts of Singapore. I remember,

as  a  little  boy living in Yio Chu Kang  Road,  that

there  was  no  Serangoon Gardens  and  no  Member  of

Parliament  for Serangoon Gardens. I used to  walk  to

Seletar  in the 1920s to watch the flying boats  land.

That was when they built Seletar Air Base. Just before

the  war, they  built  Tengah Air  Base.  During  the

Japanese  Occupation, the Japanese  built  Changi  Air

Base.  Anyone  present  here  who  lived  during   the

Occupation would know that there were so many  British

regiments here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had the Manchester Regiment, the Argyles and the

Southern  Gordon  Highlanders.  They  were  all  here,

including  the Indian Regiments such as the  Hyderabad

Regiment,  the  Punjab  Regiment  and  the  well-known

Gurkhas. They were all here living in barracks. So  in

1968  when  the British announced their  intention  to

pull out, we had to form the Bases Economic Conversion

Department,  with  two main functions:  to  take  over

reverted properties and to retrain the workers.  Quite

a few of our people were employed either by the Royal

Air  Force, the British Navy, or the British Army, and

their  services  became  redundant  when  the  British

pulled  out.  It  meant retraining.  Hence  the  Bases

Economic Conversion Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the completion of its major functions

there  are  still  residual  functions.  In  1973  the

Department  was  absorbed as a Division  in  the  Land

Office.  The Division is now primarily concerned  with

administration of reverted properties, including Asian

quarters. If the Member is interested further, out  of

the  original staff of 56 there only remains a nucleus

of  19  officers working under the direction of senior

staff of the Land



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>



Office.  The  Division  is also still  concerned  with

Defence  properties which have been made available  to

the  New  Zealand forces under the five-power  defence

agreement   and   is,   in  fact,   the   channel   of

communication  between  the  ANZAC  Forces   and   the

Singapore Government in respect of such properties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might mention that as soon as the property came to

us   there  was  a  big  scramble  among  the  various

departments. The Ministry of Defence, of  course,  got

most  of the land. The University of Singapore now  is

in   Kent   Ridge  which  formerly  was  a  site   for

residential  quarters of army officers, and  the  NTUC

got  the Changi Beach Hotel which apparently was  used

as a holiday resort and which they have moved out now.

To  mention one fact, the Naval Dockyard at  Sembawang

had  to be converted into a civilian dockyard. Instead

of  attending to battleships and cruisers, it  has  to

serve  merchant  ships. It is not easy  to  convert  a

naval  dockyard  into a civilian  one,  and  for  that

reason we had to employ the firm of Swan & Hunter  who

did  the  same job in Malta, and they did a  good  job

here.  Apparently, workers in naval ships  do  not  do

exactly the same job as on merchant ships. I need  not

go into further details.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, if I heard it right, the Hon

Minister  mentioned just now the word "retraining".  I

wonder  if  he  will be more specific  with  the  term

"retraining" services provided by the BECD.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Yes, Sir. The Training Section of the

Bases  Economic Conversion Department was  responsible

for  organising the training courses for Base  workers

affected  by  the withdrawal and it carried  out  this

function  with  the assistance of a working  committee

consisting  of the Department's Director  of  Training

and  representatives from the Ministries of  Education

and  Labour,  the  NTUC  and the Economic  Development

Board. A crash training programme



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1176</b></font><br><br>



consisting of courses of three months duration each at

the  Singapore Vocational Institute and  the  Economic

Development Board's workshop at River Valley Road  and

five  other  technical schools was  started  in  April

1968.  A  total of about 1,700 Base workers  underwent

the  training  courses  in  turning  and  fitting,  in

electrical  fitting  and installation,  motor  vehicle

mechanics,  sheet  metal  works,  welding,   plumbing,

refrigeration   and   air-conditioning,    woodworking

machine  operations,  woodwork  furniture  production,

engineering drawing, electroplating and basic  plastic

technology.  I  hope  that satisfies  the  Member  for

Punggol.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I thank the Hon. Minister for

such an elaborate answer, and I beg leave to withdraw

my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $9,918,450 for Head T ordered to stand part

of the Main Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $70,000,000 for Head T ordered to stand

part of the Development Estimates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead AAA 1004.* (* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ho

Kah Leong ).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Keep Singapore Clean" campaign initiated by the

Ministry of Health in 1968 has lost its momentum and

has come to a grinding halt almost immediately after

the responsibility of keeping our country clean was

taken over by a new Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The Ministry of the Environment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Yes, you have guessed it. It is none

other  than  the  Ministry  of  the  Environment.  The

Ministry  seems satisfied to remain status quo.  Oddly

enough,  my  complaint may appear unwarranted  as  not

only Singaporeans but also tourists still sing praises

of  a clean and green Singapore. Everyone notices  the

clean  streets and the greenery lining them, and  many

comparisons are made when Singaporeans return from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1177</b></font><br><br>



overseas and, of course, when tourists visit us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health's campaign started off with

calculated plans to achieve an objective which it  did

with a great impact. The methodology was to start  off

cleaning the main streets and the thoroughfares  which

almost  everyone  use, through exhortation,  campaigns

and then legislation to punish the recalcitrants. Then

efforts  were  shifted to the side-streets  with  much

success.   So  today  we  see  the  clean  and   green

environment whenever we drive or bus down main streets

or into side-streets. Then, of course, tragedy struck.

The  Ministry of the Environment was formed. There was

a  standstill. Yes, the main streets and  side-streets

were kept spick and span but nothing beyond that;  for

a   few  people  -  except  residents  and  occasional

visitors  and, of course, frequent visits to the  area

by  MPs, never VIPs - travel beyond these streets into

the  kampongs and squatter areas. Members of the House

who  are unfortunate enough to suffer the same fate  - my constituents and I suffer - due to lack of interest

shown  by  the Ministry of the Environment on squatter

areas and kampongs will most certainly need no further

illustration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new-tangled machinery imported by the Ministry

to  cater to the cleaning of only main streets further

illustrates  lack of interest to try to  beautify  our

kampongs and squatter areas. No modifications of these

machines  have  been  considered  to  enable  them  to

service  the  more squalid areas. Greater efforts  are

necessary  to ensure that these congested  areas  that

face  greater  health and fire risks are  kept  clean.

This will, of course, necessitate greater vigilance by

the   Ministry.  I  am  not  suggesting  a  "Keep  the

Singapore kampongs and squatter areas clean" campaign.

Perish the thought.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, Sir, the "Keep Singapore Clean"

campaign  sufficed.  I am only asking  for  an  active

follow-up  to  that very successful  campaign  by  the

Ministry  of  Health nine years ago. Must I  enumerate

the ills the community will suffer if this is not done

in double quick time? Sanitary refuse disposal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>



and  a  clean  environment are essential to  community

health.  Refuse  has been shown to be important  as  a

breeding  ground and food source for rats -  not  rat-catchers  - flies  and  other  potential  carriers   of

diseases of man. Rubbish has also been found to  be  a

significant factor in the incidence of building fires.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, under this

subhead   I  would  like  to  ask  the  Minister   two

questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I would like to touch upon the modern

sanitation  in  the  rural  areas.  Recently,  in   my

constituency many farmers have received notices to the

effect  that the Ministry of the Environment is asking

them  to  install  sanitary system.  In  the  case  of

farmers  in  the  water catchment  areas,  of  course.

nobody  would object to this request. But the Ministry

of  the  Environment stipulates that the  farmers  are

required  to  install within two months  the  sanitary

system by contractors to be named by the Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made enquiries. According to the farmers.

they  will  have to pay about $2,000 for one  sanitary

system and it would take some two weeks to build  one.

So  many  of  them  have to install modern  sanitation

within so short a time of two months, and it is to  be

done  by  the contractors named by the Ministry.  This

gives  rise  to some problems. First the time  is  too

short,  and because they have to do it so quickly  the

cost  will go up too. I would like to ask the Minister

whether it would be possible to give them some kind of

a  concession  by way of financial aid or  some  other

assistance.  I would like to ask the Ministry  of  the

Environment  whether they can give them 50%  grant  or

one-third of the financial cost involved. If  this  is

not  possible,  then  will  it  be  possible  for  the

Development Bank of Singapore, by special arrangement.

to  give them some kind of interest-free loan  or,  if

that  is  not possible, a low-interest loan,  so  that

these  farmers  will be able to build  their  sanitary

system according to the requirements.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is whether it will be possible for

the farmers to get their own



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1179</b></font><br><br>



contractors  to  do the job. Some of the  farmers  are

masons, and they can therefore do the work themselves.

The  third  point  is whether the time  limit  can  be

extended. Instead of two months, can it be extended to

three or six months? This is to give them enough time.

The   farmers  are  prepared  to  cooperate  with  the

Government  but  they should not be forced  to  do  it

quickly and at such a high cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is in relation to the medical

examination  of  hawkers in the food  centres.  In  my

constituency  many hawkers have been repeatedly  asked

to  go for medical examination by the Ministry of  the

Environment.  Of  course, basically there  is  nothing

wrong  with this as it will ensure that food  handlers

are  in good health and free from infectious diseases.

But in terms of procedure, I think some improvement is

possible.  According to the present practice,  hawkers

notified for medical examination are required to go en

bloc to the hospital before 8.00 a.m. for their medical

examination. This medical examination will  take  more

than  one morning. Some will have to go for three days

or even one whole week. Now if we want all the hawkers

to  go together, they have to wait until 10, 11 or  12

o'clock. I ask whether it is possible to simplify  the

procedure so as not to give them so much trouble. Just

imagine requiring them to go for so many days  in  the

morning  when morning is their peak hour. They  should

not  be  made to incur losses as a result  of  medical

examination.  Then, of course, in terms of  timing,  I

would  suggest  that they can be asked to  appear  for

medical  examination  in batches at  staggered  times,

instead of all at the same time before 8.00 a.m. I hope

the Minister will give me a favourable reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, without wanting

to  knock  heads together, as one MP saying  that  the

Ministry  of  the Environment has gone to  sleep  ever

since  it  was first started under my predecessor,  Mr

Lim Kim San, and the Member for Jurong grumbling about

the  measures we take to install modern sanitation  or

when we give



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>



jabs   to   hawkers,   perhaps  they   should   change

constituencies. But since the Member for Jurong  spoke

in  a more modest pleading tone, I think I should deal

with him first.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member is well aware that the development of the

PUB  western  catchment reservoir scheme has  made  it

necessary  for  farmers to install a  simple  sanitary

system.  But I agree with the Member that two  months'

notice  is too short and the Sewerage Department  will

extend  this period to six months or even more if  the

Member  pleads again. Whilst the Ministry is  prepared

to  offer advice to the farmers on the construction of

the  sanitary  system,  it is regretted  that  we  are

unable  to  give  any subsidy. We have made  inquiries

from  the  Development Bank of  Singapore,  but  I  am

afraid  that they are governed by their lending terms.

They  are  governed  by  normal banking  practice  and

principles  and  they  will  not  be  able   to   give

subsidised loans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for mass inoculation, there was an exercise for

hawkers as a prevention against typhoid fever from 1st

September.  1975  to  27th April,  1  976  at  various

markets  and food centres. This was done promptly  and

the  hawkers  were  not  required  to  wait  for  long

periods.  But I think the hon. Member is referring  to

the screening of hawkers at the Middleton Hospital for

typhoid and other gastrointestinal diseases. For  such

cases  more time is required for the necessary medical

examinations  which include the taking of  stools  and

blood  samples. But if the Member is complaining about

delays  outside  the hospital, I will  certainly  look

into his request if he gives me more information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may deal with the Member for Potong Pasir. The

way he opened up, I thought the whole of Singapore  is

dirty.  But  at least the Member admitted that  though

nothing much has been done, our main streets and side-streets  are still clean. It is not only for tourists.

It is for us. We have mechanical sweepers. We imported

them  at  considerable  costs. It  makes  sweeping  of

roads,  which are tarmac or concrete, easy.  It  saves

labour.  But  unfortunately these mechanical  sweepers

cannot go into all kampongs, nor will they do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>



any  good  if  they sweep sandy roads.  Unfortunately,

even some of our lorries which carry rubbish cannot go

into  every  kampong, and it is for that  reason  that

perhaps  the  kampongs  are  dirtier  than  the   main

streets.  But perhaps the Member for Potong  Pasir  is

only  talking  about  Potong Pasir  kampong.  Come  to

Tanglin.  We  have kampongs from the  Botanic  Gardens

right down to Race Course Road.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> That is because the Minister for the

Environment is in that constituency



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> That is what somebody else has said. But

our  kampongs are relatively clean. It really  depends

on  the  people living in the kampongs. You can  sweep

your  rubbish and burn it if you like, if our  lorries

do   not  come.  But  the  fact  is  that  our  refuse

collection   vehicles  collect  rubbish   every   day,

including  Sundays. Without a daily refuse  collection

service,  I  think our roads would be  dirtier.  I  am

afraid  we cannot deploy more workmen to remove refuse

in  kampongs.  But  every effort is  being  made  with

approaches  to the Ministry of Finance to employ  more

labour. But should there be heaps of rubbish in any of

the  constituencies,  all  they  have  to  do  is   to

telephone the Ministry of the Environment and we  will

send  one  lorry, and if that is not enough, we  will

send more. That is an assurance I give the Member.  If

he cannot get me, get my Parliamentary Secretary or my

Permanent Secretary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for campaigns, I think too many Campaigns

sometimes  lose their own force. We have had  so  many

campaigns  that  I think, sometimes the  public  is  a

little  tired of campaigns. I have had a  few  myself.

for instance. "Keep the city green". We had a campaign

to  clean up the schools in which I, as the Member for

Tanglin,  visited  many schools and all  the  children

were  working there. But what happened. At the end  of

the  day  it was the Ministry of the Environment  that

had to spend the next week collecting the rubbish from

all  the  schools.  So if he has got  rubbish  in  his

kampongs or his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>



constituency all he has to do is to give us a ring.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, with that assurance I have Hobson's

choice but to beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ang Kok Peng (Buona Vista):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead BAA 1101* (*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Lee

Yiok Seng)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in moving this amendment I

do  not intend to belittle the efforts of the Ministry

of  the  Environment;  on  the  contrary,  I  wish  to

congratulate the Hon. Minister for looking  after  the

environment of Singapore so wonderfully well.  He  has

set  a very high standard of environmental health  and

his  Ministry  has measured up to it remarkably  well.

Hence, a clean and green Singapore, among the best  in

public health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are still areas for improvement. Sir,

in  the  Addendum  to  the Presidential  Address,  the

Minister  for the Environment said that air  pollution

was  on  the increase and that anti-pollution measures

would  have to be enforced more stringently. I  cannot

agree   with  him  more  in  this  respect.  I  would,

therefore,  like  to draw his attention  to  the  poor

ventilation  of  the car parks inside  some  high-rise

buildings.  The  question I  would  like  to  pose  is

whether  the Hon. Minister is aware of this fact, and

whether  any  measure has been taken  to  rectify  the

situation and also to ascertain the health hazards  to

personnel  working for long periods of  time  in  such

places.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second matter I would like to raise is that on

the  use of ultra-violet light for decorative purposes

and for producing certain stage effects, especially in

places of entertainment. As the Minister is aware that

ultra-violet light is harmful to human eyes and  skin,

would   he   therefore  consider  taking   appropriate

measures  to  dissuade the public  from  using  ultra-violet light for such purposes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1183</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy Speaker, Sir, my colleague has told us just now

that the Ministry of the Environment has done very

well in looking after the environmental health of

Singapore. I agree with him. But there are always two

sides to a story. Although you may be successful in

one aspect some other matters are affected. The Hon.

Minister in his efforts to enhance the environmental

health has given rise to some other problems. I would

like to let him know of these problems. In the rural

areas, for example, many families are engaged in the

preparation and operation of a great variety of food.

In addition to the manufacture of food, they are also

engaged in selling coffee, cooked food, cake making,

biscuits, bread, taohu, taokua bean curd, fish ball,

etc. This family business provides the supply of

cooked food and other prepared food for neighbouring

residents in the rural areas and for the hawkers in

the vicinity. This kind of business is run on a family

basis, a small-time business. Everybody in the family

works hard and they depend on this small business for

their livelihood. These people have been doing such

business for many, many years. Many of them have

inherited their business from their ancestors for a

few decades. At least, some of them have five to six

years' history in doing this kind of business.

Although they are running a small business, the whole

family depends on this kind of business for their

livelihood and they are able to live quite happily.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I have said earlier in

this  House, the people in the rural areas are not  so

well  versed  in  Government  administration  and  the

organisation  of  the  Government  departments.  These

people  only know how to make use of their own  effort

and  labour to do a small business in their own  homes

for  a  living. They think there is nothing  wrong  in

doing  this kind of business. As far as they can  see,

this  is  not a crime. Neither do they know that  they

have  to apply to the Ministry of the Environment  for

Iicences to operate such business. In fact,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>



right  from the very beginning when they started  such

business,  no  Government officers had  ever  informed

them  of  the  requirement to apply for a  licence  to

operate  such a business. So all along they have  been

dependent   on  business  as  their  sole   means   of

livelihood.  Now  the  situation  is  different.  When

officers from the Environmental Health Section of  the

Ministry  come  to  notice  the  existence   of   this

business, they would send out letters asking  them  to

stop  operations forthwith and also informing them  of

the  requirement to apply for licences,  however  long

they  might have been operating. These people are also

told  that  they have been doing illegal business  all

this   time   as   unauthorised   eating   houses   or

unauthorised food manufacturers. The modus operandi of

this Department is this. First they start off politely

-  give  you a letter or notice to stop your business,

and  if  it  is not complied with, a summons  will  be

issued. Then you know you will be fined or have to pay

a  composition in lieu of a fine. Then the money  paid

can  get  one out of trouble. After the payment  of  a

fine  on  composition, if the order  is  not  complied

with,  then  the  premises  will  be  required  to  be

demolished. Otherwise official action will be taken to

demolish the premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is too strict an

enforcement because the livelihood of these people  is

threatened.  How are they going to earn their  living?

This method of the ends justifying the means does  not

care  for  the  difficulty and  the  plight  of  these

people.  It  is too rigid and not humane.  This  would

give  rise  to  a lot of hardship to these  people.  I

would therefore plead for flexibility and leniency  in

dealing  with such cases. I will therefore propose  to

the Minister concerned two alternative propositions to

help them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is to issue them with temporary licences

for  these  small business operations for a  few  more

years  to enable them to carry on their business while

they  try to change their method of earning a  living.

The  alternative  is  to give these  people  a  hawker

licence and allocate them a hawker stall so that  they

have  some other alternative means of livelihood. When

I suggest the method of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>



issuing  hawker licences to these people, I  hope  the

Minister will inform the Hawkers' Department to  issue

or  grant  licences directly to such people,  so  that

they  will  not have to be confronted with  a  lot  of

frustrating  conditions to be imposed by the  Hawkers'

Department  resulting  in  the  rejection   of   their

applications.  This  is  my  hope  which  I  pray  the

Minister will consider sympathetically.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the Member for Buona Vista raised

two  points - one on car parks and the other on ultra-violet  lighting in nightclubs. Some  of  the  Members

here had better watch it!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for car parks, as a preventive measure, action is

now  being  taken. In fact, it should have been  taken

long ago at the planning stage by the Building Control

Division  to incorporate requirements for satisfactory

ventilation.  But my Ministry has been  aware  of  the

poor ventilation of some car parks especially in high-rise  buildings.  The  Anti-Pollution  Unit  has  been

conducting surveys on the level of carbon monoxide  in

a  number of car parks. Where the level was high,  the

owners  of the car parks have been notified to improve

the  ventilation  and  they have  done  so.  The  Unit

further  carries  out  surveys  at  these  car   parks

regularly  to  see that the level of  carbon  monoxide

does not rise too high.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for nightclubs and ultra-violet lights, the

flashing  lights are used in nightclubs for decorative

purposes   and   for   producing  stage   effects   on

entertainers  and  guests. But the  amount  of  ultra-violet  light produced by these lights is very  small.

We  can take comfort that its effective range is  less

than  two  feet.  Apart  from  the  effects  of  these

flashing  lights on the eyes, it has no  real  harmful

health  effects,  especially when one  is  exposed  to

these lights for a very short duration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Bukit Panjang, in order to

ensure  that  the food intended for sale  is  fit  for

human  consumption and is hygienically prepared, basic

and essential health requirements have to be observed.

Hence these notices on the food manufacturers in Bukit

Panjang who have been unable to meet with these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>



requirements. It is not in the interest of the  public

and,  in  fact, against our health laws to issue  such

operators  with  a  licence.  I  am  against   issuing

temporary  licences.  Once  a  temporary  licence   is

issued, it has a sense of permanency and when we  take

it  away there is always trouble. It is better to give

them time even if they are unauthorised rather than to

give  some  authorisation by way of a piece  of  paper

called  a  licence. It is better to give a  reasonable

grace  period to the food manufacturer to wind up  his

business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My short answer to the Member in respect of his

request  for  hawker licences to  be  issued  to  such

manufacturers and stalls to be provided, is "No".  But

they  have a chance if they qualify on the grounds  of

hardship.  As  for hardship. I leave it for  a  while.

Members   have  plenty  of  time  to  argue  with   my

Parliamentary Secretary when he gets on  his  feet  to

tell  what is the definition of "hardship cases".  But

perhaps we should find a new category so that  we  can

accommodate people or small food manufacturers of  the

type the Member for Bukit Panjang has spoken about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are always dangers and if I may just cite

one  case. We had typhoid fever spreading in a certain

place.  On  investigations,  we  found  that  all  the

patients  had  eaten nasi lemak. I need not  translate

that  for you. It was prepared by just one person.  We

were  fast  enough  to stop it These  are  small  food

manufacturers.  They  prepared  the  nasi   lemak   or

whatever it is and they sell. In this particular case,

we were very lucky because we got to the source of the

infection. Hence we have got to be very careful. I  am

not  suggesting that people should not buy nasi lemak;

this  case  has been cleared up. But this is  just  an

example  to  show that we must always be conscious  of

the  fact  that food manufacturers can spread disease,

and  if Members do not want to get typhoid, do not buy

ice  cream  from  unauthorised vendors  or  ice  water

sellers. That is the major source of typhoid  in  this

country. Most of the time when there is an outbreak of

typhoid,  it is traced to someone selling  either  ice

water or ice drinks or even in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1187</b></font><br><br>



some  cases ice cream. But let me not frighten Members

further.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ang Kok Peng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in fact, I

have  very carefully avoided the term "nightclubs".  I

just   mentioned  for  decorative  purposes  and   for

producing  certain stage effects especially in  places

of entertainment. I am sure the Minister is aware that

there  are many places of entertainment which are  not

nightclubs and yet his explanation seems to confine to

nightclubs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister's excellence is not in the area of

the technical field, and though his cursory comment on

ultra-violet lights is unsatisfactory, I beg leave  to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, may I say that I was making no

references to the hon. Member for Buona Vista going to

nightclubs or as a frequenter of nightclubs. I thought

he  was  merely referring to nightclubs. Of course,  I

realise  that  there are other places of entertainment

where  decorative lights are used whether  it  is  the

National Theatre or elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead BBA 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to draw the attention of the

Minister to the refuse collection centre located  near

residences and markets. For most of the day, the place

looks all right and there is no smell coming from  it.

But  at  certain times of the day when the  refuse  is

being collected by the trucks, the stench is most over-powering.  Could  the Environment Ministry  look  into

this  and perhaps use some odour-killing agent to  get

rid of the smell as soon as possible after the rubbish

has been collected?



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The hon. Member has made a difficult

request. If there is rubbish, there is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>



smell.  On  the odour problem from rubbish chutes  and

bin  centres, especially in housing estates,  I  would

like  to  inform the Member that refuse is removed  by

the  Housing and Development Board every day from  the

chutes to the bin centres and from the bin centres  by

the  Ministry  of  the  Environment  to  the  disposal

ground.  The refuse chutes and bin centres are  washed

daily.  What is it that he wants us to spread? Eau  de

cologne?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be smell and nuisance if domestic refuse

is  wet and decomposes rapidly in hot weather. Perhaps

householders  could help to improve the  situation  by

putting wet and organic refuse in plastic bags  before

disposing them into the refuse chutes. Another measure

being  undertaken by the Housing and Development Board

is  the provision of roofs for bin centres to keep out

the  rain and the sun. This would help keep the refuse

dry  and  reduce  the odour and the temperature  down.

Without  wanting  to pull the leg of  the  Member  for

Telok Blangah, all I can say is that it is difficult.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rubbish smells and sometimes the smell is terrible.

Even  when  the  Ministry of the  Environment's  lorry

passes  you,  you  cannot get  away  from  the  smell,

especially  if  the  lorry is  leaking.  But  we  will

certainly  look into his request and see what  can  be

done  to minimise the odour that comes from these  bin

centres.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem:</b> Sir, in view of the reply from the

Minister, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead BCA 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the cremation of dead bodies in gas

chambers  was introduced, there were numerous problems

posed   by   the  Hindu  community  because   of   the

traditional last rites which have to be observed. This

has been thrashed out in the many discussions held  in

the  past by the various authorities concerned. In one

of  the  discussions,  it was decided  that  the  last

cremation  at 3 o'clock p.m. was to be extended  to  4

o'clock p.m.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1189</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, now we have a fresh problem in regard to

the  crematorium. It appears that at the Mount Vernon

Crematorium  there is a very heavy  booking  for  the

cremation  of  bodies by the various communities.  As

such,  the time given by the staff of the crematorium

to  an applicant for a cremation in most cases is not

suitable.  I  have received many complaints  on  this

matter,  because  alternative  arrangements  for  the

funeral have to be made. Sometimes they even have  to

postpone for a day because of the non-availability of

the  crematorium According to Hindu  custom  you  can

only  keep  the  body for 24 hours.  Even  the  staff

attached to the crematorium could not help the people

in any way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem did not exist in the past. Why is the

people being inconvenienced now? Something should  be

done  immediately to rectify the situation.  Just  to

quote  you  a case. A few weeks ago on a Sunday, the

breadwinner of a family passed away in the  Singapore

General Hospital. His body could not be released till

the  following day because of a post-mortem.  On  the

following  Monday at 10 a.m. after the post-mortem,  a

relative and a friend collected the death certificate

from the mortuary and rushed down to the Mount Vernon

Crematorium  at 11 am, to make arrangements  for  the

funeral to take place in the afternoon. But to  their

disappointment, the person in charge told  them  that

the body could only be brought in at 1 p.m. and at no

other time. These two persons could not decide on the

suggested  time,  because of the  very  short  notice

Therefore,  they rushed back to town to consult  with

the eldest son of the deceased. Later, as time was so

short, the family of the deceased decided reluctantly

to bury the body.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the relative who was making the arrangements had

to rush back to Mount Vernon Crematorium to take back

the  death certificate and then back to the  mortuary

to  get  it  altered for a burial. And  finally, the

casket  company  had to make the arrangements  for  a

burial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five days later, there was another funeral. Here

again, the deceased passed away in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1190</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  General Hospital on a Friday and  a  post-mortem  had  to be carried out on the following  day,

because  the family of the deceased were ignorant  of

the  post-mortem procedure whereby a  member  of  the

family  would  be  required by  the  pathologist  and

coroner  to  identify the body. This dead person  was

supposed  to  be  cremated  on  the  following   day,

Saturday.  But  it  had  to be  postponed  to  Sunday

because  of  heavy bookings at the crematorium.  Sir,

why  should so much problems be caused to people  who

have  to fight against time to make arrangements  for

funerals?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is observed that only two gas chambers have been

allocated  for  Hindu cremations. Furthermore, other

communities  are also using the same place.  That  is

why the bookings are heavy. Something must be done to

improve  this situation. Previously there  were  nine

chambers  for cremation but now there are  only  two.

These  two  are not only for the Hindus but  for  the

other  races  as  well. How can they  be  sufficient?

According to Hindu custom once you take the  body  to

the  crematorium you cannot bring it back to the home

or  for  burial.  That is very important.  The  Hindu

Sabai  has  also  sent a letter to  the  Ministry  of

Social  Affairs regarding this matter.  I  am  indeed

rather surprised that an assurance was given sometime

ago  that the bodies could be brought in after 3 p.m.

for cremation and now there is so much problem caused

to mourners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I urge the Minister to settle this problem

once  and for all. Otherwise, it is better to go back

to the old system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the Minister understands the Hindu

tradition.  If  the  present  two  chambers  are  not

sufficient  for cremation, then go back  to  the  old

system where there were more places for cremation.  I

hope   the  Minister  will  look  into  this   matter

seriously.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, may I say with respect to the

Member  for Anson that it would be a retrograde  step

to   go  back  to  the  old  system.  The  number  of

cremations in the Mount Vernon Crematorium  has  been

about  10 per day for the last six months. The  seven

cremators are able to cope with 15



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>



cremations per day. It is not our policy to go against

any  custom  or rites, whether they be Hindu,  Muslim,

Christian   or   others.   That   certainly   is   not

Government's  policy. When we first started  this  new

crematorium  the  Hindu Advisory  Board  made  certain

representations  and  we  listened  to  them.  We  had

meetings  with them, at which the Member was  present,

and most of their recommendations were accepted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the time, previously it was 3.00 p.m. for the

last  cremation. Now it is being extended to 4.00 p.m.

We would like to extend it to 5.00 p.m. and have taken

up  the  question of recruiting more  staff  with  the

Ministry of Finance. I hope we succeed. The choice  of

the  time for cremation is left to the family  of  the

deceased  but it is not easy to satisfy everybody.  If

the  cremator has been booked for the time chosen, the

applicant is offered an alternative time for cremation

on the same day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first case mentioned by the Member, an

alternative  time was offered but was not accepted  by

the  relatives.  Our  records show  that  bookings  on

Saturdays  for the past two weeks had not  been  heavy

and no relatives who applied for cremation were turned

away  without  being offered an alternative  time  for

cremation on the same day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of the Member, of the seven

cremators available, three have been modified to  suit

Hindu cremation. For an average of 20 Hindu cremations

per  month,  the  facilities appear to  be  more  than

adequate  to  meet the needs of the community.  Should

circumstances  show  that more cremators  are  needed,

these will be provided.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, we had a meeting with the

Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of Social

Affairs.  At that time we agreed in principle  to  the

amendments made. But since then we have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>



had  many troubles. Sometimes the crematorium is fully

booked and they have to keep the bodies either at home

or  in  the  mortuary.  The  Hindu  people  have  been

pressing  the  Hindu Advisory Board  on  this  matter.

Today I have mentioned about the Hindu Sabai sending a

letter  to  the  Ministry of Social Affairs  regarding

this matter. The Hon. Minister will have to reconsider

this  matter. I think he understands the  position.  I

beg  the  Minister to do it for the general public.  I

hope the Minister will do it. Anyway, Sir, I beg leave

to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead BGA 1101*. (*The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs

P Govindaswamy, Ahmad Haleem, Lee Yiok Seng, Ng Kah Ting, Haji Sha'ari bin Tadin and Dr Ong Leong Boon.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Geylang Serai area will soon have a market. The

construction of this market will be completed  shortly

and  it is located at Haig Road. Since a market  is  a

vital necessity for the everyday life of all strata of

society,  it is therefore imperative that the  Hawkers

Department organise the layout in a proper manner.  It

is  possible that in this particular market there will

be  stalls selling fish, vegetables, meat, piece goods

and  also food stalls. In other words, this will be  a

multipurpose market.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My only wish is that no friction and suspicion will

arise between Muslims and non-Muslims. Therefore,  may

I  ask whether provision will be made to sell pork  in

this  market.  If  so,  I seek the  assurance  of  the

Hawkers  Department that the pork stalls will  not  be

sited  within close proximity of the beef  and  mutton

stalls.  The  same  goes for cooked food  stalls.  The

allocation of Muslim cooked food stalls and non-Muslim

cooked  food stalls must strike a balance  to  reflect

the  local  conditions and distribution of  population

within the area. In this way, it will attract





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1193</b></font><br><br>



customers  and  tourists who would  like  to  frequent

Geylang Serai.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residents of Geylang Serai who live on a scanty

livelihood  should  be  given the  opportunity  to  do

business  in  this market. Besides resettling  hawkers

who  are  affected  by development  projects,  I  hope

consultation  between the Hawkers Department  and  the

Member  of  Parliament for the constituency  could  be

held  as  and when necessary to complement efforts  to

resolve  the  hawker  problem and  at  the  same  time

upgrade the standard of the market.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, there are some 28,750

licensed  hawkers at the moment. Out of  this,  17,000

are already sited within premises. There are still  11,750

hawkers who need to be resited from the streets.

When  are they going to be resited? What measures  are

being   taken   to   resite  the  hawkers   in   Anson

Constituency?  What  plans  are  being  drawn  up  for

building hawker centres in Anson Constituency?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hawkers Department says that it would not

issue  any  new  licences because the  present  28,750

licensed hawkers in Singapore are sufficient to  cater

for  our population. Can the Minister say actually how

many  of  the licensees are really looking  after  the

stall? It is observed that many licences have been sub-let. Why is this allowed?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that in some instances the Hawkers

Department  is de-registering some of the hawkers  and

asking them to go back to their place of residence for

their business. What is the reason for this move? This

will  cause  unnecessary hardship  and  headache.  For

example,  the  hawkers  at  Anson  constituency  after

having  been  in business in that place  for  over  10

years  are  told  to go to another place,  like  Telok

Blangah.  Is this really necessary? Is it not possible

to  resite the hawkers within that particular area? Or

give   them  an  option  to  either  remain  in   that

particular  area or to be resited elsewhere.  Many  of

the  hawkers are really unhappy about this  move.  How

could they go to a new place to sell a product or food

which  they have been selling in another area  for  so

long



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>



and   where   they  generally  have  their  customers'

goodwill? One way of solving this problem is  to  give

an option for those who have been in business for more

than  10 years to either remain at the `existing place

or go back to their place of residence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What measures are being taken by the Hawkers

Department  to  control  the  prices  charged  by  the

hawkers?  I  must at this time point  out  that  price

tagging  has  been implemented in many foodstalls  and

hawker  centres.  Yet  the  prices  are  still  stiff.

Despite   the   fact  that  the  prices   of   certain

commodities have gone down, many hawkers have made  no

attempt whatsoever to either reduce the price of  food

they sell or increase the quantity of food. No one  is

seen  to  check  the  price that is  being  quoted.  I

suggest  that the Enforcement Section should check  on

this,  otherwise  the people will be swindled  by  the

hawkers.  Previously, a bowl of  kway  teow  costs  30

cents.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mee goreng.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> No, kway teow. But now for 80

cents, the  quantity  is the same  as  for  30  cents

previously.  The  price  has been  increased  but  the

quantity remains the same.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Enforcement Section must play an active role at

places  where the hawkers find that the people are  in

demand  for  their food or drink. Thus, they  increase

their  prices  like nobody's business. A strict  check

should be made at these places.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been reported that pasar malam, a common

sight  in  Singapore, is slowly being phased  out.  In

fact,  many of them are being de-registered  and  they

have  been  told  that  their licences  would  not  be

renewed. This has brought about some hardship to  some

of  them.  May  I suggest that instead of  withdrawing

their  licences, they should be resited at some  other

suitable  place  where  there  is  no  obstruction  to

traffic.   Pasar  malam  is  a  convenient   temporary

shopping  centre for many housewives and  workers  who

cannot  shop in the day time. Pasar malam has  been  a

colourful scene of Singapore's night life



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1195</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem:</b> Sir, currently four different

bodies operate hawker centres, namely, the Housing and

Development  Board, Jurong Town Corporation,  Port  of

Singapore  Authority  and also  the  Ministry  of  the

Environment.  The question I would  like  to  ask  the

Ministry  of the Environment is whether it could  look

into the standardisation of licences At the moment the

HDB's licence and the Ministry's licence are the same,

but  the stallholders' licences issued by the Port  of

Singapore Authority are different, I think if we could

standardise the licences it would be very  helpful  to

all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of my question concerns what I have

already brought up earlier today. This is in regard to

the cooperative hawker licence for senior citizens.  I

would  like to ask the Ministry to look into this  and

see  whether  it  is  feasible  to  issue  cooperative

licence  to  four or five of our old-age  citizens  so

that   they   can  operate  it  and  be   economically

independent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, for the past

few  years  the Hawkers Department has  put  in  great

efforts  in  trying  to control unauthorised  hawkers.

This   is,   of  course, commendable  because   these

unauthorised  hawkers should be got rid of;  otherwise

everybody  can become a street hawker and  then  there

will  be unauthorised hawkers all over Singapore, with

undesirable  consequences.  So  the  efforts  of   the

Hawkers Department should be commended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, when I really think of the effect of such

efforts, I have the feeling that all these years  they

have wasted their time, because even up till today  we

can  still  see unauthorised hawkers in Singapore.  In

this House, we have been talking about the problem  of

unauthorised hawkers quite often. Why should  this  be

so?  I feel that perhaps we have not been handling the

hawker  problem properly. So I would like to  ask  the

Minister whether there are any new plans to solve  the

problem of unauthorised hawkers in Singapore. If there

is  no  new plan, I wonder how long or how many  years

more  will it take to achieve the objective of getting

rid of unauthorised hawkers in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1196</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me to another matter. As far as I am

aware,  officers  of  the Hawkers Department  have  to

undergo  several  months'  training  before  they  are

allotted  duties in the various areas  to  handle  the

problems  of  unauthorised  hawkers.  Those  who  have

special training should actually perform well in their

duties,  but  very often we hear complaints  from  the

people  against the performance of these  officers  as

being  either unsatisfactory or conducive  to  causing

resentment.  These hawker inspectors  are  often  seen

chasing hawkers very rashly and rudely. These officers

are  seen  in places where there is a congregation  of

hawkers  or unauthorised hawkers, playing the game  of

hide and seek with hawkers, They will be running after

the hawkers. Sometimes the hot pursuit by these hawker

inspectors  even involve pedestrians, who are  knocked

down  and  suffer  abrasions or  they  get  a  fright.

Sometimes,  this kind of chase will result  in  a  big

fight  in the street. Such a fight may result in court

cases and in the end who suffers? The officers of  the

Hawkers  Department seem to take a great  interest  in

this what I call "hide and seek" game. They even chase

the  hawkers  right into the shops and private  houses

and  they even take away goods purchased by others  as

exhibits or evidence against the hawkers. This is very

rash  and  I  really  believe that sometimes  they  do

mistake  innocent people as unauthorised  hawkers.  If

there  is such a case, this is very serious. I  wonder

whether  the  Ministry  concerned  has  got  any  such

information. If so, they should let us know.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, arising out of what I have said. I would like

to  ask  the  Minister concerned whether  the  Hawkers

Department  has  any scheme or method  to  change  and

improve the discourteous manners of these officers, or

whether  there will be any effective training  courses

to  rectify and correct this wrong attitude  of  these

hawker inspectors.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ng Kah Ting and Haji Sha'ari are

not here. Dr Ong Leong Boon.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I am actually taking this

opportunity to speak on behalf of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1197</b></font><br><br>



my constituents in Kim Seng where I am sure the Senior

Parliamentary  Secretary is aware that something  like

45%  of  the  housing  units are  one-room  flats  and

therefore  the social problems are fairly enormous.  I

have  therefore  come across very  many  cases  weekly

asking  for  hawker  licences.  However, it   is   my

experience  that more than 99% of these cases  do  not

meet with success. Whether this is a reflection of the

MP's popularity with the Hawkers Department. I do  not

know. I would like to think otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it really makes me think that the conditions or

stipulations for the issue of hawker licences need  to

be  redefined Sir, we are pretty aware of the three or

four  conditions which are normally stipulated: First,

licences  for  stalls will be issued  to  resettlement

cases   The  second  category  comprises  the   public

assistance recipients and the third category comprises

those deserving cases. Of course, all these applicants

must  be 40 years and above. Sir, I find that although

a  Hawkers'  Coordinating Committee has  been  formed.

there are still a certain amount of administrative  or

procedural  difficulties for  applicants.  It  is  not

uncommon  for the applicants to be shuttled  from  the

Housing and Development Board Area Office to the  14th

storey   Hawkers'  Department  at  Alexandra   Circus,

causing  a  certain amount of confusion and difficulty

to the applicants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on top of this, there is the issue of stalls at

school tuckshops. This has created a certain amount of

confusion.  I  would  like  the  Senior  Parliamentary

Secretary  to  advise  us as to  whether  the  Hawkers

Department has any say whatsoever with regard  to  the

issue  of licences for tuckshop stalls at schools  and

whether  the  same  guidelines apply,  I  think  there

should be a common ruling and there should be a common

committee  where  the issue of such  licences  may  be

considered and centralised,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the requirement that application

from  a public assistance recipient will be considered

with  favour, I think there is a certain problem here.

It  is  my  experience, and I am sure it is shared  by

several of my colleagues here, that many of our Asian



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>



citizens  feel that it is well below their dignity  to

go  to  the  Social Welfare Department  to  apply  for

public  assistance. We do have a good number of  cases

where  although the persons concerned do  not  have  a

card   to   say   that  they  are  public   assistance

recipients, they are in actual fact genuinely poor and

deserve  public assistance. The clever ones would, of

course, readily  go to the Social Welfare  Department

and  get  the public assistance which is  one  of  the

shortest routes to obtaining a hawker's licence. I  am

suggesting, therefore, that this  is  in  a  sense  a

loophole and a convenient way for some people to get a

licence.  But  on  the other hand, there  are  genuine

cases  where  the  applicants should be  given  hawker

licences,  but because they are not public  assistance

recipients, and in a sense by default, they could  not

very well qualify for the issue of a hawker licence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of age. I know that it

is  correct to insist that the young should apply  for

some  other work and that the older people be given  a

softer and less physically demanding job like hawking.

However,  at times we do come across some cases  where

they  may  be, say, an aged widow between  31  and  35

years   with   a  few  dependants  and,   under   such

circumstances, it is rather difficult for this lady to

try  to fit into the normal employment hours say, from 9.00 a.m. to 5 p.m. I hope the Hawkers Department will

consider  such  cases with favour  and  adopt  a  more

realistic and understanding approach and perhaps issue

licences to this category of people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next point really concerns the definition

of  "deserving cases". We have come across cases where

applicants  have been turned down on the  ground  that

the total family income is, say, $300. I would like to

say  that  lumping  together the earnings  of  various

members of a household may not necessarily reflect the

total  family income. Take, for example, the  case  of

two old parents with, say, two children. It is assumed

that  in  a  sense  the earnings of  the  son  or  the

daughter  added together with the parents' income  may

be  about  $300 and that the children would contribute

readily towards the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>



total  family income. But we know that there are  many

social  problems.  If  the children  are  not  filial,

therefore  we  have  a situation  where,  because  the

children  do earn a certain sum of money, the  Hawkers

Department  fails  to  understand  that  they  do  not

contribute  towards the welfare of  the  family  as  a

whole,  then  the elderly couple are left  in  a  very

difficult situation. Therefore, this leads me  to  ask

the    Hawkers'   Department   to   give   sympathetic

consideration  to such cases. These  old  and  elderly

applicants  with  problem kids should  be  given  some

leeway  and the Hawkers Department should not  be  too

stingy in the issue of a hawker licence to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, time has changed. The cost of living has gone

up  a fair bit over the last few years and, therefore,

I  think there is a need to redefine poverty level.  I

should  hope  that  the Ministry would  consider  this

point and modify the provisions requiring a person  to

prove that he or she is deserving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last point is really one of asking the

Hawkers Department to try to help us when it comes  to

the   question  of  the  possibility  of  helping  the

applicants to get hawker licences. In this respect,  I

would therefore ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary

to  let us have some idea of his projections regarding

the  development of hawker centres or the availability

of  hawker  stalls in the future, and  what  ideas  he

might have or plans he already has with regard to  the

provision  of hawker stalls to cater to the population

of  two  million people, and in addition  1.5  million

tourists and a floating population of 120,000 people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment (Mr Chor Yeok Eng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, several Members have raised

various  questions touching on the Hawkers  Department

under the Ministry of the Environment. They have  made

certain criticisms, In view of the time factor, I will

just give some brief answers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let me touch upon what the Member for

Kim Seng and others have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1200</b></font><br><br>



mentioned in this House over the past few days. On the

definition  of  hardship cases, briefly speaking,  the

term  includes cases where the head of the  family  is

unemployed,  or  physically  incapacitated,  and   the

family earning a total family income of not more  than

$250, and   those  who  are  recipients  of   public

assistance.  This  also includes certain  resettlement

cases   where   the   people  are  affected   by   the

Government's  development  plans  but  could  not  get

compensation as farmers. All these are hardship cases.

They come under the definition of hardship cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Seng has mentioned another point.

In fact, he has mentioned several points. I would just

like  to  touch  upon  his point  on  the  age  limit.

Generally speaking, we say that the minimum age is  40

years and above. Concerning the young widows or people

who have particular difficulties financially, then  of

course  we will give special consideration. There  are

no   hard   and  fast  rules  and  strict  application

regarding the rules of 40 years of age, and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the total income of $250 month, it is

also not rigidly adhered to, We do give some allowance

where the family concerned is big and is getting  more

than  this amount slightly but who have a special need

to  spend  more. We will consider the merits  of  each

case  and  make a special decision or give  them  some

allowance if they deserve. The principles serve mainly

as guidelines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the allocation of tuckshop stalls in the schools,

there is an allocation committee under the Ministry of

Education;  so this is not directly under the  control

of  the  Hawkers  Department. I refer particularly  to

stalls in the school tuckshops or canteens. Since many

Members   are  not  quite  familiar  with  the   point

regarding the 5% of stalls allotted to certain people,

I  would  like  to clarify. Regarding  the  5%  stalls

allotted to certain hardship cases, this only  applies

to  newly  built  markets or  food  centres  on  first

balloting of stalls. If there are subsequent vacancies

in  these new markets or food centres or in respect of

old  markets,  then such cases are not within  the  5%

scope.  They  do  not  come  under  the  scope  of  5%

allocation of stalls any more. Maybe



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1201</b></font><br><br>



some   people  will  ask  why  in  recent  years   the

Government  has been so strict in issuing licences  to

hawkers.  The  main reason is that for  the  long-term

policy  of  the Government we want all  the  open  air

hawkers to move into sheltered hawker centres in order

to achieve our anti-pollution policy. It is also meant

to raise our standard of public hygiene.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Members are aware that the cost of

constructing  new markets/food centres  has  increased

with  the average cost per stall ranging from  $10,000

to  $15,000. So under these circumstances, we have  to

consider this matter carefully. Some Members have also

asked  whether we should increase the 5% stalls  to  a

higher percentage. After my explanation I believe they

can  understand that at the moment it is not necessary

or  not  possible  to raise the 5% allocation  in  new

markets  to a higher percentage. We will not  give  it

any prior consideration for the time being.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter touched upon by the Member for Bukit

Panjang  relates  to  the work of our  department.  He

mentioned  the  attitude of certain hawker  inspectors

when  carrying out their duty and asked  whether  they

are  given a period of training. Here I would like  to

explain  in detail so that they can understand better.

When  new staff are recruited, everyone of them  would

be  sent for a period of at least half a year  in  the

basic  principles of dealing with the public so as  to

get  them familiar with public relations. Not only new

recruits  are  trained, but also old and senior  staff

are  sent  for refresher course in the hope that  this

will raise their efficiency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, a fact we should recognise is

that  all  those officers concerned with the  work  of

enforcement,  are carrying out difficult  tasks.  They

have  to face occupational hazards. When carrying  out

their  duty  they  are  usually faced  with  difficult

situations. It is quite risky in certain circumstances

and the public do not understand them well. While they

are  faced  with  various difficulties,  they  do  not

receive any psychological encouragement at all.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1202</b></font><br><br>



Therefore, there have been frequent resignations  from

these  people. So sometimes it is difficult for us  to

arrange such staff for our work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking. I can say that we have already

achieved  our  purpose or objective  in  tackling  the

hawker  problem. Of course, there cannot be perfection

all round. Certain problems still remain to be solved.

It  is only natural. I also said that in dealing  with

unlicensed  hawkers, there could be unpleasant  scenes

and  sometimes even fighting would take place. But the

loser will not only be the unlicensed hawkers but also

our  staff. Some of our staff have suffered injury  in

such  incidents.  Some  even had  to  undergo  medical

treatment  for quite some time. What has come  to  our

notice  is that some foreigners were involved  in  the

incidents. So in this respect, we have to enforce  our

law and protect our citizens' benefits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has asked whether markets will

be built in Anson constituency or whether food centres

will  also  be  built  there.  Verbally,  though   not

officially, the Member for Punggol has also  mentioned

about similar questions as to whether markets or  food

centres  will be built in his constituency.  My  reply

here is, taking Anson constituency for example, it  is

in  an  urban area and there are already some  markets

there.  As to whether there is a need to build  a  new

market  there, it has to depend on future  development

plans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Member for Punggol has not made any

official request, for his information I would say that

in  Punggol constituency perhaps it is easier  to  get

the  necessary land, As to whether the  site  will  be

suitable,  again  it will have to  depend  on  further

discussion  and study. If the Member concerned  thinks

that  it  is necessary and there is a proper  site  to

build  a market or food centre in his constituency.  I

hope he will raise the matter with us and we will give

it serious consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has raised two points. First.

he hopes that we will control the hawker prices or fix

the prices of food sold by them in order to be fair to

the customers. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1203</b></font><br><br>



doubt  whether it would be fair to the hawkers  to  do

so, because  they  get  their  supplies   from   the

merchants. So the prices are not within their control.

To  ask  the hawkers to sell at certain prices is  not

practical.  Prices fluctuate according to  the  market

situation. I think it may suffice if they label  their

prices themselves if they want to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards subletting of hawker licences, we are

paying  attention to this matter. If  there  are  such

irregular practices, then we will take steps to cancel

the  hawkers'  licences of the persons  concerned.  We

will not allow such things to happen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards pasar malam, last week I said in this

House, when we receive complaints against  the  pasar

malam  stallholders  we cannot do otherwise  but  take

action   against   them.   Nevertheless, for   their

livelihood,  we  will try to allocate stalls  in  some

markets or food centres for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, several points were raised by the Member for

Geylang Serai. As regards the new market at Haig  Road

how  many  stalls  are  there and  how  many  will  be

allotted to Muslim stallholders and how many  to  non-Muslim  stallholders, my answer is that  in  this  new

market  there are altogether 218 stalls, of which  146

are  stalls for the sale of meat, vegetables and daily

consumer goods. The other 72 are meant for the sale of

cooked  food.  As regards how many stalls  are  to  be

allocated  to  Muslim stallholders and  to  non-Muslim

stallholders, it will have to depend on the number  of

stallholders that will be moved into this market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is the separation of stalls selling

beef  and  mutton  from  those selling  pork  with  an

appreciable distance between them. Of course,  it  has

always  been the Government's policy to separate  them

well  from each other. So we will again properly apply

the same policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point the Member raised is that when a new

market  is  to  be  opened, whether the  MP  for  that

constituency  will  be invited  to  officiate  at  the

opening  ceremony. This again falls within  our  usual

policy. Whenever a new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>



market  is  to  be  opened,  we  will  invite  the  MP

concerned  in that area to discuss among other  things

matters  relating  to the opening  of  the  market.  I

believe  that  the  market officials  and  the  people

involved with that market have already themselves seen

the MP concerned about related matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, as regards the Member for Telok Blangah's

point about closer liaison between the Ministry of the

Environment  and the statutory boards, like  the  JTC.

PSA,  the  HDB  in order to have some kind  of  common

policy in dealing with hawkers, I will say that  these

four establishments had already in July 1975 set up  a

Hawkers   Coordinating  and  Licensing  Committee   to

harmonise  mutual  policies  in  order  to  unify  the

respective policies so that in future there will be  a

common  policy to deal with hawkers' problems  and  we

have now more or less achieved this objective. But  in

view  of different backgrounds, there would be certain

differences  in  the  actual  implementation  of   the

policy. So it is not easy to change the situation in a

short  time.  However,  we  are  trying  our  best  to

overcome these problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally - I have used this word so many times

already  -  the Member also asked whether the  Hawkers

Department can issue a joint or co-operative  hawker's

licence  for  several people or a group of  people  to

operate a stall jointly. In principle, it may be  good

for  a  society,  but  administratively  it  will   be

difficult,  because there is the possible  problem  of

subletting.  Normally we issue licences to individuals

and not to groups of persons. So for the time being we

cannot  accept this suggestion. I think I have replied

to all the questions raised.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Point of clarification, Sir, Earlier

I  have indicated to you, Sir, that I was not going to

speak   on   the  amendment,  but  since  the   Senior

Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister  for   the

Environment has made reference to the point that I was

going  to  ask  him  a  question with  regard  to  the

possibility of the construction of a hawker centre and

not a market in my constituency. I have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>



changed my mind and wish to speak on it now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Punggol Estate has a market with a hawker centre

comprising  30 cooked food stalls. I noted  that  this

was  insufficient. So I had occasion to speak  to  him

that I intended to raise this matter, and in his reply

he  preempted my intention. But since he has been kind

to give me that reply which I did not ask for, I would

like not only to thank him but ask him or his Ministry

whether  a  hawker centre will be built in  that  area

should a suitable site be found in my constituency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, at the present

moment there is no plan in my Ministry to build a  new

hawker  centre in Punggol, but if the Member concerned

can  propose  a suitable site we will make  a  serious

study of his proposal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem:</b> Sir, I asked about licences for old

people  because  under the present policy  old  people

without any school going dependants do not qualify for

a  hawker  licence. Sir, these old people  have  their

self-respect and they do not really want to go to  the

Social   Welfare   Department  to   ask   for   public

assistance. All I am asking is, can the Ministry  look

into  the  possibility of issuing hawker  licences  to

these  old  people. To dismiss it outright  is  a  bit

unfair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If the Member for

Telok  Blangah can bring up the hardship cases to  our

attention we will give special consideration to them.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir,I ask for a hawker centre

in  the Anson constituency, but he says that there are

many markets. Where are the markets? There is only one

market  at  Maxwell  Road. I am talking  about  hawker

centres.  There  are  so many  hawkers  in  the  Anson

constituency.  Why do they not want  to  resite  these

hawkers  in  a hawker centre? The Senior Parliamentary

Secretary  does not always give a proper reply  to  my

question. I want a proper reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in the past

there was perhaps one market in Maxwell Road in Anson.

Now  as  the Anson constituency has been enlarged,  he

now has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1206</b></font><br><br>



other  markets which include the PSA markets.  In  any

case  if the Member for Anson feels there is a further

need for a new market, as I have already said, then we

have  to  consider it in the light of any  development

plan  for the constituency. If he has a suitable  site

to propose then we will certainly consider it.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): My request is to get

a hawker centre in the Anson constituency. Where is he

going to dump the hawkers! It is his duty to give them

a  place.  Whenever  I ask a question  of  the  Senior

Parliamentary  Secretary, he never  gives  a  complete

answer.  He gives an answer as he wishes.  This  is  a

fair   request  that  I  am  asking.  We  are  elected

representatives of the people and therefore I am  here

to  request  the  Senior  Parliamentary  Secretary  on

behalf of my people to look after their interests.  We

are entitled to have proper answers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I did not get a

translation of the earlier part of the Member's speech

in  Tamil but I have the latter part of it. The Member

for Anson was saying that we have a responsibility  to

look  for  a site for a hawker centre. I have  already

stated earlier that in the short term we have no plans

to   build   a   new  hawker  centre  in   the   Anson

constituency. Since the Member for Anson  has  been  a

Member for Anson for such a long time, he should  know

his constituency very well. So if he has any idea I am

sure  his idea will be very much better than the civil

servants' idea. I would like to appeal to him that  if

he  or  his CCC feels that there is any suitable site,

we will give it very serious consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Sir, that is not my

duty.  That is his duty. He has the responsibility  of

selecting a place. He must ask the Government to get a

place  to build the hawker centre. Will he give  us  a

place when we ask for it? If we select a vacant place,

will  he  build  us a hawker centre? If  we  select  a

corner at Maxwell Road, or a carpark, will he build  a

hawker  centre for us? Please tell us. It is no  point

talking. We must have action. Yes, I have been serving

my constituency for a long time. He has also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1207</b></font><br><br>



been  serving  in  that  Ministry  for  a  long  time.

Therefore, he should also be conversant. Now the Anson

constituency has been enlarged. I agree. But there  is

only  one  hawker centre. We need more hawker centres,

Therefore I repeatedly request him for a hawker centre

in my constituency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Member for

Anson says that we have to look for a site. Of course,

we  have been looking for a site all the time. He said

that  if  he  were to select a place at  a  corner  of

Maxwell Road, or at the cross-roads, an important  and

busy traffic junction, whether we will be prepared  to

build  a  hawker centre there. The question of putting

up  a  hawker  centre is not decided  by  my  Ministry

alone. I am sure the Member for Anson knows well  that

before any planning approval is granted, it has to  go

through  several relevant Ministries. It is only  when

there  is  a concurrence of ideas between the  various

Departments   and   officers   concerned   that    the

construction will be approved. So it is  not  for  one

particular   Ministry  to  decide  on  a  construction

project.  We  have  to  consider  the  overall  common

interest  of  the people. It is not as  simple  as  he

says, that so long as he selects a place we can put  a

hawker centre. The matter is not so simple as that.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): This is his

responsibility.  Why is he seated  there?  He  has  to

liaise  with  the  various  departments  and  seek   a

favourable  solution. Therefore, it  is  his  duty  to

build  a hawker centre, wherever a place is available.

It  is his duty. It is not my duty. I am here to bring

the problems of my constituents, and it is his duty to

listen to these problems and to seek a solution.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If he does not bring

up  the proposal, we will still consider carefully  on

our  own  whether there is any suitable site  for  any

hawker centre to be put up.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Now I have already

brought  up this problem: we need a hawker  centre  in

Anson Road. What, else does he need?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1208</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, on principle we

said that in the short term we do not have a plan  for

it,  but since the Member feels that there is  a  need

then we will consider it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, since everybody

is  taking a keen interest in the debate, I will  also

take  part  and join the fun. The Senior Parliamentary

Secretary  has  told  this House  just  now  that  the

Hawkers  Department has conducted courses for its  new

officers.  We  have  frequently heard  in  this  House

complaints  that the Hawker Inspectors are very  harsh

in  their  attitude,  particularly towards  unlicensed

hawkers  when they would behave rashly in  the  public

eye,  as stated by the Member for Bukit Panjang.  Even

in  their dealings with licensed hawkers, they  behave

in  the  same  way  and in a very high-handed  manner.

Sometimes they are very unreasonable. So I would  like

to ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary what kind of

training  courses  do  they  conduct,  what  are   the

contents of the courses, where are such courses  held,

and  whether there is any requirement for  the  Hawker

Inspector  to  sit  in  and  observe  the  Members  of

Parliament during their meet-the-people sessions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Member for

Jurong asked about the contents of the courses. I have

already mentioned that they are given basic courses on

administration, law enforcement and their handling  of

members  of the public. In a big Ministry  it  may  be

possible  that  one  or  two  officers  may  have   so

conducted themselves as to cause misunderstanding.  If

the  Member  for Jurong welcomes our officers  to  his

meet-the-people sessions, we are prepared to send them

there.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in answering my

question  just now the Senior Parliamentary  Secretary

said  that there were instances of fighting  when  the

hawker inspectors were enforcing the law. But whatever

it   is, who   was   right   and   who   was   wrong

notwithstanding, he has admitted  that  there  was  a

fight. This is a serious matter. Since he has admitted

that there was a fight,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1209</b></font><br><br>



has he taken any steps to prevent such a recurrence?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Fighting does not

take place unilaterally. There are two sides to a

fight.



<br><br><!-- Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>8.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Moment of interruption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Deputy Speaker left the Chair of the

Committee and took the Chair of the House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1210</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I beg to report that the Committee

of  Supply has made further progress on the  Main  and

Development  Estimates  for  the  financial  year  1st

April, 1977 to 31st March, 1978, and ask leave to sit

again tomorrow.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> So be it.
