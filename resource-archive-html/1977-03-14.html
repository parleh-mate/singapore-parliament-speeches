<div align="center"><b>(Evaluation of staff performance)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi</b> asked the Prime

Minister whether a better system for evaluating staff

performance  will  be used to facilitate  the  career

development of officers in Division I grades  in  the

civil service and what comparative studies have  been

made  on the merits of different systems used locally

and  overseas to ensure that the best possible system

is used



<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi</b> asked the Minister for

Finance whether a better



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>



system for evaluating staff performance will be  used

to  facilitate the career development of officers  in

the  various  grades in the civil  service  and  what

comparative studies have been made on the  merits  of

different systems used locally and overseas to ensure

that the best possible system is used.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Sir, the Member for Kampong

Kembangan  has raised two questions (Nos. 1  and  14)

pertaining to evaluation of staff performance,  which

are   identical   except  that  they  are   addressed

correctly  to different Ministers in accordance  with

their  portfolio responsibilities. Since the  answers

required  are mainly technical, it would  perhaps  be

convenient  for me to take and answer both  questions

together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present system for evaluating staff performance

is  essentially  based on confidential  reporting  by

supervisory  officers.  In  the  case  of   confirmed

officers,  the reports are put up annually while  for

probationers,   they   are  done   six-monthly.   The

performance  of  an  officer reported  on  is  graded

according to a number of attributes relevant  to  his

work.  Such  an  assessment is usually  made  by  the

officer's  immediate  supervisor  and  subject  to  a

second  opinion  of a Countersigning Officer  who  is

usually   the  superior  of  the  Reporting  Officer.

Through this, a fairly reasonable assessment  of  the

performance of an officer is made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the present Staff Confidential Report Form

for  Divisions I and II officers in the Civil Service

is designed for the assessment of officers performing

administrative  and managerial duties.  It  does  not

provide  a  very  accurate  assessment  of  those  in

professional   grades  where  the  emphasis   is   on

professional    capabilities    rather    than     on

administrative skills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Management Services Department of the Ministry

of  Finance  has  invited Permanent  Secretaries  and

Heads  of  major  Departments who  have  professional

officers  to  make  proposals on  how  the  reporting

system  can  be  improved. These  proposals  will  be

considered  by a Committee comprising representatives

from the Prime



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>



Minister's Office, the Public Service Commission  and

the Ministry of Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister's Office has also designed a

staff  report form for officers in the Administrative

Service  in which more attention is focussed  on  the

officer's capability and suitability and which at the

same time allows for their weaknesses to be specified

so  that  remedial action can be taken.  The  revised

format  is  presently  being studied  by  the  Public

Service Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to add that the efficacy of any

system  of performance evaluation will largely depend

on the ability of officers entrusted with the task of

making  assessments to maintain objectivity in  their

assessments.

<div align="center"><b>KALLANG BASIN</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Request for additional flats)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr S. Dhanabalan</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  and  Communications  whether  there  are

plans to construct more Housing and Development Board

flats   for   rental  in  the  Kallang  Basin   area,

especially in the area known as Polling District  III

in the Kallang Electoral Constituency, as the Kallang

Basin  area  is very popular among those  wanting  to

rent  HDB  flats  and  has  the  largest  number   of

applicants (2,277 as at 31st December, 1976) on the

waiting list among all the HDB areas.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang (Senior Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Tan Eng Liang) (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, the number of applicants on the waiting list for

Kallang  Basin covers three Electoral Constituencies;

namely, Kallang. Geylang West and Kolam Aver.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, 692 more units are under construction

at  Kolam  Aver  Constituency. Apart from  this,  the

Board  has no plans to build additional flats in  the

area  known  as Polling District III in  the  Kallang

Constituency.

<div align="center"><b>SERANGOON GARDEN WAY/CHENG SAN ROAD</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Measures to reduce earth spillage and traffic hazards)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  and Communications whether measures  can

be  taken to minimize the dirt pollution and  traffic

hazards  caused  by lorries, transporting  earth  and

other   construction  materials,  travelling  through

Serangoon Garden Way and Cheng San Road to Ang Mo Kio

housing estate and vice versa.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Senior Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Communications (Mr Ong Teng Cheong) (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

since  the  second quarter of 1976, the  Housing  and

Development Board has stopped earth transportation by

lorries  to  Ang  Mo  Kio New Town through  Serangoon

Garden  Way.  However, lorries carrying  construction

materials  continue to use Serangoon Garden  Way  and

Cheng  San Road. Mud and dirt could have been brought

out  onto  these  roads by these  lorries  and  other

vehicles  after  driving  through  earth  tracks  and

construction sites in Ang Mo Kio.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB has arranged for workers to sweep and clean

the  two  roads  regularly to reduce  dust  and  dirt

pollution. In addition, officers from the Ministry of

the  Environment and the Traffic Police will continue

to  take enforcement action against lorry drivers and

contractors  who  load their lorries  improperly  and

cause excessive spillage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce hazards to other road users, the Traffic

Police  will  also  step up its  enforcement  against

lorry  drivers  who speed or drive  recklessly  along

Serangoon Garden Way and Cheng San Road. At the  same

time, the  Registry of Vehicles has  directed  lorry

operators to supervise their drivers closely  and  to

avoid spillage from lorries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these actions, dust pollution and traffic

hazards caused by lorries will be minimised.

<div align="center"><b>RADIO AND TELEVISION SINGAPORE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Selection of articles and artistes)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi</b> asked the Minister for

Culture  and  Science and Technology  how  Radio  and

Television Singapore select (i) the articles for  its

drama  and  comedy programmes, and (ii) the  artistes

and participants in its children's programmes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture and Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Science and Technology (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, artistes and

participants  for  RTS drama, comedy  and  children's

programmes are drawn from a pool of artistes built up

over  the  years. Selection of artistes for  specific

programmes  is  determined by  such  factors  as  the

nature of the programme, suitability of artistes  for

certain  roles, their experience and the standard  of

their  performance. Artistes who do not keep up  with

their  standard of performance are phased out or  not

used.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pool of artistes is constantly enlarged by: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) mass auditions which are normally conducted to

find talent for a new series of programme;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the holding of contests, such as Talentime;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Periodic auditions which are held to ascertain

the suitability of persons who write in indicating an

interest in taking part in TV or Radio programmes;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) talents who come to the notice of our staff

through their performance at shows, dramas staged  by

cultural organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malay and Chinese services of Radio Singapore

also  each  run  a children's workshop  which  yearly

recruits new members for training in acting,  singing

and  compering.  These  children  are  then  used  in

programmes  produced  by  the  services.  The  Indian

service holds auditions twice a year for students  to

spot those with ability in music or drama.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Artistes who take part in TV programmes in

particular are required to spend a great deal of time

in rehearsals and recordings.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>



Some   find  the  monetary  returns  from   RTS   not

attractive  enough and they either stop  or  take  up

more  paying  assignments elsewhere. This  does  lead

sometimes  to  a  dependence on a  smaller  group  of

artistes  than is desirable. Although  fresh  or  new

talents are discovered through auditions or contests,

they need time to gain experience in order to take on

more demanding roles in, say, a drama.

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT CRECHES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Takeover by trade union)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> asked the Minister for Social

Affairs  how many Government creches have been  taken

over by a trade union and how many more will be taken

over; and what are the reasons and conditions for the

take over.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Encik Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, so far, only the Kallang

Creche   has   been  taken  over  by  the   Singapore

Industrial  Labour  Organisation (SILO)  with  effect

1st October, 1976



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has been discussing with the National

Trades Union Congress on the proposal for the NTUC to

take   over  the  remaining  10  creches  at  present

administered  by the Social Welfare Department.  This

is  in line with the Government's policy to encourage

private   and  industrial  organisations  to  operate

creches  to  help working mothers. It is particularly

appropriate that the NTUC should take a lead in  this

area   as  it  is  best  placed  to  understand   and

appreciate  the practical difficulties of employment.

It  is also in line with the NTUC's policy of looking

after the welfare of workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the conditions for the handover, these are

still being discussed but basically the NTUC would be

responsible for the day-to-day running of the creches

on  a financial subsidy given by the Government.  The

Social Welfare Department will continue to look after

the hardship cases which are sent to the creches.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is planned for the NTUC to take over the creches

by the end of this year on a phased schedule.

<div align="center"><b>ISSUE OF HAWKER LICENCES TO CITIZENS AFFECTED BY RESETTLEMENT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for Law and

the  Environment if he will consider  issuing  hawker

licences  to  those  citizens  who  are  affected  by

resettlement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment (Mr Chor Yeok Eng) (for the Minister for Law and the Environment)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, hawker licences are not issued to

all   citizens   who  are  affected  by  resettlement

undertaken  by  the  Government. However,  stalls  in

markets  and  food  centres  have  been  allotted  to

persons  whose  earnings are  adversely  affected  by

resettlement due to public projects undertaken by the

Ministries or departments concerned, so that they can

have a new way to make a living.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Senior Parliamentary Secretary said

that  action has been taken to issue hawker  licences

to  some, but not to all citizens who are affected by

resettlement. Can the Parliamentary Secretary  inform

this House under what circumstances is allocation  of

stalls  made,  and so far how many of those  who  are

affected  by  resettlement  have  been  given  hawker

licences?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in answer to

the question concerning the circumstances leading  to

the  allocation  of hawker stalls, I would  say  that

basically approval is given to those who are affected

to  the extent of losing their opportunity to earn  a

living, for example, fishermen or farmers who,  as  a

result  of  resettlement, have lost  their  means  of

livelihood.  Another circumstance could be  that  the

compensation they get is not much and that  they  are

still  in  financial difficulties, then consideration

will be given for the allocation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>



of   stalls  to  such  people.  On  the  other  hand,

hereafter  we  shall liberalise the issue  of  hawker

licences for such people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the number of cases of successful

allocations, I have some figures here. In  the  whole

year   of  1976  168  resettlement  cases  have  been

allotted  hawker stalls. But these hawker stalls  are

those built by the Ministry of the Environment, which

are  of the older type and are not popular, and  only

one  farmer  has accepted the offer. In the  case  of

Jurong  Town, seven have accepted the offers, whereas

in  the  case of markets under the administration  of

the  Housing  and Development Board, 160  cases  have

accepted  the offers. This is because in the  Housing

Board  estates the markets are new and are all  sited

in  population centres. Therefore, their  stalls  are

more popular.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Senior Parliamentary Secretary  has

mentioned  in his reply about liberalising the  issue

of  hawker licences. I would like to ask him  how  is

the issue of licences to be liberalised. Secondly, in

the case of those affected by resettlement and suffer

financial  hardship  to whom consideration  would  be

given,  I  would  like to ask who  is  to  give  such

consideration?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, on

the  point  raised by the Member for  Jalan  Kayu,  I

would  say that consideration is given by a committee

to   those   people  who  suffer  financial  hardship

directly as a result of resettlement or who have lost

their   means  of  livelihood  in  the   process   of

resettlement.  There  are  now  four  departments  in

charge  of  hawkers,  namely,  the  Ministry  of  the

Environment, the Housing and Development  Board, the

Port  of  Singapore  Authority and  the  Jurong  Town

Corporation.  So  this  coordinating  committee,   in

charge  of  mutual matters and common measures, will

consider such cases.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ngeow Pack Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ngeow Pack Hua (Boon Lay)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, who really



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>



considers the issue of licences? Is it the JTC or the

Ministry of the Environment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, it

is  the  committee which considers  such  cases.  For

example, if those affected are in JTC charge then, of

course,   the  recommendation  will  come  from   the

Resettlement  Department of the  JTC,  and  if  those

affected  are in the Housing Board estates, then  the

recommendation will come from the Housing  Board  for

consideration by the committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

who  undertakes the investigation? I believe that  up

till  now  nobody  from any of these  departments  is

undertaking an investigation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, on

this   question  I  have  already  stated  that   the

department  directly concerned is  charged  with  the

responsibility for the investigation. For example, if

it concerns the Housing Board, then the Housing Board

is  responsible for the investigation. If it  is  the

Ministry of the Environment, then that Ministry  will

take  action to investigate the applications, and  so

on.  As  far  as  I am aware, apart from  asking  the

applicants concerned to come for interview,  we  even

carry out on-the-site investigation by calling on the

applicants in their homes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai (Henderson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  ask  the   Senior

Parliamentary Secretary whether consideration will be

given to the removal of one of the conditions for the

issue  of licences, i.e, the applicant must be  above

40  years old. To go a step further, is he aware that

a person who is more than 60 years old and has only a

daughter  earning less than $100 to support the  aged

parents is also not eligible to apply at the moment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

think it is because of our policy a few years ago  to

reduce  the number of hawkers in Singapore that  this

age  restriction was imposed. It does not necessarily

mean that all hawkers must be above the age of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>



40. In fact, before 1973 a lot of hawkers were in the

age group of 20 years and 30 years. However, in cases

of  difficult family circumstances, for example,  the

applicant is a widow, those who are disabled  or  who

have  medical  certificates to  show  that  they  are

unable  to  undertake  laborious  manual  work, then

special   consideration  will  be  given   to   their

application for hawker licences. As I have  said,  we

are   now  reviewing  our  policy  with  a  view   to

liberalising  the  restrictions  on  hardship  cases,

especially  in  regard to age restriction  and  other

factors. An over-all review of the position is  being

undertaken  at  the  moment. I think  in  future  the

conditions will be more relaxed.



<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi (Kampong Kembangan):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  is  it  our policy  to  progressively

reduce the number of hawkers? If so, would it not  be

true  to  say that in the long run there will  be  no

hawkers?  What  then  will be  the  position  of  the

hawkers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a long-term

policy,   we  do  not  basically  encourage  roadside

hawking.  After 1973 we had ceased to issue any  more

licences  for  street  hawking or  roadside  hawking.

Hawker licences are only issued to those resettlement

cases  and they are accommodated in sheltered  hawker

centres.  That  has  always been the  policy  of  the

Government  because there are a lot  of  labour  jobs

without  the people to take them. So it is  our  hope

that our citizens will direct their energy to working

in private enterprises, factories and other services.



<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the

present  hawkers  get older and  with  the  stringent

policy of limiting the transfer of licences to  their

children. I think we can anticipate that, in the long

run, there will be no hawkers. Is it the objective of

the  Ministry that in the long run there will  be  no

hawkers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

that  is  not our policy. In the long run, of course,

we  will  still need the services of the hawkers.  As

regards  the  application by members  of  family  for

transfer of hawker



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>



licences, we have to consider each case on  its  own

merit.  For instance, if a hawker licence is held  by

the father and his children have been helping him all

this time, then in such a case, we normally allow the

transfer of a licence from the father to a member  of

his family.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Home Affairs and Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs and Education (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, various measures

have  been taken to check and book drivers of  earth-carrying  lorries speeding along Jurong  Road.  These

measures  include  the  use  of  radar  speed  traps.

the  registration plate numbers and speed of vehicles

which travel faster than the speed limit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1976, 338 lorries were booked for speeding along

Jurong Road. In January and February this year, 30 of

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE CITIZENSHIP</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Applications from minor citizens)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr S. Dhanabalan</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  and  Education  how  many  applications  for

citizenship  result from minor citizens  who  through

ignorance  fail  to take the oath  of  allegiance  on

attaining the age of 21 years and whether, instead of

calling  up  such persons and taking away their  pink

identity cards and issuing them blue identity  cards,

a procedure can be established to inform such persons

individually  of  the  need  to  take  the  oath   of

allegiance and to administer such an oath immediately

instead  of  causing  them  to  join  the  queue   of

applicants for citizenship.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all,

let   me  state  that  minors  who  become  Singapore

citizens  by descent or by registration are  required

under the Singapore Constitution to take the oath  of

renunciation, allegiance and loyalty within 12 months

on  reaching the age of 21 years. Failure  to  comply

with   this   legal  requirement   will   make   them

automatically  lose  their  citizenship.  It  is  not

possible  to reinstate their citizenship once  it  is

lost   by   reason   of  non-compliance   with   this

constitutional   requirement.   Such   persons   may,

however, apply again to be registered as citizens. In

1976, a total of 34 applications were received under

this category.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last six years, the number of persons who

failed to take the oath and had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>



lost their citizenship was as follows:



<pre>

                      1971 - 135

                      1972 - 150

                      1973 - 122

                      1974 - 84

                      1975 - 86

                      1976 - 67



</pre>

The   figures   indicate  that  the  problem   is   a

diminishing one. I also wish to point out  that  some

could  have failed to take the oath deliberately  for

various  reasons, such as to evade national  service.

In  1976,  24 of the 67 who failed to take  the  oath

were known to have done so deliberately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not practical to send individual reminders to

minors  about the need to take the oath because  many

of  them were registered as Singapore citizens  at  a

tender age, often below one year old, and it would be

extremely   difficult  to  contact   these   persons,

particularly if they are residing overseas and do not

possess  Singapore identity cards. Even if  reminders

were  to  be sent, those who failed to take the  oath

could  always  claim that they did  not  receive  the

reminders  and  thus put the blame on the  Government

for their own failing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the following measures have been

taken  all  along by the Registry of  Citizenship  to

remind   minor   citizens  to  take   the   oath   of

renunciation, allegiance and loyalty on reaching  the

age of 21:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) A reminder on the need for the oath taking, in

the  four official languages, is stamped on the  back

of  all  citizenship  certificates  issued  to  minor

citizens;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) At the time such certificates are issued, the

attention of the parent or guardian is drawn  to  the

oath taking requirement;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Singapore passports, both international and

restricted, issued to minor citizens are  valid  only

up  to  their 21st birthday and will not  be  renewed

unless the holders have taken the oath;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Since July 1973, a press statement has been

issued  bi-annually  in June and December  to  remind

minor citizens to take



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>



the  oath. This statement is carried by the TV, radio

and by the newspapers; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) Minor citizens serving national service in the

SAF are also reminded by the SAF to take the oath  at

the appropriate time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above measures should be sufficient to remind

minor citizens to take their oath. If they fail to do

so,  they have themselves to blame. I might add  that

citizenship  is a serious matter for the  minors  and

their  parents  to make the effort on their  part  to

remember to take their oath. If they do not, it is an

indication  that  they  do not  seriously  value  the

citizenship or treat their oath of allegiance to  our

Republic seriously. They have one full year in  which

to take their oath.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lau Teik Soon (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the Minister mentioned that in 1976 out of  the

number  who  failed to take the oath  of  allegiance,

about 34 of them had reapplied. May we know from  the

Minister  how  many  of these 34 who  reapplied  were

successful, and whether there were any rejections, if

so, on what grounds were they rejected?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, I have some of the figures

here.  The  majority of those who  lost  their  minor

citizenship  have reapplied. In 1974,  of  those  who

reapplied,  17  were  approved;  in  1975,  169  were

approved; and in 1976, 77 were approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as some of them are genuine cases of failure

to  take  their  oath,  they were  given  sympathetic

consideration and, in fact, some of them  were  given

priority  consideration. But before  approving  their

citizenship  applications, they have to  satisfy  the

various  requirements needed. For example, they  must

have  the normal residence of 10 years out of the  12

years  preceding their application; that they are  of

good  character  and that they have family  roots  in

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Dhanabalan (Kallang):</b> Sir, would

the  Minister  please explain why it should  be  more

difficult to send individual reminders when, in fact,

individual letters are sent to those who have  failed

to  take  their oath of allegiance to exchange  their

pink identity, cards for blue identity cards?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, as I said, the reason is

that  some of them were registered as minor  citizens

at  the  tender  age of one year  old  and  have  not

obtained identity cards at all. If they have identity

cards,  then it would not be difficult to  send  them

reminders.  In  fact, the answer to  the  Member  for

Kallang's  question  is  contained  in  the  question

itself. If they have identity cards, then it would be

easier  to  address  them for  the  return  of  their

identity cards.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Dhanabalan:</b> They must have.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Then it would be easier to

address  them  a  letter  for  the  return  of  their

identity cards.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Sir, would the Minister consider withdrawing

that  part of his reply where he said that  those

people  failed  to  subscribe  to  the  oath   of

allegiance  for  reasons of evasion  of  national

service?  Would the Minister consider withdrawing

this  part  of  the reply, because  there  is  an

apparent   contradiction?  That  is   the   first

question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question: Is the Minister not aware that

the age for national service is set at the age of  18

and  that  the subscription to the oath of allegiance

is  at  the  age of 21? This leads me  to  the  third

question.  At  the  age of 21, he would  have  served

national   service.   So   there   is   an   apparent

contradiction there. Would the Minister then consider

withdrawing his entire reply in the circumstances?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that statement

of  mine has been made after very careful thought.  I

do  not know whether the request from the Member  for

Kampong    Chai   Chee   was   made   after   serious

consideration on his part. I am not saying that every

one  of  them did not take the oath because he wanted

to  evade national service. What I said was "some  of

them."  And  it does not mean that when a person  has

reached  the  age  of  18  he will  automatically  do

national  service  or, if he has  not  done  national

service,  he  would not have to do  national  service

later. I think it is quite obvious that those people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>



whom I am referring to are those who have gone abroad

at  the age of 18 and below and are still abroad. And

when they reach the age of 21 they have not returned.

This is the category of persons I am referring to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, is not the Minister

therefore  implying that those who can afford  to  go

overseas  at the age of 18 and before 21  will  stand

the chance later to deliberately fail to subscribe to

the  oath  of  allegiance so  as  to  evade  national

service?  That means those who cannot  afford  to  go

overseas  have no chance even to say, "I do not  want

to  subscribe to the oath." Is there not a disparity?

Would the Minister consider withdrawing this part  of

his reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, I just cannot understand

the   Member  for  Kampong  Chai  Chee.  I  was  just

referring  to a category of people who had  not  done

national  service and that they had not done national

service because they were not in the country and they

had not gone to take the oath of allegiance when they

reached the age of 21. That is all that I have  said.

I am not implying anything further.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Sir, as regards

national service registration, it is published in the

papers,   announced  over  the  radio  and  TV   that

everybody  affected must register during  the  stated

periods.  Why  is it, therefore, that minor  citizens

who  reach 21 years of age are not reminded  to  take

the oath?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, in answer to the Member for

Anson, the publicity is given over the radio, TV  and

in the newspapers.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Dhanabalan:</b> Sir, if letters could be sent to

each  individual who holds an identity card (and they

are  all given identity cards at the age of 12), then

why  cannot individual letters be sent to  them  when

they  reach the age of 21 to remind them of the oath,

when  in  fact such letters are sent asking  them  to

come  and exchange their pink identity cards for blue

identity cards?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, let me explain again. The

reason why we say that it is not good policy to  send

letters is that if we send letters to one or to some,

then we have to send to all of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Yes, send to all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> It is not possible to send to

all because not all of them will have identity cards,

particularly the category of minor citizens  who  are

abroad. Some of them do not hold identity cards.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

has  not answered my question. He has only said  that

national  service  registration  is  announced   over

radio,  TV  and the newspapers. What I want  is  that

those  minor citizens who reach the age of  21  years

must  be  reminded to take the oath of allegiance.  I

want this reminder published in the press and carried

over the radio and TV.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Khe Bong):</b> That is right. Why not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, these reminders are being

I was saying that Singapore has been transformed into

a  productive industrial country providing employment

for  the  greater part of our population. This  shows

that  our  economy  is  on the way  to  recovery.  On

industrial training, the Minister pointed out that at

our     industrial    technical     reservoir     for

industrialisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have heard of certain adverse reports on

such  training  schemes.  For  example,  there  is  a

shortage of instructors and that the contents of  the

courses are not very relevant to actual needs.  I  do

not  know  whether there is any truth in the rumours.

But  since  the Government has spent a lot of  money,

manpower  and resources on these training schemes.  I

would  like  to ask whether such schemes have  reaped

favourable  results  where  the  trainees  have  been

deployed  in  our industries and whether  the  skills

have  been  put  to  proper use,  otherwise  what  is

learned  is  of no practical use and is  a  waste  of

public   funds.  Another  question  is  whether   the

training  institutes  keep  a  record  of  employment

statistics  of  those  trainees  relevant  to   their

skills. I would like the Minister to inform the House

of the situation in detail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Industrial Development, the Minister said that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Large unused production capacity and high

unemployment in the industrialised countries no doubt

affected  the drop in new investments from  overseas.

The  task of investment promotion for the coming year

remains difficult.'



<br><br>Such  analysis  is quite correct. The  Minister  also

laid emphasis on promotion efforts to be made in  the

United  States. Japan and Western Europe. This  shows

that the Government is quite determined in developing

our  economy. Of course, in order to further  develop

our  economy, we should have political stability  and

harmonious  industrial  relations  which  will  bring

about a suitable investment climate. Apart from this,

we  should  also formulate more favourable terms  for

investment  to attract investors from Southeast  Asia

and other parts of the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need to review our incentive measures.

For  example, there is the stipulation that  foreign

investors  who  have  resided in Singapore  for  five

years will be entitled to apply for citizenship. But,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>



according to my knowledge, not many foreign investors

have  obtained citizenship. This would give  rise  to

doubts  among  the foreign investors  and  shake  the

confidence  of  would-be investors.  My  question  is

whether the Minister is aware of the manner in  which

applications for citizenship by such people are dealt

with  and whether the incentive measures are properly

carried  out  by  the  proper  authorities.  Has  the

Registry of Citizenship considered the policy that we

should  give incentives and encouragement to  attract

foreign  investors? I reckon the Minister for Finance

should  be  concerned about this matter. In addition,

when foreign investors want to purchase properties or

send  their children to school, or have other  needs,

do  we  make it easy for them to do so? I think these

are   important  factors  that  will  induce  foreign

investors  to come and invest here. Though these  are

matters  of  detail  to  be  carried  out  by   civil

servants. I hope the Minister will see to it that our

civil  servants  do  not tarnish the  good  image  of

Singapore as a centre for investment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister in the past few years has on several

occasions emphasised the need for diversification  in

our  economy  in  order to overcome problems  due  to

economic  recession.  Such a  statement  is  correct.

However,  apart  from industrial diversification,  we

should  also not neglect the development  in  farming

and fishery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question is that in the Budget statement,

according to the Minister, there is a drop of 20%  in

the  private building industry. This is  due  to  the

completion of office blocks and shopping centres  and

the  slump  in  industrial building and the  shipyard

investment. There is a drop of 3% in private housing.

What  are  the causes? In the beginning of 1970,  the

private  building sector had experienced a period  of

prosperity and had played quite an important role  in

our  economic development. However, in the  last  few

years there has been a slump in this sector. What are

the reasons? I think the Minister should instruct the

relevant  authorities to get to  the  bottom  of  the

reasons  for  such  slump  in  the  private  building

industry so as to find a remedy for such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>



defects,  and  in  order to resuscitate  the  private

building  industry  to continue contributing  towards

our plural economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the farming industry, for example, the growing

of  orchids and rearing of tropical fish,  which  are

two big foreign exchange earners, however, I have not

seen  any effort being made by the Primary Production

Department  to  assist these two industries.  What  I

mean is that the Primary Production Department should

give  them  greater assistance and encouragement  and

that there should be a liaison between the Department

and  the  two  industries to study and plan  for  the

development of these two industries and to allot more

land  to  enable them to expand and earn more foreign

exchange for our Republic. We should not leave  these

two  industries to struggle and fend for  themselves.

If  Members of Parliament in this House were to raise

such  a question, the Minister concerned would always

say,  "These are excellent suggestions and  that  the

Ministry  will consider such suggestions",  but  what

has  been the outcome? Nothing has been done. Is this

correct? Our country is an insular one, surrounded by

sea.  I  believe there is potentiality for developing

our  marine  fishing  industry.  For  example,  large

quantities of fish, prawns and crabs can be reared in

our numerous islands. If the fishermen have an outlet

in  employment, they will not be obliged to resort to

hawking  as a means of livelihood. Many kelongs  have

been  abolished. So these people were forced to  take

up  hawking.  Therefore, the development  of  fishery

will  save us tens of millions of dollars in  foreign

exchange. So, why not develop it. What is the answer?

I would like the Minister to tell this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the four tax concessions mentioned in the

Budget    statement   will   benefit   many   people,

particularly the first two tax concessions, i.e, the

increase  in the exemption of tax on estate duty  and

the  reduction  of  tax on resident pensioners.  This

goes to show that the Government has the interest  of

the  middle and lower income groups of the people  at

heart. These measures are laudable.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Economic Development, the Minister has put

forward  positive plans. For example,  there  is  the

further  strengthening of economic cooperation  among

the  Asian  countries, further  effort  in  promoting

international  trade  and  further  effort  to   make

Singapore  an  international financial centre.  These

are  all constructive and practical measures and  are

good guidelines for the development of our economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, the Budget before the House is a body

of  economic policies imbued with foresight and depth

and  is well defined. I agree with the Minister  when

he  says  the weather ahead is fine and the  Ship  of

State  is  in  good  shape. As  long  as  the  people

continue  to  be  hardworking  and  self-reliant  and

cooperate  closely with the Government, our  Ship  of

State will sail forward smoothly and steadily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to support the Motion.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong (Marine Parade):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I rise to speak with some trepidation,

as  not only do I stand the risk of being bruised  by

superior counter fire power, but also the possibility

of  being  ruled  out  of order for  repetition!  But

conscience speaks louder than fear and it shall be my

guide.  I  am going to speak on a subject  which  has

been  raised by several Members and commented  on  by

the  Minister  for Finance during the debate  on  the

President's Address a few weeks ago, as I  feel  that

the  argument  did  not thrust deep  enough  and  the

answer offered did not parry the attack sufficiently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some of my colleagues in this House have

argued  for an increase in personal and earned income

reliefs  from  income  tax on  the  ground  that  the

quantum  of  reliefs  was fixed about  30  years  ago

whereas  the  cost of living has risen  significantly

since  then,  particularly over the last  few  years.

This  argument  was basically sound but  it  was  not

carried  far enough. The Minister for Finance  warded

off  this  argument  by saying that  an  increase  of

$1,000  in  personal reliefs would  mean  a  loss  in

Government revenue of some $26 million



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>



and  a narrowing of the tax base, i.e, the number  of

people  paying  income tax. This line of  defence  is

correct but not impregnable. He also added that while

the cost of living has gone up, so has the per capita

income which increases the ability of the taxpayer to

pay income tax. But is this really so?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let us take the $26 million potential loss.

$26  million  is a lot of money from an  individual's

viewpoint,  but  what  is  its  significance  to  the

Government?  Income tax expected to be  collected  in

the  fiscal  year 1977 amounts to $1.38 billion,  and

$26  million is only 1.9% of this. But if  we  relate

the  $26 million to income collected from individuals

only, and not companies, the percentage will probably

go  up  to  about  8-10%.  This  is,  of  course,   a

significant percentage. The Minister, therefore,  has

a good defence here, but only fairly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the shrinkage of the tax base, I agree it is

salutary  for the population to be reminded that  the

services provided by the Government must be paid for.

But  I  would  simply ask at this stage  whether  the

affected  taxpayers at the lower income scale  should

be  paying  tax in the first place! The  answer  will

depend on whether their real income has actually gone

up  since  the  time  when  the  present  quantum  of

personal reliefs was originally worked out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I said my colleagues' argument did not cut

deep  enough,  I did not mean to be disrespectful.  I

was  simply  having in mind their not quantifying  an

argument  which could be quantified. Now I have  done

this, and it shows some disturbing results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we are discussing income tax, the relevant

measure for inflation is the Consumer Price Index and

not the Gross Domestic Product deflator. The Consumer

Price Index as at December 1976 was 144.9, down  from

a  peak  of 150 in February 1975. Its base period  is

November  1972.  By coincidence, the  National  Wages

Council  made  its first promulgation  in  1972.  The

recommended  wage  increase  of  8%  for  that  year.

however, will be ignored by us in our calculations so

that we have a common base



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>



year  of  1972. In 1973 the NWC award was  9%,  with

certain offsettings. In 1974, the recommended  annual

increment  was $40 plus 6% pIus annual  increment  or

$40  plus 10% for those without annual increment. Let

us  assume an average increase of 15% for that  year.

to be on the generous side. In 1975 the NWC increment

was  6%  and  in 1976 7%. The employee's  salary  is,

therefore, being raised by 42% from 1972 to 1976,  on

a compounded basis. This is less than the increase of

45%  in  the Consumer Price Index. Thus, real  income

has  actually fallen by 2.1% despite the  passage  of

time and NWC increments and despite the growth in per

capita GDP.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us examine the effects of inflation and

the  NWC  increase on taxes. I have prepared a  table

based  on three income levels: Case A refers  to  the

lower  income  group with a monthly salary  of  $500;

Case  B is for the middle income group with a monthly

salary of $1,500; and Case C the higher income  group

earning a monthly salary of $4,000. These are  income

levels  in  1972,  our base year. Sir,  I  shall  not

bother the House with the details of the calculations

which I shall attach as an Appendix* to my speech  for

purpose  of recording in the Hansard, but  only  give

the  results of the analysis. On the basis of a four-member  family and the personal reliefs  as  allowed, and  adjusting the 1976 incomes of these three groups (the 1976 income has been increased by 42% from 1972)

to income at 1972 prices, we find that while monetary

income  has grown by 42%, disposable income  in  real

terms  (income after tax at 1972 prices) has actually

decreased  by 3.5% for Case A, 6.8% for  Case  B  and

11.8%  for Case C as opposed to a fall of 2.1% before

tax.  The average tax rate for the three cases,  i.e.

tax  payable  as a percentage of income, has  jumped

from  a  negligible 0.03% to 1 .5% for  Case  A,  the

lower  income group, from 5.4% to 10.1% for  Case  B,

the middle income group, and 19.9% to 27.9% for Case

C,  the higher income group. But now, let me give you

the  real  shocker.  In current  prices, income  has

increased by 42% in the four-year



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1977/19770314/19770314-HA-0360907.pdf"">APPENDIX - COMPARISON OF TAX LIABILITIES AND DISPOSABLE INCOME BETWEEN 1972 AND 1976 (Cols. 907 - 908)</a><br>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>



period  1972 to 1976, but tax liability has increased

by 99% for Case C, 165% for Case B and 6950% for Case

A!  Sir,  I  have talked of current prices  and  real

income but in truth I am not a "real" economist. That

distinction belongs to my better qualified colleagues

from the other side of the House, but when the taxman

bites I can feel real pain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would not have been so

painstaking  in trying to quantify the taxman's  bite

but  for  an ominous note in page 2 of the Memorandum

on the Main and Development Estimates of Singapore. I

quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In FY 76 income tax collections are expected to

reach  $1,200.0 million which represents a growth  of

only  34%  over the actual receipts for the  previous

financial year. The current growth rate is by far the

lowest  since  FY  71  when the growth  rates  ranged

between 24.3 to 52.8%. The present low growth rate is

largely  attributable to the slow economic growth  in

the  preceding  year. Also, several  tax  concessions

have   been  granted  recently  but  tax  rates  have

remained unchanged for some years.'



<br><br>I repeat, "tax rates have remained unchanged for some

years."  Sir,  before our tax boys get any  ideas,  I

submit that tax rates must not be changed upwards  in

the  next  few years so long as the Minister  expects

inflation  to take place at about 5-6% per annum, as

he informed us on 24th February.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have cautioned earlier in the debate on the

President's Address that whilst inflation may be good

for  the  businessman, it can crush the poor and  the

salaried  workers. I repeat that warning. The  severe

beating  taxpayers have been given despite a rise  in

monetary   income  is  because  inflation   increases

monetary  earnings  and forces it  upwards  into  the

higher  tax  brackets  of  a progressive  income  tax

structure. I have already demonstrated its disastrous

effect on both the lower income and the higher income

groups.  We  have  seen that the  biggest  percentage

increase in tax liability comes at the lower  end  of

the   income   scale,   while   the   tax-bite   gets

progressively  bigger  with  income  increases.   The

distribution  of  tax  burden by  income  classes  as

originally  envisaged is, therefore, altered  in  the

process of inflationary increases in income with

`See Appendix II, cols 907-8



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>



unchanged tax rates and personal reliefs. I wonder if

the Minister for Finance is aware of this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the underlying assumption of a progressive tax

structure  is  constancy in the purchasing  power  of

money.  If  the  purchasing power  of  money  changes

rapidly, the tax structure and personal reliefs  must

be  reviewed.  I am not asking at this  stage  for  a

lowering of tax rates as Government must raise enough

revenue  to  finance  its  ordinary  and  development

expenditures, besides having to build up reserves for

a rainy day. Like the Member for Jalan Kayu, all I am

asking  is that a thorough review be carried  out  to

assess the damaging work of the unseen, unwelcome and

unfeeling tax-man

-  inflation - and to find a solution to counter  it.

With due respect to the Minister for Finance, I think

all  of  us tax-payers have been diddled, not by  the

Minister, but by inflation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me ask, Sir, have we built a case for personal

reliefs to be increased by, say, $1,000? I submit  we

have if the quantum of personal reliefs as originally

allowed  in 1 948 is intended to apply in real  terms

to  today's  living environment. Some countries  like

Canada  have  introduced  indexation  to  income  tax

reliefs   to   ensure  that  these   reliefs   remain

meaningful when cost of living goes up. I suggest the

Ministry of Finance study this possibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me briefly buttress our argument for a tax

rebate  - for that is what it is if personal  reliefs

are   increased   -  with  economic  arguments.   The

Government  has vowed to make the economy  grow  fast

again,  at  least 6-8% in real terms. The  Government

has also emphasized the desirability of keeping costs

down, including wages. First, if personal reliefs are

increased  by  $1,000, the tax loss to Government  is

$26 million, By the same token, the money pumped into

the  economy  is  $26 million, assuming  this  entire

amount  is spent by the recipients. This should  help

to  stimulate the economy. With economic growth,  the

tax collections should increase



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>



and hence the ultimate tax loss to Government will be

less  than $26 million. The tax rebate of $26 million

will  not  be inflationary as we are an open economy.

It is instead expansionary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, to the individuals it is real disposable

income  that matters, not salary, not even  take-home

pay.  If the real disposable income is inadequate  to

sustain  a  minimum expected level of  living,  there

will  be  pressure by employees to have  their  wages

increased.  Tax is an important element of  cost.  So

long as the Government can afford it, it is better to

have  as  low  a  tax rate as possible  so  that  the

overall  wage  required by an employee  will  not  be

artificially pushed up. It is better to  give  a  tax

rebate, assuming Government can afford it, and have a

lower  NWC  annual  increase for  the  taxpayers  who

benefit from such a rebate, than to give a higher NWC

annual  increase in order to achieve  the  same  real

disposable  income. The end result  is  lower  labour

costs with the same real purchasing power after tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads us to the final tantalizing question.

Can the Government afford to give away $26 million? I

shall  leave it to the Minister for Finance to answer

the question!



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir.

this  year again we see a near painless budget  being

introduced by the Finance Minister. My repeating this

is  necessary, although it may sound like a "cliche",

when  other countries of the world are suffering from

inflation and introducing taxes that cut deeply  into

the   wage-earners  pocket,  we  have  overcome  this

problem through an efficient, honest Government,  and

an industrious people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although only two existing taxes have been

increased  slightly, they are justified in the  light

of the four tax concessions that are being introduced

The tax increases are meant to lessen the cost of our

development  expenditure and they  are  non-essential

items which will cost only a little extra for a booze

or a puff.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concession in estate duty and the concession on

tax  for  pensioners are long overdue, Home ownership

will  become a practical reality and not a source  of

worry   to   a   family  that  suddenly   loses   its

breadwinner.   Pensioners  will  sigh  with   relief.

considering  that  too  many  of  them  have  seen  a

continuous erosion of their pension through inflation

in commodity prices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax concession on earnings from the Asian

Dollar  Market operations and on reinsurance business

will  further  strengthen Singapore  as  a  financial

centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this modest budget is the result of the

diligence  and  excellent  planning  of  our  Finance

Minister, however, we must thank our lucky stars that

the world has not suffered too much from inflation in

1  976. We should keep our fingers crossed and may we

offer prayers and hope that the present dispute among

the  OPEC countries will not result in another  world

recession. The people of Singapore appreciate a great

deal   the  Government's  anti-profiteering  measures

which  have controlled commodity prices a great deal.

However,   continuous  vigilance  is   necessary   as

profiteering  elements are only  waiting  to  make  a

quick buck, given the slightest opportunity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are getting the tourists that we badly

need. However, I wonder whether the infrastructure is

ready  to  meet  this influx of tourists.  Too  often

there  have been complaints from tourists about  poor

taxi  services  at  the airport, poor  bus  transport

system for tours offered by tour companies and, worst

of   all, cheating   by  some  taxi   drivers   and

shopkeepers. What measures are being taken to control

these  anti-social elements who bring a bad name  for

Singapore?  It must not be forgotten that tourism  is

an important source of foreign exchange.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is good to hear that Singapore will probably

become  a convention centre. However, there seems  to

be  little  liaison among the hotels to  ensure  that

convention business is evenly distributed among them.

In  developing tourism and encouraging  tourists,  we

notice that quite often the local



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>



people  are forgotten in the use of facilities  meant

for tourists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to the forecast, Singapore's

performance will be slowed down this year because  of

external circumstances. However, we too can adjust to

these circumstances by conserving our expenditure  in

certain   fields.  There  is  too  much  wastage   in

personnel,   material  and   energy   in   too   many

departments. For example, street lighting is  changed

too often because of modification, alterations, etc.,

wastage   in   stationery  because   of   unnecessary

correspondence, and too many persons doing  a  simple

job  such as installing a gas cooker in a home,  etc.

All this and many more can be trimmed. Let us cut our

coat according to our cloth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has been considered a brain centre.

We  train  people for the various services.  But,  of

late, in  the last few years particularly,  we  have

seen too many people migrating to other countries. We

will  be like the proverbial ostrich that buries  its

head in the sand if we just say "Good riddance to bad

rubbish".  Have we found the root cause of migration?

Not  all of them migrate because the grass is greener

on  the  other  side.  Do people  with  the  "brains"

migrate because of our educational system, or  is  it

because  of  job dissatisfaction, or  is  it  because

financially the jobs are non-remunerative, or  is  it

because  they  have  been by-passed  in  a  promotion

exercise by persons who should not have been there in

the  first  place? Let us find the causes and  remedy

the situation so as to retain our brains here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of late, there has been a lot of communist

infiltration in Singapore through their  lackeys.  No

doubt the ISD is doing a good job tracking down these

traitors in Singapore. But then the work of  the  ISD

could  be supplemented by a "Board" which could check

infiltration by communist agents, particularly in the

Army,  the schools and the tertiary institutions.  No

doubt  a  few  have been exposed, but  then, like  a

cancerous  growth, there are many who have  not  been

apprehended yet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to a matter relating to Finance, I wish to

bring to the attention of this House



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>



the  poor telephone service in Government departments

and   statutory   boards.   Many   departments   have

antiquated   switch-boards,  and  it  is  practically

impossible to telephone through. Most of the time  we

find  that no one answers the call. In the  world  of

business, time is money. To a businessman who  cannot

telephone  through to a Government  department  means

time  wasted  and  money lost.  It  is  time  we  did

something  to this part of the service,  although  we

may  be  proud of our 374,000 lines. A serious  study

should  be  made to rectify this anomaly,  either  to

increase  the staff, equipment or lines, whatever  it

may be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, rewards to efficient workers are commendable.

How  is  productivity measured at  present?  Has  the

National  Productivity Board drawn up  guidelines  on

the output per worker in industries? The lower income

group workers, particularly the daily rated, find  it

extremely   difficult   to   meet   their   expenses.

Productivity-wise, some of the output of  the  daily-rated  workers  is greater than the factory  workers.

Vet  the factory workers may get more for less effort

done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the civil servant, promotions are based on

merit and not on allocated grades of appointment.  It

is  a  wise  move, but what safeguards are there  for

aspiring   civil  servants  who  cannot  be  promoted

because  of  their  superior's  attitudes  or   bias?

Unfortunately some civil servants have been in acting

posts  for  too long, and they gain neither financial

remuneration nor peace of mind, for they do not  know

whether they will be promoted or even demoted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the civil service the idea of reduced-leave

allowance  was introduced more or less  to  help  the

officer whose annual leave was forfeited because of a

need  for  their  valuable services  in  the  office.

However, what the Finance Ministry has done to retain

the  service of civil servants is being undone by the

Ministry of Defence by its compulsory annual  in-camp

training   of  officers  in  the  national   service.

Valuable manpower is lost during these annual in-camp

training

sessions, and sometimes the absence of a badly needed

officer can upset work in an office and bring about a

chain  reaction  of  indecisions. Precious  time  and

money  is  lost through badly organised and conducted

in-camp training sessions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our civil service is commendably efficient.

That  is the view of the general public of Singapore.

Unfortunately there are some black sheep in the civil

service who through their actions bring disrepute  to

the   departments   concerned  and   thereby   create

frustrations to the public at large.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although courtesy is a by-word, there are some who

show  courtesy  without intending  to  be  courteous.

Casting commands and unsmiling faces of officers  who

deal  with  the  public  bring  about  a  picture  of

authority  without  humanity. The  human  element  of

sympathy  and politeness is missing in  a  number  of

civil  servants  who  have daily  dealings  with  the

public,  and  above all in dealings among themselves.

Perhaps a campaign "Courtesy begets courtesy"  should

be introduced in the civil service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is pointless to point out the efficiency of our

civil  service if our civil servants end up as  clock

watchers. In most departments the staff do not  serve

the public beyond the stipulated times. Travelling in

Singapore  roads  is not easy. It  is  time-consuming

and,  therefore,  when a person has  travelled  miles

just  to  pay  a  fee to a particular office  is  not

served when he is only 30 seconds late, shows a  lack

of   humanity  by  the  department.  It  only   earns

disrepute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since those above 60 years of age, forming

6.6% of the population, are people who are likely  to

get   unwell  more  often  due  to  the  degenerating

process, it is time we considered the plight of these

people.  Our  hospital charges are not  low  to  this

group of people. Most of them are not well off. Could

not  a  reduced rate of fees be introduced  to  these

people,  so  that their meagre earnings will  not  be

eaten away by hospital charges?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a picture of efficiency, neatness, and honesty

in  the civil service could be extended further. Some

departments of the same



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>



ministry are scattered all over the island. These can

be   centralised, thereby  reducing  the   manpower.

Furthermore,  the  buildings of some  Ministries  and

Government  departments could be  "touched"  up.  The

Health Ministry in Palmer Road, which is supposed  to

care  after  the  sick, is an  example  of  a  sickly

looking building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it is the hope of the people of Singapore

that  our  wise  Finance Minister  will  continue  to

introduce  future budgets with less pain and  no  new

taxes.  Let  us  ride  the waves  of  "turbulence  in

international  economy" smoothly and comfortably,  as

the people have shown their faith in a PAP Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, Sir, a Tamil poet who wrote a poem which

reads

<pre>

    lyarralum Eattalum Kathalum

    Katha Vakuthalum Vallathu Arasu

</pre>

<br><br>This  most  famous poet wrote this poem  2,000  years

ago,  on how to run the government. The poem contains

two lines only, but the explanation may take one full

page. The translation is:

<pre>

   To explore better ways for revenue,

   To save and safeguard the same,

   And to spend it wisely,

   Is the duty of the government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the effectiveness and soundness of  the

Finance  Minister's  overall  economic  policies  and

planning as set out in the Budget Estimates  for  the

coming  fiscal year is clear. The economic  programme

for  the next fiscal year, after all, is an extension

of  the  Economic Strategy Programme for the  1970's,

announced by him in this House some five years ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past five years is now part of history, but it

is  a  history that bears eloquent testimony  to  the

correctness  and  soundness  of  our  approaches   in

economic  planning and development. We have withstood

the  ravages of severe world economic crises, and our

GNP indicators show a modest economic growth, despite

those crises.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have noticed, however, that although more and

more  emphasis  is  correctly  being  given  to   our

manpower  development programmes for the training  of

our  younger workers to gain more specialised skills,

no  mention is made of any attempt to tap and develop

the fairly large reservoir of the unskilled and semi-skilled labour force in Singapore. Attempts were made

in the past to tap the substantial women labour force

in  the  housing  estates, etc.,  but  I  wonder  how

successful  these  attempts  have  been.  There   are

thousands  of  unemployed Singaporeans still  on  the

Employment  Register,  and  in  addition,  there  are

thousands  of  others  not on the  Labour  Ministry's

Employment  Register. All of them, whether officially

registered  as  unemployed or not, are  actively  and

desperately  seeking jobs so that they  can  maintain

their  families. Putting the blame on the job-seekers

and accusing them of being choosy may be a convenient

and  neat  way  of  dismissing any  discussion  on  a

troublesome issue; but we have still to live with the

problem  of  the unemployed in our midst. True,  some

unemployed  deservedly bear the blame  for  rejecting

jobs offered to them. But there are also those who do

not get any offer of jobs. These are the persons that

factories and companies will reject outright in their

labour  recruitment. These are persons who are  above

the age of 40 years and who may be illiterate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are a large number of

workers who constituted part of the workforce  20  or

more   years  ago.  These  persons  came   into   the

employment  market in an era where there  was  little

industrialisation   in   Singapore   and   when   the

requirements  were  the artisan or  the  semi-skilled

worker.  They  were the products of  our  educational

system  at  that  time  and for  various  social  and

economic reasons they had to leave school at an early

age  and take up employment either as apprentices  or

as  unskilled labour. The demand for skilled  workers

at  that  point of time was very limited and so  they

had  no alternative but to go to work at a very young

age.   In   addition,   there  was   practically   no

opportunity  for  them  to  pursue  higher  education

because they came from poor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>



families  and  at  that time there  was  little  free

education  or scholarships to enable them  to  pursue

higher    skills.   Their   technical   or   academic

qualifications,  therefore, were very  low  but  they

fulfilled the need at that time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last 17 years, as Singapore industrialised,

new  skills  were required and the tendency  is  that

higher standards of academic performance are required

from  applicants  aspiring to  train  in  the  skills

required   for   our   industry,  especially   higher

technology industries. Therefore, this large pool  of

workers are unable to find employment, although  many

of  them are quite efficient. If they are given  some

form of formal training to equip them with the skills

required for modern industry, they will do very  well

because they have gone through the hard times of  the

fifties  and  will  therefore  be  willing  to   work

assiduously for a living. It is very easy to  dismiss

them  and say that they are underqualified, but  they

were  qualified at a time when Singapore needed them.

And  they are now with us. Something, therefore,  has

to  be  done  to  equip  them  with  skills  to  find

employment especially as industry is crying for  more

skilled and dedicated workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not that these unfortunate

persons  are being choosy, but that the emphasis  has

been  placed on the new worker with a higher academic

standard.  It  is  not to say that  we  do  not  need

workers of higher educational standards, but there is

also a need and a place for these older workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers of certain establishments have imposed

unduly high or exacting requirements of applicants in

respect of qualifications or personal appearance,  or

both. Let me illustrate this with examples. Take  the

case of the hotel establishments in their recruitment

of  staff.  The  girls  they recruit  must  not  only

possess  certain minimum academic qualifications  but

they must also be tall and have a winsome smile, long

pretty  hair, and be able to charm the customers.  In

fact, they must have all the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>



attributes to induce the male customers to return  to

the  warm  and friendly atmosphere of the  respective

hotel  establishments. Even for  the  job  of  house-keeping  similar attributes, but only at  a  slightly

lower level, are also expected of the applicants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to my union source, a few years ago even

one  local hotel went as far as retrenching the older

female   employees  under  some  pretext  and   later

recruited younger girls to fill the jobs left  vacant

as  the  result of the retrenchment. So at once,  all

those  hardworking mothers, who are able to be house-keepers  in a hotel and who wish to supplement  their

family income by working, will find themselves out of

luck  if  they wish to seek the simple job of  house-keeper  in  a hotel, although they may be  much  more

efficient in view of their long experience  in  their

own homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even Government establishments are guilty of

adopting such a choosy attitude. At one time, to be a

car-park attendant, whose job is only a simple  thing

like  issuing a receipt, an applicant had to possess,

at  least a Secondary 2 qualification and be  between

18  and 25 years old. Luckily, through the efforts of

the  Ministry  of Labour, this excessive  stipulation

has  been  removed.  Now one needs  only  to  have  a

Primary 6 qualification and may even be over 30 years

of  age  to  be a car-park attendant.  I  can  go  on

listing  examples to show that employers have  become

choosy.  In  view  of the ease in  employing  certain

categories of foreign workers because of our  present

policy  on  the issue of work permits, employers  can

continue  to be choosy. But what happens to  many  of

the   Singaporeans,  who  are  less  endowed,  either

physically  or  academically?  Are  they  to   remain

forever at a disadvantage?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seriously doubt that we are doing enough or as

much  as  we  can  to  help the  unemployed  who  are

unskilled  and  semiskilled to get  jobs.  Obviously,

something more is needed than just registering  their

names  in  the  Employment  Register  of  the  Labour

Ministry  in the hope that employers will offer  them

jobs.  Services  such  as those  offered  by  private

employment agencies in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>



filtering    or    screening   out   unsuitable    or

inappropriate  applicants should be provided  by  the

Ministry.  Or  are  we  just  concentrating  on   the

training   of  more  persons  with  better   academic

qualifications or with highly specialised skills  and

catering  for the interest of such persons  only?  Is

there  an  overall  national  manpower  planning  and

development  programme?  Even  if  there  is,  is  it

effectively   and   efficiently   co-ordinated    and

centrally  directed? Or do we just leave the  various

ministries  and  institutions  to  go  on  in   their

separate and merry ways?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present moment, one gets the impression that

each  institution of higher learning has its own idea

of  what  courses it should provide, without any  due

consideration   to  our  overall  national   manpower

requirements. The Economic Development Board runs its

own   technical  training  programmes  together  with

certain multi-national companies. Then there  is  the

Industrial  Training Board with  a  separate  set  of

objectives   and  priorities.  Soon   the   Education

Ministry will introduce its own Junior Apprenticeship

Training  Scheme.  Even  the  MINDEF  joins  in  this

multiplicity of training schemes. I would, therefore.

like  to  enquire how many of these training  schemes

are  being  duplicated  and,  therefore,  causing  an

unnecessary   wastage  of  training  resources,   and

whether we are producing too many of one kind and too

little of another kind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be a matter of irrefutable, logical and

grave  importance  that,  in  a  small  island   like

Singapore where human power is the only resource,  we

should have a comprehensive and properly co-ordinated

manpower planning and development programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is imperative that we do not produce a surfeit

of highly skilled or specialised personnel and at the

same  time completely neglect the unskilled or  semi-skilled  unemployed. For in the end, we  may  not  be

able  to satisfy the heightened expectations  of  the

highly  skilled personnel or the basic desire of  the

unskilled for any jobs, with the result all  of  them

will be frustrated and demoralised,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is imperative that in our overall manpower

planning  and  development, the unskilled  and  semi-skilled  must be taken into account. In our situation

today, this is all the more important, since we must,

at  one time or the other, resolve the problem of the

unusually large number of work permit holders who may

pose  serious problems in political and social  terms

in time to come.



<br><br>4.11 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  in his financial statement on the 28th of  last

month,  the  Hon. Minister for Finance  made  a  very

significant conclusion to the effect that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`the weather is getting fine and fair and our Ship

of  State  is  in  good  shape.  The  command  should

therefore be "Steady as she goes."'



<br><br>As  a matter of fact, our Ship of State, the Republic

of  Singapore, has been moving steadily all the  time

as a result of our very steady helmsman and pragmatic

policies, and that is the reason for the social  and

economic  progress that we are making, as the  saying

goes.  "with  care a ship can sail for  ten  thousand

years".  With care and caution, the helmsman  of  our

Ship  of  State  will  be  able  to  weather  through

difficult  times  in  a turbulent  and  unpredictable

international situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the financial statement, the Minister did

not  mention any major tax increases. Instead he  has

offered   four   tax  concessions.  All   these   are

indications to show the soundness of our economy  and

this  should  increase  international  confidence  in

Singapore. To the people of Singapore, this is  again

a  mild  budget.  If  there are no  unreasonable  tax

increases or revision of tariffs in the course of the

year, I believe our people will be able to go through

another peaceful year comfortably.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the budget the Government has

provided a loan of $245.9 million for the Jurong Town

Corporation for the further development of Jurong and

other  industrial estates. Jurong has been  fortunate

enough to have been chosen for industrialisation  and

it  has  become  an internationally known  industrial

area in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>



Singapore.  This is an honour for the Jurong  people.

But  how  many  people realise the hardship  and  the

price  the  Jurong  people  have  to  pay  for   this

industrial  development? How many people realise  the

losses  and the inconvenience suffered by the  people

of   Jurong  in  the  course  and  as  a  result   of

industrialisation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, 10 private bus companies have finally

succeeded  to merge into one single bus  company  for

the  purpose  of  raising  efficiency  and  providing

better  services to the people. But in the Government

administration,   there  are   different   Government

departments  separately in charge of matters  of  the

same   nature.   For  example,  there   are   several

departments  involved  with  hawkers,  such  as   the

Hawkers'   Department   in  the   Ministry   of   the

Environment, the Housing and Development  Board,  the

Jurong  Town  Corporation and the Port  of  Singapore

Authority. Although the major policy may be the same,

the  manner  in  which  such policy  is  executed  or

implemented  may  be  different  from  department  to

department or from area to area. For example, in  the

same  area, department A is in charge of some hawkers

and  markets  and  department B in  charge  of  other

markets  and even department C in charge of yet  some

other  markets  or hawkers, with diverse  regulations

and  methods.  So  there  is no  consistency  in  the

implementation  of the same policy. As  a  result  of

this  inconsistency, there would be confusion or even

a feeling of discrimination. In the field of building

construction, we have the HDB, JTC and PSA, in charge

of  housing. The Housing Board is the largest housing

agency  in  Singapore, with a lot of experience  over

the  past decade. Other statutory boards cannot outdo

the  Housing  Board in terms of costing, professional

supervision or planning. If the 5-room flats in  Boon

Lay  Garden and Teban Garden were built by  the  HDB.

the price would not have been as high as $35,000.  It

might well be $30,000, as in the case of 5-room flats

built  by the H DB in other new towns. Again, if  the

flats  in Boon Lay Garden were not built by  the  JTC

but were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>



built  by  the HDB, then there would not be lifts  of

different   brands   from   different   manufacturers

resulting in frequent breakdowns, a shortage of spare

parts, and other maintenance problems. Again, if  the

JTC did not build the executive flats, then the flats

for the middle-income group would have been built  by

the  HUDC  and  the  purchasers in the  middle-income

group in Jurong would be able to use the CPF for  the

purchase of the flats, unlike the present where  they

are  not  allowed to use the CPF for the purchase  of

flats  built by JTC. This is a very unfair situation.

Because  of  this duplication and inconsistency,  the

people in Jurong have been deprived of their right to

use CPF funds to buy their own houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only this, a lot of land in Jurong is earmarked

for  development purposes. The matter of resettlement

is  in the hands of the Resettlement Department under

JTC, while the matter of adjudging who is a bona-fide

farmer and who is not, is not made by the JTC but  by

the Primary Production Department in the Ministry  of

National  Development. Because the Primary Production

Department  is  not  directly  concerned   with   the

development of the area, it takes its own sweet  time

to  establish who are the bona-fide farmers  and  who

are  not,  and because of the dispute in this  matter

the  development  plan is delayed. So  these  farmers

have  to stay put where they are. Last year, at  the

20th  km  Jurong  Road (now it comes under  Boon  Lay

constituency) some farmers had to stay put because of

the  delay. Then, because of the rainy season at that

time  there was flooding. They again suffered  losses

because  their livestock were drowned in the  floods.

Furthermore,  these people affected  by  resettlement

had  to  apply for shops and flats from  the  JTC  in

order  to be eligible for concessions. Otherwise,  if

they  apply  to  the HDB for such accommodation  they

will  be  treated like any other ordinary applicants.

There  are  sufficient residential flats  in  housing

estates  under JTC. But the problem is that there  is

an  inadequate supply of shophouses built by the  JTC

for  allocation  to  these  people  affected  by  the

resettlement schemes, thus causing a lot of problems.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether the Government will consider

unified control and management and do away with  this

duplication of duties and administration in order  to

raise  efficiency and avoid unnecessary problems  and

trouble. That is, all the hawkers' problems should be

centralised and dealt with by one central  authority,

the   Hawkers   Department;   resettlement   problems

similarly  handled  by  one  centralised  department;

industrial  problems for example, by  the  JTC,  and

housing  matters  by the HDB, We  are  talking  about

efficiency  of  the Government. We  should  not  have

unnecessary  waste  and  duplication  of  our   human

resources  and  efforts.  I hope  the  Minister  will

seriously consider these problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the financial policy of the Minister

for Finance.



<br><br>4.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin (Bedok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  to join my other colleagues in support  of  the

Budget Statement made by the Minister for Finance for

the financial year 1977-78.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues spoke in high praise. They were

greatly  impressed by the presentation of the  fiscal

policy which, on the whole, gives a rather optimistic

picture  of our economic prospects. All these  years,

the  Minister  for Finance's Budget  Statements  have

always been supported by facts and figures. This year

is  no exception. He has the Economic Survey to  back

him up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although I am not competent enough to give an

in-depth  analysis of the economic prospects  of  our

country. I would like to contribute some ideas by way

of  one or two observations. It is my hope that these

observations  and ideas would find  a  place  in  the

various aspects of planning and strategy to make  the

nation  an even better place to live in, to work  in,

and to conduct business in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, it is common knowledge that

Singapore's success story has been, and is to a  very

large extent, due to its political stability and  the

pragmatic leadership of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>



PAP  government, a government that has the  foresight

and  the  far-sightedness to  chart  troubled  waters

ahead, thereby enabling it to go through and overcome

the  many  stormy  seas lying  in  the  path  of  the

country's economic, social and political progress. We

have   been  able  to  take  positive  and  realistic

measures  that have helped us to come out  of  crisis

after  crisis in the recent past - the energy crisis,

inflation,  economic  recession,  etc.  -  relatively

unscathed. In spite of the many world-wide  problems,

Singapore   has  been  able  to  achieve  commendable

economic growth and development. In this respect, the

part played by our efficient civil service should not

be   overlooked.  The  civil  service  has  made  its

valuable contribution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is most heartening is the part played by

the  people of Singapore at large. We have been  able

to keep wage increases, for example, to proportionate

levels  so  that the situation would not get  out  of

hand,  thereby endangering the economic  position  of

the  country. This has been possible because  of  the

cooperation  of  the people of Singapore.  The  close

rapport the Government has been able to achieve  with

the people is, in many ways, the deciding factor. The

recent  General Elections, in which the  PAP  made  a

clean  sweep,  was ample testimony of the  confidence

and  the  rapport  existing. The Government  and  the

people, together, have proved Singapore's prophets of

doom  all wrong, all the way. Those who have  written

off  Singapore, those who have tried to  subvert  the

nation, those who have left the country because  they

thought  we were doomed to sink, are now all  red  in

the  face  with envy and embarrassment. These  people

are now having second thoughts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent disclosures and confessions of G. Raman

and  his  repentant  colleagues  are  examples.  They

wanted to put Singapore in bad light internationally.

They  wanted to discredit the country. They  did  not

want  to  see  the  nation  make  good,  prosper  and

progress.  They tried to subvert Singapore.  We  know

now  why  reputable publications, which  should  have

known better in the first place, like the Far Eastern

Economic  Review,  the Financial Times,  and  others,

were so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>



critical  of  Singapore. But  there  will  always  be

people like G. Raman and company who fall prey to the

evil designs and machinations of foreigners and Euro-communists bent on seeing the downfall of the PAP and

Singapore.  They  perpetrate  acts  which  are   both

treacherous  and  traitorous.  But  they   will   not

succeed.  They will not succeed simply  because  they

are  acting  against the interests of the  people  of

Singapore   as  a  whole,  their  well-being,   their

happiness, their future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future - what does it hold for us? A good one,

I  believe, if we together put our shoulders  to  the

wheel.  Looking at the prospects for the fiscal  year

1977-78,  as  strategically outlined by the  Minister

for   Finance,  there  appears  to  be   five   basic

objectives  -  namely, manpower development,  science

and    technology,   infrastructure,   taxation   and

promotion,  and  the measures to be  taken  by  major

industrialised countries to stimulate their economies

by   creating  more  employment.  In  this   context,

Singapore  can confidently look to the future  if  we

keep   the  present  momentum.  However,  Singapore's

future  is,  of course, not all a bed of roses.  With

higher  standards  of  living,  a  better  life,  and

greater  affluence,  there  will  be  problem  areas,

particularly  among  the younger  generation  of  the

population.  There will be changes in job  attitudes.

Expectations go higher each day. There  will  be  the

crave  for better life-styles. All this can  generate

and coagulate into one big social evil. But it can be

prevented.  Youth  tends to  be  restless,  and  this

restlessness must not at any time be ignored. In  our

eagerness and anxiety to achieve something, we  often

stumble and fall over the most obvious. Therein  lies

the  danger.  And  the young is one of  our  greatest

assets.  It  can  also turn out  to  be  one  of  our

greatest drawbacks, if we neglect it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young is a creature of many potentials and

paradoxes. It is the country's source of manpower. It

forms  the sinews of the nation. It forms the  future

leadership.   Yet  it  is  ever  so  susceptible   to

influences and distractions:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>



drugs,  crime,  political clutches, and  other  anti-social  and anti-national behaviour and conduct.  The

distracted youth can, collectively, become both a de-stablising  and a destructive force in  society.  But

accorded  the  correct channels of communication  and

constructive  activity, the young  is  undoubtedly  a

factor  in  the  nation's favour.  Given  avenues  of

expression  and performance areas that are  conducive

to  productive results, our youth can be the fountain

of life in Singapore's future. In short, youth has an

important role to play in the affairs of the  nation.

This  is amply demonstrated everywhere: where youth's

role  has  been positive, the results have been  most

constructive;  where its role has been negative,  the

consequences have been very destructive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this light, Sir, I would like to touch upon the

subject of youth in Singapore. What are we doing  for

these   young   people?  The  primary   establishment

responsible  for  the right answer to  this  question

appears  to  be  the  People's  Association.  It   is

acknowledged that the People's Association is doing a

good  job. But is it doing enough? That is  the  more

important question. It is noticed that in many of the

community   centres,   real   activity    is    often

conspicuously absent. They appear to be deserted most

of  the  time.  It will be interesting  to  know  the

actual  response,  both  in  terms  of  numbers   and

percentages,  to  programmes of activities  that  are

planned by community centres. We know that more  than

half  of  our population are under 21 years  of  age.

They form the core of our young. How many of them are

attracted  to the activities of the various community

centres  and  the People's Association? I  understand

the  figure  is  very small. Many activity-programmes

look   good  on  paper.  But  it  is  the  areas   of

performance, participation and production of  desired

results that really count. How and where do we  stand

in  this respect? It is a question worth pursuing  at

this  stage of the country's progress, because it  is

important that we take stock, assess and evaluate the

position, so that strength and weaknesses are brought

to  light. In this manner we can consolidate the good

and eliminate the bad.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question of youth is also directed to other

areas,  not  just  the People's Association.  Several

Ministries have close connection and association with

youth  and  youth  matters  too.  For  example,   the

Ministry  of  Education is in the forefront  in  this

regard.  The Ministry of Social Affairs, as  well  as

those  of Home Affairs, Defence, Culture and  Science

and  Technology, are all inextricably  involved  with

the young. No doubt there are all kinds of activities

going  on  in all these places; whether or  not  such

activities  are designed particularly  for  youth  is

another matter. Whether or not there is cohesion  and

proper planning and execution in these activities  is

another  question. Whether or not there is a  lot  of

unnecessary  duplication and therefore  manpower  and

time wastage is also worthwhile looking into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I am making. Sir, is whether or not the

question  of  co-ordination of youth  activities  has

crossed  the  minds  of the planners  and  programme-directors.  Perhaps  a  Department  of  Youth  or   a

Ministry  of  Youth would be the answer.  Admittedly,

this  is not a new suggestion, but it is a fresh call

for   more  thought  and  greater  concern.  The   co

ordination  of youth affairs and youth matters  is  a

vital  aspect of our growing society, a society which

is  wide  open to influences of all kinds,  Singapore

being  what  she  is  geographically,  socially   and

economically. As I have stated earlier on, correct co-ordination  and guidance of youth is  of  the  utmost

importance. The quality of our youth, its  mentality.

its  attitudes,  its responses, are  all  necessarily

aspects  of  society the leadership has  to  be  very

concerned  about.  "Today's  young  people  are   to-morrow's  leaders"  -that, as it may,  is  a  cliche.

Nevertheless,  a  cliche with  a  tremendous  lot  of

meaning and message in it. One misguided youth  is  a

problem.  A whole lot of misguided young people  will

be  disastrous. It is therefore imperative  that  we,

who  are  today's leaders, pay sufficient, and  more,

attention  to  this  vital question  of  guiding  and

inculcating  in  the  young,  correct  attitudes  and

responses through a concerted and co-ordinated  youth

programme,  allowing  at the same  time, avenues  of

expression  and  criticism, so  long  as  these  are

positive and constructive.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, in the final analysis, Sir, the battleground

lies in the mind. We have just seen abundant proof of

this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng San (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I support the 1977-78 financial  policy

of  the Government contained in a Motion moved by the

28th February, 1977.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the world economy is slowly recovering, it is

very correct for the Finance Minister to announce  in

his  Budget  for the new financial year  measures  to

increase  taxes on cigarettes and tobacco and  liquor

which  are consumer goods, not daily necessities.  In

the  field of technical and industrial training,  the

Government is emphasising the training of  skills  in

the   engineering   trades,  metal   machining,   and

fabrication  as  well  as  on  selected   fields   of

precision  engineering. This is a piece of good  news

to   our  workers,  because  through  industrial  and

technical training the skills of our workers will  be

raised  so  that  the products will be  of  a  better

quality.  This in turn will raise their  productivity

and  improve the workers' remuneration comparatively.

Because  of  this,  our workers with  better  skills,

increased productivity, and increased income will  be

able  to live a better life than before. On the other

hand,  because our products are of good  quality  and

with  increased  productivity, our products  will  be

able  to compete better in the international markets,

thus  stimulating our economic growth.  In  order  to

meet the needs of our commerce and industry for their

rapid growth the Government has allotted more land,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>



expand   communication  network  and  increased   our

electricity  capacity.  This  policy  will   directly

promote  our  economic growth and help to  solve  the

employment  problem of our people. In  the  meantime,

the   Government   is  allocating  land   for   civic

organisations,  such as churches, youth  associations

and  others  for them to build their headquarters  or

offices.  Trade  unions are also civic organisations.

They  have great responsibilities in respect  of  the

economic development of our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look back to 1968 when the British military

forces  planned  a  withdrawal  from  Singapore, our

economic prospect was then not at all optimistic  and

nobody  could  predict the fate that was  facing  us.

However,  under  the  able  leadership  of  the   PAP

Government  we  have  passed  and  overcome  many  an

economic  difficulty. In the interest of  the  nation

and  for  the  long-term interest of our workers,  at

that  time  our workers had resolutely taken  up  the

challenge  of  a patriotic mission and they  accepted

the Employment Act, 1968 and the Industrial Relations

(Amendment)   Act,  1968.  That   we   have   today's

prosperity  is  also  due to  the  workers'  resolute

action  taken then. Therefore, our workers have  made

indelible contributions towards our nation-building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, trade unions not only take part in

negotiations for working conditions and the  benefits

of  our  workers but also take part in  national  and

social activities. The National Trades Union Congress

has  resolutely  taken  up  the  task  of  organising

cooperative  supermarkets  in  order  to   curb   the

increasing  prices  of consumer goods.  In  order  to

respond  to the Government's call for more  women  to

engage  themselves in production work,  trade  unions

have also resolutely taken over or set up creches. In

order  to be more involved in social activities,  the

trade  unions  have  organised kindergartens,  health

centres,  issued  primary, secondary  and  university

scholarships to children of union members,  sponsored

family  planning courses, organised various  cultural

and recreational activities, actively promoted sports

activities, visited



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>



homes   for  the  aged  and  taken  part   in   blood

transfusion, and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, in order to support the National

Wages  Council's recommendations, trade  unions  have

actively  set up productivity committees under  their

branch  unions to increase productivity. This  is  in

keeping with the national policy. In order to support

the   Ministry  of  Labour's  effort  in   preventing

industrial accidents, trade unions have also actively

set  up industrial health and safety committees under

their branch unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these facts enumerated above have demonstrated

the  contributions made by trade unions in our social

progress and economic development. Therefore. I  hope

the  Government will also consider allowing the trade

unions  to  purchase industrial land to  build  trade

union  houses to serve our workers. When  any  worker

meets  with any difficulty, he could promptly  go  to

the  union  for  consultation. I also hope  that  the

Government  will also consider providing recreational

and  sports facilities around trade union  houses  so

that  our  workers can take part in these  activities

after work.



<br><br>5.07 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I believe the Chinese have  a  saying

which   goes   something  like   this:   One   year's

preparation  is  done  in  the  spring,   one   day's

preparation is done early in the morning.  () (Yi nian zhi ji zai wu chun, yi ri zhi

ji zai wu chen.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) Hen hao! (good)



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) Xie xie ni. (Thank you) Now

this  quality  of foresight, of forward  preparation,

has  always  characterised  the  style  and  planning

behaviour   of  our  Government,  and   the   Finance

Minister's  latest Budget statement  merely  marks  a

continuation of this principle of early planning  for

the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, one thing that has excited my attention is

a certain subtle feature of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>



diction  in  the  budget address. It  is  that  while

previously the Finance Minister has talked of policy,

and   the   word   policy  has  occurred   frequently

previously, in this year's Budget statement there  is

a greater resort to the use of the term strategy. The

word  strategy has been used at least six  times  and

the Minister has even used the word tactics once. The

Finance  Minister is far from being a bellicose  sort

of  person but the military aspect of his diction has

induced  me to look up Sun Tzu's Art of War.  In  the

popular  translation by Samuel Griffith, by a strange

coincidence, the first chapter of the Art of  War  is

headed `Estimates'. Another version translates (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) (ji

pian)  as  Essay  or Chapter on `Deliberation'.  Both

headings,  Estimates or Deliberation, are appropriate

to  describe the Minister's Budget statement. But let

us  take  Sun Tzu's `Estimates' and consider what  he

says  in  this  first chapter about five  fundamental

factors on which `Estimates' or `Deliberation' should

be  based. These are, firstly, the moral influence or

moral cause, (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) (dao); secondly, the weather or

climatic conditions, (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) (tian), thirdly, the terrain

or terrestrial conditions (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) (di), fourthly,

command or generalship of commanders, (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) (jiang); and

fifthly, doctrine or organisation and discipline, (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)(fa). Let us apply these conditions to what our Finance Minister has done in his Budget statement,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will have to say a little more on the first

factor, moral influence, later, but in terms  of  the

second factor, climatic conditions, the Minister  has

said  the  weather is getting fair and  our  Ship  of

State  is  in  good state: "steady as she  goes."  In

terms   of   the  second  factor,  the   terrain   or

terrestrial conditions, the terrain may be rugged but

we  have also the Minister's own five basic programme

objectives to help traverse this terrain, namely, his

programme   related   to   manpower,   science    and

technology,  infrastructure, taxation and  promotion.

And  of  course the strategy will be a very  flexible

one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the fourth factor, generalship, Sun

Tzu,  when he talks of command, says he means by this

the general's qualities of wisdom, faith, compassion,

courage and strictness. Our general in charge of  our

financial strategy has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>



all these qualities. He is wise, he is a man of faith

-  he  is  one of the 10% who are Catholics  in  this

House. His budget has continually good indications of

compassion.  For example, with effect from  the  1976

year  of  assessment, the earned  income  relief  was

increased  from $1,000 to $2,000 for  those  over  55

years  old  and $3,000 for those over 60  years  old.

This  year  the tax concession with regard to  estate

duty  and  also the other concession with  regard  to

pensioners paying income tax also show that he  is  a

man  of  compassion. Where courage and discipline  or

rigour  are  concerned, anybody  who  has  been  made

Finance    Minister    by   our   Government    would

automatically  have these virtues:  as  the  Minister

himself has shown in the rigour with which he imposed

the  well-known and well-felt car taxes announced  on

1st January, 1976



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the last factor, namely organisation and

control, assignment of appropriate ranks to officers,

is  concerned,  the  Minister has  touched  on  civil

service  expenditure, in respect of which he promises

rigorous  pruning, and on the development of  quality

of  our  managerial and executive grades. From  these

general  guidelines  we can see that  there  is  able

direction in the battle for economic development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me take up more particularly, and more

seriously,  the  first of Sun Tzu's five  fundamental

factors - the one I merely mentioned, but did not say

more  about, namely - moral influence or moral cause.

And this, Sun Tzu says (and I quote from the Griffith translation): "By moral influence, I mean that  which

causes the people to be in harmony with their leaders

...".  And  it  is  the  necessity  for  harmony   in

different  segments of our society  that  I  want  to

stress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently the Deputy Prime Minister stated that

[Straits Times, 28th February, 1977]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Government had provided the masses with the best

safeguard   against   communist  revolution   through

continuous economic development'



<br><br>This development would not have been possible without

the  harmonious  relationship between the  Government

and  the  people.  This harmony has to  be  cherished

because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>



recent   events   have  shown  that  occasions   will

continually   arise  wherein  we  will  find   people

continually  plotting to injure this same  harmonious

association or communication,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very latest instance has related to the

disclosures about "black operations" that  have  been

aimed   at  spoiling  the  good  reputation  of   the

leadership in the people's eyes. This instance is all

the   more  significant  in  view  of  some   special

circumstances I would like to refer to. Sir, I was  a

member  of  a parliamentary delegation which  visited

Malaysia last year. The welcome we received was  most

cordial  indeed, and we felt that everywhere we  went

we  were  greeted by warm and sincere expressions  of

friendship,   including  those  of   the   very   top

leadership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet within the `very setting where there was

sincere  recognition of basic identity  of  interests

especially  in  matters concerning security  and  the

development   of   ASEAN,  there  have   been   found

individuals who have been accused of such plotting as

would, if successful, have spoilt the harmony between

our  people  and our leaders, subverted intellectuals

and  students, and  finally affected  adversely  our

economic development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on this point of security, it is good to

point  out  that the relationship, in  good  balance,

between the leadership and the people has resulted in

a  rather  special political situation. We have  been

one  party in Parliament for nearly ten years through

three  successive elections. And throughout all  that

time  we  have  continued  to  plan  for  Singapore's

successful development in the way the present  budget

also  shows.  I am sure that it is much more  than  a

coincidence  that our best development,  and  control

over this development, took place when the Government

party was in full possession of all the seats in this

House. I think it is more than a coincidence that  it

has happened this way. Therefore, it might not be out

of  place to remark that for the time being at least,

a  so-called  parliamentary opposition is  irrelevant

for our continued development. The real



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>



opposition  walked out of this House some  time  ago,

because  it was not the Government party they  wanted

and  still want to do in, but Singapore itself.  They

talk   of   a   unitary  state  of  Malaya  including

Singapore.  And the so-called would-be  parliamentary

opposition  plays footsies with such and other  anti-national elements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall, therefore, have to be on a constant alert

to  promote  and  foster harmony in our  society,  to

ensure  development. When we talk of  development  we

cannot   separate  the  human,  cultural,   spiritual

aspects  of development from the material. The  whole

purpose    of   development   -   improved   economic

conditions, more and better jobs, enhanced quality of

the  environment  - is the betterment  of  the  human

condition, the total human condition. In Singapore it

is quite in order to point out that man does not live

on  bread alone. He has bread in the vast majority of

cases   and  even  circuses  - witness  the   football

enthusiasm  at  the  National  Stadium.   To   ensure

development,  to make sure our people  enjoy  a  good

life,  we  must  also see to the importance  of  good

communication  between  Singaporeans,  for  what   is

suggested  by  "moral  influence"  and  "harmony"  is

brought about by good communication.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have deliberately used the term "good

communication"  because just as material  development

depends   on  good  communication  such   as   roads,

telephone and radio communication, ships, aeroplanes,

radar,  satellites  and  so on,  the  development  of

people  as  rooted,  civilised, cultured  and  humane

depends  also on communication of another  kind.  And

this  communication may be described in the sense  of

the  Christian,  St.  Paul's  injunction  that  "Evil

communications corrupt good manners", or in the sense

of  "propriety" in Chinese tradition,  but  it  deals

with  consideration and human relations, and in  fact

is the criterion of such relations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japan is a fine example of how the acquisition of

modern material means of communication did not affect

Japanese society with a shudder, because a lot of the

traditional forms of communication were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>



preserved and, in fact, used to cushion the shock  of

assimilating   the  new  and  impersonal   means   of

communication, It does seem ironic that Singapore  is

one   of  the  world's  most  important  centres   of

communication,  and yet communication between  people

in  the  sense of regard, consideration,  concern,  a

sense of identity has yet to be profoundly instilled.

In   Japan, the   very  network  of   interpersonal

communications traditionally developed and  supported

has  contributed to Japan's growth as an economically

powerful state, despite the fact that there has  been

some erosion of traditional values as a result of the

impact of modernisation. In Japan, you still find the

relationship   between  worker  and   employer   very

personal  and bound by ties of loyalty and  pride  of

identification with the company. There still prevails

a  kind  of  industrial morality which  frowns  on  a

worker (whatever the level of his education, training

and  expertise) moving from one employer to  another.

The  quality control movement, depending so  much  on

cooperation   (i.e, good   communication)   between

workers,  has taken such a root in Japanese  industry

that  they  are even able to strive after  what  they

call ZD, namely Zero Defect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to improve our sense of communication, and

we  cannot  find a better place to start setting  the

example  of  good  communication than  in  Parliament

House itself in this very debating Chamber.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the debate on the President's address was very

lively  indeed.  Much  heat was generated  and  light

thrown on several matters. Disagreements, where  they

occurred,  were  sometimes  vehement.  I  hope   such

conditions  will  continue  to  prevail, during  the

Budget debate and after. So what, if we sometimes  do

not  agree  with  one another. I remember  reading  a

remark  by  a  person  called  Wrigley  (probably  of

chewing  gum fame) to the effect that in a  business,

if  two  people always agreed, then one of  them  was

redundant.  So,  in  Parliament,  we  must  agree  to

disagree.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, whatever the new styles we may want to

adopt  in our own Parliament, for it is correct  that

we should not merely imitate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>



the  Westminster  model of behaviour  of  Members  of

Parliament;  whatever Standing Orders we change,  for

they may in certain instances bear changing, we could

certainly  set  an example of harmony (or  the  moral

influence  of  Sun  Tzu or the good  communication  I

spoke  of  just now) if we tried to bear  in  mind  a

certain dictum of Confucius.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My eponymous - this word means `same name'.

Actually  it  was the Member for Kampong  Chai  Chee

who   gave   the  name  to  me.  My  eponymous   and

infinitely  more illustrious predecessor  said  -



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture and Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Science and Technology (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Ancestor,



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> No, not ancestor, but

predecessor.  "Respectfulness without  the  rules  of

propriety   becomes  laborious  bustle, carefulness

without  the  rules  of propriety  becomes  timidity;

boldness  without  the  rules  of  propriety  becomes

insubordination  (or  disorder);  straightforwardness

without  the rules of propriety becomes rudeness."  I

shall try to read it in Chinese, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;() Gong er wu li, ze lao

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;() Shen er wu li, ze xi

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;() Yong er wu li, ze luan

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;() Zhi er wu li, ze jiao



<br><br>Since  some of these words have very ancient meaning,

I  am sure some of the Members of this House did  not

understand them!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having ensured good communication in Parliament.

what  can  we do. Sir, to encourage the growth  among

Singaporeans of a sense of identity with  people  and

place?  I  think  we have to keep  worrying  at  this

question. We certainly do not know what is  going  to

happen - exactly. But we most certainly also have  to

think of decisions to make about what interactions we

can   contrive   to  enlarge  our  understanding   of

ourselves  as Singaporeans: We have to make decisions

beyond  those we have taken; such decisions  that  we

have  taken like our language policy which the  Prime

Minister  elaborated  on in his marathon  speech, or

like our stress on returns to effort and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>



contribution,  or like our subscription  to  economic

growth  as the basis for social development, or  like

we  say,  "We  want to have friendly  relations  with

communist  countries but internally communism  is  an

incompatible   ideology   where   our   society    is

concerned". These decisions we have made. But we have

got  to  go beyond. We have got to think of decisions

beyond those which we have already made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to face the fact that perhaps we have to

take   decisions  about  matters  where   areas   of

ambiguity are larger than what we have tolerated  in

the  past.  In the area of economic development,  so

many  inputs  are  quantifiable.  In  the  area   of

development   of   nationhood  -  there   are   many

imponderables.  But  there are indicators  which  we

may  take as possibly lighting up the path we  might

follow.  For  example, we should try  in  every  way

possible  and  as  repeatedly as  possible  to  draw

attention   to   significant  common  and   familiar

things,  multiplying  (so  to  speak)  occasions  of

common   reference.  What  are  these   common   and

familiar  reference  points?  For  one,  there   are

places  and  people. In some cities,  walking  along

sightseeing,  one comes across a small  monument  or

even   a   plaque  which  tells  of  a   significant

happening  connected with the place commemorated  in

such   a   simple   way.  Recently  I   incidentally

suggested  to  the  Minister for  Culture  that  the Victoria  Memorial  Hall could be restructured  into quite a good concert hall. He jokingly replied  that

we  should  not  change -



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> It was solemn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Seriously or jokingly, well, maybe he

will  tell  us  later. He jokingly  replied  that  we

should  not  change  the shape  of  such  a  national

monument  as  it  was there that  the  PAP  held  its

inaugural meeting and thus saw its coming into being.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it may happen that one day the people of

Singapore   may   want  to  commemorate   the   PAP's

contribution to Singapore's construction - be that as

it  may,  there are many places and events  which  it

would be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>



useful to commend to the attention and memory of  the

people, in a more thoughtful way - in such a  way  as

to  make the people realise that there is much in our

past to remember and ponder over. The Monuments Board

should be given every support if it can help in  this

task.  But  I can recall off-hand one or  two  places

like,  for example, the location in Bukit Timah where

our  own  boys, already Singaporeans, gave  up  their

lives defending this sector against the Japanese when

they  invaded Singapore. Other places may  relate  to

recollections  of  cultural  or  earlier   historical

significance.  Both  where  people  and  places   are

concerned,  the  Member for Ulu  Pandan  has  already

recommended  the kind of references  we  should  make

those  in  our  schools familiar with.  But  I  think

programmes interestingly produced for the mass  media

should be considered for the general education of our

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also consider the record of events that

have   occurred  more  recently.  As   the   Foreign Minister  has pointed out last week in  this  House,

the  revelations  we have been given  regarding  the

latest  black operations should be seen as  salutary

education  for our own people and for ourselves.  We

can  see  more and more how the communists  operate.

This  is what is happening today. But our leadership

have  been  involved in the fight for  the  span  of

about  a  generation.  Their  experience  should  be

recorded and made more widely known. How many  know,

to  refer only to one example, what an exciting  and

interesting  story  our  Minister  for  Culture  can

tell. I have been having some conversation with  him

a  little bit more frequently recently, Sir. What an

exciting  and  interesting story  our  Minister  for

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Culture can tell about his involvement as a

communist  activist for a period until  he  -



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Underground!



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> - on his own accord, broke away from

the  communists. [interruption] Yes, he is organising

the  thing  right now! Our Deputy Prime Minister  has

announced that he would be personally involved in the

structure  of a course for senior commanders  in  the

SAF on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>



Marxism/Leninism, The Defence Minister  also  pointed

out  that the general public seemed ignorant of  what

really  happened between 1954 and 1963 and  that  the

fight in which the PAP was involved did not end in an

easy  knockout victory over the communists,  I  think

that  a record of these stirring happenings depicting

the  actual condition of the life and death  struggle

should  be made much more widely known. Every  device

should  be  used to facilitate the recording  through

oral  history  interviews, assistance given  for  the

recording  of memoirs; and the means of dissemination

should  also  employ the different arts of  the  mass

media.  In  as  much  as  the  course  for  the   SAF

commanders  is  not  a  propaganda  or  brain-washing

session,   so   also   should   these   records   and

recollections  not be regarded merely  as  propaganda

and   brain-washing  but  a  serious  and   necessary

endeavour to hand over from one generation to another

the   results  of  a  vital,  social  and  historical

experience,  When  we  think of the  oft-referred  to

burden  of  the  present  leadership  of  finding   a

successor  government worthy of its responsibilities,

the   development  of  public  awareness  and  public

responsibility could contribute significantly to  the

solution of this problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these very vital means of providing a

common  testament  to people, and other  measures  to

relate their thoughts constantly to common references

as I have indicated, there are still other sources of

common  references  which  are  seemingly  trite  but

important  all  the same. It has been said  that  the

proper  means of increasing the love we bear  to  our

native  country is to reside some time in  a  foreign

one.  Then  you  really miss the familiar  things  or

occasions of common reference. Sir, one of the things

people  miss, however trite this may sound, is  food.

Napoleon is alleged to have said that an army marches

on  its  stomach. In my younger days -  I  was  young

once,  Sir  -  I  used  to overhear  elderly  matrons

advising  young women about to get married  that  the

way  to  a  man's heart was through his  stomach  The

interest  of  the Singaporean in food is proven  many

times over by the number of hawker centres we have on

our island and by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>



debates  on  hawker licences that  we  have  in  this

House.  It  may  not be such a quaint idea  to  focus

attention  on some very idiosyncratic culinary  items

that  we find in Singapore. One type of cooking  that

particular  attention could be drawn to  for  special

reasons  is  the  style of cooking of  the  peranakan

Chinese.   The   special  quality  of  characteristic

flavour   is   fast  being  lost   because   of   the

commercialising in the sale of some  types  of  nonya

food. [Interruption] The question of moral influence

has  everything  to  do  with development,  Sir.  The

Straits-born   Chinese,   Sir,   have   made    other

contributions  in  our history besides  the  culinary

one.  They  have  provided a  very  good  example  of

adjustment   and   assimilation   into   the    local

environment  while  retaining some  very  interesting

Chinese traditional ways. They spoke a kind of  Malay

of  their own but they got married in the full  glory

of traditional Chinese costume. It would be useful to

recall the history of the Chinese babas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reference point, Sir, is song. Somehow or

other, very few of our modern compositions seem to me

to  have the quality of universal appeal so far as we

can  make our songs a kind of common reference point.

How song can possess powerful evocative qualities  is

indicated by the way the famous Terang Bulan has been

modified  and  turned into the Malaysian  anthem.  In

Singapore there may be a number of traditional  well-known  tunes  -  but  perhaps well-known  in  musical

circles  only  - that we can revive and make  popular

yet   another   source   of   common   reference   to

Singaporeans.  Two  Malay  songs  come  to  my   mind

immediately. One of them runs this way:



<pre>

 Di Tanjong Katong airnyabiru

 Disitulah tempat mencuci mata

</pre>



and so on. There is another one which has got a march

tempo and the first two lines run:



<pre>

 Tanjong Katong tepi laut

 Siapa suka boleh ikut.

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Why not sing it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> I think we cannot move aside Standing

Orders for that purpose.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where songs in Chinese are concerned, while it

would  certainly not be appropriate to  stress  songs

like  ()  ,we  can recall how the national  anthem  of

China  today  arose  out of a  stirring  war-song.  I

remember attending a campfire at a Chinese school  in

my  constituency  and  observing  the  great  rapport

aroused by the singing of () - and the repeat verse in

English  "The  more we are together". It  showed  how

common feeling could be generated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, different people react differently

when  the  subject of patriotism is brought  up.  The

liberal    tends   to   feel   uncomfortable,    Some

intellectuals get more excited over human rights  and

internationalism. However, I did not  notice,  in  my

school-days,  that  the British were  shy  about  our

singing "There'll always be an England" and "Land  of

Hope  and Glory". I can still remember the titles  of

"patriotic" songs the Japanese made us sing "Miyoto o-kaye-no", "Umi-no-tame nara". Maybe the Minister  for

Finance  was  old  enough to remember  these  things.

Today,  countries  like China,  Japan,  North  Korea,

Russia,  even  America - they are not  bashful  about

patriotism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cuba is a very extreme example of the stress on

commitment.  The  Castro regime  in  Cuba  was  quite

willing,  after  the  revolution,  to  allow  over  a

quarter  of a million of the population to  leave  as

refugees  principally to the United States, in  order

to maintain high revolutionary morale among those who

remained.  This decision entailed the  loss  of  two-fifths  of  the country's stock of graduate  manpower

and  about  a  fifth  of  its  stock  of  those  with

secondary  education. As many as 20% of  the  lawyers

and  judges,  1  5%  of  professional  and  technical

workers, and 7% of managerial and office workers  of

Cuba  had  been registered as refugees in the  United

States between the years 1959 and 1962.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would imagine that Castro did this as much

because he was a Cuban as because he was a communist.

Even communism.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>



however   internationalist   its   leaning,   becomes

subordinate  to  stronger feelings of nationalism.  I

say these things, Sir, merely to stress how important

it  is for us to develop our own brand of patriotism,

and  contrive in a more conscious way to bring  about

the  circumstances that can help us foster this sense

of identity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made references to those ideas which I think

will   help  us  develop  some  kind  of  roots   and

strengthen these roots - even considering the  ritual

or  symbolic  effect  of song and  food.  Perhaps  we

should  even  think  of a common costume,  a  way  of

dressing - much like MPs wear white on National Day. I

saw  our  Foreign Minister dressed one evening  in  a

rather  unique jacket. These are difficult  areas  of

discussion  that we have brought up, the areas  which

the Member for Khe Bong was not able to understand. I

hope that what has been attempted as a kind of brain-storming  in Parliament will not be finally assessed,

especially  by  the  Member for Khe  Bong,  as  brain

deterioration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the area we should consider in trying to work

out  a  sense of commitment in is a wide  area  -  it

relates to our whole way of life. If this way of life

is  only concerned with what this budget is concerned

about  -  I  do  not think the Minister  for  Finance

himself intends it that way - then I think we will be

the  poorer. Perhaps it is this commitment that  will

slow  down  the  progression  of  our  young  doctors

towards  being their own businessmen, will slow  down

the   progression  of  our  over-taxed   wage-earning

executives towards the level of disincentive that  my

good  friend  the Member for Jalan Kayu referred  to,

even slowing down the emigration that the Member  for

Anson  has  referred to. I do not  believe,  as  some

people  do, that patriotism is out  of  place  in  a

modern  technological  and cultural  system.  In  our

situation, it is quite essential, because  it  simply

means  getting one Singaporean to communicate  better

with  another,  feel more responsible  for  him,  and

cooperate with him in greater harmony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going back to Sun Tzu. Sir, the Budget observed

four of the five principles relating to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>



a  matter of vital importance to the State.  Sun  Tzu

said this matter of vital importance is war. Well,  I

say   it   is   development,  Sir. It   took   into

consideration () . It left out the moral  cause, ().  I

fill it in, Sir, [Applause].



<br><br>5.39 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Alexandra):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

public  is  generally  quite happy  with  the  Budget

presented by the Hon. Minister for Finance in that it

contains no shocks. Coming so soon after the  General

Elections, the concessions given by the Minister  and

the absence of new taxes must have come as a pleasant

surprise.  Only the smokers and drinkers are  feeling

the  pinch  this  time. But I think the  smokers  are

somewhat  confused as to whether the tax increase  on

tobacco  is  intended purely as a  measure  to  raise

additional revenue or whether the Minister  seriously

intends this increase to really discourage them  from

indulging  in  the  habit. I do  not  think  the  tax

increase  which in effect amounts to five cents  more

per  packet  of  cigarettes will put people  off  the

habit.  But  if at all the objective is to discourage

what  is  a hazard to health, then I suggest that  in

future  taxation be based on a system  whereby  taxes

are proportionately raised according to the amount of

tar  content  in cigarettes. It has been  established

that there is a correlation between the amount of tar

in  cigarettes and the frequency with which  diseases

of  the  lung occur. But if the objective of the  tax

increase is really to increase revenue, then  perhaps

the  Minister should not attempt to sweeten  his  tax

increase with moral camouflage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, although the Budget did not

contain  rude shocks, it must have come as  a  slight

disappointment to those who hope to gain  by  way  of

more  tax  concessions out of it.  Of  the  four  tax

concessions granted by the Hon. Minister,  only  one.

that  is the raising of the exemption limit on estate

duty, has a direct benefit to many people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the Minister to consider

raising,  in  future,  the relief  allowed  for  life

insurance  premiums and CPF contributions. The  total

deduction  permissible  under  this  category  cannot

exceed  $4,000  at  the moment.  This  has  put  many

people,   especially  those  in   the   middle-income

category  who are executives or at middle  management

levels,  at  a  disadvantage. Their CPF contributions

would  take up most of the amount allocated,  leaving

hardly  anything  left for deductions  for  insurance

premiums. Assuming a person earns a salary of  $2,000

per  month, and it is becoming quite common  nowadays

for   such   people  to  earn  such  a  salary,   CPF

contributions will then amount to $3,600 per year. If

there  are  bonuses  earned, then  CPF  contributions

could well total $4,000 or more per year, thus taking

up  the  entire amount of relief one is entitled  to.

The  amount  of  premium one pays for life  insurance

depends on the capital sum secured on death from such

a  policy.  But  I  think I would  not  be  wrong  in

suggesting  that  a person in such  an  income  group

would  normally pay around $1,000 a year or  more  in

insurance  premiums  in order  to  get  a  reasonably

attractive life insurance policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the hon. Member for Jalan Kayu, insurance is

not my profession. But I do know enough to believe in

insurance  and  I think Singapore is still  far  from

being  an insurance-conscious society. It is  not  my

purpose to delve into the benefits of life insurance,

but  I think if we are to encourage people to provide

for the beloved ones that they leave behind when they

depart from this world or at least to tide them  over

a difficult period and I think it is not unreasonable

for  us to encourage people to do so, then some  form

of  immediate  attraction to purchase life  insurance

must be provided for. Raising the limit on relief for

life insurance and CPF to $6,000 per year would serve

as  an  incentive for many people who  are  presently

deterred from purchasing life insurance policies. The

need  to  raise this limit is also the more necessary

in  view of the fact that compulsory contributions to

the  CPF  has been steadily increasing over the  past

few years, leaving



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>



less  and  less in the amount of relief for insurance

premiums.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the Hon. Minister's call to

exporters to develop new markets. Our exporters often

face problems of making new contacts. Their potential

customers in various markets are already buying  from

other sources. Customers see no point in buying  from

a  new source unless better terms are available or if

they  can get something which their present suppliers

cannot provide. I am appreciative of the work done by

our  commercial secretaries abroad and the Department

of  Trade  here in Singapore in promoting  Singapore-made  goods.  But  I  have found that  many  contacts

introduced  to  our manufacturers do not  materialise

into  business because there is no follow-up  action.

Often the initial contact ends up with the sending of

samples.  No  orders  follow. The manufacturer  loses

heart,  not  realising it takes time to inculcate  in

the   potential  customer  sufficient  faith  in  the

Singapore  product  and to build a relationship  that

would materialise in business deals. To achieve  more

positive  results, we should quickly set up permanent

exhibition centres in the main European, American and

Asian cities where Singapore products could be put on

permanent display. Another form of promotion would be

for  Singapore  to participate in all  the  important

trade fairs. But participation in international trade

fairs  is an expensive thing. The participant has  to

pay   for  rental  of  space  which  is  often   very

exorbitant, travelling expenses, shipping merchandise

to the fair, etc. In other words, it would cost quite

a sum for a manufacturer to participate in such fairs

and many of our small manufacturers cannot afford  to

do so. What the Government can do to help would be to

have  "Made-in-Singapore"  stands  at  all  important

trade   fairs   and  to  rent  space   out   to   our

participating manufacturers at nominal  rates.  I  am

sure  that  such a policy would attract more  of  our

manufacturers, particularly  the  small   ones,   to

participate in international trade fairs at a reduced

cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On going through the Estimates, I noticed a small

item - excise duty at $15.1 million



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>



to  be  collected from locally refined sugar. I would

like to ask the Minister the reason for imposing this

excise,  and in view of the fact that this excise  is

being passed on to consumers ultimately and the  fact

that  sugar  is  a  basic  necessity,  would  he  not

consider abolishing this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point relates to a complaint which was

raised  by  me  during the debate on the Presidential

address  on the case of a family asked to return  the

13th  month allowance already paid to an employee  of

the  HDB who died just before the end of the year.  I

am  glad to read that the HDB has said that there  is

no  legal  basis to claim against the family  of  the

deceased  and that it will not make a further  claim.

However, I read only a few days ago the similar  case

of  another statutory body asking back, not just  for

the 13th month allowance already paid to somebody who

died  after receiving it, but even the return of  one

day's  pay. This time the culprit is none other  than

the  Telecommunication Authority of Singapore. I hope

the  TAS is not competing with the HDB and trying  to

outdo it. But the TAS has today replied to criticisms

14th March, 1977:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the widow of Enche Sardek bin Arip approached

Telecoms  (via her relative) that she was  unable  to

repay  the  sum, the officer in charge  of  the  case

assured her that she could take her time to repay the

amount.  He  added that she could make an  appeal  to

Telecoms  which  will likely consider  the  case,  on

sympathetic and compassionate grounds, to  waive  the

refund.  Subsequently. Telecoms decided to waive  the

refund  of one day's pay, and initiated a request  to

the  Ministry of Finance to waive the refund  of  the

13th month allowance. This matter is being considered

by the Ministry."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot accept the TAS reply that they have

made  a  request to the Ministry of Finance to  waive

the  refund  of the 13th month allowance. Of  course,

there  are  rules which have been laid  down  in  the

beginning. Perhaps those who drafted the rules  never

saw  the  possibilities of such situations  but  they

cannot  ask for a refund from somebody who is already

dead.  They  cannot  ask from  the  deceased's  widow

because, strictly speaking, she did not receive  the

money. So why persecute the poor widow and her family

at a time when they have already



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>



enough  problems and agony? The TAS says that it  has

no  authority to waive the refund of the  13th  month

allowance. May I say. Sir, that the TAS in the  first

place  has no right whatsoever to ask for the refund.

But  what sickens me most is the TAS's claim  of  one

day's  salary  from the widow. Even  though  the  TAS

eventually decided to waive the refund of  one  day's

pay,  just imagine the shock and the anguish the poor

widow must have suffered when she was first asked  to

pay  back the one day's salary. Sir,I can only think

of  one  word  to describe the TAS approach  to  this

matter  -  cruelty.  Even  if  the  TAS  subsequently

decided to waive the refund of one day's salary,  the

damage has already been done. If it is a question  of

rules.  I  urge the Minister to quickly take measures

to  amend  the  present rules. It is  very  sad  that

insistence on rules being followed to the letter  has

resulted in very unfortunate situations. It  is  time

that we put the human element into the interpretation

of  rigid  rules and where the rules  really  tie  us

down, then change the rules.



<br><br>5.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like  to  join my colleagues in congratulating

the  Hon.  Minister  for  Finance  for  presenting  a

reasonable  and  fair Budget to this  House  on  28th

February,  1977, especially as it does not  introduce

new  taxes for the year 1977. Although there are  two

tax  increases on tobacco and cigarettes and  raising

the  import duty on intoxicating liquors, I  am  sure

all  smokers and drinkers can afford to pay a  little

more.  The  increasing number of restaurants,  night-clubs and bars, clearly shows that their patrons have

plenty  of  money  to  spend  on  their  smoking  and

drinking pleasure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the tax concession in the exemption limit in

estate  duty which will be increased from $50,000  to

$100,000 and the remission limit which will  also  be

correspondingly  raised from  $230,000  to  $280,000,

will  definitely encourage a greater  home  ownership

because properties under $100,000 will pay no  estate

duty at all.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore benefitted from the world economic

revival  in  1 976 with a real growth  of  7%.  I  am

confident  we  can achieve the same growth  rate  for

1977  if we continue with our tripartite cooperation.

Government will do its best to maintain political and

economic  stability,  employers  will  expand   their

industries  and workers will work harder to  increase

productivity.  I  fully agree with the  Minister  for

Finance  that we must continue to press on  with  our

promotion  efforts  in the United States,  Japan  and

Western  Europe and to maintain a healthy  investment

climate  on the home-front. Also, we have to  explore

new markets especially in West Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the five major ASEAN industrial

projects  will  be implemented as soon  as  possible.

These  five industrial projects will certainly  boost

up the economic and industrial growth in this region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the proposal made by the hon.

Member  for Leng Kee that ASEAN should form a  united

front  in dealing with United States, Japan  and  the

EEC  countries in matters relating to tariff and non-tariff  barriers. I also agree with  him  that  ASEAN

should put pressure on Japan especially when she  has

been  enjoying a huge surplus in trade with ASEAN.  I

hope the Japanese Government leaders and the Japanese

business tycoons will stop their selfish, greedy  and

ugly  exploitation of the economic situation in  this

region. It is a matter of time for the United States,

Europe,  ASEAN  and  other  developing  countries  to

imitate  the Japanese style and strategy in  business

dealings and trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If ASEAN decides to stop exporting rubber, tin,

oil, timber and other raw materials to Japan, and  to

find other markets, it will not be easy for Japan  to

get  similar supplies at such fair prices.  In  World

War   II,  Japan  was  not  successful  in  achieving

military  and  territorial  domination.  However,  at

present  Japan has been quite successful in  economic

exploitation  and  domination,  which  is  as  deadly

dangerous as military and territorial domination,  We

have to watch the situation closely.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I believe that the best way to deal with

Japan, United States and Europe is for ASEAN to  form

an  ASEAN  Common Market like the EEC countries.  The

sooner we form it, the better for our ASEAN Economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us remember the proverb: "Heaven helps

those  that  help themselves". We should  accept  the

fact that the world does not owe us a living. We have

to struggle, sweat, toil, work harder, do our best in

whatever way we can, so that our people in ASEAN  can

live  a healthy and happy life with a better standard

of   living   through  mutual  self-reliance,   self-discipline and self-help.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I join my colleagues in supporting the Budget

Statement  presented by the Minister for  Finance  to

this House.

<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  I would like to begin  with  a  small

diversion,  as  I wish to first pay  tribute  to  our

national  soccer players who were beaten  one-nil  in

the  just concluded pre-World Cup tournament  at  our

National  Stadium. These were the same men  who  were

dismissed   as   no-hopers   after   their   alarming

inadequacies   in   friendly   matches   before   the

tournament. And even the anxiety of soccer  fans  had

appeared to threaten their confidence. That they were

able  to  lift their game to an altogether  different

dimension underlined their resilience and indomitable

spirit.   They  have,  indeed,  surpassed   all   our

expectations. And isn't this capacity  to  thrive  in

adversity so typical of we Singaporeans?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not very long ago that our future was

written   off   by  many  when  we  were  discharged.

unexpectedly, from the Malaysian Federation. And more

recently we were viewed by many outsiders with morbid

fascination as condemned people after the pullout  of

the  British bases. But we snapped back with the same

tenacity  and  resolute will and emerged  from  those

moments with greater glory.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our footballers have displayed that same grit, that

same  inner  strength. And I salute  them  for  their

determination and sacrifices; their wives  for  their

understanding during those many lonely hours, and the

FAS  officials for a job well done. I wish them  well

in all their future endeavours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the learned views and excellent

presentations of hon. Members who spoke before me,  I

cannot  but feel convinced that the Minister and  his

officials have indeed done a great job in formulating

an  excellent programme to ensure that  our  Ship  of

State  will  always be resilient  and,  as  the  hon.

Minister says, be "steady as she goes".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I was very happy to find that my reaction

to  the  Minister's Budget speech reflects  the  same

tenor  and spirit expressed by the Member for Katong,

but,  of  course, the Member for Katong has expressed

this feature of the policy in a much lucid manner and

in his typical, classic and fine literary style.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would not want to over-emphasise as he

did  the  element of compassion. By this,  I  do  not

really  mean, Sir, that the Minister is  not  a  kind

man.  I  prefer instead to call him a judicious  man;

judicious  because  his thinking, his  assessment  of

things,  his  assessment  of our  economic  situation

tells him that Singapore can afford to have what many

Members  say "a painless Budget". This point must  be

seen  in  this light because if his abacus tells  him

that  next  year the Budget will be a stringent  one,

then  surely it is not fair for us to call  the  hon.

Minister an unkind man.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to congratulate the silent backroom

boys  who  have  given  the Minister  such  excellent

support.  I am sure the task of gathering  the  data,

analysing   them   and   formulating   the   multiple

permutations of alternative strategies must call  for

the most analytical minds, strong perseverance and  a

deep  belief that something positive can be  done  to

promote the prosperity of our Republic.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister's assessments of 1976 and the

prospects  for  1977  are  indeed  realistic.  He  is

cautious, yet refreshingly optimistic. His review  of

the   status  of  the  Economic  Strategy   Programme

announced   five  years  ago  gives  us  a   succinct

recollection  of the rationale and direction  of  our

economic developments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank him for reminding us that the central

objective  of our programme he announced  five  years

ago   is   to  modernise  and  transform  Singapore's

economic structure so that it would become a  `brain'

services  centre.  In  a nutshell,  he  has  kept  us

informed  of  the progress of the package  of  public

policies designed to fulfil the five basic programmes

in  manpower  development,  science  and  technology,

infrastructure developments, taxation, and promotion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my mind, this review is crucial. We need to be

always conscious of our economic chart-ways. We  must

also know how each step we make not only consolidates

what we have achieved but also paves the way for  the

next step,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The `tactics' for 1977 he offers us again reflects

his  meticulous  thought-process as a tactician.  For

Industrial  Development, he urges that  we  press  on

with  greater  promotion efforts  especially  in  the

United  States, Japan and Western Europe - and  these

are indeed the crucial sectors. On the home front, he

advises  us to maintain a healthy investment  climate

and  do  what  we can to keep major production  costs

stable, and  industrial  facilities  and   services

readily   available   for   investors.   For    Trade

Development.  I see the importance of  the  need  for

government and traders to work more closely  together

and  for  us  to  strengthen  and  expand  our  trade

contacts  and  promotion efforts overseas.  The  same

meticulous thought process is also reflected  in  his

formulations   on  Asean  Economic  Cooperation   and

Services  Development. On Wages Policy  and  Manpower

Development, the  Minister  has  propounded  what  I

consider are very crucial principles so necessary  to

help us sustain a healthy and more meaningful climate

in industrial relations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While urging workers to put in their best efforts,

the Minister has reminded management, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;....employers have an equal responsibility to improve

their  management  of  personnel  or  of  plant   and

machinery to increase productivity. Employers  should

consider  the  introduction of appropriate  incentive

schemes   to  reward  efficient  workers  for   their

productivity'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This commitment to productivity, as we all know, Mr

Deputy Speaker, Sir, has been our standing policy. To

labour,  this  policy  imposes,  to  some  degree,  a

constraint  on wage increases. Nonetheless,  we  will

honour our commitment. Our workers will no doubt  put

in their best.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But management must also honour their commitment,

In  this  regard the Minister has very aptly  stated,

and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The initiative for formulating such (productivity)

schemes is clearly their responsibility as they  have

the greater resources and experience in this area'.



<br><br>This, to my mind, is critical. But unfortunately, the

record  of management's efforts in this direction  is

dismal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Manpower Development, the Minister has cautioned

management (and this emphasis is long overdue!) that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To instil correct work attitudes in our workers,

employers  must provide a proper working environment.

Good  employers  usually have hardworking,  dedicated

workers'.



<br><br>All  too  often,  too  many  workers  suffer  because

management has failed to realise the significance  of

this fundamental principle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are too many instances (and this applies to

the  civil service as well) where management does not

show   enough  concern  in  ensuring  that  work   is

systematised; instructions given clearly;  legitimate

grievances  resolved conclusively. Nor do  they  seem

interested  to  consciously  look  for  talents   and

developing these talents in a positive way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, their view is excruciatingly negative.

Take    disciplinary   procedures,    for    example.

Disciplinary actions pressed by management  are  only

interested  in deciding the penalties to be  imposed.

They start with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>



the  assumption that the workers are guilty  and  all

management  wants to do is to prove how more  serious

the  guilt  is - simply to justify the most stringent

penalties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This negative attitude must be rectified. Perhaps

the  Minister and also the Minister for Labour  could

design appropriate measures and incorporate them into

all  important administrative policies pertaining  to

Manpower  Development  and Management.  Whatever  the

details,  management must be made to be more positive

in  effecting work improvements. They must not assume

things. They must be more involved in the running  of

their  organisation. They must make  it  a  habit  to

check,  double-check  and see that  improvements  are

implemented, and implemented properly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management officers, individually, must conduct

themselves in such a way as to honour the self-esteem

of   workers   and  strive  to  afford  workers   the

opportunity  to experience a sense of self-worth.  In

all disciplinary proceedings, a fairer system must be

instituted.  Charges and reasons  for  these  charges

must  be  clearly  stated  and  communicated  to  the

alleged  offenders - not vaguely or carelessly  as  is

often  done. The principle of "due process'  must  be

guaranteed   and  the  worker  must  be   given   due

opportunity  of being heard - not merely ratified  by

lip-service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every disciplinary proceedings, a mandatory

assessment must be made to ascertain whether  or  not

there  are  any  flaws or deficiencies in  management

which  have  led or contributed to the occurrence  of

the    offence,    indiscipline   or   unsatisfactory

performance.  If the offence was due to  management's

default  or disinterest, then a more positive  action

must be taken on management officers responsible  for

the deficiencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying that these precepts are non-existent in managements. Yes, they do exist. But

management tended to give them lip-service and  often

for their own



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>



convenience. I say this because I know these precepts

are  difficult  to implement, that is, if  management

really  wants to seriously upgrade themselves in  the

direction  urged  by  the hon. Minister.  But,  alas,

these improvements are necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I am asked for any pointers which can help

management in realising these improvement measures, I

would suggest they take the cue from the Minister for

Finance  who  in  his Budget policy has  so  strongly

emphasized three principles: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Problems must be tackled with positive

dynamism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Efforts must be charged with a deliberate

intent to promote favourable circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) There must be regular reviews and therefore

scope for flexibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see these three-pronged strategy of "dynamism -

promotion  - flexibility" a crucial prerequisite  for

improvements. These must be cultivated, nurtured  and

imbued  in  all our organisations, our civil  service

and  our  life-styles. Without these, we will  wither

and  that mysterious inner strength so typical of the

Singapore  character will fail to come to our  rescue

especially during a crisis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strategy of dynamism, promotion and

flexibility  must particularly be instituted  in  our

civil  service. This is crucial as we are no more  in

the  colonial  era  where the  civil  service  was  a

cloistered domain whose primary task was to  regulate

and  control, rather than to promote  and  stimulate

growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demands made by our society on the civil

service are numerous and exacting. It is required  to

be  incorrupt, efficient and effective.  It  must  be

humane and judicious. It is expected to be an abiding

and  prompt executor. It must arbitrate and  regulate

fairly  and,  most  importantly,  it  has  to  be  an

untiring  catalyst and innovative  developer.  It  is

true that the civil service must run the machinery of

Government and to run it well. It is also  true  that

it  should not make mistakes, cause delays  or  waste

public  funds,  but  these are the minimum  standards

expected of all civil service.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our ability to perform beyond this minimum

level  that the Singapore civil service has  achieved

that  unique  position of being  the  most  efficient

civil  service in this part of the world.  To  ensure

real  success of the financial policy of  Government,

the  civil  service must continue to  be  innovative,

dynamic and flexible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In formulating policies and implementing them, the

civil  service is expected to do so with  competence,

diligence  and  a  deep sense of responsibility.  Its

members  are  expected to possess the  expertise  and

imagination  to  appreciate problems and  to  propose

realistic solutions which should be implemented  with

sufficient  perspicacity and thoroughness.  They  are

also  expected to be involved in assessing the merits

of  policies rather than merely accepting  them  from

those  above  for implementation. Civil  servants  in

their   respective  fields  should  demonstrate   the

capacity  for  expert  advice  and  to  do  so   with

integrity and conviction. These standards of  conduct

and  performance  expected  of  the  Singapore  civil

service will be hard to compromise. They will  become

more  pronounced as the present political  leadership

strives  to  enhance the viability, prosperity,  and

stability of the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards this end, there are certain critical

capabilities which must be developed within the Civil

Service.  Firstly, urgent attention must be given  to

develop  a  larger pool of second echelon leaders  in

the  civil  service. At the moment, we  have  such  a

dangerously  small  group of top  administrators  who

have  to burden so much, and, as a consequence, could

not  have  the disposition to develop the second-line

resources in a positive manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, new working structures must be

institutionalised. I agree fully with the hon. Member

for  Kallang  when  he urged that  more  supra-status

bodies  like  the  Economic Activation  Committee  be

utilised.  This is necessary because the  process  of

governance  is  more complex. More and  more  complex

programmes  and projects are required and  all  these

call  for more sophisticated policies and machineries

which must allow for better coordination, sharing of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>



expertise, establishing   proper   priorities   and

ensuring concurrent developments of all sectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Government to consider

establishing what may be called a special Task  Force

consisting  of a group of multi-disciplinary  experts

who, together, can be given short assignments to help

Ministries which have persistent problems which  they

cannot solve themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary role of this Task Force is to also

build  up  the initiating capabilities in the  weaker

Ministries.  Such  a Task Force may  include  two  or

three bright young officers who, having completed the

assignments,  can  be assigned the responsibility  of

implementing  and  making permanent  the  improvement

measures.  In  a way, this arrangement will  open  up

greater  opportunities  to develop  the  second  line

commanders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to urge that the Central

Agencies  like  the  Public Service  Commission,  the

Budget  Division, Audit Department, and the CPIB,  to

drastically change their essentially centralised  and

authoritative postures into one which is more dynamic

and promotive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, Sir, the Public Service Commission is

the   final  authority  on  personnel  and   staffing

matters. I would like to see the Commission  and  its

Secretariat   to   take  this  job  of   recruitment,

emplacement,  promotion and staff  development  in  a

more  open and dynamic manner. It is ridiculous,  for

example,  for the Public Service Commission  to  take

more  than four months to recruit a temporary  clerk.

Nor  is  it  enough  for them  to  merely  blame  the

educational  system,  university  and  colleges   for

having failed to supply the necessary candidates  for

important appointments in the civil service.  Nor  is

it  correct for them to merely wash their  hands  and

lament  that  the private sectors offer better  terms

than  what  the  civil  service  can.  More  positive

methods  of  attracting  better  candidates  must  be

worked out. New methods of assessing candidates  must

be  introduced because the exclusive reliance on  the

interview methods is not only inadequate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>



but  indeed obsolete, especially for the higher grade

appointments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the budget Office, it is true that they must

have real control in resource allocations. But surely

they  can  do  it  without unduly  inhibiting  urgent

sector developments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Processing of projects and issues pertaining to

staff  matters surely must be attended  to  promptly.

When  disapproving  requests made by  departments,  I

think  Budget should make it a point to indicate  the

reasons  for  the  rejection.  This  will  help   the

Ministries  understand the thinking and rationale  of

the Budget's decision. No doubt there are problems of

staff shortages at Budget but something must be  done

positively  about it as any failings  in  the  Budget

Office  will create more serious implications in  the

sector developments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the auditors, I must say how much I appreciate

the  increasingly difficult jobs they have to  do  as

the  Government  machinery becomes  more  complex.  I

therefore wish to offer the Auditor-General  and  his

staff my deep concern. I wish them well and urge them

to  be  patient in their work. However, I must remind

the  Auditor-General  and his staff  that  the  audit

function,  or  rather the manner by which  the  audit

function   has   been   carried   out,   has   rather

inadvertently brought about that most infamous  label

that  the  Civil Service is over-cautious, rigid  and

bureaucratic.  I  really do not  blame  the  officers

responsible in the control and utilisation of  public

monies to be cautious. With the auditors always ready

to  pounce  on them, there is little option  but  for

officers to be rigid and cautious.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent case where a junior clerk in the Income

Tax  Department could embezzle nearly $1  million  of

public  money  and remain undetected  for  nearly  40

months  has  made me feel that something  serious  is

wrong  with  the  audit system. It  is  pointless  to

solely blame the Approving Officers in the Income Tax

Department for blindly signing the payment bills when

the auditors themselves.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>



who  are given copies of the Payment bills, could not

detect these errors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not understand why auditors take such a long

time  to  raise queries, often after a lapse of  many

months from the date the errors were committed. It is

really  unfair  to  ask  an officer  to  explain  the

mistakes  after a long lapse, because he may  not  be

able to recall in detail the explanations which could

really justify the errors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore urge the Auditor-General to

seriously improve his department so that the auditors

can  take  remedial action promptly after the  errors

are committed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next the CPIB. The CPIB must continue to be

stringent.  This must be so because  our  society  is

more  involved in developments where there is so much

avenue  for  malpractices and there  is  a  need  for

greater control. It must maintain high standards  as,

otherwise, our creditability will be threatened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the CPIB must ensure that their officers

do  not  make  their investigations  in  a  frivolous

manner  which often can cause undue inconvenience  to

the  departments, and unjustifiably bring unnecessary

shame  to officers, thus lowering the morale  of  the

department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, my appeal is that Central Agencies

which  I  have  mentioned above must now  take  on  a

greater  role  as promoter, facilitator  and  dynamic

agent   and  must  allow  for  sufficient  scope   of

flexibility   rather   than  remaining   a   passive,

disinterested   authority.  This   change   must   be

deliberate  and  the Civil Service must  reflect  the

true  spirit  of dynamism, promotion and  flexibility

promulgated in the Hon. Minister's Budget policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally I would like to urge the Civil Service to

take  on  a  more  positive  view  to  the  criticism

directed  at  them - most forcefully  by  Members  of

Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I feel that the criticisms which hon.

Members of this House have raised should make the job

of  the civil servants easier because they would have

the added reason



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>



and  argument to put up for a case to their  superior

officers  and  even  to  their Ministers  for  easier

support and approval. This was my experience  when  I

was in the Civil Service. I welcome criticism because

things simply get done much faster when there is good

criticism,   especially   when   the   criticism   is

accompanied   with  very  sensible   suggestions   or

alternative solutions. In this context, I would  like

to strongly urge my colleagues that whenever we raise

any  particular criticism, we should also make  it  a

point to offer sensible solution,



<br><br>6.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would

like to congratulate the Minister for Finance for his

painless  budget and for his confidence  demonstrated

in  his deficit budgeting. The only increase in taxes

are on luxuries, and if people insist on drinking and

smoking they should be prepared to pay for the  extra

cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> So do you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I have given up smoking. I would

like, however, to ask the Minister for Finance if  he

is  willing to give us an assurance, in the light  of

the  confidence displayed in presenting  the  budget,

that  no  new  taxes  will  be  introduced  and  that

existing  taxes will not be raised during the  course

of  the year. I ask this, Sir, because of late, there

is  the  tendency  to present a painless  budget  but

after the electorate has been lulled into a sense  of

satisfaction and complacency, new taxes  are  imposed

or  existing taxes raised for various reasons  during

the course of the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, with the indulgence of the

House, may I raise once again a question which I have

raised  before and which I am sure is of interest  to

most  of  us  in  Singapore. I  refer,  Sir,  to  the

personal  relief afforded to taxpayers.  Sir,  income

tax  was introduced more than 25 years ago and  there

has been no increase in the personal relief of $2,000

except  for  the relief of $1,000 allowed for  earned

income.  Despite representations made in  this  House

year after year, the Minister for Finance has brushed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>



aside  all  arguments with the same old excuses.  His

refusal  to  increase  the stagnant  personal  relief

brings consolation to nobody.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has given us three reasons

for refusing to increase personal relief. Firstly, he

says  that the Government will lose about $26 million

in  revenue  a year, and that (I quote Hansard,  24th February, 1977):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our revenue performance in the last financial year

and  in the coming year is not so strong as to permit

an increase in such income tax relief, If such relief

were  to  be  increased, a new tax or an increase  in

other taxes may have to be imposed to make up for the

loss in revenue.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This appears to be an answer which he repeats year

after  year.  In  regard to the first observation,  I

would  like  to draw attention to the  fact  that  in

presenting  his  budget  the  Minister  gave  us  the

impression that Singapore is financially sound. In  a

budget  of $5 billion, $26 million is a drop  in  the

ocean.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the second sentence in the quotation,

does  the Minister imply that he is thus giving us  a

guarantee that there will be no new taxes or increase

in existing taxes during the current financial year?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make one other observation in

regard to this $26 million which undoubtedly is being

collected  from marginal tax payers, who  undoubtedly

number  several thousands. In a previous  sitting  of

Parliament,   the   Minister   indicated   that   the

collection of taxes from hawkers was too tedious  and

cumbersome,  as  it would entail a  large  number  of

staff and revenue would rather be small.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I would like to enquire if it

would  not  be better to transfer the staff  who  are

collecting this meagre $26 million from thousands  of

the  lower  income group and let them concentrate  on

the  collection  of  income tax  from  those  earning

higher  incomes and from those who may be at  present

evading income tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason the Minister has given is that

while  the  cost of living has gone up,  so  has  per

capita  income,  which increased the ability  of  the

taxpayer to pay more tax. Of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>



course, it is evident that if a person earns a higher

income  he  has to pay higher income tax if  personal

relief  is  not increased. But what the Minister  has

apparently  omitted to consider and  mention  is  the

fact  that although incomes have gone up so  has  the

cost of living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance sometime ago admitted that

the  Consumer  Price Index for the year  1973-74  has

gone  up by nearly 25%. How many times would it  have

gone  up since 1948? Thus, any increase in wages  has

been consumed and nullified by rising prices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason the Minister has given is that the

ever-increasing public expenditure has to be borne by

as  many  people  as possible and that  the  services

provided  by  the  Government must be  paid  for.  Of

course,  nobody  expects the services  of  Government

free  of charge but surely some consideration can  be

given to those in the lower income group, who in 1948

were  not  so  badly  off when prices  of  goods  and

services were lower.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an article in "Socialism That Works, The

Singapore Way", Dr Goh Keng Swee, our former Minister

for  Finance,  stated that "from 1959  to  1975,  the

Consumer  Price Index increased by about  70%".  What

then  would be the increase from 1948 -probably  well

over  200%.  Thus whatever wage increases  the  lower

income group may have received have all been absorbed

by rising prices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should also be borne in mind that taxpayers'

expenses  have also increased, if he is  married  and

has   children.  The  allowances  for  his  wife  and

children have not been increased since 1948,  despite

rising  prices. Thus the end product of the  existing

tax  pattern  means that although a man's  wages  may

have doubled or trebled since 1948, he is left poorer

than what he was in

1948 despite our Republic's progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not that I am advocating a substantial

reduction  in  the rate of income tax;  all  that  is

being asked for is that cognisance be taken of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>



the rising prices and the fact that they have reduced

the wage-earner's real income as opposed to his money

wages.



<br><br>6.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  I rise to join my colleagues  on  the

Backbench in support of the Motion moved by the  Hon.

Minister  for Finance. Several hon. Members  have  no

doubt contributed much to the debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have several things to say about the financial

policy  of FY 77, Let me first refer to the statement

of the Minister that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We have laid a sound foundation for sustained

growth  (6  - 8%) through the five basic elements  of

our long term development strategy',



<br><br>Hopefully this prediction may come true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the EDB's efforts in attracting

investment  commitments of $364.2  million  in  1976,

comparatively speaking, is I think a bit on  the  low

side,  though I understand their difficulty. However,

I  hope the EDB will spare no efforts in securing and

promoting investment to Singapore especially  in  the

fields  that  will bring us to a higher technological

level  in  which  higher skills are required  of  our

workers;  thereby putting us on a better footing,  so

to speak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I welcome the setting up of the

Capital  Assistance  Scheme to  assist  in  financing

smaller   but  more  technology-oriented  industries.

Coupled  with  this,  I would  like  to  see  greater

efforts  made  in  export  promotion.  Several   hon.

Members  have  already mentioned of the  need  to  co

ordinate  these efforts, and I hope the Hon. Minister

will  no doubt look into this. Perhaps a unit  should

also  be  set  up  to  advise on marketing  as  well.

Several   Members   have  also  mentioned   marketing

promotion for manufactured products, but they do  not

seem  to have any follow-ups. I suggest that  such  a

unit  be  set  up. This unit could then map  out  the

strategy  of promoting our manufactured products  and

also  provide amongst other things related  services.

Permanent  exhibition centres  are  of  help,  but  I

believe there is nothing better than the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>



personal   touch.   The  example  of   the   Japanese

aggressiveness in this respect should  enable  us  to

understand  why  the Japanese economic  recovery  has

been  so  successful and rapid since  post  war.  Our

growth  rate  over the last few years has  been  high

also.  We  have had growing prosperity over the  last

17 1/2  years  under PAP rule. But I believe we  can  do

better  if  we redouble our efforts in  view  of  the

uncertainties   ahead  which  I  think   nobody   can

accurately predict.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I turn to ASEAN economic cooperation. I

would  like  to  urge the Hon. Minister  to  consider

laying  greater  emphasis on  bi-lateral  and  multi-lateral trading arrangements with ASEAN countries.  A

good start has already begun with the Philippines and

Thailand "with the across-the-board reduction of  10%

of  existing  tariffs  on all  products".  These  bi-lateral  agreements  mean that  Preferential  Trading

Arrangements would eventually, I think,  bring  about

greater  benefits to ASEAN. The other ASEAN countries

are  rich in natural resources whereas Singapore  has

the   necessary  infrastructure  and  other   related

services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Hon. Minister mentioned

a  balance of $611 million from the expected revenue

yield of $3,362 million of which no less than 41%  of

such  revenue  comes  from  income  tax.  The  income

receipts will be $1,380 million, i.e, up 15% over  FY

76, In fact, wage earners and others have helped much

in  this contribution. But there are others who  seem

to be untaxed. Several hon. Members have again raised

the  question of further tax incentives. They are  my

good  Friend,  the Member for Khe Bong  (formerly  of

Bras Basah), the Member for Alexandra and others, and

I  hope their appeal this time will not fall on  deaf

ears. However, Sir, the hon. Minister in reply to  my

plea  for such income tax reliefs stated the need  to

have  a  broader  base; but I do hope  that  he  will

enlighten  this  House as to what other  measures  he

proposes  to  take  against the  untaxed  to  further

broaden  this base. In my remarks on this. I  am  not

referring  only  to  the  specialised  unit  in   his

Ministry alone. I leave this matter open.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Sir, whilst I compliment the

Hon.  Minister  and  his Ministry officials  for  the

extra caution in ensuring actual expenditure incurred

as  a  result  of savings, (I think hon. Members  can

refer  to the Financial Statement for the year 1/4/75

to  31/3/76, Paper Cmd. 1 of 1977, pages 130-317,  to

infer  this) I would like to draw the Hon. Minister's

attention  to  both the shortfalls and underestimated

yields  in  revenue. On estimated and actual  revenue

side  (in  page  127, Code 311-002, on  "Interest  on

Investments") the estimated revenue was $110 million

whereas  the  actual revenue came to $74.91  million,

resulting  in a shortfall of $35.08 million.  I  must

hasten   to  add,  Sir,  that  this  is,   in   fact,

reclassified under Dividend - Other Investments, Code

312-009.  Sir, the following item Code  312-001  on

"Dividend-Temasek Holdings" the estimated  yield  was

supposed  to be $6 million and the actual  yield  was

"NIL" simply because no dividend was declared. Before

hon.  Members rush to a conclusion on these  remarks,

may  I  point  out that there are many  examples  of.

these  so-called "more than estimated".  These  vivid

examples  can  be  found  in  the  same  statement  I

referred to just now. I therefore leave my remarks on

this  matter  to  the  Hon.  Minister  and  his   top

officials in the Ministry to reflect on. Surely, I do

not  expect  hon.  Members to say "those  responsible

must  be  very accurate in their projections"  but  I

must say that the differences should not be too great

either.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of course, I have studied the Report of the

Auditor-General  for  the financial  year  1975-76,

Paper  Cmd.  2  of 1977, concerning this  point.  For

example, on page 11 of the Report, Revenue Less  Than

Estimated (paragraph 48) I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Information received showed that the respective

department concerned was not in a position either  to

anticipate the recurrence of actual revenue less than

estimated  or  to adjust for more accurate  budgeting

for the financial year under review'



<br><br>Therefore, Sir, the Auditor-General's remarks on this

should not only be noted but also be looked into.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to touch on two aspects

concerning Industrial Training and Prices covered  in

the  Economic  Survey of Singapore  1976.  Under  the

heading   "Manpower  and  Wages",  on  page   37,   I

appreciate  that "Industrial Training  was  conducted

mainly in institutions and on-the-job." I have had on

previous  occasions  in the past suggested  a  scheme

"earn-whilst-you-learn". I believe that learning  on-the-job and in the institutions concerned is one good

thing;  but  I  submit  that  "earn-whilst-you-learn"

would certainly upgrade the skills of our workers and

will  also encourage the younger students. Therefore,

such  a  scheme  should  be implemented  as  soon  as

possible  if we are to encourage both the  young  and

skilled  workers to sharpen their tools of trade  and

thereby better, themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of Prices in page 42 under "Local

farm products", it states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Between February and September 1976, prices of pigs

fell  by 18% owing to excess supply, despite attempts

to export more live pigs'.



<br><br>May  I say that the prices of pigs fell by more  than

18%.  May I ask who made attempts to export more live

pigs  and  to  which countries? How  far  have  those

departments  concerned assisted  in  stabilizing  the

price  of  pigs? Prices of local farm  products  will

decline  if the Finance Ministry continues  to  allow

import of frozen and canned farm products from  other

countries.  Therefore, it is difficult to  understand

the rationale behind all this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statement that "fish prices were unusually

higher  at  the  beginning and end  of  the  year  on

account  of  a poorer catch and during the north-east

monsoon  period" is understandable. What is important

is  the  need  to develop and encourage  the  fishing

industry.  Although  the  Changi  Fisheries  Training

School  has been closed down, it does not  mean  that

all  is lost in the fishing industry. The Jurong Fish

Market  caters  for foreign as well as local  fishing

vessels.  The  Kangkar Fish Market in my constituency

has more than a hundred otter trawlers and serves the

inshore fishermen as well. No doubt they help towards

the growth rate It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>



may  be  negligible  in terms of  percentage  to  the

growth rate but still a little goes a long way. May I

suggest to the hon. Finance Minister to look into the

matter  of  concluding bi-lateral  and  multi-lateral

fishing  arrangements  with the  ASEAN  countries  to

enable  fishing  in  the region's waters.  I  believe

there  is  an abundance of fish in the seas  of  this

region  and if such arrangements are concluded,  this

will be another benefit to ASEAN.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, Sir, I would like to refer to

the  tax  concessions which encourage home ownership.

The increase from $50,000 to $100,000 exemption limit

is  most  welcome. Also the raising of the  remission

limit  from  $230,000  to  $280,000  in  respect   of

properties  means  a  reduction  of  tax  under   the

existing   estate   duty  liability.   Hon.   Members

especially  of  the  Third Parliament  are  certainly

grateful  to  our  Hon.  Minister  for  Finance   for

granting such a concession as this matter has at last

been well considered, For the benefit of some of  the

new  Members of Parliament, including my good Friend,

the Member for Changi, this matter was raised on many

occasions in this House because many of us felt  that

it  would  be too harsh to see families losing  their

houses  because of the burden of having to pay  heavy

estate duties. Properties have gone up in value  over

the  last  few  years. Therefore, the  concession  on

estate  duties was only given a couple of years  ago,

up to $50,000. Today it is now raised to $100,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> It is long overdue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> My good Friend, the Member for Khe

Bong,  says it is long overdue. I think it is  better

late  than never. Therefore, it is not a question  of

the  haves benefitting and the have-nots losing  out.

Nobody  loses  out  in this. It  is  a  matter  which

enables owner-occupiers' families to continue to live

in  their  own homes. Most of them save hard  to  buy

their  houses, say, 10, 15 or 20 years ago  when  the

prices  then were about 10 times lower than they  are

today. Just to illustrate, a terrace house then might

cost  anything between $10,000 to $15,000  depending

on the locality. Today it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>



costs  about $100,000 or more. I am sure hon. Members

in this House would not wish to see a family, because

they have to pay estate duty as such, sell away their

owner-occupied  house  which  the  owner  himself  or

herself left behind for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, several Members have pleaded with our Hon.

Finance  Minister  in the past  to  consider  not  to

impose the estate duty on the owner-occupied house of

the family concerned. In any case, this concession is

well  received. But I certainly hope that  this  will

not bring about an escalation in property assessment,

because this concession then becomes meaningless.  In

this  respect,  I share the view of  the  Member  for

Whampoa, who unfortunately is not around, on this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Motion of the Hon. Finance Minister has my

support.



<br><br>6.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Kuo Chuan):</b> Sir, I would not

detain this House very much longer. Apropos of what I

had  raised  in the earlier debate on the President's

address, there are a few concrete cases bearing  upon

the  implementation of the policy of the Housing  and

Development Board that I would like to raise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> would recall that in 1975 we passed

the  Housing  and Development Board (Amendment)  Bill

which  provided, among other things, that  the  Board

may  compulsorily acquire any flat,  house  or  other

living  accommodation,  if  the  owner  thereof,  his

spouse  or any authorised occupier, has at  any  time

acquired,  whether by operation of law or  otherwise,

any  title  to or an estate or interest in any  other

land.  Barring  dishonesty, all owners  who  obtained

flats from the HDB did so because they qualified  for

their  flats. At the time of acquisition, they  owned

no  other house or flat. Since obtaining their  flat.

however,  they  went  on to invest  in  other  landed

properties. The amending Act now empowers the HDB  to

reacquire  the  HDB flats from such owners  who  have

gone  on  to  acquire other property and  to  improve

themselves.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst one accepts the need for empowering the HDB

to  reacquire the flats in special circumstances, the

way  in  which  this power is used  in  practice  has

caused  hardship.  A few cases would  illustrate  the

difficulty. In the first case, an unmarried woman,  a

Singapore citizen, qualifies for and is given  a  HDB

flat.  She lives in it with her parents and  sisters,

all   of  whom  are  permanent  residents  but   with

Malaysian citizenship. In due time the owner  of  the

flat marries and moves into the matrimonial house  of

her husband. Because her husband owned his own house,

the woman was asked by the HDB to surrender her flat.

The woman is now unable to perform her filial duty to

her parents who must leave the flat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second case, an illiterate man qualifies for

a  HDB  flat  but purchases it in the name  of  his

eldest  son who has an English education. The  father

provides  the entire purchase price for the flat.  In

due  time  the eldest son gets married and  seeks  to

transfer the flat back to his father so that he,  the

son,  could apply for his own flat, The HDB  says  he

could not do it under current policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third case, an unmarried son qualifies for

and  buys a HDB flat and houses his parents, brothers

and  sisters. He decides to get married but  proposes

to  transfer  the  flat to his brother  so  that  his

brother  could  continue  to  look  after  his   aged

parents. He further proposes to apply for a flat  for

himself and his wife. HDB says, "Under current policy

such transfers could not be entertained."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, instances could be multiplied to show how an

inflexible   application  of   policy   resulted   in

dispossessed  families, due  to  no  fault  of  these

families  but  due  only to changes  in  Government's

housing   policy.  It  would  serve   the   ends   of

Government's  policy  if greater  discrimination  was

shown in avoiding genuine hardship when the HDB  used

its powers of acquisition of flats in given

situations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also join in the chorus of support for the

Motion standing in the name of the Hon. Minister  for

Finance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.57 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Deputy  Speaker,  I  have  listened  with  deep   and

absorbing interest to all that hon. Members have said

today  and on the last Budget day. I thank  them  for

their general support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been very few critical comments but

quite  a number of useful suggestions. Some of these,

such   as  those  relating  to  Sun  Tzu  and   moral

influence, food and cooking (the nyonya cooking)  and

other matters, require consideration at the pace  and

deliberation appropriate to philosophy, poetry, songs

and  cooking. I will therefore do so at  my  leisure.

But  at  the  slower  growth rate  that  we  are  now

experiencing,  maybe  a lot  of  us  will  have  more

leisure   time!   Other  suggestions  are   sometimes

critical  of my own Ministry of Finance's  assessment

of  the economic situation in Singapore and I propose

to  spend  some time replying to them. I  have  taken

copious  notes and since I cannot expect  equal  time

with  all  the Members who have spoken, I propose  to

concentrate only on highlights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may take the economic strategy, first of all I

would like to make some general remarks on the nature

of  the  Economic  Survey and the  planning  and  the

prospects  for 1977. The assessments in  my  Economic

Survey and in the Budget Statement are, of course, to

some extent personal or departmental, and it is quite

possible that economists in the business and academic

sectors may have their own views. In fact, the wealth

of  data  that has now been supplied in the  Economic

Survey   is   intended  to  induce  such   individual

evaluations,  if necessary, even to the  devising  of

economic  models  from, say, banking  and  university

circles, of the economy of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in considering the comments which have been made

by,  say, the Member for Whampoa, I think it may well

be  that he would consider his own assessment of  the

situation as correct. For example, he commented  that

the  improvement  in  productivity  was  due  to  the

economy pulling out of recession. This, of course, is

a plausible



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>



explanation, although my Ministry and I myself differ

from such an assessment. In the shipbuilding and ship-repairing  industry, for example, there is  no  doubt

that the keener competition which has been due to the

recession  has  increased  the  productivity  in  the

industry's   attempt,  not  always   successful,   to

maintain their profit margins by getting rid  perhaps

of  their  less  efficient workers and improving  the

productivity of the ones they retain,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other comments which he made on the

decline  in the construction sector and the need  for

the Ministry of Finance to have regard to this in the

future.  Some  of  the  decline  in  private   sector

construction has been due to the lack of demand,  for

example, there has been a certain glut in commercial

buildings,  and  it  would not be  possible  for  the

Government to further stimulate commercial buildings.

In the hotel sector, of course, it would be something

which we would encourage over the next few years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also comment on the private share of

expenditure  declining over the last one  year.  This

has  been due to the fact that because of the private

sector's hesitation in capital expenditure the public

sector  has  taken over much of the development  work

and  has  consequently increased  its  share  of  the

Singapore expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Whampoa has also made comments on

exchange  rate policy, or the lack of a statement  in

the  Budget concerning such policy. The exchange rate

policy  has been constant over the last two years  or

so.  Our efforts have been to maintain stability  and

an   easy  money  policy, so  that  there  would  be

sufficient   liquidity  in  the  banks   to   promote

development  activities.  Perhaps  it  was  wrong  to

assume that there was no need for special mention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also suggested that quarterly figures be

included  in  the Economic Survey. Some  figures  are

available  of  the  kind of data we  present  in  the

Economic Survey, on a quarterly basis, but not in the

full  range or the accuracy of it. So it may be  some

time yet before we are ready to produce these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>



quarterly figures in the annual Economic Survey.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now go on to trade policy which has been

mentioned  by quite a number of Members. I think  the

Member  for Jalan Kayu was the first to suggest  that

there  should  be  a  coordinating  body  for  export

promotion.  Possibly a Trade Development Council  may

be  a solution to the problems which we are facing  -

how  to  coordinate the efforts of  the  Chambers  of

Commerce,  the  Singapore Manufacturers'  Association

and   our   own  Trade  Department  export  promotion

efforts. So it is something which we are proposing to

give consideration to over the next few months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next matter which has been raised related to

ASEAN  and  the development of activities  under  the

ASEAN  umbrella. I made a pretty short  statement  on

ASEAN  in  the  Budget Statement because  I  did  not

consider  that  at  this stage while  there  is  very

considerable  ferment  and  activity  among  Economic

Ministers and by the officials, that there  had  been

sufficient  implementation  of  projects  to  make  a

significant contribution to the economy in  1977.  It

may  be  that  in  1978 or 1979 the  effects  of  the

Agreement on Preferential Trading Arrangements on the

five ASEAN industrial plants, or the arrangements for

ensuring  that  oil and rice would  be  available  in

times of crisis, would bear sufficient fruit to  make

a considerable impact upon the Gross Domestic Product

of  Singapore. At the moment, all we can say of ASEAN

is  that it shows very considerable promise and  that

we will need to spend very much more time on it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic strategy on manpower was a matter of

interest to very many MPs and the need for skills and

productivity  was generally appreciated.  One  Member

suggested  that  we  should  have  some  regard   for

unskilled workers, In this respect we have  not  paid

any particular attention to unskilled workers because

there  is  really a shortage of unskilled workers  in

certain   industries  like  construction  and   ship-repairing, where we have had to issue quite a  number

of work



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>



permits. So if there is really a considerable  number

of  unskilled  workers  willing  to  engage  in  less

attractive jobs, there are already industries waiting

for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the responsibilities of management for

instituting  productivity incentive  schemes,  I  was

perhaps misunderstood, or the Member for Leng Kee had

not  read  the  first part of my Budget speech  which

said  that  productivity incentive schemes  were  the

responsibility of management because they had greater

resources  and experience in this area and  that  the

rewards  for  productivity should  be  in  incentives

which  are  to  be  accorded by the  management.  The

Member  for Kampong Kembangan put this matter  right,

but I am not sure whether the Member for Leng Kee was

present when he said that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were very many other comments on elements in

economic tactics rather than strategy. The Member for

Jurong  was  properly concerned with the difficulties

and  hardships  experienced by  his  constituents  in

Jurong.  There were comments by the Member for  Anson

on  tourism and brain centre developments. But I will

not  go  into these matters because these are  points

which can be raised in the Committee of Supply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were very many questions raised on income

tax, personal  allowances, and  so  on.  I  think  I

answered  these questions during the  debate  on  the

President's Speech and I do not think I need  now  go

into this matter in any detail.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Not very detailed!



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> The Member for Khe

Bong  was among those who raised this with some heat.

And,  of course, I heard the Member for Marine Parade

who  came  up  with figures which he referred  to  as

being  in a Table(See Appendix II, cols. 907-8) which he would present in Hansard.

I look forward to reading this and to be impressed by

the figures which he has produced. All I need now say

is  that I will examine these figures very carefully.

I  suspect the increase of 6950% in tax liability for

the lower income group may have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>



due to the fact that the tax base was very low. If it

is  say, $1 then 6950% would be $69. In fact, if  you

move  from  zero  to $50, that does not  make  it  an

infinite increase in the tax. As I say, I will have a

very  close look at the figures which he has produced

for  the  Cases A. B and C. As for index  linkage.  I

think  this  is  a  matter  which  I  would  be  very

reluctant to give any special consideration. I do not

know  whether this has been the accepted practice  in

many  other jurisdictions, and I am loathe to be  the

first  to  start in Southeast Asia, if not, in  Asia.

There  was  the  question whether I could  spare  $26

million. The answer is, I can spare it if I can  find

it elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One comment made by the Member for Alexandra was

that  the tax on cigarettes and drink was not a  real

disincentive  to  smoking  and  drinking.  I  am,  of

course, prepared to impose a much higher rate if that

is  his  advice, and I would certainly  look  further

into this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the Member for Changi, and until I

heard the Member for Punggol just now, I thought that

perhaps I had given, in vain, a concession on  estate

duty which no one wanted. But I am glad that this  is

appreciated in certain quarters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for an assurance asked by the Member for Khe

Bong  that  there  would  be  no  further  taxes   or

increases in the year, I think he knows by  now  that

Ministers  of Finance never give assurances  of  this

kind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the question of civil servants. There

were  some comments on civil servants, and I am  glad

that the ex-civil servant, who is now the Member  for

Kampong  Kembangan, was here to hold up the flag  for

the  civil  servants. I listened with some regret  to

the  Member for Aljunied. I thought that while it  is

true that civil servants can very often take care  of

themselves, it is not possible for them to do  so  in

this  House.  It  is  a matter for  regret  that  the

performance  of  the civil servants should  again  be

raised for attack, as not all the suggestions of  the

Member for Aljunied are invalid. In fact, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>



suggestion  for a rotation of staff  so  as  to  give

civil servants a very broad experience is entirely in

accordance  with  the  policy,  if  not  always   the

practice, of the Government and of the Civil Service.

But  I  think  he spoils the value of his suggestions

and  comments by making quite unnecessary attacks  on

the civil servants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture of Ministers invariably listening to

civil  servants who have been in the Ministry  for  a

very   long  time  is  not  entirely  flattering   to

Ministers.  We initiate the policy, and sometimes  we

even try to implement it, and the civil servants take

their  orders  from us. But I think  the  Member  for

Aljunied  contradicts himself in the next  breath  by

saying  also  that  the  civil  servants  fear  their

superiors  and try all they can to please  them,  and

that  they  answer  letters  to  the  Press  promptly

because  they  are afraid of coming  to  unfavourable

notice.  I  myself  consider  that  the  growth  that

Singapore  has had over the last 18 years since  1959

has  been  due  not  only to the  Ministers  and, of

course,  the Members of Parliament who represent  the

People's Action Party -although they should be  given

the  credit which is their due, this growth has  also

been  due  to  the  fact that  we  have  a  good  and

efficient  Civil Service. Like all organisations,  of

course, there is always room for improvement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were also some criticisms of them because

they  hold office in the boards of private or  public

companies  and in statutory boards. Very often  these

are  a  part of the duties of the Civil Service.  For

example, the CPF is a statutory board, but  it  is  a

part, as much as any other function, of the Ministry

of  Labour.  In the same way, some of the  industries

which  the Ministry of National Development  has  set

up,  like  Food Industries and so on, are really  for

carrying  out of the work of the Ministry of National

Development.  For  example, in the experimental  work

which  they  are  doing on the breeding  of  pigs  in

flatted  buildings it was the Treasury that  insisted

that  they should set up a separate company in  order

that  all the elements of costs and of revenue  could

be properly accounted for so that one can see



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>



the  distinction between what is being done  in  that

company  and what would normally be done by  officers

in  the  departments  of  the  Ministry  of  National

Development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the accountability of the civil servants,

there  is some kind of impression that they  are  not

subject  to  any  control. The  fact  is  that  their

performances in these companies and in the  statutory

boards are most certainly monitored by the people who

appoint  them. In the case of the Ministry of Finance

companies  and statutory boards, they report  to  the

Minister for Finance. I think the basis of assessment

of their performance is even more rigid because it is

properly  quantifiable by the profits which are  made

in  companies  or by results in economic  development

which  ensue from their appointments to the statutory

boards. For example, I think a board as vital as  the

Economic  Development Board would  be  assessed  even

more   closely  than  a  normal  department  of   the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to end my statement by a reference to the

growth  rate of 6-8%. Some Members thought  that  the

growth  rate was unduly optimistic, that  the  mildly

rosy  nature of the consensus which has been  reached

in  the OECD and elsewhere is not entirely justified.

Well,  this  may be so. This is again  a  matter  for

individual judgment. In 1978, at about this  time  of

the  year,  I think we shall see whether or  not  the

estimate  of 6-8% which we have made is correct.  The

Member for Kampong Kembangan has suggested that there

should  be  cautious optimism. I think we  are  being

cautious, optimistic and, at the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>



same time, realistic. We had a 7% growth rate as  the

possible  growth for Singapore. We would be  cautious

by  putting it at 6% and optimistic at 8%. So we said

6-8%. On that basis we should not be too far off  the

mark, But I think that this time next year I will  be

able to know whether or not I was right, whether  the

Member for Kampong Kembangan is satisfied, or whether

the  Member  for  Serangoon Gardens  was  correct  in

saying that it was too optimistic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To close this debate, may I say that since the

Member  for Kampong Kembangan has spoken of  football

in  this  debate,  we all need to  have  the  highest

morale  in  the business of economic development  and

that  we,  Ministers and MPs, as well  as  the  Civil

Service,  should  try  to  maintain  this  very  high

morale.  Perhaps an Empress Place roar, in  the  same

way  as  the  Kallang roar, will help to achieve  our

objective.
