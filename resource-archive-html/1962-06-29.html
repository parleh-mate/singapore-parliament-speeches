<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>COMPENSATION FOR MASSACRES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>BY JAPANESE ARMY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>IN SINGAPORE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b> asked the Prime Minister if he will make a statement on his

recent  discussions  with  the  Japanese  Prime  Minister  on  the  question  of

compensation  for the massacres by the Japanese army in Singapore  in  the  last

war.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, on the 25th of May, I paid a courtesy call on the Prime Minister

of  Japan  and in the course of our conversation, he referred to the unfortunate

incidents  which took place during the war in Singapore in which  our  civilians

were  massacred by the Japanese army. He expressed his sincere regret  for  what

had happened. I told him that there were strong feelings on the subject and that

it  was a very emotional issue. I told him also that the Japanese Government and

people  will  have to make atonement to the people of Singapore. My conversation

was an informal one because foreign affairs as distinct from trade relations are

the  responsibility of the United Kingdom Government, and as I  have  stated  in

answer to another question by the Member for Pasir Panjang, the question of  war

reparation  including  compensation  for  atrocities  and  war  damage  was  the

responsibility of the United Kingdom Government which in 1951 signed a treaty of

peace with Japan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, morally, we should get some sort of compensation. From



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>



the  reply  given by the Prime Minister, we can see that the Japanese Government

is  very obstinate in this matter. So is the Government prepared to take further

steps regarding this matter?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am sorry that the Member for Pasir Panjang did not

listen  to my reply, or perhaps he did not listen very carefully to the  translation of my reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be fair to the Japanese, I did not find the Prime Minister's attitude to me

"obstinate" - I do not know how the word was translated. I did not find him either

obstinate or obdurate. He expressed his sincere regrets, and I indicated to  him

that  beyond  the  expression of sincere regrets  there  should  be  an  act  of

atonement to the people of Singapore. I know certain elements would like to  see

our trade relations with non-Communist and anti-Communist countries disrupted: I

see  no  reason at the moment for embarking on any such action which the  Member

for Pasir Panjang has suggested.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, the Prime Minister said that he had an informal conversation

with  the Prime Minister of Japan. He also told this House that the question  of

compensation, according to the Constitution of Singapore, is in the hands of the

United  Kingdom Government. But from what I know, the Government has brought  up

this matter of compensation with the United Kingdom Government. So can the Prime

Minister  tell this House: What is the present position of negotiations  between

the  United  Kingdom Government and Japan? When can a report  be  made  on  this

matter to this House?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, if the Member for Choa Chu Kang will recollect, I

indicated  that  we  had  written  to the United  Kingdom  Commission  who  have

communicated with their Government and they wanted evidence to show whether  the

bones  found referred to massacres which were already known at the time  of  the

war  crimes  and  before the Treaty of San Francisco or whether  they  were  new

massacres in the sense



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 287</b></font><br><br>

that they were unknown at the time of the war crimes and the Treaty of

San Francisco.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been in correspondence with the persons who are interested in these

matters  and who wish to exhume the bones and they have gone round  to  get  the

evidence  of survivors. The evidence is being collated, although, as far  as  we

can make out at the present moment, there is no clear evidence of any one of the

massacres  being unknown to the authorities either at the time of the Treaty  of

San  Francisco or at the time of the war crimes. But the matter is  still  under

investigation.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Will the Prime Minister indicate what was the reaction of the

Prime Minister of Japan to his suggestion of material atonement!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think the Member for Anson, who spent some time, I

believe  living  amongst  the Japanese - albeit unwillingly - understands  that  the

Japanese people are extremely polite on formal occasions. I can only say that  I

found  him  most  receptive  to everything that I said  in  the  usual  Japanese

civilian way. [Interruption] I found in the typical Japanese, politeness of  the

host  and  not  of the conqueror. I found him extremely courteous and  listening

attentively  to  my points, and he indicated that he would pass  his  views  for

close examination by his Foreign Minister and, in due course of time, I have  no

doubt there will be an official reaction.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Can the Prime

Minister inform the House what action



the Government intends to take if the Japanese Government ignores the request of

the people for compensation?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is a hypothetical question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, from a statement given by the Japanese, it was  stated  that

this matter was settled by the Treaty of San Francisco. So from this, we can see

that the request of Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 288</b></font><br><br>



has not been met and that no compensation has been made towards the victims' families. What steps are the Government going

to take!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I would be delighted when the time comes to listen to

any suggestion of martial activities as have been suggested by Members opposite.

Yesterday I heard protestations of great love for peace and peace-loving methods

and  I am quite sure that when the time comes for them to play a different role,

they will not be altogether barren of ideas of aggressive action. We are open to

-  as  it  is  the  duty of any democratic government - all suggestions  from  all

quarters which we think would be to the benefit of the people of Singapore, and

if  the  Member for Pasir Panjang lacks sufficient "martial" qualities,  we  are

even prepared to attach him to the Second Infantry Battalion for training.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Question No. 2, Mr Tee Kim Leng.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>EXHUMATION OF MASS GRAVES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>OF JAPANESE MASSACRE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>VICTIMS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b> asked the Prime Minister if he will state the reasons for

not  yet approving the application of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce to  exhume

the  mass  graves  of victims of the massacres in the last war by  the  Japanese

army.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the applications of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce

to  exhume the remains of victims of massacres by the Japanese in the  last  war

were  generally  approved on the 6th of June. However, as  I  explained  to  the

Chairman  and  representatives of the Chamber who saw me yesterday,  there  were

certain  technical matters which they will have to clear before the licence  can

be issued.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker. Sir, the Prime Minister says that because of some technical matter,

the licence is now being held up for the time being. Can the Prime Minister tell

this House what the technical matters are?





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 289</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I have said that there were certain technical matters. I

have  informed  the Chamber of Commerce of them. They are having a  meeting  and

they  will  be communicating with my Secretary and I do not think it is  of  any

importance to this Assembly a: this stage to delve into these technical details.

lt will not help matters.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, can the Prime Minister tell this House when the licence  will

be granted?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, from time

to time, I try my best to be a prophet and in this particular case all I can say

is that I see no difficulty so long as the parties concerned can reach agreement

on certain technical matters which have to be agreed to.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>DEMOLITION OF UNAUTHORISED</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>STRUCTURES ON GOVERNMENT LAND</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b> asked the Prime Minister how many unauthorised structures

on Government land have been demolished by the Land Office since June, 1959, and

how many are due to be demolished.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, a total of 615 unauthorised structures were detected

on  State  lands  and  demolished from June 1959 to  27th  June,  1962.  One  un

authorised shed is due for demolition next month. Demolition action is taken  as

and when unauthorised structures are detected. It is therefore not possible  to

predict when further unauthorised structures will be detected.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Can  the Prime Minister take a sympathetic view of the fact that the farmers put

up  unauthorised  houses because they are ignorant of the  law?  Can  the  Prime

Minister issue them with temporary licences?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I will quite willingly oblige everybody and forgive

everybody, and in the case of the Member for Pasir Panjang, if there are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>



any  vacant  lands for schools, hospitals, clinics and community centres  which

are  due  for  building  but  which unfortunately have  buildings  occupied  by

farmers  in their ignorance of the law as to State land, and if he  gets  me  a

mass  petition  from  the people in the neighbourhood saying  that  they  would

forego  willingly  the  schools, hospitals, clinics and  community  centres  in

order  that  the  farmers  should not have to bear the  consequences  of  their

ignorance  of going on to other people's land and building on it, then  I  will

give serious consideration to this petition and to each specific case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quite sure the Member for Pasir Panjang knows that when he was in the

People's  Action Party he participated in an important series of conferences  in

which we decided that there should be a once and for all amnesty to everybody an

terms an a clear warning to everybody else that any structure that went up would

be  smacked down the moment it was detected. I have no doubt that all his  other

pledges are of little value to him now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say that if he, as the Member for Pasir Panjang, could convince me that the

people of Pasir Panjang are quite happy to have their vacant lands, which  have

been left vacant for certain specified purposes, unlawfully occupied in this way

and  the  public  utilities and amenities frustrated, the Land  Office  and  the

Planning Department will give serious consideration to these petitions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, the Prime Minister says that I agreed to the  demolition  of

huts.  This  is rather confusing the issue. I remember that when I was  in  the

P.A.P. no  such decision was arrived at any meeting. At that time, I  suggested

that  unauthorised  huts which were at least five years'  old  should  be  given

temporary occupation licences.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> There were

minutes  kept of our meetings at which the Member for Pasir Panjang was present.

A series of decisions were made as to old unauthorised structures on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 291</b></font><br><br>



State land and the position was regularised. Speaking now from memory, they were

as  follows:  they  were all to be given T.O.Ls: they were  all  to  be  let  in

accordance with the size of the building. Half the rent was to be set aside  for

refund  to  the  occupant when he was asked to vacate and when building  was  to

commence.  All  those  provisions  have  been  implemented, and  all   unlawful

structures before June 1959 have been regularised. After that date, the position

was  made clear to everybody, by debates in this Assembly, in the newspapers and

by  land  bailiffs  informing all and sundry, not least of all the  contractors,

that  any  unlawful  structure put up on any State land will  be  demolished  on

detection. And all the while that he was a Member of the Government, that policy

had  been expeditiously executed as I indicated - 615 houses had been demolished,

of  which some 470 were demolished at the time the Member for Pasir Panjang  was

supporting the Government.

<div align="center"><b>TRANSFERRING OUT OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>TEACHERS WHO ARE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>RELATED TO EACH OTHER</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Method adopted and Numbers)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b> asked the Minister for Education to state (a) the method

adopted  in transferring out from a school, teachers therein who are related  to

each other; (b) how many such teachers have been transferred this year; and  (c)

how many have not been transferred.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I answer the question proper, may

I  be permitted to explain as follows? On the 24th August, 1959, a circular  was

issued  to  all  school principals requiring them to declare  a  list  of  staff

employed  in  each  school  of those who happen to be close  relatives,  defined

as: - spouses,  parents, brothers,  sisters, or  children.  The  purpose  of  the

circular  was to ensure fair and proper running of schools by breaking up  teams

of close relatives working in the same school, as far as possible.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the first part of the question as to the method adopted in

transferring  out  teachers  who  are closely related  in  accordance  with  the

circular: in the case of Government schools, such teachers are generally posted

to  different  schools by the Ministry itself. In the case of  Government  aided

schools,  the  transfers  are  usually arranged mutually  between  teachers  and

principals of schools concerned, subject to approval by the Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the second part of the question: as most transfers of this nature

were effected during the two years 1960 and 1961, there were only four transfers

for this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the last part of the question, from available records. 36 teachers affected

by the circular have not been transferred with the knowledge and approval of the

Ministry  for  a variety of reasons. The status quo is, however, only  permitted

subject  to there being no complaints against these teachers. Otherwise  one  of

the  affected parties would have to be transferred out or be required  to  leave

the service of the school altogether.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Education said that there were four transfers

this  year. Could he tell us whether every one of these four teachers  is  still

teaching at the moment, or is he now unemployed?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Has the Minister the question? It seems to be a different

question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The four teachers who have been transferred have been put

to other schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker. Sir,I know of a case in which a transferred teacher seems to have

been dismissed. He is not teaching any longer.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have said in the past that Question Time is not the time

merely to give information. A case like that could, easily have been brought  to

the notice of the Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 293</b></font><br><br>



or  stated  specifically in the Question, so that the Minister will be  able  to

answer  it.  A general question followed by particularisation is not  quite  the

proper course to take.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, I would like to ask a question concerning those teachers who  have

not  been transferred out. Can the Minister acquaint the House with the  reasons

for not transferring them out?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I have stated, Sir that those who have not been transferred

have  been allowed to stay in the schools concerned for special reasons  and  if

there  were  no  complaints against them. In certain cases like island  schools,

husbands and wives were permitted to stay together because certain teachers were

not  prepared to serve in island schools. In other cases, it was because  it  is

difficult  to replace such teachers if  they are specialist teachers  in  Upper

Secondary  schools,  or  for  health reasons and so  forth  where  it  was  felt

justified  to  permit  such teachers to remain, subject to no  complaints  being

received that the teachers concerned, being relatives, are ganging up seeking  a

favoured position in schools, and so forth.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Has  the  Minister concerned paid attention to the fact that some  teachers  who

were supposed to have been transferred had, in fact, been dismissed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, in my reply I mentioned that in the case of teachers

who  have  not  been  transferred with our knowledge and  approval,  there  were

conditions  attached  to them, which were that 'there should  be  no  complaints

lodged against these teachers in the schools. Should there be complaints and  if

after  investigation,  they were found to be true,  then  one  of  the  affected

parties would have to be transferred out or leave the service of the school.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has made

mention of teachers in island schools.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 294</b></font><br><br>



I would like to find out whether the Minister has noticed that apart from these

island  school  teachers there has been a case where a  couple  have  not  been

transferred, but in another case where the teachers are brothers, they have been

transferred out. If the Minister wants the name pf the school concerned,  I  can

give it to him.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I should prevent all these what are technically

called  "fishing"  questions. If the Member has a particular complaint,  he  can

either  complain  direct  to the Minister, or put it  down  in  a  question  and

particularise. I cannot allow fishing questions like that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b> asked the Minister for Education how many Chinese

Secondary  Four  graduates  are  teaching in  Government  and  Government  aided

schools, and the dates of their appointments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are 38 graduates with the

Government  Secondary  IV  Chinese  certificates  teaching  in  Government   and

Government   aided  Chinese  schools.  The  breakdown  figures  and   dates   of

appointments of these teachers are as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Government schools, one was

appointed on 8th February, 1962; 20

appointed on 12th February, 1962; and

8 appointed on 8th March, 1962, making

a total of 29.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Government aided schools, 2 were appointed on 2nd January, 1962, one an

10th January, 1962 and 6 on 24th April, 1962, making a total of 9.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be added, however, that more than 80 per cent of those who have

passed the internal School Secondary IV examination in Chinese Secondary schools

are continuing their studies in Upper Secondary I classes this year.

procedure  followed in letting out a new office of the Housing  and  Development

Board at Lorong Tai Seng to the P.A.P. Paya Lebar Branch.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, I am indeed surprised that the Member for Pasir Panjang

is  still  not  aware that the normal procedure for applying for  Housing  Board

office  and  shop  accommodation is through public tenders invited  through  the

medium of the Press and by notices pasted on the premises themselves. It is  the

practice  of the Housing and Development Board to award tenancy of the  premises

in question to the highest tenderer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vacant premises at No. 330-35 Lorong Tai Seng, together with other vacant

Housing  Board  office and shop premises, were advertised for  letting  on  20th

March,  1962. Prospective tenderers were invited to submit their offers  to  the

Housing  Board for these premises. There were three tenderers who offered  $40/-

per month, $50/- per month, and

$55/-  per  month respectively for the premises. The highest tender of  $55/- per

month  was  from the Treasurer of the People's Action Party, and  in  accordance

with  normal  practice this tenderer was awarded the tenancy of the premises  in

question.

<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, yesterday some Members of the Opposition cited

precedents  from other countries where only one question was put to the  people.

Precedents  were  quoted from both East and West. But I have explained  that  in

most  of  the countries quoted by Members of the Opposition, there is  only  one

nationality, one culture and one religion. We should not forget that the  people

of  our  country  are different in race and religion. Therefore,  the  basis  of

democracy which should be practised here is to respect the views of all sections

of  the population. If we ignore this basic principle of democracy, then it will

be a death-blow to democracy in our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, to return to the question which will be posed to the electorate; let us say that it will be on merger. All are unanimously agreed that merger must come. The question to be answered is what kind of merger. We must be aware

that  the  Government have been elected by the people and that  they  have  left

their  destiny in the hands of the Government. Therefore, the Government  in  im

plementing  the  task entrusted to them must always bear in  mind  that  the  in

terests  of  the  people come first. The Government have on  many  occasions  re

iterated  that we must respect the views of all sections of the people.  I  hope

the  Opposition will also respect the rights of all sections of the  people.  We

should  not think in terms of what we want. For instance, yesterday, the  Member

for Jalan Kayu quoted the example of buying an article in a shop and that if the

article  offered to us is unacceptable we go to the next shop. We  can  go  from

Sungei Road to Robinson, Sir, but there is a difference in the price. The prices

of  articles in Sungei Road vary very much from those in Robinson. The price  of

an  article depends on its quality. So it is with merger. If we want a super mer

ger,  then we must be prepared for sacrifices. But instead of fighting  for  the

rights  which  we are enjoying now, we are asking for other rights.  As  I  said

previously,  our wives will remain our wives. But we should not  be  asking  for

other people's wives. If the Federation of





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>



Malaya  can be likened to a shop and if the products sold in that shop  are  not

suitable,  where  shall we go? We do not want Singapore and  the  Federation  of

Malaya  to  be a second Palestine. We must admit that this referendum  is  on  a

national  issue and not on a political issue. In facing this national issue,  we

must  be realistic. We must respect one another's views and rights. We must  not

make  this  Referendum Bill an issue for winning the next election. We  must  be

fully aware of this as we are the elected representatives of the people in whose

hands  the people have put heir destiny. Therefore, Mr Speaker, in facing  this

issue, we oppose the proposition that only one question is to be put to the elec

torate. We must submit a number of reasonable questions because we are concerned

with  merger.  There must be agreement on both sides and the view of  the  other

side  should be taken into consideration as well. If I take my child to a  shop,

he  might  want to buy expensive articles. But I must first find out  whether  I

have enough money in my pocket before I can buy them for him. So, if what I have

just  said  materialises, then Singapore and the Federation  will  be  a  second

Palestine.  There  will  be no peace between these two  countries.  'Therefore,

political  leaders, in facing this problem, must be sober in  the  interests  of

national unity and peace for the country.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, let me say

something on this disgusting National Referendum Bill. It does not look  like  a

national Referendum Bill. It is something like a repressive Bill. It does not re

ally  reflect  the views of the people. This Bill can only force the  people  to

choose two unacceptable alternatives. The people in the whole of Singapore  know

that this Bill is a very undemocratic Bill. The Government have put on the cloak

of  democracy.  But,  as  a  matter of fact, they are selling  the  contents  of

democracy. Therefore, this Bill is a plot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have reason to believe that this national Referendum Bill

has  been  created  by some of the leaders in the P.A.P. in order  to  trap  the

people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 299</b></font><br><br>



Therefore,  I  hope  that the Back-Benchers of the Government  Party  will  come

forward to uphold justice and the people's democratic rights.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, now let me come back to the clause. The clause which we have been discussing is one of the most important clauses. Mr Speaker, Sir, if the

amendment  proposed by the Opposition is not acceptable by the Government,  then

it only proves that the Party in power does not dare to face the people. It also

proves that the P.A.P. Government has lost its own confidence in the White Paper

merger  proposals. Mr Speaker. Sir, regarding the questions why the leaders  of

the  P.A.P. have to go back on their word, why they want to distort facts,  why

they dare not bring up their White Paper proposals for the people to decide, let

us  see  whether  the  people want their proposals or  not.  Mr  Speaker,  this

question  has been debated in this House for a long time, because the  Party  in

power itself knows that its own White Paper proposals are not in accordance with

the  views  of  the majority of the people. If the Government put forward  these

proposals they are sure to be rejected by the people. Therefore, the leaders  of

the  Government  shamelessly go back on their word. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the  Gov

ernment  leaders have decided to pose two questions to the people for  their  de

cision.  This is clear to everyone and we have spoken at great length  on  this.

But  originally the Government wanted to pose only one question,  but  now  they

have  decided to pose two questions. The P.A.P. leaders are very clever  people.

They can think out all sorts of devices. What is the device? It is that they try

to  create  confusion over the title of the Bill. The Government has  altered  a

specific  Bill for the specific question of merger to a general Bill. This  Bill

has  been  changed by the Government into a general Bill, so that the  Party  in

power  can  pose one, two, three or four questions to the people.  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  because the Government have changed the fundamental nature of  this  Bill,

therefore  they  are trying to quote instances from other countries  to  justify

their stand . This  is meant only to confuse the vision of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 300</b></font><br><br>



people.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, let me quote some examples  to  show  you  how  the

Government are trying to confuse the people's vision. This is a copy of the  Sin

Chew  Jit  Poh  of  7th of June in the local field. A speech  by  the  Political

Secretary to the Prime Minister was published on this page in which he said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Here the Government has decided to hold a national Referendum on the question

of  merger. However, we must be clear that this National Referendum Bill is  not

only  meant for this merger issue; it is not only applicable to a referendum  on

the merger issue, but it is also intended to be applied for future referenda  on

other issues.'



<br><br>And  in  discussing this Bill the question of merger was mentioned. This  is  be

cause it is necessary to cite examples. It is not a central question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know that this Bill was brought up because the Gov

ernment  wanted  to carry out its White Paper merger proposals,  but  today  the

Government  try  to  describe  it  as a general National  Referendum  Bill.  The

Government at the same time have inserted certain provisions into this  Bill  in

order to distort it: that is to say, if there is only one question posed to  the

people,  then  it means a waste of public money. This is said by  the  Political

Secretary to the Prime Minister. He is trying to distort the spirit of this Bill

into  something else. Now, let me quote him. This was on the 9th of this  month.

It  was published in the local news, the Sin Chew Jit Poh. Mr Speaker, Sir,  in

this article he said about the Select

Committee:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There is someone who mentioned two examples. One example is the question of

Malay  as  the official language. Everybody agrees that this should be  so.  But

when Malay is made the national language, evervbody agrees that it should be the

official language. But there might be a divergency of views on when this  should

be  implemented. Therefore, the Government should seek the views of the  people.

Therefore,  the  Government will have to ask the people  whether  it  should  be

implemented  in  5  years  or  7 years or 10 years.  The  second  example  is  a

hypothetical example, and that is the control of toddy shops. This example shows

that  if  only  one question is posed and if the answer requires only  'yes'  or

'no',  it  might become very restrictive. These two examples show  that  if  the

answer  is a straightforward 'yes' or 'no', it will not effectively reflect  the

views of the people, If in the national Referendum we provide only one question,

then the Government has to hold 3







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 301</b></font><br><br>



or  4  national referenda and each national referendum will cost about $400,000.

Why  should  we spend so much money unnecessarily to pose only one question  and

the answer is 'yes' or 'no'? Why should we do that and spend so much money?'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from this speech we can see very clearly that the Government

have  put  in an entirely different question in this Bill. This is very  unfair.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, we can see the P.A.P. Government are trying to twist the Bill

into  something  else  and it becomes something else. That  is  why  the  P.A.P.

Government want to turn a specific Bill for the merger question into  a  general

Bill. Mr Speaker. Sir, I want to point out to you that the Government have lost

their  confidence  in their own merger proposals but they are  not  prepared  to

abandon  them. The Government have put their own interests above  those  of  the

people. They are trying to achieve their ends without regard to the means.  They

do not care whether it is justifiable or reasonable and they do not care whether

it is democratic or not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now we listened to the Parliamentary Secretary to the

Prime  Minister when he rebutted a remark by the Opposition. The example  quoted

by  the Opposition of buying things is merely to show that we have a freedom  of

choice  when  we buy things. But what we buy must be something which  we  really

want  to have, but the things which are offered by the Government are not wanted

by  the people. The Government themselves know that they have no faith in  their

own  goods.  Only the P.A.P. Government are anxious to have this  thing  because

they try to make use of this method to salvage their political fortunes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance in his speech yesterday made many

abusive,  distorted and smear remarks about the Opposition. He said the  Barisan

Sosialis  and  Mr  Marshall have maintained that the right to  say  no  is  the

fundamental  and basic right of the people. The right to say no is the  fundamen

tal right of human beings, but the P.A.P. would not like the people to have such

a right. From this you can see why we do not understand what the Minister for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 302</b></font><br><br>



Finance has said. The example should be taken to mean to refer to the Government

themselves.  That would be more proper. The Government want to  have  a  certain

type  of  referendum in order to deprive the people of their democratic  rights.

Mr  Speaker,  you  can see that the Government - the Party in power - are  preparing  for  their outrage. They are not a clean Party. That  is  why  they  are

trying to deprive the people of the right to say no and to force them to say yes

in order to meet their own desires and wishes.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to note two points. The first is I want to touch upon the purpose

of the amendment. Later on he said everything was in a mess.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to avail myself of this chance to reason with this muddle-headed Minister for Finance. The purpose of our proposing this amendment is very simple because we want the Government to pose only one question, to ask

the  people  whether  they  want the Government's White  Paper  on  merger.  The

Government  should  not  try to confuse the people  by  setting  more  than  one

question. That is the purpose of our amendment, but our particular Minister  for

Finance  of  Singapore  up to now has not understood  this,  and  that  is  very

pitiful. I hope he will not avoid our questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has also touched upon another point, namely,

"that  the Barisan Sosialis is now in a quagmire." That is what he said. I  will

not  touch  on this point. He said, "Let me straightforwardly say that  we  will

very  easily  frame the question on this issue whether you want to  accept  this

White  Paper merger. And the answer can he 'Yes' or 'No'. If the answer is 'No'.

if you prefer this one to the other one, you can have what you want from the two

alternatives."  I can rebut him on this point. You can see that the  P.A.P.  Gov

ernment  are very worried. They are now struggling very hard to save themselves.

But I will say this: if the P.A.P. will not change and try to improve themselves

and  make  things  better  for  all, then their  struggle  will  only  end  with

themselves dead.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 303</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is another question - the last question - which is a true

question. Here it says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The true question is not "Yes" or "No" to merger hut whether the Communists

and their stooges will have the chance to pretend to have complete merger and to

sabotage the national referendum.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this question should be explained in this way. The true

question should be one that would require "Yes" or "No", it is not a question of

whether  the Communists have any chance to sabotage the referendum.  The  P.A.P.

themselves are the culprits. They are trying to wreck the national referendum by

means  of this Bill because they do not have confidence in themselves. They  are

now trying to destroy the national referendum and yet they say others are trying

to  wreck  it.  This  is very improper. They tear their own clothing  and  blame

others for doing so.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we on the

Government side have all along maintained that this Bill is a general Referendum

Bill  and  that it would be improper to incorporate in it a provision  like  the

amendment  proposed which would have the effect of limiting  the  scope  of  the

Bill.  The Member for Anson argued that if it was clearly the intention  of  the

Government  to use this Bill for the purpose of holding a referendum on  merger.

would  the  Government  not  have  acted more appropriately  and  fairly  if  it

introduced  a specific Referendum Bill to hold a referendum on merger?  He  said

that  this  was done in all countries where referenda were held.  Is  there  any

merit  in  this  argument? All Bills which deal with referenda matters,  whether

they  are  called  general Referendum Bills or specific Referendum  Bills,  must

provide  the  machinery  whereby questions can be put  to  the  electorate,  and

whereby  the  choice  of  the electorate can be ascertained  through  the  usual

electoral procedures. The only difference between a Bill to hold a referendum on

a  specific issue and a general Referendum Bill is that in the former  the  ques

tions  are framed as a clause in the Bill. In other words, the participation  of

the Legislative Assembly is sought by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>



Government  in the framing of the question or questions before they are  put  to

the electorate. When the Opposition was seeking to create a song and dance about

this,  you  yourself, Sir, pointed out to them that the remedy lay in their  own

hands.  You indicated that there was nothing to stop the Opposition from tabling

a motion in the Legislative Assembly on the question or questions that should be

put  to  the  electorate in the referendum on merger. This you  suggested  would

provoke a debate and, by recourse to the normal constitutional machinery open to

all  Members of this Assembly, the Assembly would be able to debate the  matter,

and  the participation of the Legislative Assembly would in this way be obtained

in the framing of the questions that would he put to the electorate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis and the Workers' Party have since taken your advice in

this  matter and have tabled a motion indicating the sort of question they would

want  to  he  put to the electorate in a referendum on merger, so  that  it  can

readily be seen that there is very little substance in the distinction that  the

opposition  sought to draw between a general Referendum Bill  and  a  Referendum

Bill on a specific issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Select Committee when the amendment proposed by the Member for

Anson seeking to limit the scope of this Bill was under consideration, we on the

Government side gave very serious consideration to the proposition contained  in

this  amendment. The proposition was this: if there was to be what  the  Barisan

Sosialis and Workers' Party considered to be a fair referendum, there must be in

cluded  in the Bill a provision that there must be only one question, that  this

question  must be limited to a single issue, and that the electorate  should  be

invited to say "Yes" or "No". We had therefore to consider whether there was any

merit  in this proposition. We began by testing this proposition from the common

sense point of view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was you, Mr Speaker, who suggested the case of toddy shops. You said that

in a referendum on toddy shops, it was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 305</b></font><br><br>



possible  that  two  or  more  questions could be put  to  the  electorate.  The

electorate could be asked such questions as:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Should all toddy shops be closed?;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Should only Government toddy be sold in shops?



<br><br>The  Minister for Finance then said that if a referendum was to be held  on  the

question  as  to  when  Malay should be adopted as the  official  language,  the

electorate could be asked to indicate in two questions whether it should be in 5

or 10 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we were seriously considering the merits of this proposition, the Member

for  Anson  in his usual way became very frivolous about the matter.  He  asked,

"What about a referendum on taxi girls?" I replied: "What about a referendum  on

smoking?"  As  time went on, he became more and more frivolous,  more  and  more

excited, and went on to talk about referenda on such questions as the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you prefer to heat your wife or do you prefer to beat your mother?"



<br><br>Then you, Mr Speaker, interposed and said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the question, 'Would you like to beat or list your wife?'"



<br><br>Then the Member for Anson went on further to say:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about a referendum on this question, 'Would you like to shoot or fist

your wife?'"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a clear indication that trouble is brewing in the

Member  for  Anson's matrimonial household. I have no doubt that when  his  good

lady comes to know that such serious propositions have come from the lips of the

Member  for Anson himself, she will have very good reason to seek the protection

of  the police almost immediately. I know, Sir, that the Member for Anson  is  a

very  able  lawyer  and that it is part of his training, for which  he  receives

handsome rewards, to interpret unlawful acts in a favourable light. In order  to

get  back  to a serious note, I told him that we on our side were most concerned

with  lawful  propositions and suggested that it would be more  worth  while  to

consider the questions that could be put in a referendum on smoking.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 306</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been said by the Opposition that instead of treating this Bill

seriously,  we  on  the Government side have been talking  about  referendum  on

piddling  matters like toddy shops and smoking. I do not think that the  records

will support such a charge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we nevertheless felt that in spite of the eccentricities of the Member

for  Anson,  the  question  that  he posed in  his  amendment  required  serious

consideration and, for this reason, we proceeded to find out whether there  were

any  precedents which support his proposition and whether it is true that  if  a

referendum  is  to  be held on an important constitutional issue,  we  would  be

acting  unfairly  and unjustly to the electorate if we were not  to  accept  the

proposition  contained  in  his amendment. In support  of  the  proposition,  we

ascertained that it was true that referenda had, in fact, been held limited to a

single  question  where the voter was asked to say yes or no  in  the  following

countries in the past. For example:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Western Australia in 1933, on the question whether Western Australia

should secede from the Commonwealth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. France in 1958, to approve a new constitution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. New Zealand in 1959 -[Interruption].



<br><br>I  will deal with that. Be patient about it. New Zealand in 1959, whether or not

the  electorate supported the introduction of compulsory military training. Here

the  elector  was not asked to say yes or no, but to strike out the proposal  he

did not support, which was much the same thing as saying yes or no.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> New Zealand, you strike out one.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes or no.

Jamaica should continue to be a member of the West Indian Federation.

on Swiss soil should be banned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;France in 1962, to approve the agreements to be established and measures to be

taken concerning Algeria.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in our researches we also discovered that referenda were held in the past

where  two or more questions were put to the electorate and they were  asked  to

make a choice of one. The examples are the two referenda held in Newfoundland in

June and July 1958.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> What

about blank votes?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> In the first referendum, three questions were put and the elector

was  asked to choose one. It was stipulated that if any of the questions put did

not  receive an overall majority, the question which received the lowest  number

of  votes in the first referendum would be dropped, and a second referendum held

on  the  two remaining questions. As in the first referendum, no single question

received an overall majority, a second referendum had to be held.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next examples we found were on referenda held in Australia and New Zealand

on  the  local licensing laws. These precedents established that it was quite  a

normal  thing  in  Australia and New Zealand for referenda to be  held  on  such

questions as the hours during which premises selling intoxicating liquor  should

be  opened  and  whether particular areas should be prohibited or non-prohibited

areas for the sale of intoxicating liquor. Precedents also established that when

such  referenda were held, it was usual for two or more questions to be  put  to

the electorate and for the electorate to he invited to make a choice of one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next example was the referendum held in the Cameroons. The Prime Minister

drew public attention to this referendum in a recent public forum on merger.  In

this  referendum, two questions were put to the electorate of  North  and  South

Cameroons,  which were trust territories administered by the British Government.

The  people  in each of these two territories were asked to decide whether  they

wanted  to  join the independent Republic of the Cameroons, which was  a  former

French colony which had become



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 308</b></font><br><br>



independent, or whether they wanted to join the Federation of Nigeria, which had

become independent. Each voter was given a ballot paper which he had to place in

whichever of the two ballot boxes which corresponded to his choice, namely,  the

box  marked to correspond with the choice of joining the Federation of  Nigeria,

or  the box marked to correspond with the choice of joining the Republic of  the

Cameroons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after a study of the precedents, it occurred to us that there was a close

analogy  between the procedure adopted in referenda where two or more  questions

were put to the electorate, and where the elector was invited to choose one, and

the normal procedure that is followed in a general election or by-election.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Can the Minister indicate the number of countries that he has quoted

so far where in the referenda, irrespective of the number of questions posed - two

or three or four questions

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- the basic right of a voter to either accept, reject or abstain was denied? If

he could name the countries and the referendum, I should be much obliged.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, I will be dealing with all this. If he will be patient

and listen to me, he will get all the explanation that he wants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a general election or a by-election, the electors are asked to make

their  choice  of  candidates, whether they stand as independents  or  as  repre

sentatives of political Parties. They have to indicate their choice by marking a

cross against the name of the candidate whom they support. When this was pointed

out  to the Member for Anson, he, immediately in his reckless way, said that  he

saw  in  this  analogy  which we sought to draw "the seeds  of  a  Machiavellian

concept which will, in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 309</b></font><br><br>



fact,  mean  a  major act of perfidy towards the people." It is in the  Official

Report  of the Select Committee of 11th May, 1962, col. 161. It is in the  third

paragraph  of  the  first column. He went on to say that the analogy  was  false

because  we were, in fact, saying that in general elections, we do not permit  a

negative  reply and the voter must say yes. This was, in his view, an inaccurate

statement  of the position. His argument was that in a general election  or  by-election, the elector could put in a blank ballot paper. This was denied to  him

under  clause 29 of the Bill which provides that where a ballot is  unmarked  or

uncertain,  the voter is deemed to have accepted or to be willing to accept  the

decision of the Legislative Assembly on the matter referred in the referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that except in the case of the referendum held in the Cameroons.

where  two  or  more questions were put to the electorate and  the  elector  was

invited  to  make a choice of one, the elector was allowed to  put  in  a  blank

ballot  paper  if he wished to do so. We have already explained  to  the  Select

Committee in great detail -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Can the Minister indicate whether in the Cameroons referendum there

was compulsory voting; whether every man in the electorate was by compulsion  of

law expected to vote?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Member for Thomson will be patient, I will

come to it in due course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said just now, Sir, that it is true that except in the case of the

referendum  held in the Cameroons, where two or more questions were put  to  the

electorate and the elector was invited to make a choice of one, the elector  was

allowed  to  put  in a blank ballot paper if he wished to do so.  [Interruption]

Yes, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 310</b></font><br><br>



will  come to that. We have already explained to the Select Committee  in  great

detail  why we have found it necessary to introduce clause 29. The Bill when  it

was  first  introduced did not contain this new clause. It was  introduced  only

after  the  Opposition had moved an amendment to make it not an  offence  for  a

person  to  deface a ballot paper, whether it was his own ballot  paper  or  any

other ballot paper.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> It has been defeated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> We shall he dealing in more detail with this new clause when we

reach it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> If we ever reach it!



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Sir, the fundamental objection, in the view of the Member for

Anson,  to adopting the procedure in the precedents with regard to the referenda

held  in  Newfoundland, Australia 'and New Zealand, is that in view of  the  New

Clause,  the  voter would be deprived of his fundamental right of saying  no  by

putting  in a blank ballot paper. Let us look and see if there is any  merit  in

this  submission. I have already mentioned the referendum held in the  Cameroons

where  the  elector  was  asked to answer one of two  questions  and  where  the

procedure  adopted was that he should put his ballot paper in whichever  of  the

two  ballot boxes which corresponded with his choice. This was a referendum held

under  the  supervision of the United Nations. In this referendum, the procedure

adopted  can  be assumed to be unimpeachable. Yet in the procedure adopted,  the

voter  was  not given the opportunity of putting in a blank ballot paper.  Where

then is there any merit in the Member for Anson's argument that if an elector is

not given an opportunity of saying no, by putting in a blank ballot, then he  is

deprived  of  his  fundamental right to say no and the whole  procedure  thereby

becomes tainted? In the case of the referendum held in the Cameroons, it is true

that  the  elector  could  decide to stay away if he  chose,  as  there  was  no

compulsory voting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson then went on to argue that in his view, if two or

more questions were put to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 311</b></font><br><br>



electorate  and they were asked to choose one, then there was an  obligation  on

the  part of the Government to give an opportunity to the elector to say yes  or

no  to each of the questions put. He cited as his authority for this proposition

the  many  multiple  referenda  which have been held  in  Austra1ia  under  the

Referendum  (Constitution  Alteration) Act of 1906.  Everybody  knows  that  the

Commonwealth of Australia is constituted by a constitutional instrument, it  is

provided in this constitutional instrument that wherever changes are to be  made

to  the  constitution  1tself or to laws of general applicability,  it  will  be

necessary  for the changes to the constitution or to these laws to be  submitted

to  the electorate by way of a referendum. It is also provided in the Australian

Constitution that where such proposals are put to the electorate  by  way  of  a

referendum, the elector must be given the right to say yes or no to each of  the

proposals put.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I have with me now a copy of the ballot paper which was used in a

referendum  held in Australia in 1946 when proposals were made to the Australian

electorate  to decide on changes to be made in three laws concerning the  social

services, organised marketing of primary products, and industrial employment. In

each  case  the  electorate was asked to say yes or no to each of the  questions

put.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> So that, Sir, the position in Australia is that neither the Common

wealth  Parliament nor any of the State Legislatures can make any law on matters

which,  under the constitution, require popular approval by way of a  referendum

unless  a  referendum is first held. Sir, that is certainly not the position  in

Singapore. The Singapore Legislative Assembly has the power under section 47  of

the  Singapore (Constitution) Order in Council to make laws for the peace, order

and  good  government  of  Singapore. It is nowhere provided  in  the  Singapore

(Constitution) Order in Council that any law has to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 312</b></font><br><br>



receive  the approval of the electorate by way of a referendum before it  is  to

have  legal  validity. How then can the Member for Anson support his proposition

that  when more than one question is put to the electorate, the electorate  must

be given the opportunity of saying yes or no to each of the questions put?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have already said in this Assembly that the Member for Thomson has a

far  sharper mind than the Member for Anson in these matters. Yesterday in  this

Assembly,  the  Member for Thomson said that it would be stupid  of  anybody  to

consider clause 5 of the Bill as it stands unless at the same time he gives  his

attention  to  clause  29, because  clause  29  deprives  the  elector  of  his

fundamental right to say no to each of two or more questions where he  is  asked

to make a choice by putting in a blank ballot. He vent on to refer to what I had

said  to Mrs Leon-Soh when she gave evidence before the Select Committee.  Mrs

Leon-Soh asked what should an elector do if he did not like any of the questions

that  were  put, assuming that two or more questions were put. I said  that  the

elector  could keep away. The Member for Thomson then feigned to express  great

surprise that such words could have come from the Minister for Law.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was clause 21 of the Bill which provides for compulsory voting. "Here

was a Minister for Law telling the elector that he should keep away." The Member

for Thomson is not a naive person by any means. He well knows that clause 29 was

not in the original Bill and had to be introduced. Sir, I hinted to him that  it

was  because of the presence of clause 21 in the Bill that the Barisan  Sosialis

could not organise a boycott of the election by getting those whom they tried to

dupe to keep away from the polls.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Quite simple.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> He told me in polite terms that I should mind my own business, and

that the Barisan Sosialis did not need my advice on how they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 313</b></font><br><br>



should go about their affairs. Sir, shortly after he spoke yesterday, the Member

for Nee Soon let the cat out of the bag. He accused the Government of trying  to

set  a  trap  for the Barisan Sosialis and that we were trying to  get  them  to

organize a boycott of the election so that the procedures to be found in  clause

21  of  the  Bill accrue to the Government's advantage. He himself  offered  the

explanation that if the Barisan Sosialis were foolish enough to organise such  a

boycott,  it would be the Barisan Sosialis who would suffer a crushing blow,  as

the  names  of  their dupes would be removed from the electoral register.  There

would  then be a deliberate delay in the revision of the registers and meanwhile

a snap election would be held under circumstances where their dupes would not be

able  to  vote. I can assure the Member for Thomson and the Member for Nee  Soon

that  there was no trap set by the Government because clause 21 of the  Bill  is

almost  an  identical  reproduction of a similar section which  appears  in  the

Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance passed by the last Government

in 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He has no objection to beating his wife.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> The Member for Anson yesterday, in his usual reckless way, proceeded

to  repeat  in this Assembly a challenge, which he made to the Government  in  a

letter  to the Singapore National Union of Journalists. He never makes a  direct

challenge. He always conveys it through a third person. [Interruption]  Is  that

so? He has been known to make such reckless challenges before.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Where?

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I do not think anybody

in  Singapore  really does take any heed of his challenges very seriously.  Only

very  recently.  Sir,  he  challenged the Government Front  Benchers  to  repeat

outside  the  Assembly any of the statements we made about him in this  Assembly

and he would immediately institute legal proceedings against us.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 314</b></font><br><br>



In  our  quiet and modest way, we told him to go and play and that  one  of  the

Front Benchers had already published a statement about him in the Straits Times,

and we invited him to take action against the person concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Which issue?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> To our surprise, when he

appeared  before  a  Committee recently, Sir, he made the astonishing  statement

that  as far as the law of defamation was concerned, his knowledge of defamation

was no more than that of the intelligent citizen.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Point of order, Sir.

This is a breach of privilege. The matters to which he refers are matters before

a  Select Committee which in so far as I am aware have not been reported out.  I

ask that this breach of privilege be noted.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not know

whether  the Minister for Law is, in fact, referring to the proceedings  in  the

Committee of Privileges where the Member for Anson gave evidence. If he  is,  he

is  wrong  in  doing so as the Report itself has not as yet been  presented.  In

fact, he should withdraw those remarks.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> These proceedings will

be published in due course, and I therefore withdraw these remarks, Mr Speaker,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why then, Sir, is he so reckless in making his challenges? He told the Union

of  Journalists that he would be prepared to make a contribution  of  $1,000  to

their  funds if the Government would say that it was prepared to put  these  two

questions to the electorate:

"Do you  want  complete  merger with automatic  conversion  and  proportionate

representation, or do you want the White Paper proposals?"



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, on a point of

clarification.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Minister will

give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 315</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I think the Minister should get his facts accurately. The

challenge was at a radio forum on Wednesday last - two days ago - in which the Prime

Minister was present.

It  was not a challenge to the National Union of Journalists. It was a challenge

to  the Prime Minister and to the Minister for Finance who was also present. The

question was that they should put the P.A.P. proposals and the counter proposals

as  enunciated  by the Opposition Party in the amendment to the motion  on  21st

November, 1961 -  "complete and genuine merger with Federation citizenship for all

Singapore citizens". Give the facts straight.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I accept that correction. He went on to accuse

the Government of perfidy and dishonesty if it refused to accept this challenge.

I  would  say to the Member for Anson that he is the most politically  dishonest

person  that  I  know of. Does he recall that when he was in my office  on  18th

January  this year, he told me that he was prepared to come out with a statement

supporting the White Paper proposals if the Tunku would give an indication  that

he  would be prepared to accept all citizens of Singapore as citizens of the new

Federation after a period of, say, ten years.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Within.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Yes, within or after. Let us have it that way, if you so desire. He

told  me  that he believed the Tunku was not receptive to this proposal  and  he

asked  me  if  I  could  influence my colleagues to get the  Tunku  to  give  an

indication that this proposal would be acceptable. The purpose of his  challenge

to  the  Prime  Minister  at this radio forum was to  deceive  the  people  into

believing  that  he could get better terms for them from the  Tunku  than  those

contained in the White Paper proposals. Recently he wrote a letter to the  Tunku

telling  him that the Workers' Party was quite prepared to accept that  citizens

domiciled  in  Singapore should vote only in Singapore and that candidates  from

Singapore for the Central Legislature



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 316</b></font><br><br>



should  be citizens domiciled in Singapore. He also asked the Tunku if, in  view

of  these acceptances, he would be prepared to consider a common citizenship for

both  territories. If he wishes it to be believed that it will be  possible  for

him  to  get better terms from the Tunku than we have been able to get  for  the

people of Singapore in the White Paper proposals, I challenge him to publish the

Tunku's reply. I have seen the Tunku's reply and so have all my colleagues.  The

fact  that the Tunku has given the Prime Minister a copy of his reply shows that

he  would not consider it a breach of confidence if the Member for Anson were to

publish his reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have known the Member for Anson not to be a man of courage and not to be a

man  of  convictions  at  all.  When clause 29 was under  discussion  in  Select

Committee,  he  issued  what he described as a warning.  This  warning  was  not

directed  specifically to anybody, otherwise he would have  mentioned  expressly

the  person  or  persons to whom this warning was addressed.  This  warning  was

couched in rather equivocal terms. He urged the Government to recognise that  if

in  the  referendum to be held on merger a citizen was deprived of the right  to

vote  against the Government's provisions and thereby the Government was to give

a  legalistic cloak to a dishonest maneuver, such a referendum would require  to

be  condoned by both the United Kingdom Government and the Federation Government

before  it  can be put into effect. And he said that he did not think  that  the

U.K.  Government would lend itself to a major act of perfidy in the  context  of

the day nor would the Government of the Federation of Malaya lend itself and co-operate actively in this major act of perfidy on the people of Singapore to seek

imperial  dominion  under  a  legalistic cloak. He  also  went  on  to  ask  the

Government  if it really believed that the United Nations would permit  in  this

era  an attempt at imperial annexation by the Federation of Malaya of the  State

of  Singapore. I was anxious to know to whom he had addressed this warning,  and

therefore I felt it my duty to refer to this warning



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 317</b></font><br><br>



of  his  in the following terms. I would refer the House to what I said in  col.

368  [No.  6]  of the Official Report of the Select Committee on  the  Singapore

National Referendum Bill dated 16th May, 1962. I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'On top of all that, for added measure, Mr Speaker, Sir, if the voter was

denied the right to abstain, the Member suggested that it would he necessary for

him  then to issue a warning to the Governments of the United Kingdom  and  the

Federation,  that  if fraudulent proposals on merger were  put  forward  to  the

electorate and they condoned what was done, then they did so at their own peril.

He  has  also  suggested, Mr Speaker, that such fraudulent proposals  would  he

against certain United Nations recommendations and this could also he brought to

the attention of the United Nations.'



<br><br>Sir,  the  language that he used was couched in very strong terms.  He  enquired

whether  the  United  Nations would permit in this era an  attempt  at  imperial

annexation by the Federation of Malay of the State of Singapore. After this very

forceful warning addressed to all and sundry in very general terms, this is what

the Member for Anson sheepishly said - I quote col. 370 of the same Report:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Minister alleged that I said I issued a warning to the United Kingdom

Government  and  the Federation Government that they would  at  their  peril  do

certain  things.  That is not true, Sir. My warning was to  this  Government  to

recognize that it could hardly expect an act of co-operation in a major  act  of

perfidy,  and even if they obtain that co-operation, there is still  the  United

Nations.  [he  warning  was directed to the Members here  and  relevant  to  the

issue.'



<br><br>Sir,  he was one of the Members of the Select Committee on this Bill, and it  is

most surprising that he should address this warning to himself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have also discovered that the Member for Anson is a very timid sort of

person. You have allowed this debate to range over the provisions of clause  20.

He  wanted us to believe that there was something crooked about this clause  and

suggested  an  amendment deleting the provision from this clause which  required

the  electoral  number of each elector to be marked on the  counterfoil  of  the

ballot paper as this would be a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 318</b></font><br><br>



fraud  on the electorate. Sir, he received considerable support from the  unions

for his point of view.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I hope the Minister for Law did not misunderstand me. The

debate  could  range over the amendment which is now on the Order  Paper  to  be

moved to clause 20, i.e.,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A7, line 2: after "vote", to add 'and the voter shall record his vote

in  respect  of  each question by marking a cross in one of two squares  against

each question marked respectively "Yes" and "No",



<br><br>and not over the whole clause.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Sir, I have taken some trouble to study all the points that are

contained in the proposition of the Member for Anson and I would say that  there

is  no substance in any of them. I would, therefore, say that there is no ground

whatsoever  for the incorporation of such an amendment in this  Bill  so  as  to

limit its scope.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we

are getting accustomed to exhibitions by the Government, through this particular

Minister, the Minister for Law, of personal attacks and personal spite, both for

the  pleasure of attacking an opponent who is becoming uncomfortable  and  as  a

smokescreen  to  cover  their  own dishonesty.  I  shall  first  deal  with  the

allegation  that I am "the most utterly dishonest politician" he has ever  seen.

Of  course, Sir, he never looks at himself or at his colleagues. But let us take

the one example, Sir, he has given, that I saw the Tunku and offered that if  he

would  give  us - this was not said by the Minister but these are  the  facts  he

would  not deny, these are the details - give us a provision in the Constitution

that  within  ten  years  if  Singapore voluntarily handed  back  education  and

labour - and  you will notice the words, not "before" or "after" but  "within  ten

years" - then  the citizens of Singapore would be citizens of the  Federation.  I

said  that  if  you would agree to that. I for one, and I hope my  Party,  would

struggle  with  all  our efforts to make this White Paper acceptable  with  that

provision. Now, Sir, it is true that I failed. But I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 319</b></font><br><br>



never  said  to anybody that I could get it. Then, Sir, it is  said  that  I

issued  a  challenge  to  the  National  Union.  The  inaccuracy  is  merely

symptomatic  of the entire inaccuracy of the inferences. He now accepts  the

correction of the inaccuracies. I will not call them false. Sir,  because  I

do  not  think  that  part was intentional. But the inaccuracy  affects  the

venue  and  the  exact challenge. The challenge was that the Prime  Minister

was  indicating in the radio forum that he wanted two questions  because  of

his  deep  anxiety for the democratic process and respect for the Opposition

views. Above all, he wanted to put the Opposition view. He was a nice  Prime

Minister  who  believed  in  democracy. And it was  only  fair  to  put  the

Opposition view. And I said if he would put the Opposition view,  which  was

deliberately  enunciated by us in our amendment of the 21st November,  1961,

this  is what we wanted. Now, Sir, I do ask you, could any reasonable  human

being  suggest  that because that is what I wanted I meant that  is  what  I

personally  could get? Therefore, in saying that that is what the Opposition

want.  I am being dishonest? Sir, the charge of dishonesty has almost become

so  trite that it ceases to have the gravity of effect it should have  in  a

decent  society.  Audi the Government have been repeatedly  charged  openly,

frankly  with  being  completely dishonest, and I so charge  the  suggestion

made  that because tile Opposition seek in a conciliatory effort to  achieve

alterations  of  that  White Paper which could make it  acceptable,  we  are

dishonest because we know we cannot get it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has added that I issued a warning to the Government of the

United Kingdom. I would draw

your  attention, Sir, to column 363 [No. 6] of the Official Report of the Select

Committee  on  the Singapore National Referendum Bill, and I  want  to  nail

that falsehood to his throat. This is the last paragraph:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But finally, I would urge the Government to recognise that even if they

can  get  the Federation Government and the Government of the United Kingdom

to lend themselves to this major act of perfidy, there is the United

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Can I remind the hon. Member that this is being translated?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am sorry, Sir:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But finally, I would urge the Government to recognise that even if they can

get  the Federation Government and the Government of the United Kingdom to  lend

themselves  to  this major act of perfidy, there is the United Nations  and  the

Committee  of Nineteen who have the duty to see that the implementation  of  the

Resolution 1514 of 1960 is in the spirit of that resolution, in accordance  with

the will of the people, and I would ask them [in the context, Sir, can there  be

any  doubt  who  "them" is but this Government?] whether they genuinely  believe

that the United Nations would permit in this era an... imperial annexation by

the Federation of Malaya of the State of Singapore,...'.



<br><br>Now, Mr Speaker, he tried to suggest that I was issuing a warning to the United

Kingdom even in that Select Committee. You have my answer on record.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, on the subject of my representation, which seems to hurt this

Government  very  deeply, that the Workers' Party should make attempts'  improve

the  terms.  Surely, it is nut only the right but the duty of every citizen  who

seeks  merger to make strenuous and conciliatory efforts to inprove those  terms

to a point where in his view they might be acceptable to the majority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our second representations to the Prime Minister of the Federation should be

put in their proper context. They were three in character. The first was that in

the  context  of  the  majority representation in  the  Federation  of  Malaysia

Parliament,  with  100  in the Federation and 15 in Singapore,  the  possibility

exists  constitutionally for the Federation representatives to  amend  the  cons

titution in a manner that might adversely affect the rights and responsibilities

of  the  citizens of Singapore. So we sought what is a normal provision  in  the

Constitution  that the rights and responsibilities of our people  would  not  be

adversely affected by future amendments of the Constitution except with the  consent of the Legislative Assembly in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 321</b></font><br><br>



Singapore. The Minister says he has seen my memorandum. In fact, he can have a

copy if he has not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second issue. Sir, we said that we recognise the fear, and accept it

as  being a genuine fear, of the Federation that our politicians would seek  to

swamp  or  might  swamp  the political activities in the Federation, and  their

desire  to avoid that possibility, and we said we would be prepared to accept  a

common  disability not merely for Singapore residents, but also  for  Federation

residents. This is that those residents domiciled in one State - that is  to  say,

taking the Federation as a State, Singapore as a State, and Brunei. Sarawak  and

Borneo  as  States - would not stand for election or vote  in  any  of  the  other

States.

In    the context -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> On a point of information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If I might finish first.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member is not

giving way.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If I might finish first,

Sir, because this is rather important. On the understanding that we obtained a

common Federation citizenship.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member

has indicated that he would like to finish what he is saying and then he will

give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I would like to get

this  fact clear: that we would have a common Federation citizenship and then  a

common disability, so that there would be no question of any distinction at all.

The  thing that we were anxious about was the provision of a distinct status  of

citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I know both Ministers seem to want a point of elucidation, and I

trust it is indeed a point of elucidation; then by all means.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> In view of the challenge

that I put to the Member for Anson in this Assembly, would he say now that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 322</b></font><br><br>



he  accepts that challenge and that he is prepared to publish the Tunku's  reply

to his letter?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, the reply to the

Tunku's letter was considered by the Executive Council of my Party, and  it  was

unanimously  decided not to publish it. Sir, I say this to you, that  when  they

did  so  decide, it was with a feeling of pride, a feeling of deep  and  genuine

pride - if  I  were  a  Frenchman I would have kissed every  one  of  them - that  I

recognised their strong -

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Homo!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The porcine obscenity of the Minister is, I trust, a matter of

record. I say that it is with deep pride, it was perhaps the proudest moment and

the finest moment of my relationship with my colleagues on the Executive Council

that, for the welfare of the country as a whole, Sir, and I trust I need say  no

more than this, for the continued racial harmony in this area, it was considered

inadvisable to publish that reply. I will say no more than that, Mr Chairman.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the Minister has said that he advises those people who do not like

the  alternatives offered to keep away. Mr Chairman, this matter was adumbrated

in the Select Committee, and you know that by virtue of clause 21 the person who

keeps away is not merely punished with a fine of $5. The very dangerous position

arises that he is deprived of his right of voting or standing for election - and

that  is a few of them - but the vast majority are deprived of their right to vote

until  after the next register is compiled, and the compilation of the register,

being  unfortunately  at the present time in the hands of the  P.A.P.,  you  can

anticipate that they will be as dilatory as they were in holding by-elections. A

man may expect, if he does not go to vote at this referendum, not only to pay  a

$5  fine to get back on the register but possibly for two years he will  not  be

able  to  vote,  and  the P.A.P. would no doubt welcome the opportunity  whereby

those who arc the opponents of these merger proposals,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 323</b></font><br><br>



and  consequently  the  opponents  of  the  P.A.P.,  will  thereby

disfranchise  them  selves  and  prevent themselves  from  voting  at  the  next

election, if, in fact, a next election takes place. So therein is the perfidy of

that  suggestion; that those persons whose conscience does not  permit  them  to

vote  for  the alternatives offered, who are not permitted to deface the  ballot

paper,  and  if  they leave it blank will be deemed to accept  the  Government's

view,  the suggestion is that they should keep away. In truth and in fact,  this

is  a  suggestion to entrap those who feel a deep sense of resentment  amounting

almost  to  hate  of  this Government which, utilising their majority,  seek  to

impose  their  will  on them. They want their opponents to  be  struck  off  the

register.  Then they will only have to contend with the S.P.A. And  I  will  say

this  to you, Mr Speaker, if you will permit an aside, I think the S.P.A. even

will  give  them a thrashing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> A one-man Party!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The

Minister  has said that this is a general Referendum Bill and he says he  cannot

see why it is necessary to bring in a specific Bill.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, I will

draw your attention not to the frivolity but to the red herring in the shape  of

teddy shops and zugzwangs and camels which were brought in by some gentlemen  in

Select Committee. But at this juncture I wish to draw your attention to the fact

that  neither  in  the  past three years nor even today  is  there  any  serious

suggestion  even from the Government Benches that they have in mind a referendum

on any other topic except proposals for closer relations with the Federation.  I

think,  Sir, that must be admitted. If that is so, why not bring in  a  specific

Referendum Bill for this purpose and not a general Referendum Bill? Because they

want  the best of two worlds. I did show you yesterday, Sir, and I do not intend

to  repeat  it, that the Minister for Law - and, Sir, the reference  in  case  he

wants to check, because I do not cheat by saving it is there when it is not: the

reference is the 16th of March, page 21 of the revised transcript [Vol. 17,  No.

3, col. 270] -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 324</b></font><br><br>



he  pointed  out  to you that the New Clause (A), which is now  clause  29, was

produced specifically for the purpose of dealing with anti-merger elements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,

according to his speech on the 16th of March, it was a specific Referendum Bill.

What  has he since said? The lighter side of life has its value, Sir. Permit  me

to  deal  with  some  of these stunts. At column 108 of the  Select  Committee's

Report [No. 3 of 8th May, 1962] of the Singapore National Referendum Bill,  you,

Sir,  pointed out: "I must pull the Member back to the idea that this, in  fact,

is  a  general  Bill,  and as the Minister for Finance has indicated..." - having

forgotten   what  his  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  his  Prime   Minister   had

said - "another  matter which might go to a referendum could be the five-day  week

in schools." And then, this goes on:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dr Goh Keng Swee: Sale of toddy!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Byrne: Do not forget smoking!"



<br><br>Who introduced toddy and smoking?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, look at column 118 -

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> What about beating your wife?

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Shooting her. [Laughter]

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, the infantilism of the Minister concerned, so symptomatic of his

Government, is a matter for contempt by the serious-minded. It is - how shall I

say it, Sir - a matter for embarrassment for responsible citizens to recognise

that their Ministers are unaware of the contempt which they attract by this

infantilism. But it is not a matter for embarrassment to their opponents who

recognise now, I think to the full, not merely the perfidy but also the

shallowness and the contemptible infantilism of these Ministers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> What about you?

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Now, Sir, at column - [Interruption]

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b>Order.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am sorry, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister for Law had his

say and, if I recollect correctly, the expression he used was such that





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 325</b></font><br><br>



probably the Member for Anson could have been just as disorderly as the

Minister for Law is now so disorderly. Well, let us try and have some decorum

in this Assembly. Mr Marshall.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Thank you, Sir. I was

referring to column 118. You see. Sir, the whole of that paragraph of Mr

Byrne is that if the Member for Anson does not like smoking, for instance, he

might agree to pipe-smoking or cigar-smoking. Who introduced these absurdities?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Column 139, Sir, you will see:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'For instance, there may be circumstances where it is not possible to put a

single question - the Member for Anson admitted that just now. Take the case of

toddy shops. Questions could be: "Should toddy shops he closed?"'



<br><br>Now that is another falsehood, Sir, that I introduced these red herrings. And

the real issue is this. Sir. The tragedy of this debate is not that we have

failed to convince the Government. During the last six months I think all of us

have grown to a full realisation of the bottomless depths of perfidy of which

this Government are capable and intend to perpetrate. So it is not that there is

anything new in our being unable to convince them of the validity of our

arguments. The tragedy is the speech of the Member for Cairnhill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I said yesterday, and I meant every word of it, that the action of the Member for Cairnhill in Select Committee was of a character which drew my admiration and my respect. 'No matter what our personal differences and our

obvious political differences are. I respect and admire a man who will tight

honestly for what he thinks is right and makes it clean. And the Member for

Cairnhill made no bones about his views that some of the provisions of this Bill

were filthy, were dishonest, and he said so yesterday -  only there is a

difference. In Select Committee, Sir, he did move amendments which had merit,

but I see, and I saw yesterday, that the words will continue to he sweet. He

will continue to recognise in his statement for publication that the Government

are dishonest and that the Government intend to cheat the people, but he votes

with them. If



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>



the Government are dishonest and the S.P.A. votes with the Government, what does

that make the S.P.A.?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, he said to us in his first speech that he could not understand why I should associate myself with the request for one question, and one ques tion only, when I knew that one question only would mean wrecking the referendum, wrecking the merger proposals. And he was good enough to answer a direct

question with a direct reply. When I asked him whether he thought that the

voting of the majority against the merger proposals would be voluntary or not,

he said, "Of course, the Member for Anson knows, and we all know, that it would

be voluntary. It will be because everybody hates the P.A.P. so much. They are so

sick of the P.A.P. they want to bury them quickly so that Singapore may be

cleaner and they will vote against the merger proposals to get rid of the P.A.P." Now, the P.A.P. say of course the merger proposals will go

through because it is only the Communists who are going to vote against them.

But I do ask the Member for Cairnhill, whether persons will vote against the

merger proposals because they hate the P.A.P. or for any other reason  they not

to have a democratic right to vote against the proposals? If putting one

question would wreck the merger proposals, does he mean that putting one

question would give the people the right to say "No", and he does not want them

to have the right to say "No"? If that is the position, then, Sir - that seems

to be the logical inference - what is the difference between the stand of the

S.P.A. and the stand of the P.A.P.? Granting that the S.P.A. do not have the

arrogance and do things with courtesy, the position seems to be the same. We

want to cheat the people for their own good! That, in essence, seems to be the

common stand of these gentlemen who face each other across the Floor. As a

responsible Party leader of a responsible people, which the Member for Cairnhill

is so proud of, he has damned the

P.A.P. up hill and down dale. And I agree with him. And yet he votes with them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 327</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, he says that it would be better and would not wreck the referen

dum  on merger if we were to have three questions. How would that help, Sir?

If  we  had  three questions, does he mean that then the people  cannot  say

"No"  to  the  White  Paper proposals? I am glad that we are  in  Committee,

because  I  do  appreciate  the frustrating position  where  you  are  asked

questions which are rhetorical and you cannot answer them.

Here  the  Member for Cairnhill has the right to reply, and I mean the questions

not  as rhetorical questions, but as questions for his consideration. If you

have  three questions, would the people have the right to say "No"? If  they

have  the right to say "No", then they would reject the P.A.P. proposals  in

the same way, would they not? But then that is just what he does not want.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, he says he is prepared to offer them the alternative of merger

like  one of the Borneo States or merger like a State within the Federation.

Mr  Speaker,  we  have  seen  how the English of  this  Assembly  has  been distorted,  so that you need a special dictionary when you are dealing  with a  statement from the Front Bench of the Government. A dictionary  of  words

just  as you need a dictionary of words when you are in Communist China - when

you  hear  "socialist", that means "Communist"; when you  hear  "democracy",

that  means  "dictatorship". Here you hear "complete merger"  and  they  say

that means "cut your citizenship in half". That is the P.A.P. dictionary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, at least the P.A.P. merger proposals have been spelt out to some extent in White Paper Command No. 33, although I notice that the Prime Minis

ter  is  very reluctant that the real draft constitution should be disclosed

to  us  before voting day. I do not know what more there is in store in  the

way  of  perfidy  for our people from this Government in that  constitution,

but  I  do  note with some anxiety that we are refused sight  of  the  draft

before  referendum.  But  I  ask, how can he then offer  other  alternatives

which  have  not  been  spelt out and feel safe that  the  Government  would

implement  the other alternatives in the spirit in which they are  intended?

If the other alternative is complete merger or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>



merger  like Brunei, does he know to what extent it would be distorted? Because,

let us recognise that when the Barisan Sosialis first used the words "Penang and

Malacca", they used them in reply to the Deputy Prime Minister's letter and they

said,  Mr Speaker, this is the context, "an immediate, full and complete merger

with  Singapore  joining the Federation as a constituent State like  Penang  and

Malacca".  Sir,  the  context was "a constituent State";  the  context  was  "an

immediate,  full and complete". Now, Sir, there were no Penang or  Malacca  citizens;  so  there can be no question that anybody was deprived of his citizenship

in  the  Federation. If you want to take any State, Sir - there were, say,  Johore

citizens  or citizens of the Sultan who immediately became citizens  when,  say,

Johore  and  Negri  Sembilan -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I wonder whether the Member

could  not reserve those comments until we deal with the motion to be  moved  by

the  Member for Queenstown wherein he asks this House to condemn the Government

for  its "dishonest and malicious distortion" of the Opposition's stand  on  the

merger issue. Otherwise we will never finish.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes, indeed. I have

brought it up in the context of a question to the Member for Cairnhill: how does

he  anticipate that the posing of another question, two questions,  or  a  third

question, that is to say, questions that have not been clearly spelt out,  would

be helpful in the context of this referendum? And finally, Sir, he did in Select

committee  move  an  amendment which was negatived by the Government's  majority

that every voter should be allowed to vote "Yes" or 'Nay" to each question.  But

he  agreed  that  there  should be one issue, but any number  of  questions.  In

fairness,  let  us  get  it  clear, that insofar as  one-third  of  the  present

amendment  goes,  he  did not agree that there should be one  question.  But  he

agreed  that  each referendum should be limited to one issue and  that  a  voter

should be required to answer "Yes" or "Nay".







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 329</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, that is the crux, I repeat crux, of the whole exercise. If the voter

has the right to put a cross for "Yes" or for "No", to say "Yes" or 'No", then,  Sir,

whatever the Machiavellian efforts of the Government, I  think,  on balance, the people

would be safe. If the voter does not have the right  to  say "Yes" or "No" to each question

and he is compelled to have a choice, then,  Sir, the  choice can be so presented, as the

Member for Cairnhill himself said,  that the  only  possible one, the least unacceptable one,

would be the one which  the Government  proposes.  Now,  the Member for Cairnhill  knows  that,

and  it  is interesting  to  notice his change of stand on this crucial  issue.  Whereas  in

Select Committee, he was prepared to support, and in fact, propagated a specific

amendment to enable the people of Singapore to say "Yes" or "No", here  we  have

fair words, as fair words as were in Select Committee, but shorn of the deed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Minister for Law has the gall to say that in Australia and the Cameroons they did not have the choice to say "No". Sir, I will be happy to

pass  this book down. I thought I read it yesterday hut I just want to show  the

ballot  paper. I can assure you I will not trespass on time more than necessary.

Sir, Australian Commonwealth Acts 1901 to 1950, Volume IV, page 3585;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where there are several propositions to the people of Australia, each one

must be answered with a 'Yes' or a 'No'."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, he says "But that is in the Constitution". Ha! I do not understand

the argument, Mr Speaker, forgive me. That is so. It is in the Constitution.  A

constitution enunciated for the welfare of the people and for their just  govern

ance. He says in Singapore we have got a right to make laws for good government,

and  obviously  for  bad  government, of the country. We  are  not  bound  by  a

constitution. Does that mean, Sir, that we have a right to be dishonest  and  to

provide for machinery whereby in the words, the classic words now, of the Member

for  Cairnhill, the Government can have flexibility for dishonest manoeuvre? What

is wrong with following the Australian provisions, Sir? What harm could possibly

be done? We showed to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>



you, as we sought yesterday to say - I know that the Front Bench is deaf - that  the

Cameroons was a trust property, that the United Nations could only give them two

alternatives:  there were no other alternatives available, and those  two  alternatives were given to the people without compulsion to vote.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the cameroons were in a specific and unusual position. Our Prime

Minister  unfortunately  has  said that if you  ask  624,000  of  our  Singapore

citizens what kind of merger they want, they will get 624,000 types of merger. I do not agree with him, but let us take him at his word. It is not therefore

two alternatives! There are, according to the P.A.P. Prime Minister, 624,000  alternatives you can give: therefore is it not proper at least that in our efforts

to  seek their opinion we should give them the opportunity to say "Yes" or  "No"

to  each proposition which is going to affect them and their children for  ever,

Sir?  This is not a matter of a Licensing Bill; this is not a matter of toddy-shops;

this  is  a  matter  of our future. Can the Minister indicate,  apart  from  the

unusual position of the Cameroons, that, in fact, he knows very well where there

was  the  question  of  a  constitutional change in Switzerland.  And,  Sir,  in

Switzerland is it not provided in the constitution that they shall say "Yes"  or

"No"? In Switzerland there was a special law passed in 1892 to implement Article

120, and it was that law which says that every referendum must require an answer

of "Yes" or "No". We have told you because we have already shown it to you - West

Australia, Jamaica. Sir, why cannot we follow all these countries? "Because this

is  a general referendum Bill!" We now go back to the curious somersault of the

Deputy  Prime  Minister.  I  am  told  that  was  unfortunate.  It  came   about

unfortunately because he did not hear the expose earlier on of how  I  indicated

that  they had all said that it was a specific provision for a specific purpose.

I think he said "one prospect only", Sir;

I  take it whichever way you read P.A.P. English, "one prospect only" means  one

purpose only.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> All right, let us make it one

purpose.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am obliged to the Deputy Prime Minister if he agrees then

that  this  Bill should be for one purpose only. His colleague on his  left,

the  Minister for Health and Law, has said that in that case, of course,  in

every  referendum in respect of which he has come across,  you  specify  the

question  in the Ordinance and you specify that it shall be "Yes"  or  "No".

If that is so, Sir, then I am quite happy to accept that position.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I did not say that.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> You did not say that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Very well, no. That is

an  unhappy  answer to the argument, Mr Speaker, Sir. I  am  here  at  this

moment  first to clear myself of the filthy charge brought up  and  to  show

you  how filthy and unreasonable it was: and secondly, to draw the attention

of  the  S.P.A. whom I had hoped - though strongly at variance  with  other

Opposition  Members on, the issue of the acceptability and validity  of  the

White Paper proposals for the welfare of the two territories concerned

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- were nevertheless themselves deeply concerned at the effect on

parliamentary democracy and on our people generally of the dishonesty  which

is  intended  by  the  Government,  as  I  have  already  indicated  in  the

provisions of this Bill.

I  had anticipated that they would translate their words into action not  to

support us in our opposition to the merger proposals, but to support  us  in

giving  the  people  the  right  to say "Yes"  or  "No".  To  deny  to  this

Government  the right to cheat the people because they say  if  you  do  not

cheat them, they will be robbed. So it is better that we should

cheat  them for their own good. That is the essential purpose for which I  stand

and  I  know, Sir, that there are many Members who have not spoken from  the

S.P.A. side,  and I do hope to hear from them, perhaps in clarification  of

the  position which would correct the unhappy effect I received last  night.

Until last night, Sir, I thought that if we go down, at least we go down  as

a  united group, a united group which will highlight the basic dishonesty of

this Government, and not - The Member for Thomson has risen, Sir.

that  the Minister for Health and Law has got his warring glands functioning  ab

normally today and I do not want to earn his displeasure, at least not more than

is  necessary.  But  he has asked me to be patient, and I believe  I  have  been

'patient  for  the  last  twenty minutes but he has not answered.  So  before  I

proceed any further, I would like to ask him to answer the question now.  If  he

does not like to answer - he is always at liberty not to answer - I do not have  the

ability  to have a legislation enforced like the one the P.A.P. has for  him  to

enforce. If he does not want to answer. I think he can indicate he does not want

to answer. All that I want him to do - he was quoting precedent after precedent as

he  did  in  the Select Committee that afternoon - is to stand up and  name  the

countries and the referenda where the voters' basic right of free choice  either

to  accept or to reject or to abstain was restricted by legislation, whether  by

compulsory  voting, or whereby, say, blank votes would be recorded. I  shall  be

much obliged, Sir, if the Minister will answer this.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not propose to call any Member now, but I would like to

indicate  that  after the tea-break, after hearing Members who  have  been  chal

lenged  to speak or who desire to speak. I will then consider whether or  not  I

will accept a closure motion, because it seems to me that we have exhausted  all

the  arguments.  The  only thing that remains is to answer charges  and  counter

charges.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I just wish to say, Sir, that I have a few comments to make on what

the Minister has said.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is just what I have said: if there are charges and counter

charges, they can be aired later. But I think we have exhausted the arguments. I

now intend to suspend as it is 5 o'clock.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and took the Chair of

the Assembly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 333</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5-(contd.)



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are on clause 5, an amendment to add a new sub-clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might as well indicate to Members the order in which Members caught my eye - the Member for Thomson, the Minister for Finance and then the Member for

Cairnhill.  If  the Minister for Finance wishes to speak, he  speaks  after  the

Member for Thomson.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member for Cairnhill would like to speak after the

Member for Thomson.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister might

lose his chance.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I do not mind.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister does not mind. Mr Bani.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

quite certain that the Ministers would speak as little as possible because they

have -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Let us try and

skip irrelevancies, shall we? Let us go ahead.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with you here that we do not want to be

irrelevant.  I must point out, nevertheless, Mr Speaker, Sir, that  the  issues

that we are debating at the moment are issues that affect all our people and the

importance of the issues, I think, cannot be underestimated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Law just now did not attempt to even answer my question.

This, I believe, Sir, is because he has not got an example to give.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. leaders are very slimy and slippery customers. They have been

trying to confuse the issues by drawing red herrings across the trail.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 334</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of

order,  Sir.  Did I hear the Member for Thomson referring to slimy and  slippery

characters with reference to the Government?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am afraid I never

heard  that expression used with reference to Members of the Assembly. If it  is

used  with reference to Members of this Assembly, then, of course, it is out  of

order. Would the Member for Thomson say whether it was with reference to Members

of the Assembly?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I said the leaders of the P.A.P., Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of

order,  Sir. Would it be in order for the Government Front bench to use  similar

lurid  terms  of abuse with regard to, say, the Barisan Sosialis leaders?  Would

that be in order?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Well, that has been

done.  It  has  been  done in the Assembly, time and again. The  Standing  Order

itself  is  a  curious Standing Order. It is very flexible.  I  think  the  word

"flexible" has been used in this debate. Standing Order 46 (4) reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It shall be out of order to use offensive and insulting language about

Members of the Assembly.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is a particularity - you must be guilty of using offensive language

about Members of the Assembly. But, of course, a Member does not need to have  a

great  sense  of  imagination  if  he  uses  expressions  generalising  and  not

particularising.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a further

point  of order, Sir,I take it that so long as there is no direct reference  to

any  Member of the Assembly, it would be in order to use phrases such as  "slimy

and slippery characters". Is my understanding on that point of order correct?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have no intention to enter into a slugging match with the

Barisan Opposition whose powers of abuse are greater, but if they want to  start

it, we are quite prepared to take it up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> You started it first.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 335</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I will not make any decision on anything in

anticipation. All I can suggest to the Minister for Finance is that  he  can

try, and  if the Speaker, within the context of the speech, decides  he  is

out of order, well, then, he is out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Be that as it may, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the Referendum Bill before this Committee  is  probably  the

most

undemocratic piece of legislation passed by a legislature of this nature in  the

name  of  parliamentary  democracy in the whole world.  Sir,  even  in  Nazi

Germany,  as  has already been pointed out a number of times by  the  Member

for  Anson,  the right of the people to reject a proposition  was  given.  I

know  this hurts the Ministers very much, Sir, and naturally they would like

to  try  and ensure that the case is not put forward as clearly as possible.

So  far in the past, at forums and elsewhere, they have been getting away by

giving  apparently .a coherent argument because they have forced  discussion

in isolation of one clause against another.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I did say yesterday that as far as we are concerned, we do not seek

to  confuse anybody. We are quite prepared to sit down and argue this out as

clearly  and  as  simply as possible so that nobody would be  confused,  not

even the most stupid of persons who live in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the examples of the New Zealand referenda quoted by the

Minister for Law were already dealt with by me yesterday, and I do not  want

to  go  back and deal with them once again, but I must emphasise once  again

that in

the  New  Zealand referenda, the basic and fundamental democratic  right  of  a

voter  to either accept or reject or to abstain was not denied to him either

by legislation or by any other force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the Minister for Labour quotes the Cameroons example, and to my

question  as  to  whether there was compulsory voting, the Minister  himself

said  that  there  was no compulsory voting. It is true, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

from  what  I understand, in the Cameroons, the voters were asked to  choose

between two propositions, and in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 336</b></font><br><br>



polling booth, two boxes were put, and the voter was expected to put his vote in

one  of the two boxes depending on what proposition he chose. First of all.  The

reason why they put the boxes was that in the Cameroons the rate of literacy  is

very  low and because they did not want to confuse the people by asking them  to

vote in writing or vote by marking on a ballot paper, they made it a very simple

affair  by  making the boxes represent the propositions. Because  there  was  no

compulsory voting in the Cameroons - this does not mean we are against compulsory

voting:

I  have  already stated earlier that we have nothing against clause  21  of  the

Bill - a voter, if he did not like both these propositions, need not have gone  to

vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every voter wants to exercise his right to vote. No voter wants to go and

put  in  a  blank vote. No voter wants to stay away unnecessarily, and no  voter

wants to tear away a ballot paper. Every voter, I am quite certain, is conscious

of  his  civic rights and he wants to exercise that voting right. But if  it  is

sought  to force him to vote one way or the other, if it is sought to indirectly

compel  the 624,000 voters in our electorate to vote for one of two unacceptable

alternatives, then undoubtedly there is going to be a large percentage of voters

who  would  be  helpless. And if one wants to tear away a ballot paper,  if  one

wants to put in a blank vote, it is not because he does not like to exercise his

civic right, but because he finds that he cannot choose between two unacceptable

alternatives.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Supposing there were four alternatives.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I did say, Sir, yesterday, irrespective of the number of questions,

the  fundamental right of the people to choose or not to choose must be  guarded

by  any legislation made by a House like this and not, in the name of democracy,

seek to deprive this basic right of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if it were people who have preached fascism - a fascism of a degree worse

than the Nazi fascism - then we can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 337</b></font><br><br>



understand. If the P.A.P. Ministers would stand up and say, "We seek to deny the

people  the  fundamental right of free choice," then we at least  would  respect

their  courage. They do not have the guts to say it, but they use  the  name  of

democracy. They say they want to put the Communists in a zugzwang. Mr  Speaker.

Sir, I am not interested whether -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You are already in a zugzwang!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - the P.A.P. get the support of the people for their White Paper

merger or not.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as we are concerned, we have no doubt whatsoever that the people will

reject  it,  no matter how the questions ultimately are going to  he  posed,  no

matter how many questions are going to he posed. Yesterday, I said that we  have

great respect for the intelligence of the people and we do not think any man - let

alone the P.A.P. Ministers -  can fix the people by undemocratic provisions in the

undemocratic Referendum Bill. Sir, it is suggested that it is necessary to  have

more than two questions and it is necessary to have certain other provisions  in

the  Bill because they want to fix the Barisan Sosialis and they want to fix the

Communists.  This  is a very serious proposition, Mr Speaker,  Sir.  The  Prime

Minister  himself - none other than the master of the P.A.P. - has said that  there

are  only 300 Communists in Singapore. I ask then, Sir, whether they are in fact

fixing  the  300 Communists or if they are fixing the lives of over 1.6  million

people in denying the

624,000 voters the basic right of free choice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Mr Speaker, Sir, I said that notwithstanding the number of

questions,  the fundamental right to choose freely, to say yes  or  no,  or,  if

necessary,  abstain,  must  be  given to the  people.  And  that  is  the  basic

proposition the Barisan Sosialis is making. We do not like two questions. We  do

not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 338</b></font><br><br>



like  three  questions and we do not like four questions because we  think  that

will confuse the people.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> They do not like anything.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I am sick of hearing sills and stupid remarks -



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> So are we.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Long-winded.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - of we being afraid of a referendum. It is simple for one to make an

accusation. We tell them, Sir. "Be brave enough and have the decency to  have  a

fair and proper referendum."



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You will get it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> And that, is exactly what we are asking. The Minister for Finance

says that we are going to get it. Let them show it by supporting this amendment.

Let  them  show  it  by supporting the amendment to clause 29.  It  is  not  the

Communists or the Barisan Sosialis who are going to be in a zugzwang.  Those  of

us  in the Barisan Sosialis are not worried because we know one cannot cheat the

people all the time. We know what the consequences are going to be, and we  know

who is going to pay for this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not afraid of a referendum. We do not want to block a referendum. We

want  a  referendum. We insist that the people must be consulted, but in a  fair

and decent referendum. We oppose this Bill, Mr Speaker, Sir, not because we  do

not want a referendum, hut because the Bill is undemocratic and because the Bill

will  not bring about a fair and reasonable referendum which will ascertain  the

views of the people. They have said, "What is wrong with putting two questions?"

I  tell them, Sir, fundamentally, there is nothing wrong. But first we must  not

forget  clauses 21 and 29. It is a very desirable democratic right of the people

to choose freely. They should have an uninterfered right to choose 'yes', 'no' or

to  abstain.  That is fundamental. That we cannot compromise. If that  right  is

given to the people, then we say, "You want to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>



have  two  questions, first question- White Paper merger;  second  question-

you  want  to  put  the Bartizan type of merger, put the  Bartizan  type  of

merger  as  has been stated." At least they must have the common decency  to

let us tell what we mean by complete merger.

It  is utterly ridiculous for them to suggest, "This is what we mean by  com

plete  merger-half the voters lose their citizenship rights."  I  would  not

venture

To distort what their version of anything

Is. I would have, as I said, the common

decency to ask them to define what they

want. What we want has already been

defined in clear and in unambiguous

terms in the amendment we moved to

the motion sometime in November. At

the right time, we shall say that once

again. But let not lies and distortions

cloud the issues. Today the Government

want to have a referendum that would

get a majority support for the White

Paper merger. It is imperative. This is

something on which the survival of the

P.A.P. depends.  And because of that, they are prepared  to  sacrifice  the

interests  of  the people. Because they are committed to a referendum,  they

have  to hold one. If they hold a referendum, they must make sure that  they

get  the  majority. So under the Referendum Bill before the Committee,  with

the  provisions  as they stand now, if ten per cent of the voters  vote  for

the  Government's proposition (No. 1, White Paper merger), 30 per cent  vote

for proposition No. 2, and 60 per cent abstain because of the provisions  of

this  Bill,  it will in fact mean that 70 per cent support the  White  Paper

merger.  This is no zugzwang for the Barisan Sosialis. This is  no  zugzwang

for the Communists. This

is zugzwang  for  the people. And whoever supports this Bill,  I  will  say  in

simple language he is a traitor.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  Member for Anson posed certain  questions  to  me  last

night.  E  replied to them. It would seem that he was unhappy and  it  would

seem that he read into it a change of stand, and it would seem also that  he

expressed  some  unhappiness  that there should  be  this  disunity  in  the

Opposition which he had hoped he could see  in this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 340</b></font><br><br>



debate as a result of the debate in Select Committee on this Bill. Sir, the fact

that  the Opposition are arguing among themselves is clear. There are Opposition

and  Opposition. Sir. There are Opposition that are responsible  and  there  are

Opposition that are irresponsible. There are Opposition that are imbued with the

desire to serve the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Which I desire.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> There are Oppositions that are imbued with the desire not to

serve  the people but to get themselves heard, to put up a performance as  great

heroes fighting for the welfare of the people



An hon. Member: Just like the Barisan Sosialis. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - and in their desire to kill one another, there is this

exchange of pleasantries between

P.A.P.     Members  and  ex-P.A.P. Members even while I am speaking  to  a  very

important  charge  of the Member for Anson on a very important  national  issue.

Sir, he, quite rightly, showed surprise that I did not carry on the fight that I

took  in  Select  Committee,  and  I tried to explain  as  briefly  as  I  could

yesterday, that because I was anxious that the time of this Assembly should  not

be  wasted unnecessarily on party politics, he misunderstood me. Now,  Sir,  you

will  remember  in  Select  Committee there was this Government  and  Opposition

Members-- myself excluded

--going at it hammer and tongs, and I, as a responsible Opposition, thought that

the  best  way out would be to suggest a compromise that could be acceptable  to

both sides. Of course in Select Committee and without notice being given. I  did

put  up  my  suggestion and that caught the Members by surprise. The Member  for

Anson  was  quick and said that he liked it. He argued on my behalf. The  Member

for Queenstown, representing the Barisan Sosialis, said that he saw merit in it,

but  later on in his speech he saw no more merit in it. And there was the Member

for  Hong Lim who did not quite like it because he said my suggestion would open

the doors wide for dishonest manoeuvring.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 341</b></font><br><br>



If  I  can have your indulgence, Sir, I will just quote short passages from  the

Official  Report. You will remember that at one stage the Minister  for  Finance

said - this  is  at  column 150 [Official Report of the Select Committee  on  the

Singapore National Referendum Bill (No. 3) dated 8th May, 1962]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Dr Goh Keng Swee: I think the Member for Cairnhill has succeeded in

confusing everybody.'



<br><br>And you, Sir, said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I think he has . . . In fact, the Chair is confused. I must say that - definitely confused!'



<br><br>So,  it would seem that in order to try to make confusion less confounded, I had

only  succeeded in making confusion more confounded. Then the Member  for  Anson

tried to explain. I am indeed indebted to him for trying to explain my stand. He

gave his reasons. And you, Sir, said at column 152:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Member for Cairnhill is interpreting his amendment in that way, and I

think the Member for Anson has interpreted it in a different way.'



<br><br>So, my suggestion was capable of various interpretations, so much so that  even

when  we  adjourned  and  met on Friday, 11th of May, we discussed  this  matter

further  and this was what the Member for Hong Lim said at column 157  [Official

Report  of  the Select Committee on the Singapore National Referendum Bill  (No.

4)]:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I feel that the amendment to the amendment moved by the Member for Cairnhill,

although he is trying to bring both views to a compromise, still leaves room for

manoeuvring, and as such I oppose it.'



<br><br>The Member for Queenstown was quick to follow at column 158. He had this to say:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Therefore, the amendment to the amendment again does not solve the problem

and  it will not achieve the objective of getting a true and correct answer from

the electorate.'



<br><br>And the Member for Anson, at column

161, had this to say - it was coming to

the end of the debate:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Now, in answer to the Member for Cairnhill. My suggestion

is that in  matters of  grave  national moment, there must be precision in the questions sought.

If there are alternatives to he put, then each alternative can he put



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 342</b></font><br><br>



in  a  separate referendum with the text of the proposed constitutional  changes attached.

They are of considerable clarity.'



<br><br>It  was  clear that in the Select Committee when I was trying to be  helpful  it turned out that I made everybody confused, even my friends in the Opposition.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of 4, 3 began to have doubts and, therefore, when I asked for leave to

move that amendment, leave was not granted. Right, Sir, I crave this -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think we must have the record straight. Is the Member

for  Cairnhill suggesting that leave to move the amendment was not granted?  Can

the Member indicate?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> No, no, I am sorry, Sir,I mean it was defeated. Thank you,

Sir, for your correction. The amendment was defeated not only on the vote of the

Government, but on the vote of the Opposition in association with the Government

against poor me - the S.P.A. Member in the Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I came to this sitting last Wednesday - two days ago - I was ready to

move my amendment. I had, in fact, a gestetnered copy of a similar amendment and

I  thought  I could move my amendment when this particular amendment was  moved,

but  then  because  I  saw  that even on the first amendment,  on  a  matter  of

constitutional  practice  and  procedure, there was  so  much  unnecessary  heat

generated and so much unnecessary talk and exchange of harsh words that  I  felt

that  it  would  not  be right for me to try and put in an  amendment  that  had

already  been  defeated and not supported by some Members of the Opposition,  to

try and prolong this - I would not say this unnecessary - debate on a very important national issue. Therefore, I did not move  it.

Of  course, if I were like some Members who wish to hear their own voice in this

Assembly,  I might have done it, but being a responsible Member of the Assembly,

I  felt  that  the  time  of  this Assembly should  be  devoted  to  matters  of

importance, matters that can serve the interests of the people of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 343</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore did not send in my amendment, although I was prepared to do

it.  We  have  so  far  already spent fifteen hours debating  this  present

amendment.  I  was  indeed very glad to hear you say before  the  tea-break

that  you  proposed to put the Question after all the charges  levelled  at

certain  Members  of  this  Assembly  had  been  answered  by  the  Members

concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in the Select Committee, I made it clear that I did not like the

amendment  of  one  question one issue. I did not like it  and  I  gave  my

reasons in

my  two speeches why I could not support the amendment, and I spoke in  very

strong  language  in  Select Committee because it was not  refuted  by  the

Government that I had come to know that the Government proposed to put  two

questions - "Do you want White Paper 33 where we have autonomy in labour  and

education?"  Or "Do you want the Barisan type of merger where 340,000  non-local  born citizens will lose their citizenship rights?" Sir, when I heard

that  it  was suggested that these two questions should be posed, naturally

I  was  not only very angry but I would say annoyed and gave a piece of  my

mind.  I said I would not allow the Government to go on with this dishonest

way  of  posing questions in a referendum on merger. I made my stand clear.

The  Minister for Finance has said that the Government will agree that  the questions  will  be debated in this Assembly before they  are  posed  in  a referendum.  That, I take it, is an admission that they saw  the  error  of

their  ways  and  that they are prepared to amend their  ways.  Surely  the

Barisan  Sosialis will still be able to have the opportunity to  speak  for

days on end when the questions are being debated in this Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, talking of my supposed change of stand from a "yes" to a "no", what I

suggested in the Select Committee was that, first, there should be one

issue  but there could be more than one question, but the meat of the issue

should  be  posed first - "Do you want closer association with the Federation

of  Malaya'?" Yes or No. If it is "yes", then there could be 3, 4, 5, or  6

questions; everything like "Yes", "No",



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 344</b></font><br><br>



"Yes",  "No",  "Yes", "No", and it was, I think, the Member for Anson  who  said

there could be 3 yeses and then, where would we be? Then I said we would get  no

answer.  Surely  to  spend  $400,000 of public money  on  a  referendum,  it  is

necessary  that  an  answer in clear and certain terms  should  be  ascertained.

Therefore, I did not move my amendment and now what is this referendum to be  on

merger?  We  claim that White Paper Command 33 is not merger;  it  is  a  closer

relation  with the Federation of Malaya - that we do not mind - we do not  want  to

quibble about words. It is, can we say, half merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Parties, I said yesterday, are committed to merger. Everyone, even if I

take  my  Party  Constitution's objects, wants to achieve merger with  the  Fede

ration  of  Malaya. The P.A.P., the Barisan Sosialis, the U.P.P.,  the  Workers'

Party  and even the Parties that are not represented in the Assembly say merger,

merger,  merger,  but  no Party has defined what that term  'merger'  means.  Of

course,  it must be merger. Admitted that what is meant by that is that we  want

to join the Federation of Malaya as a constituent State in the Federation in the

same way as other constituent States are in the Federation. We want that because

we  want  to  be  free from British colonial rule. Right, so  all  Parties  want

merger.  So what is wrong if the P.A.P. says, "Sorry, we cannot achieve  merger.

The  best that we could do with the Tunku is this half merger." There are  other

Parties  who  are  more bold, more brave, more militant, but unfortunately  more

unrealistic by demanding complete merger. Merger to the extent that they know it

in  the  objects of their Parties, on the platforms of their Parties. They  want

complete  and  unconditional merger. So why do they not pose that question?  Now

because  of  Brunei,  Sarawak and Borneo coming into the greater  Federation  of

Malaysia, what is wrong in posing that question to the electorate, "Do you  want

it  like Borneo, Sarawak and Brunei?" So there I say, when you pose these  three

questions - the first is White Paper Command 33, I call it half merger; the second

is complete and unconditional merger with the Federation on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 345</b></font><br><br>



the same basis as any one of the constituent States in the Federation; the third

one  is  entering  the Federation of Malaysia on terms no less  favourable  than

those  of  any  one  of the Borneo territories - those are  the  three  possible

questions that face anyone -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Member has made this point on this amendment.

1'hat  argument will arise, as I say, when the Minister for Finance  tables  the

motion.  I do not know what procedure he is adopting, but he has said that  this

Assembly  is going to debate the questions to he put to the people. So  I  think

all this can be reserved until we do debate these questions.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> With respect, Sir, the charge of the Member for Anson is

not  the  posing of three questions, but my keeping firm in "yes" or "no".  Yes,

Sir,  I am trying to answer the "yes" or "no" charge of the Member for Anson.  I

am not posing the three questions. So, well, I -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. But the hon.

Member  has  gone  a  little further. He says what is  wrong  with  these  three

questions'? That is exciting a debate. Another Member can properly stand up  and

say, "Oh, it is wrong." A Member in the Opposition might say the second question

is  wrong.  Therefore, the whole debate is opened up. Let us get  on  with  this

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I am bound by your ruling, Sir. The questions I said I heard

the  P.A.P. were intending to pose in a referendum were dishonest, but I  cannot

agree to one question, because it would give us an answer that would not be  the

correct answer. So, let us have three questions, four questions, five questions,

so  long  as the questions to be posed are settled by a full, frank and  lengthy

debate  in  this  Assembly. Sir, everyone wants merger,  that  is,  every  Party

represented  here  and  outside wants merger.  So,  let  us  make  use  of  this

referendum  and go and ascertain from the people what type they  want.  Do  they

want this half merger of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 346</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P.,  or  do they want the full complete merger of all political Parties,  or

do  they  think  now, "Maybe we have the Federation of Malaysia,  we  want  the Borneo  territories merger." On the Borneo territories, there is a lot  of  heat generated because of the moves and counter-moves, political moves and  what  not that  this Bill presents. It is said that this is a general referendum Bill  hut they are trying to prove that this Bill is meant only for the merger referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Government that the only way to take the heat off this unnecessary, lengthy and provocative debate is to give an assurance to this House that once the referendum is completed, the Ordinance will be repealed. Let us forget whether it is going to be a general Bill or a merger Referendum Bill. Let us get down to the serious business of the day. We want a referendum on merger. We want the questions for the referendum to be debated in this Assembly. We want the questions to be posed in an honest, straightforward manner. And we

want to get an answer from the people of Singapore as to what they like.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, to reply to certain charges made by the Member for

Anson. Sir, the Member has once again accused us of dishonesty, being fraudulent

and  perfidious. Sir, there is a Chinese saying called "Chuo Chei Han  Chei",  a

thief calling other people thieves. The people who are dishonest, fraudulent and

perfidious accusing other people of dishonesty and perfidy. Sir, I can very well

understand  why the Member for Anson wanted to kiss his members of  the  Central

Committee  when  they agreed not to release the text of the letter  he  received

from  the  Tunku. I can well understand that because if that letter were  to  be

published the Member for Anson would suffer the most humiliating rebuff  in  the

history of his political career - and he has suffered many humiliating rebuffs and

this will be the most humiliating of them all.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Publish it!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 347</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Now, Sir, just to give one example where the facts are

established beyond all doubt. He has admitted that the Communists have  captured

his Party.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> That is false!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I would suggest to the Minister for Finance that he is

absolutely stale. He has already dealt with that part of it and perhaps  he  can

mention it in passing and not go into details.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I only mention it in passing, Mr Speaker. I say that accusation has been completely documented and if the Member for Anson really now

denies it, then, will he please say who captured his Party?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think I must rule that out as completely irrelevant. If

the Hon. Minister wishes to pursue that, he must give notice of a substantive motion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I only raise that point because we have been accused

of  being dishonest in saying that and I say that is a completely honest  accusation, honest and well-founded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want now to come to the serious part of the debate and it is this: that

they  say  that  the referendum questions which will be posed  are  unacceptable

because  we are not going to put the Opposition's policy for the choice  of  the

electorate.  The  Member  for Anson says that they  had  already  expressed  the

definition  of  the type of merger they wanted quite clearly in  the  resolution

which was defeated in this Assembly. They maintained that if the referendum  was

honestly carried out, then that proposal of theirs for complete merger with  100

per cent automatic conversion of citizenship should be posed as an alternative.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> That is not correct, Sir. I have never maintained that that

proposal should be any part of the referendum. I say if they want to put it  in,

by all means put it in, but give the people a chance to say "yes" or "no".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 348</b></font><br><br>



The only proposal I suggest that should be put in is the one that has been fully

spelt out and approved by the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, we are not

here to quibble over a little point. He says we are wrong in proposing to put to

the  electorate complete and unconditional merger in terms of, equality of other

States  because  they  say  that  is not what they  wanted,  that  is  only  our

interpretation of what they wanted. Sir, my point, is that the Barisan  Sosialis

and  the Workers' Party have said quite clearly and unequivocally that they want

complete  merger. May I read again what the Workers' Party has said about  this?

They  believe that the ultimate solution is integration with Malaya on an  equal

basis  with the other States. They go on to say that what they want is  complete

and unconditional merger with the Federation of Malaya. So does the Barisan.

Now,  how does this clause, this addition of automatic conversion of citizenship

come  about? I suggest this proviso of automatic conversion is merely  their  in

terpretation of what complete merger means. May I quote from what the Member for

Anson  said during the debate on referendum? You will recollect that we said  we

were  not prepared to support complete merger because it meant that half of  the

citizens of Singapore could be disfranchised. This is what the Member for  Anson

said [Hansard, Vol. 15, No. 7. 23rd November, 1961, column 574]:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is not true to say that on complete merger there is anything in the

Constitution of the Federation which would permit a citizen of Singapore  to  be

deprived of his citizenship of Singapore.'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. May I suggest to the Minister that this is an argument

which  he  could possibly advance when the Assembly is debating the actual  questions?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I agree this

point  could be more appropriately raised in the debate on the misrepresentation

of the Opposition issue, but since they have said that we have been dishonest in

misrepresenting them - there is a central objection to their amendment  of  clause

5 - I say what they have put forward is their own interpretation of what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 349</b></font><br><br>



complete  merger means, and if we put forward a proposal of complete  merger  we

are going to put no interpretation on

it.  We will say complete merger on the same and equal basis as any State of the

Federation  of Malaya. That is a fair enough proposition. If they  believe  that

that  means automatic conversion, they are entitled to believe that that is  so,

but whether they are right or whether we are right is a matter to be settled  by

constitutional jurists. I mean the laws of citizenship are there; they apply  in

the  Federation:  they would apply in Singapore. But if their proposal  is  more

than

their  interpretation of what complete merger means, then all I say is they  are

simply  asking for super merger, merger on more favourable terms and  conditions

than any of the 11 States of the Federation enjoys in respect of citizenship.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I wonder if I can ask the Minister one question.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Minister will

give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged.

Could  the  Minister say whether the Government is in possession of any  jurist opinion on the issue?

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have the views of the Governinent's legal adviser, the State Advocate- General and he is a lawyer of some eminence, and we base our opinion on his interpretation. Now, these are matters of interpretation, Mr Speaker, Sir. We may be wrong; the State Advocate-General may be wrong; the Member for Anson, on the other hand, may be wrong: but equality in citizenship laws with any of the States of the Federation is something that is already defined in the laws of the Federation.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I hate interrupting the Minister, but I think the

Minister  has made his point. The Government has been accused of being dishonest

in  choosing  a  topic of that nature. I think the Minister  has  rebutted  that

sufficiently.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 350</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Now, I just want to deal with one other point, and that is

the point that I raised in my address yesterday. I said 'that this amendment  of

theirs is defective from the point of view of draftsmanship because even  if  we

were  to  accept it, we could still frustrate the intentions that they  have  in

mind,  i.e.,  if  they want one question with a "yes" or "no" answer,  we  could

frame  the question in the way I posed yesterday. "Do you prefer complete merger

to  the  White Paper merger?" Answer "yes" you get complete merger; answer  "no"

you  get the White Paper merger. So it does not carry them any further in  their

attempt to frustrate merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown) </b>rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Lee, in answer to the charges?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes, Sir, he made a lot of charges yesterday.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Well, I hope there will be no repetitions because I am stopping

repetitions.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> No, Sir. Just to show how dishonest the Government have

been, I need only mention a few words on how they have been twisting about  this

being a general Referendum Bill and this being also a Bill for merger. I do  not

want  to  repeat all the arguments, Sir, except to say that even  here  in  this

House  they have been saying that this is a Referendum Bill and also a Bill  for

merger.  There is a lot of talk about the mode and manner, Sir, and  I  want  to

debunk the argument of the Government Ministers that now our decision should  be

only  on the mode and manner. Sir, common sense will tell us that if we want  to

have  consultation on the mode and manner of anything, then that mode-and-manner

consultation should have been carried out before that something has  been  fixed

and  placed before the people. Let me bring your mind back to the day when there

was  a  request from us for participation in the affairs of the Party.  At  that

time,  Sir, we asked that we be given a chance to tell the Party leaders  as  to

what form of -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 351</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think I can allow that. We are now on an

amendment, one question or two questions or more than two questions. I think  if

the  hon.  Member  has  a  specific contribution  to  make  on  that  particular

amendment, strictly on the amendment, I will allow him to speak. But all  this,

to  my  mind,  is  completely  irrelevant, because we  have  now  exhausted  all

arguments  and all I am allowing is a winding-up more or less, and I  think  the

Member  for  Queenstown is entitled to wind up because it is his  amendment  as

well.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Very well, Sir.

I  come  back to what I said yesterday, that the correct translation of this  Referendum  Bill  is not "Chyuen Min Tou Piau" but "Chyuen Min Fu  Chyueh".  When  I

mentioned  that, Sir, the Prime Minister jumped up and asked if  I  could  quote

references.  I have the quotes, Sir, and I will show them to you now.  In  fact,

Sir,  textbooks  all  over  the  world say that the  correct  translation  of  a

referendum  is  not  "chyuen mm tou piau" but "chyuen min fu chyueh".  I  am  now

quoting, Sir, from a textbook called "On Comparative Study of Constitutions". It

is  a  texbook of China published in 1936 and is used for the Peking  University

Department of Law. It is written by Hwang Shih Chieh and Chen Tuan Tseng.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former was once a Foreign Minister of old China. I will now read to you

from  page  277  where  the  authors talk of direct legislative  rights  of  the

citizens. I will read it in Mandarin so that it can be translated for you by the

official interpreter:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Interpreter's version]-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A referendum means that any Bills or

constitutional resolutions are put to the citizens for a decision as to  whether

such Bills or constitutional resolutions are to be approved. That is referendum.

The  citizens, of course, can express whether they want to adopt them or  reject

them. That is called a referendum.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will translate it in English, Sir, to

see whether it tallies with the translation you have just heard:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 352</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A referendum means any bill or proposed change in the constitution that has

been  passed in Parliament or Legislative Assembly must be taken to  the  people

for  endorsement in order to decide whether or not such bill or proposed  change

in  the constitution is to become law of the country. This is called referendum.

That  is  Chyuen  min  fu chyueh. The expression of the will  of  the  citizens

naturally can only he in the form of saying yes or no.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think the Minister for Home

Affairs can contradict Professor Hwang

Shih Chieh and Chen Tuan Tseng. I

will quote you another two lines only. I

will read it out in Mandarin. It is at

page 295:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Interpreter's version]-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Irrespective of whether for the purpose at

election or referendum the people should have the free right of voting. That is,

to  have  free  expression of their will. The freedom of voting means  that  the

people  can  cast negative votes and also means that the people can  form  their

political  parties  and  can  also freely express their  views  and  oppose  any

political parties and things like that.'



<br><br>I will give you my interpretation of it. Sir, in English:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Whether it is an election or referendum, that is chyuen min fu chyueh, the

people  must have the right of freedom of choice, (that is of vote). It is  only

then that the result can be said to be the expression of the will of the people.

What is meant by freedom or choice of vote not only includes the right to say no

but  also  the  right  of  people  to organise political  parties  and/or  other

organisations in order to strengthen the opposition [that is to the issue].'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have only given one quotation from this book but if the Government

Ministers want to challenge me on quotations I can assure them that I  can  give

them  another  10 or 20 quotations. I think this should convince the  Government

Ministers  that  we  are  not  talking without any  basis.  It  is  the  general

recognition  all  over  the world that when you talk of a  referendum  you  mean

taking the decision already arrived at and passed in the Legislative Assembly to

the  people  so that the people outside the Assembly may accept or  reject  such

decision  on  any  proposed law in the country. This  is  very  important,  Sir,

especially in relation to the White Paper merger proposals of the P.A.P. today.

Of  course they want to get out of their own zugzwang by posing two unacceptable

questions in the referendum but I hope to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 353</b></font><br><br>



bring that in when I move my motion condemning the Government for the distortion

of our stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance says that the real issue at stake in the whole

of this Referendum Bill - and he mentioned it in relation to the amendment that is

before  us - is:  should  the  Communists be  allowed  the  chance  to  wreck  the

referendum?  Sir,  all  their arguments do not hold water.  Whenever  they  find

themselves cornered, whenever they find that their arguments are rebutted,  they

always go back to the same old theme, that this is a general Referendum Bill, or

when  that  fails, they bring up the Communist bogey. It is always the Communist

bogey,  Sir. Why? Because the Communists cannot answer back. Nobody defends  the

Communists and nobody can answer for them and therefore it is a convenient label

to  put on because, the Communists being illegal, none of us would speak up  for

them.  But  let  us see what substance they have in their arguments.  The  Prime

Minister in a speech before the foreign correspondents before he went to  London

said  that  the  Communists were never more isolated. Similarly,  Mr  Jek  Yuen

Thong,  the Political Secretary to the Prime Minister, said over the  radio  the

same  thing, that the Communists are now conscribed and isolated. Even the Minister  for Finance said something to that effect, and the Prime Minister,  in  London,  mentioned also that 99.5 per cent of the people in Singapore  are  neutral

and  that only a very small section of the people were supposed to be Communists

and  pro-Communists. Sir, the Minister for Finance now says that this is  all  a

Communist  threat.  Of course they have been contradicting  themselves  all  the

time, but one has to pin them down some time or other and we must ask them:

Who is the person who has not been speaking the truth? Was it the Prime Minister

or  was it Mr Jek Yuen Thong or was it the Minister for Finance? Tell us.  Only

one  person  can speak the truth in this case and they must tell us who  is  not

speaking the truth. Sir, it is always the habit of the Government to concentrate

their attack and their propaganda



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 354</b></font><br><br>



machine  against  any section of public opinion or public activity  that  causes

them  anxiety. By this, Sir, they hope to prejudice public opinion against  that

section of people who cause anxiety to them, and the commonest label which  they

can  think of nowadays is the "Communist and the Red". I remember I said  before

in  this House some time back that the label they used about 40 or 50 years  ago

was  "Socialist"  or  "Labour"; that about 70 or 80 years  ago,  the  label  was

"Radical",  and  that  possibly  1,900 years ago,  the  label  was  "Christian".

Nowadays, Sir, Communism has become synonymous with effective opposition and  if

the  Prime Minister himself will remember, he also was labelled Red and a  pro-Communist  when he was in the Opposition. Let us see their arguments,  Sir.  All

those  who  are  anti-Communist claim that they are anti-Communist  because  the

Communists  are dictatorial and because they rob the individual of his  freedom.

But  let  us  examine  what  has happened in Singapore  today  and  ask  who  is

dictatorial  and  who  is  robbing the individual of  his  freedom?  Is  it  the

Opposition? Is it the Barisian Sosialis? It is none other, Sir, than the  P.A.P.

The  P.A.P.,  especially the Prime Minister and the Minister  for  Finance,  are

doing  just  that.  They are not only dictatorial outside but also  inside  this

House.  I  do not think I need remind you, Sir, of the many occasions  of  their

practice of parliamentary dictatorship in this House.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think the Member should go further. I think he

has made his point. Let us come back to the amendment now.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> In this Referendum Bill, for example, there is no choice

offered  to the people. They want to offer unacceptable questions to the people,

and if the voter cannot vote "Yes" to any of the two unacceptable questions, and

if  he  throws in a blank vote, t1me Government are going to get that  vote  and

call  it  theirs. This alone, Sir, should tell us how dictatorial the Government

are in everything they do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, to answer again the charge that it is due to the Communists. Sir, in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 355</b></font><br><br>



world  today,  especially when the socialist movement is gaining strength  every

where,  there must be Communists everywhere. There must be Communists  all  over

the  world,  in  Britain itself, in the United States of America.  In  Indonesia

there  are  2 million Communists. In Singapore only 300, according to the  Prime

Minister.  So it is absurd to say that just because there are certain Communists

in  Singapore, therefore, we fire not supposed to have our democratic  right  of

saying  "No"  and  other rights of freedom. The Communists have advocated  anti-colonialism. They have advocated that the wages of workers be raised. They  have

advocated  that our standard of living should be raised. Does it mean that  just

because  they have advocated these things, so we cannot also advocate the  same'

Therefore, Sir, the argument which the

P.A.P. have  been  advancing cannot convince many people. They  cannot  even

convince themselves, and they can only hope to deceive themselves. What we light

for  are  the  interests  of the people, and if they should  coincide  with  the

interests of the Communists, then we should not be debarred from working for the

same  interests that serve the people. Even the Prime Minister himself said that

if  there are things that are good for the Communists but if they are also  good

for  the  people,  then the P.A.P. would support them; but it appears  that  the

Prime Minister only thinks of the P.A.P. these days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. have repeatedly claimed that all those who are against merger are

Communists.  Today they have further claimed that all those who are against  the

Referendum Bill are also Communists or pro-Communists. I do not know, Sir, about

the  Workers' Party and about the Member for Anson. Nobody can say that he is  a

Communist. The Member for Hong Lim of the United People's Party - nobody  can  say

that  he  is a Communist. There is today a Council of Joint Action to fight  the

Referendum  Bill  and  the  unequal provisions  in  the  present  P.A.P. merger

proposals. The Lib-Socs, -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On a point of information, yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> What is the source of the Member's information?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I went to Brunei recently. In fact, the

Press  have  been  told  to suppress the news of the Commission  of  Inquiry  in

Brunei.  I  can  tell you some interesting stories. For example,  when  the  Com

mission  of Inquiry was held, there were a few people who went up to  speak  for

Malaysia.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order,

Sir.  May  I  suggest it is not only irrelevant but it could be embarrassing  to

other  Governments  and, out of courtesy, Sir, I do think we should  not  pursue

that matter.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the objection is well taken. It is irrelevant and it

might  embarrass  and offend those Governments. Let us not go into  details  but

come back to this amendment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 357</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I have no intention of telling those stories, but for the

question from the Member for Farrer Park.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, this constant harping on the Communists by the P.A.P. is nothing

but  a  pretence and a make-believe of their own, in order that the  P.A.P. may

crush  the  effective opposition from the Opposition parties. By so doing,  they

hope  that the Opposition will be, according to the words of the Prime Minister,

contained, conscribed and rendered ineffective. Of course, when there is no more

opposition to the P.A.P., then they hope to maintain themselves in office and to

live  and rule merrily ever after. 'The intention, Sir, is very clear.  All  the

time  they  talk of the Communist bogey, but it is not because of the people  of

Singapore  or of anything else, but because of the selfish interests  of  a  few

leaders in the P.A.P. I do not think I need go further on this, Sir, but  may  I

be  permitted to say a few words on the question which the Minister for  Finance

has  been  talking about? He said, "Do you prefer complete merger to  the  White

Paper  merger?" Sir, this is a most misleading question. What we are asking  for

is  not a double-headed question but a simple and straightforward one. In  fact,

this  question  can he divided into two. It is not one question. There  are  two

questions  put  into  one. And, therefore, it is unfair  to  the  voter  and  is

completely  misleading. That is why we stress that the question must  be  simple

and straightforward in order that the voter in clear conscience can answer "Yes"

or "No". I do not want to raise any new material now except to -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> There is no more.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, order. I think the Members on the Government side should

also have regard to what the Chair is trying to do. The Chair has suggested that

there should be a winding-up and the Member for Queenstown is probably trying to

give effect to the Chair's wishes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Most of our arguments have already been given in Select

Committee, Sir, and Members can always look up the arguments, but I want to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 358</b></font><br><br>



correct  the erroneous analysis of the Member for Cairnhill. He was saying  that

the P.A.P. was committed to a referendum only after the radio forum in September

1961  and it was because the Barisan Sosialis said "No, no, no" that the  P.A.P.

dare not have one question, and hence the delay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you the correct picture of this referendum plot. I would also like

to  tell you more about how the referendum plot originated, but I think  I  will

reserve  that  part of it until I come to the amendment on the  announcement  of

details in the electoral divisions. I will just run through it quickly and  tell

you  how  the  P.A.P. was committed to the holding of a referendum  long  before

that.  It was not without reason that the P.A.P. had decided on a referendum.  A

referendum, first of all, need not involve the resignation of  the  Government,

and secondly, the P.A.P. Ministers' private interests would be served. But, as I

say, I will come to that later on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original intention, as has been correctly said by the Member for Cairnhill, was that one question on the White Paper merger proposals would be put to

the  people and that the people would be required to give an answer of "Yes"  or

"No".  That  was  clearly indicated in the many communications which  the  Prime

Minister  let  out.  He  said  that the people  could  reject  or  accept  those

proposals. He also gave a very graphic explanation in the Nanyang Siang Pau  and

the  Sin Chew Jit Poh on 25th September, 1961. There he clearly indicated to the

people  how the people could vote. He said if the people did not like the merger

proposals  put  before them, all they need do was to put a cross  in  the  space

indicating "no", and if they want to support those proposals, they could  put  a

cross in the space indicating "yes". Therefore, Sir, the original intention  was

to put the White Paper merger proposals before the people and the people were to

be  asked one simple question that required the simple answer of "Yes" or  "No".

But  since that day, Sir, there has been widespread opposition and, as correctly

stated by the Member for Cairnhill, the P.A.P. quickly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 359</b></font><br><br>



came  to  realise  that their merger proposals would not be  acceptable  to  the

people.  Therefore, the original plan had to be scrapped and a new one  substitu

ted. Since the original one-question referendum would be a risky business, more

than  one question would have to be submitted to the people. Therefore, the plot

was to pose two or more unacceptable questions to the electorate. Hence you see,

Sir,  in  the original Bill and even in the present clause 13 of the Bill  there

are "questions" to be posed.

Of course, the plot was and still is to

pose  the two unacceptable questions - one being the White Paper, which would  he

the  less  objectionable of the two unacceptable alternatives. The  people  were

expected  to choose the lesser of two evils. This is what I want to  impress  on

the  Member  for Cairnhill, if the information could be handed to  him.  The  in

tention,  therefore, under those circumstances, was to have a  snap  referendum,

blitzkrieg  style, and only five days would be allowed for the  referendum  from

the  date  of  notification to the actual date of referendum. That  was  in  the

original  Bill - clauses 6 and 13. Now they have amended the period from  five  to

seven  days  and from seven to 14 days In the original clause it was  only  five

days - to make sure that the Opposition Parties would be prevented from mobilising

all  their strength for canvassing. They made sure that there would be  complete

prohibition  of canvassing. That was in the original clause 42. Of  course,  the

whole  idea  was  to  limit  and  restrict  the  Opposition's  normal  means  of

communication  with  the masses. No canvassing would be  allowed.  It  would  be

complete  prohibition. Of course, the P.A.P., would have all the  facilities  of

propaganda  through the unrestricted use of Government machinery, including  the

radio and Rediffusion. That is found in clause 40. I do not intend to go further

into it now, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original plan for a referendum of only one straightforward question that

required  a simple answer of "yes" or "no", was, therefore, changed and switched

to  a  referendum of two questions, which made it a choice of two evils. In  the

confusion so caused, and with the short period allowed to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 360</b></font><br><br>



people, the P.A.P. had hoped that the

voters  might  vote for the White Paper merger proposals. This  was  the  actual

thinking  and behind-the-scenes plotting before the merger debate. That  is  why

the National Referendum Bill had its First Reading on the 27th of November.

I will only go so far about the plot, but

1  will  enlarge and go into further details later on. This is just to tell  the

Member  for  Cairnhill  that  when they tabled the Bill  in  the  Assembly,  the

decision  had already been arrived at to have two unacceptable questions  to  be

posed  to the people. They call this the National Referendum Bill. We hope  that

the

P.A.P. will accept the amendment and

really  give a chance to the people to say no to the question posed. This  would

then make it really a National Referendum Bill and not a P.A.P. Referendum Bill.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> I just want to take up the last point made by the Member for

Cairnhill as to the nature of the Bill. Considerable heat has been generated  in

the  debate  in the last few days that this is a general Bill. It  would  appear

that all the Opposition - the S.P.A., the Workers' Party, the U.P.P.

and  the  Barisan Sosialis - object to this Referendum Bill being called a general

Bill.  Mr  Speaker, I take it that it is the wish of the Opposition  that  this

Bill  should  not be a general Bill and that it should apply only to  the  refer

endum  on merger. Now that being the case, the Government are prepared to  scrap

the Bill on merger with the Federation.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir. Could we have that repeated?

It may be that our understanding of English is defective. Could he elaborate and

explain?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member for Anson was not

listening.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> What makes you think so?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> My point is this. Since all of you are objecting to the fact

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All the Members,

please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Yes, Sir. I am

sorry.  Most of the Opposition Members object to the fact that this is a general

Bill. They all say that this should be a specific Bill dealing with the issue of

merger  only. If this is their wish, I say that the Government are  prepared  to

scrap it after a referendum on merger has been taken. [Laughter]

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment accordingly negatived.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6-

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

though chronologically this clause comes before clause 13, the amendment therein

sought  is, in fact, an amendment consequential to the first amendment to clause

13*,  and  after consultation with the supporter of the amendment in respect  of

clause  6,  I would inquire, Mr Speaker, Sir, whether you would defer consideration  of  this  amendment until after consideration of clause 13.  That  is  the

material clause, Sir, once that is dealt with.



<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Amendment (i) to clause 13 reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A3, line 37, to leave out "seven" and insert "twenty-eight".

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>7.15 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think it might be

convenient to move the amendment and then debate both the amendments so that

when we come to clause 13, we can just take a vote. That is a better idea.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, why I sought the other way is that it might be

confusing. It is not so much that we

worry  as  to whether the Yang di-Pertuan Negara would give 28 days or  14.  The

material  aspect  is that there should be enough time for the  questions  to  be

known. We do not want this consequential matter to cloud the real issue. You see

the  point,  Sir,I would ask, in the circumstances, that it be  deferred  after

clause 13. There could be no argument once clause 13 is dealt with.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No dissentient voice to postponing? Clause 6 is therefore postponed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7-

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I am not moving

my amendment, Sir+.



<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+Dr Lee Siew Choh's amendment reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A2, line 36, to leave out "his satisfaction" and insert "the satisfaction of the

Legislative Assembly".

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member is not moving.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 ordered to stand part of the

Bill.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Clause 12, Dr Lee?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Actually, Sir, this is a consequential amendment to clauses

5 and 7. I am asking that symbols should be fair and should not work unfairly on

the subconscious mind of the voter. If symbols are to be chosen, they should  be

neutral  and have no religious or other unsavory significance in them.  Here  we

are asked to put our trust in the correct judgment of the Superintendent. It may

open  the Superintendent to criticism of unfairness if he should make a mistake.

Under  those  circumstances,  the Superintendent  would  be  placed  in  a  most

invidious  position.  To  prevent  all this unhappiness  and  possible  misunder

standing,  we  suggest  that the symbols be debated  in  the  Assembly  so  that

although  they may ultimately still have a political bias because of the  P.A.P.

majority  in the Assembly, at least the publicity of the debate will enable  the

people to know exactly what the symbols are all about. I have already previously

argued  in  the Select Committee that if the Superintendent made a  mistake,  we

might  not have an opportunity to complain to the Assembly; whereas, if  it  was

debated  in  the  Assembly beforehand, no such mistakes  could  arise.  We  must

remember,  Sir,  that  certain symbols need explanations, and,  at  the  present

moment, the whole of the Government propaganda machinery is in the hands of  one

Party and it may not allow the other Parties equal opportunity to explain to the

people unless we have a debate on this in the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member formally move the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A3, lines 32 to 34, to leave out "the Superintendent may adopt such

symbols as he thinks fit and such symbols shall be printed on the ballot  paper"

and insert "symbols as indicated by the Legislative Assembly shall be printed on

the ballot paper."



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can assure the House that the symbols

to  be chosen will not have a religious significance or bear any resemblance  to

the symbols of any political Party. They will be fair and neutral.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am very interested to hear the Minister give an assurance as

regards  the executive act of an executive officer in whose activity he  is  not

supposed  to interfere. Would he inform this House whether, in fact, he  intends

to give directions himself as to the symbols?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, it is obvious my assurance will be conveyed to the Superintendent.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, I think we can give the House this assurance that any

symbols used to indicate the questions will not have a party bias. If we were to

debate on the nature of the symbols which are going to be employed, probably  we

will  be  spending another 3 midnight sittings on this debate, as you  yourself,

Mr  Speaker,  will have noticed that on a simple amendment  to  clause  5,  the

Opposition have been going on dingdong for several hours. It might well be  that

the Workers' Party might want the hammer, and the Barisan might want the sickle,

and  between them and us, we might never arrive at an agreement for a symbol  at

all.  I  think the House can rest assured, as the Minister for Home Affairs  has

said just now, that no symbos will be used which will have a party bias.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13-



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, you

will notice that in clause 13 the Superintendent shall publish in the Gazette  a

notice  specifying, inter alia, the questions to be put at the poll. He  may  do

this  on  a minimum of seven days before Polling Day. Mr Speaker, the  weather-cock of the P.A.P. has turned from north to south, and east to west, and back to

north,  so that we do not really know where we stand here as to whether this  is

now  a  general Referendum Bill or a specific Referendum Bill. I would  like  to

suggest  that  they  go  into a huddle somewhere and make  up  their  minds  and

solemnly assure us on which one it is, so that we know how to argue. If it is  a

general Referendum Bill, you will appreciate that to give the people seven days'

notice in respect of any question is inadequate for the purposes of canvassing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>



and  explaining  to  them the meaning of that question.  If  it  is  a  specific

Referendum Bill, I would like to add this. You are aware that the Government are

taking  credit throughout the country, and when the Member for Cairnhill was  on

the  radio  forum,  he  seemed delighted at the assurance  given  by  the  Prime

Minister  that  in respect of the questions to be asked in this referendum,  the

Government  would permit a debate on them. I am sorry I was not present,  and  I

gather  from  the Minister for Finance that the assurance was given  by  him.  I

accept the correction. I have no doubt it is accurate. An assurance was given by

him  that  the Government would permit a debate on the questions to be asked  in

the  referendum. That is very generous of the Government. The truth is,  at  the

time  they  gave that assurance they were under a constitutional  obligation  to

participate in the debate, because the Opposition had given notice that it would

be  seeking  a  debate  on  a motion as to the questions  to  be  posed  in  the

referendum.  However, Sir, the purpose of my remark is not to deflate  yet  once

more  the  pouter pigeon credit that they seek, to which they are not  entitled,

but  merely to say this, that I am conscious of the possibility - I say no more - be

cause  undertakings by this Government, you have seen, can change from  hour  to

hour.  We  have been told, Sir, that this is a general Referendum Bill.  I  have

been  abused  in  a  most scurrilous fashion. They have  even  indulged  in  the

impudence  of  introducing my wife's name. I take strong  exception  to  obscene

people  using her name. On top of it now, we have the Minister for Home  Affairs

saying  to us that he will scrap this Bill as soon as the merger referendum  has

been put. Are they changing their minds from minute to minute - maybe they and  I

do  not speak the same language, Sir, - we will leave it at that. What I want  you

to notice is this. Assuming for the sake of argument that that part of the assur

ance  given  by the Minister is going to be carried out, that we do not  have  a

prorogation,  let  us  say,  before we have the motion - they  can  prorogue  this

Assembly. Now, Sir, assuming then that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>



the  people  will know what the questions are; assuming furthermore  that  those

questions will be specified by the Superintendent - because there is no legal duty

on him so far according to this Bill, but let us assume it. Then we come to this

position.  I  say that accepting this as specific for the moment, accepting  the

Government  assurances at their full value, nevertheless we  are  left  in  this

position.  Though we may know the questions, we will only have a limited  period

for  canvassing.  In fairness - and I do not want to mislead anyone-assuming  that

they  carry  out  all  the  promises made, which are not  legally  binding,  the

questions  will  be known, in fact, when His Excellency orders the  gazetting - gazettes  his  orders to the Superintendent to put to the people the  matter  of

merger by way of a referendum. The moment he says, "Order from His Excellency to

the  Superintendent that the matter of merger be put to the people by way  of  a

referendum."  Then we have got 14 days. In fairness, that would be  correct,  although  we do not know the exact questions for another 7 days. Nevertheless,  if

they  keep their word and the questions are here debated, and the same questions

are  put  by the Superintendent, we will have 14 days. That is taking everything

that is favourable. Now, Sir, 14 days. I would suggest to you, in the context of

a  trading  and commercial community where people have to earn their livelihood,

and  I  am talking of the common people - we in the Assembly on this side are  not

supposed to be earning our livelihood; the Government side is doing jolly well.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would say that in order to educate the people, how shall I say, Sir, to

the  issues  during that period and for having mass meetings, and  you  will  re

member,  Sir, that the Member for Hong Lim who sought a mass meeting in his  own

home  town, on his own home ground, has been refused a licence because  of  some

technicality which I trust

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- I do not know, maybe I am trusting

too  much  again: I withdraw that trust. But on the assumption that at  election

time the technicalities will be waived



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>



and  we  will be permitted at short notice to hold mass rallies - that  gives  us,

Sir,  a  maximum  of  two Sundays - the Sunday immediately  after  His  Excellency

gazettes the Order and one more Sunday. It gives us two Sundays and two Saturday

afternoons on which to hold mass rallies at which the people of Singapore  could

attend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I say with respect that asking for four weeks is reasonable and surely,

particularly  in  the context of the obvious insistence of the  Government  that

several  questions will be put, four weeks is not unreasonable; it is necessary.

I must touch here, Sir - though it is in the Select Committee's Report - on the fact

that in Jamaica where they had a special referendum law they specified - and though, Sir, in that law itself the question was clearly enunciated - that

the  Governor  must  lay down the date for polling at least six  weeks - forty-two

days - from  the date of the proclamation. I am here asking for no more  than  28

days between the gazetting of the questions and the polling date. Sir, I am at a

loss  to  understand the vigorous resistance to a request which is supported  by

every  possible precedent that could be thought of. I would draw your  attention

to  the fact that the Member for Cairnhill voted in favour of this amendment  in

Select  Committee.  It  is a minor thing, Sir,I know we were  outvoted  by  the

Government - five to all the Opposition four. I do say that asking for 28 days for

the  purpose  of canvassing is the basic reasonable minimum. I will  not  say  I

trust  that  the Government will accept it, but I do urge that there  should  be

unity at least on this side in insisting on it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I formally move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A3, line 37, to leave out "seven" and insert "twenty-eight"*.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when we do not agree with the Member for

Anson, he says that we are dictatorial, and when we do agree with him, he doubts

our intentions and our sincerity. Mr Speaker, Sir, in case he is still confused

over what I have said just now, and to keep his mind at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>



peace, may I say here that I will be moving an amendment to restrict the life of

the Bill to the referendum on the merger issue? I think that is clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, I should like to come back to this allegation that the

Government is not giving the Opposition time to explain to the people  regarding

the  merger  issue.  Nothing  is further from the  truth  than  this  ridiculous

allegation.  Since the Barisan Sosialis and their newly acquired  mouthpiece  in

the  Member  for  Anson  are only interested in this  specific  case  of  merger

referendum, I shall perhaps be permitted to dwell at length on this case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, the issue of merger, if I remember correctly, was being

discussed  seriously ever since June 1961, following the statement made  by  the

Federation  Prime Minister in May 1961. A White Paper on merger was  tabled  for

debate  in  the  Legislative  Assembly in November  1961.  The  debate  went  on

uninterruptedly for three weeks with the Member for Queenstown making his record-breaking seven and a half-hour speech. No one can deny that there was a thorough

ventilation of views on the merger issue in the Assembly. There was,  indeed,  a

free,  full and frank discussion. The issue was finally concluded at the end  of

three weeks with no dissenting votes on the White Paper. Since then the issue of

merger  has  been more intensively discussed in the newspapers, at radio  forums

and  at mass meetings. Indeed, in the last month the form in which the questions

will  take  has  begun to take shape. Surely, information on the issue  for  the

coming  referendum  has been given in advance far beyond the  twenty-eight  days

which the Barisan Sosialis and their newly acquired mouthpiece have demanded.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I must stop the

Minister referring to a Member of this

House by other than his constituency.

He is the Member for Anson.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if they are only interested in this

specific referendum on merger, then





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>



they  have had not only just twenty-eight days, but two hundred days, if we take

into  account the period when the Assembly debate on merger first took place  in

November  1961 up till now. The charge that the Government is not democratic  in

not giving the Opposition sufficient time to explain to the people cannot stand,

especially  so  when we have already given an assurance to this House  that  the

question to be put to the people will be debated in this House.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the mover of this amendment, the Member

for  Anson,  did  in his opening remarks say that if this Bill was  intended  to

refer  to the merger referendum, then he might have different views on the  time

required  for canvassing and for referendum meetings. It was I who suggested  to

the Government in my earlier speech that perhaps if they could give an assurance

that  this Bill would only be used once for the merger referendum, it would take

the  heat off on a number of succeeding proposed amendments. I am glad that  the

Member  for Anson has given an indication that if it was meant to be  used  only

once for the merger referendum, then we might have softer views - not so harsh - but

softer views on the matter with regard to this question of time for canvassing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the other assurance given by the Government is that the questions will be

fully  debated  in  the Legislative Assembly. They will be  fully  debated  and,

therefore,  the public will be able to get an idea of the pros and cons  of  the

questions  to  be  posed. In the light of that assurance, I wonder  whether  the

Member  for  Anson will be so insistent on the time required for canvassing  and

for referendum meetings. But I will assure him that no matter what it is, be  it

28 days or be it what he thinks is more reasonable, we will support him.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, we have all the time been saying that the Government

have been very dishonest. This clause proves it to the hilt because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>



when  we were debating this clause in the Select Committee, they said that since

we  had  had so much discussion on the merger issue, there was no necessity  for

any  further  time  for  debate  or  for canvassing.  They  were  thus  implying

indirectly that this Bill was meant for merger. And yet all along they have been

trying  to  say that this is a general Referendum Bill. Therefore, you  can  see

from this alone that if the argument suits them, they say that this Bill is  for

the referendum on merger. If the argument does not suit them, they say that this

Bill is a general Referendum Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it is not the case of 200 days or 14 days for the issue. It is not the

issue that we want to talk about. It is the questions which the people must know

about and discuss. If the questions were given early, we would be able to have a

full  debate on them. But through the pressure of our arguments and through  the

pressure  of  public opinion - in truth, they are trying to give an appearance  of

democracy  on  their  part - they have now given in to  our  insistence  that  the

questions should be debated in the Assembly. In fact, in giving the promise  now

that  the  questions will be debated in the Assembly, they have already admitted

the validity of all our arguments. I only need, Sir, to remind the House that in

all  other countries the period of canvassing allowed is either six weeks or two

months.  For  example,  in the referendum that is going to  be  carried  out  in

Algeria, the notification was given on the 15th of May, and they announced  that

the referendum would be held on the 1st of July.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question was given to the people three or four weeks before the date of

the  referendum.  Everybody  knew  what  it  was  all  about.  The  Government's

insistence of only one week now therefore cannot be defended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson referred to the Hong Lim by-election and to the Anson by-election - 7 weeks and 5 weeks. Yet the original intention was -, and I suppose it

still is - that canvassing after discussion of the question



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>



will only be one week. Even the Prime Minister himself, during the Hong Lim  by-

election, suggested that seven weeks was not long enough for the P.A.P. to  put

their  views  across to the people. He thought at that time that  if  he  had  a

longer period, possibly he might have swung the results the other way round.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main thing about canvassing, Sir, is this: if you really intend to allow

canvassing,  you  must  allow the time and the facilities  for  canvassing.  Gov

ernment  has  full  advantage of the propaganda material  in  Radio  P.A.P. and

Rediffusion; and even the Press is under pressure. I mentioned to you the  other

day,  Sir, that if the editors of certain newspapers do not toe the line of  the

P.A.P. then  pressure is exerted on the newspaper and even its  circulation  is

threatened.  For  example,  in  this particular case  of  the  Sunday  Mail,  we

understand  that the editor has now been transferred as a result of negotiations

between  the  people  in  charge of the Straits  Times  and  the  Government  of

Singapore.  Just because a headline did not suit the purpose of the P.A.P.,  all

this has happened. Sir, a lot of reporters have put in their reports of the  day

to  the  newspapers, but after sub-editing they just do not see  their  original

stories  anymore. All because of some frantic telephone calls from the  Ministry

of  Culture. This is an open secret, Sir, and I think everybody knows about  it.

So,  from  this  alone,  we can see what pressure the Government  exert  on  the

newspapers and indirectly on the Opposition Parties. When you come to clause  4,

Sir,  you will see that the P.A.P. do not intend to allow Opposition Parties  to

put  up posters. I do not intend to say very much on that now, but just to point

out that they have given an undertaking that they would allow canvassing as in a

general  election. "As in a general election" does not mean seven days; "general

election" means six or seven weeks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the questions that are going to be put in the referendum will be

debated  now  in  the Assembly, it will still take some time for  the  different

meanings, and hidden meanings especially, of these questions to be placed before

the people. When we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>



ask  permission for a rally, Sir, they always put difficulties in our way.  They

allow  us to have our rallies, but they make sure that our preparation  for  the

rally  is  very strictly limited. Permission is only given almost  at  the  last

minute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Sir, this clause ties up

with  their  original  intention to have a snap referendum.  But  now  that  the

questions are going to be debated, they relax the time period for canvassing  to

a  certain  extent. Even then in relaxing the canvassing period, they limit  our

facilities  to  the  minimum, making sure that we cannot  communicate  with  the

people as easily as we like. I hope the Government will really live up to  their

promise of allowing canvassing "as in a general election", and if canvassing  is

to  be  allowed as in the general election then it is a minimum of four  to  six

weeks.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before this Bill went to Select Committee it

provided that a notification should be published not later than five days before

the date of the referendum. The Member for Anson has now agreed with the Barisan

Sosialis that it should be amended to not later than 28 days. But when in Select

Committee, Mr Speaker, Sir, it was pointed out to the Member for Anson that his

original  amendment was that five days should be amended to ten days, if  I  can

quote from the Official Report of the Select Committee on the Singapore National

Referendum Bill of 11th May, 1962, No. 4, col. 207, Mr Speaker, Sir, his  reply

was "Never". And I asked:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Could that be checked for the purposes of the record, Sir?'

<br><br>And then he replied:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr David Marshall: That is correct, Sir,I have since recognised, Sir, the

validity  of the suggestion made by the representatives who appeared  before  us

and by my colleagues on this side of the table that 10 days would, in fact, give

us only one week in which to hold rallies, and week-ends are the only times when

the  voter can be approached with any adequacy for purposes of clarification  of

the issues.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to illustrate the way in which the Member for Anson keeps changing his

mind from hour to hour and from day to day.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, the difficulty with the Member for Queens-town

and  the  Member for Anson is this. When we agree with them, they say we  change

our  stand  to suit our purpose; and when we oppose them, they say we are  being

dictatorial. The Member for Anson has drawn particular attention to the question

of whether this Bill is a general Referendum Bill or a Bill meant for a specific

referendum, and I think he mentioned it several times during the course  of  the

debate.  If, as I have said, this Bill could he used for a referendum on merger,

the  Member  for Anson also insisted that it should be employed for a referendum

on merger. But when the Minister for Home Affairs agreed that if that were so he

would  be quite prepared to repeal the Bill, the Member for Queenstown  and  the

Member  for  Anson said that we changed our stand to suit our  purpose.  On  the

charge  of  the  Member for Queenstown that the Opposition do not have  adequate

time  to campaign on the question of referendum for merger, Members of the House

will  remember that in the debate on a motion moved some months back, we pointed

out  to  the  House that the Ban-san had jumped the gun long ago.  They  started

their campaign on April 1st -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> April fool.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> - and they had been canvassing from house to house; they went

to  all electoral divisions, and they had all their mass rallies. How could they

say  that  there will not be adequate time for them to campaign in  this  merger

referendum?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question on merger has been debated in the Press, over the radio, at

forums,  and has been expounded by the Barisan Sosialis for months on  end,  and

the  public today know full well what are the issues at stake. Moreover, we have

agreed  that  the question for the referendum will be debated in this  Assembly,

and,  therefore, ample opportunity will he given not only to the Barisan to  air

their  views  but  also for the people to know what sort of  questions  will  be

posed. Therefore, the charge of the Member for Queenstown



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>



that  they do not have time to campaign and to explain to the people what merger

is all about is rubbish.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If the Minister will sit down, I will rise on a point of elucidation, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are in Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> You mean that he can answer later?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker. Do I understand that, in fact,

they are accepting the second amendment to clause 13 -instead of "question", they

want  "questions as framed by the Legislative Assembly"? Are they accepting that

amendment?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Which clause?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I understood the Minister to say, Mr Speaker, that he agrees to

the questions being framed in the Legislative Assembly. He says it is, going  to

be a specific Bill for referendum. So is there going to he a firm constitutional

legal  requirement  that the questions specified by the Superintendent  are  the

questions framed by the Legislative Assembly?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The answer is that he is going to move a motion to debate

this  question in this Assembly, and the question which will he framed  by  this

Assembly will be used.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am sorry, Sir, I -

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I know he wants me to put this amendment. We have already

debated it in Select Committee. There will be undue delay. If we were to put the

question as framed by the Assembly in this clause now, then this Bill would have

to  go  through  the Assembly, and be assented to by the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara

before it could be implemented.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We will come to that in the debate on the next amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr

Speaker,  we  will come to that. But I do want to say - and it is  very  fortunate

that we are getting the Official



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>



Report  almost  24  hours after the speech - that I am  charged  with  having

agreed  with them and, in fact, insisted that this Bill should be used  for

a   referendum  on  merger.  That  is  a  falsehood,  Mr  Speaker - a  plain

falsehood. I have all along insisted that this Bill is inappropriate for  a

merger,  that we should have a specific merger Referendum Bill.  They  have

consistently denied it. They say that I made the issue as to whether it  is

specific  or  general - I  made  the  issue  to  show  with  contempt   their

dishonesty - how  if one thing suits them it is one thing and  when  it  does

not,  it  is another. When it was debated on the Second Reading,  everybody

said it was

specific.  Then the fantastic exhibition throughout the Select Committee -   'This

is  general. This is general." And when we come back here, the Deputy Prime

Minister - not being here when I draw attention to it - comes in and  puts  his

foot  into it, and says, "This is general, this is general". When it is  ex

posed  to  the public gaze, to a point where nobody can miss it,  they  now

say  it  is  specific. I say again, the Jamaican Referendum Bill was  short

and  simple  with  a few clauses. Why should we not have it?  And  this  is

pertinent because the Minister - I think I can say which Minister it  was,  I

think  it  was the Minister for Law -  said, "In every legislation which  pro

vided  for  a specific referendum, the question was framed in the Ordinance

itself." That was said this afternoon, Sir. That is what I am seeking,  and

that is what is being denied, and that is what is important.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this alleged concession is no concession at all. We knew exactly what

was  meant, and we pointed out that there was no other referendum  in  view

but  the  idea of having a specific-cum-general Bill is merely in order  to

have  flexibility  for  dishonest  manoeuvre.  No,  Sir,  they  charge  the Barisan,  and  they  might  as well charge me,  with  being  hypocrites  in

wanting  more  time because the Barisan have, since April Fool's  Day - April

Fool's Day, was it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> They have been canvassing. Sir, I would like you to listen to

the words of the Member for Cairnhill who rammed that lie down their throats.



<br><br>8.00 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer to the Official Report of the Select Committee on the Singapore

National Referendum Bill of 11th May, 1962, No. 4, col. 182:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Dr Goh Keng Swee: In this instance, Sir, I say it is extremely bad, because

experience  in the past 12 months has shown that, if anything, the  public  have

been  informed  of  the  views of the various political  Parties  on  merger  ad

nauseam, absolutely ad nauseam -'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member for



Anson read a little slowly?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes. I am sorry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I say that the argument that there is inadequate time is sheer humbug. The

Government will not accept it.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> It is not the issue involved that we are concerned with, but

rather  the questions. As it is, we do not know what questions are to be  posed.

Unless  we  know what questions are to be posed, how are we going  to  tell  the

electorate?  Surely all Parties, Opposition or otherwise, must  be  given  every

opportunity to explain the implications of each question.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that was a logical stand and, I must say, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill

in  his very short speech has brought a breath of parliamentary courtesy to this

Assembly which is invigorating. I do recognise that in the light of the logic he

expressed in his speech in Select Committee, he is entitled in this instance  to

say, "Now that we are going to have the questions posed, I will not support this

amendment."  But  he has extended me the courtesy of saying that  they  will  be

prepared to support it, but they will inquire whether I am insisting on it. Sir,

I  am indeed appreciative, particularly in this atmosphere, of this reminder  of

the way things could be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as to the actual merits, I agree with the Member for Cairnhill that if,

in fact, we could be quite certain, for example, if it is incorporated in clause

13,  that  the questions to be specified would be questions as framed, then  the

main argument is met. Yet, Sir, may I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>



remind him that in Jamaica, where the

question  was posed in the Act itself, the Act requires six weeks'  notice?  And

so.

Sir, you will find in Australia, several weeks are required, though the law  has

been discussed and passed in Parliament. What is my main anxiety in this matter?

I  am  afraid, Sir, again the Member for Cairnhill earlier on put his finger  on

it - I  have  become deeply suspicious of the Government's potential for dishonest

manceuvre and I want the maximum time possible to meet this possible manouvre. I

say  that  look  at it from the negative point of view, giving  28  days  cannot

possibly harm anybody. Looking from the positive point of view, Sir, 28 days may

give  us  time to meet some dishonest manipulation that might eventuate  and  it

would  give  the impetus of topicality and urgency to the canvassing that  takes

place.  Frankly,  Sir, if he was in the Government and he  was  suggesting  some

compromise, I would be inclined to cooperate completely. But in the light of the

attitude  indicated by the Government, I trust that we may have their  continual

support in respect of this motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Siew Choh</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Lee? I was just wondering whether there is any further

argument on the question.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I just want to remind the House, Sir, that this is the

first  time we are having a referendum and sufficient time must be given to  the

people to decide. I want to ask why they want to be in such indecent haste?  Why

are  they  afraid of people knowing the facts? $400,000 is going to be spent  on

this referendum and they do not want the people to know everything. They do  not

want the people to have sufficient time to make up their minds.

Sir, they say the referendum period is

going  to  be two weeks, and during those two weeks, according to the amendments

in  clause 41, posters will not be allowed. How are the political Parties going

to  canvass  without  posters?  What the Government  intend  to  have  are  only

Government posters - P.A.P. posters all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>



over  the shop. I have learnt they have printed thousands and thousands  of  big

posters. All for the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, their giving way on this clause is simply because they have this

foolproof  provision  in clause 29 of a sure win in the referendum.  I  do  not

mean  to talk now very much on that aspect of it, but just to indicate  to  you

that  their  giving way is because they want to put up an appearance  of  being

democrats. But more -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Is the hon.

Member  alleging that the Government are agreeing to the amendment when he  says

they are giving way?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Pardon?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the Member alleging that the Government are agreeing to the

amendment when he says they are giving way? I do not quite follow?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I think I had better explain, Sir. Their original intention

was  only  five  days, then it was changed to seven days, and now  the  question

itself will be debated. So all their giving way on the question is because  they

want to pose themselves as democrats. We have criticised them so much, Sir, that

they  cannot take it any more. Public opinion is pressing them and they have  to

give  in some way or other. All because they have a sure win referendum in their

clause  29.  Under those circumstances, they think they can relax, but  even  in

relaxing they want to make sure that canvassing will only be limited to  a  very

short period, and during that short period no posters will be allowed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani</b> rose-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Bani, on this

issue?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Yes. On the amendment to clause 13.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it would appear that the debate on this clause is relatively

unimportant. But I think, Mr Speaker, Sir, to dismiss this as such would

not  be fair to the Opposition case. We have put forward to the House our  views

as to why we think the

P.A.P. is wanting the Referendum



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>



Bill as it stands now. We asked that the matter to be put to the people be first

discussed  in  this  Assembly, so that the people can be fully  aware  of  their

arguments  for  and against that question, but the Government  rejected  it.  We

asked  that  only  one question be posed in the referendum, so that  the  people

would not become confused, but the Government rejected it. Now, Sir, we ask that

the  people be given more time so that they could fully understand and  consider

carefully  the  question  before they vote, but the  Government  is  once  again

rejecting it. Sir, it is important. It may be a bit tedious but, nevertheless, I

think  it  is important to realise, particularly on an issue of this  magnitude,

why in fact the Government is behaving like this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reason the Government gave for rejecting this amendment in Select

Committee  was  that if more time were given, the people would  be  confused.  I

believe  it  was  the  Minister for Home Affairs who moved  this  amendment.  He

suggested  that  if  more time were given, it would allow  unscrupulous  men  to

confuse the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> It has been done.

Peet  Fong  who made representation to the Select Committee on the  same  lines.

Sir, to suggest that if the people were given more time to consider the question

they  would become confused is, in fact, an insult to the people. Does  not  the

P.A.P. leadership at least have some respect for the intelligence of the people?

Is  the P.A.P. seriously saying that our people are so foolish that if more time

were given, they would be confused?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you are aware that prior to and even during the 1959 elections the same

suggestion  was made by the S.P.A. There was the suggestion that the P.A.P. won

the elections because they confused the people. And it was people like the Prime

Minister and various others who denied this. They said, "No, our electorate is a

sophisticated electorate; they are intelligent enough to choose the policies one

stands for and not the individuals themselves." For example, the people of  Hong

Lim were given



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>



seven  weeks  to  decide. This was longer than the time given  for  the  general

elections. Those seven weeks, Sir, were given by the P.A.P. Government. Does the

P.A.P. agree  that  it gave seven weeks longer than the period  given  for  the

general elections?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> They already got 7-plus!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Longer than normal because they wanted to confuse the people? The

Prime  Minister says they have already had longer than seven weeks. We have  had

longer than seven weeks to discuss and decide in the face of restrictions on the

Press,  and  in  the face of restrictions on the availability of  media  to  put

forward  our  views,  notwithstanding that we have had a  longer  time.  But  to

discuss  what?  To discuss whether we want merger or not. In 1959 everybody  was

saying,  "Yes.  Merger  is  the next constitutional step."  But,  Sir,  in  this

referendum  it  is  not important whether one wants merger or  not,  but  rather

whether  the  question  posed is understood. Even if  they  were  to  bring  the

question  to  this  Assembly for debate, one may not fear a  longer  period  for

canvassing, or for allowing all political Parties to explain to the people their

points  of  view.  And there is no need to have this lack of confidence  in  the

intelligence of the people to decide definitely one way or the other.



<br><br>8.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the elections were over, the Prime Minister suggested that had a

longer time - longer than seven weeks

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- been given for canvassing, perhaps the tables would have been turned on the

Member  for Hong Lim. Was he then, Mr Speaker, Sir, suggesting that  if  longer

time  had  been  given, the P.A.P. would have confused the people  and  won  the

elections?  I  have not heard arguments more absurd than the one the  P.A.P. is

putting  forward in defence of this undemocratic Bill. This is because they  are

vulnerable and their arguments are untenable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in opposing this amendment moved by the Member for Queenstown, the

Minister for Home Affairs said in Select Committee that the Government could





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>



not  agree  because this was a general Referendum Bill and that  the  Government  might  have  to ask any number of questions. Sir,  the  Minister  here

wanted  to  reserve  the  right for the Government to  pose  any  number  of

questions, 20 questions if necessary. But in opposing it, the Minister  also

said  that in a referendum only one or just two questions would be  put  and

that,  therefore, there was no need to have a longer period  given  for  the

people to consider the issues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, the Government wants to preserve the right to put as many

questions as they want, and on the other hand, they want not more than  seven

days  given for the people to consider the questions. Sir, who is  trying  to

confuse the people? Whatever the

Minister  says, Sir, we know for a fact that this Bill is primarily for the  purpose  of  pushing  through  the  unfair merger  arrangements.  In  fact,  the

Minister  for Finance said at col. 181 of the Official Report of  the  Select

Committee  on the Singapore National Referendum Bill, No. 4, dated 11th  May,

1962:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Let us come down to brass tacks. This referendum will be about merger.'

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is admitted. That is so. We also know, Sir, that to get through this

unfair  merger arrangement, the Government has not only to rig the referendum

hut also to confuse the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the basic P.A.P. theme that we should understand if we are to

understand  the  P.A.P. wriggling in and out of contradictory arguments.  The

Government does not want to pose just one question, viz. "Are you in  support

of  the  merger arrangement on terms contained in the White Paper?",  because

the  people's  answer is going to be a categorical "No".  So  they  want  the

right  to  pose more than one question. They want the right to  pose  perhaps

two unacceptable alternatives in a context where the people have no right  to

say  "no" and where they cannot abstain. The Government does not want, at the

same  time, to give sufficient time for canvassing, because it knows that  if

sufficient  time  is  given the people will know the  P.A.P.'s  strategy.  In

fact, Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>



Speaker,  Sir, the Bill in its original form gave no opportunity for  canvassing

at  all.  Why are they afraid of facing the people and of putting forward  their

case and giving the right to the Opposition Parties to do the same?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Sir, the Government, in effect, wants to give seven days of very

restricted canvassing on the referendum. But since the Select Committee convened

and  up  to the time of the sitting of this House, the Government wanted to  prohibit  completely canvassing. The reason why today the Government is willing  to

allow  even this very restricted canvassing is because of the pressure it faces.

from  the  people  and because it finds that the resistance to the  undemocratic

provisions  of  this Bill is very strong from the people and the  organisations.

Because of this, they now seek to appear reasonable. But everyone knows that  al

lowing  seven days of very restricted canvassing is not being reasonable by  any

stretch of the imagination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment accordingly negatived.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The next amendment

standing in the names of the Member for Anson and the Member for Queenstown is,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A3, line 41, to leave out "questions" and insert "one question as

framed by the Legislative Assembly".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There appear to be two issues there.

One is whether or not the word "questions" should be left out and the words "one

question" should be there inserted. The second issue is whether or not the words

"as framed by the Legislative Assembly" should be added. On the first issue,  we

have  exhausted arguments, and I do not think I will be correct  in  allowing  a

further  argument  on  whether  or  not there  should  be  "questions"  or  "one

question". Therefore, if the hon. Member for Anson wishes to take a vote on that

particular aspect of the amendment, he can move separately. In other words, move

'That  the  word "questions" be left out, and there be inserted the  words  "one

question".'  We take a vote on that, and having disposed of that, I will  permit

the  Member  for  Anson to move the insertion of the words  "as  framed  by  the

Legislative Assembly." Is that convenient?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, you will forgive me, but I have no intention

of  raising again the issue already discussed, not even to take up the  time  of

the  House  for a vote since the issue has been voted on. It seems to me  fairly

specific  and it is not my intention to just waste time. I was going to  address

the  House  exclusively on the issue as to the framing of the questions  by  the

House.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Member will just move, we will take a voice vote.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Is it necessary, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is just for the

record.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A3, line 41, to leave out "questions" and insert "one question."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member now move formally before we suspend?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you. Mr Speaker, I move,

Legislative Assembly".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker thereupon left the Chair of the Committee and took the Chair of the Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13-(contd.)



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are on an amendment in page A3, line 41, after "questions",

to insert "as framed by the Legislative Assembly". Mr Marshall.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, are the Ministers on the Front bench informed of

the  undertaking given by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance to the

people  of Singapore at the radio forums that the P.A.P. Government will  permit

the Assembly to debate the questions to be asked in this referendum? If they are

so  informed, I trust they will keep that information in mind during the  debate

on  this  amendment. If they do so, they will not repeat the ugly exhibition  of

contradicting each other and themselves which we have witnessed on the  question

whether  this was a general or specific Referendum Bill. In March,  we  had  the

Prime Minister, the Minister for Law, and the Minister for Finance tell us  that

it  was  a  specific Bill for merger. In April, the Deputy Prime Minister  in  a

solemn



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>



motion  told  us it was only for the merger. In May, we had in Select  Committee

the  extraordinary exhibition of forgetfulness on the part of the  Minister  for

Law,  the  Minister for Home Affairs, and the Minister for Finance of what  they

themselves and their Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister had said.  To  cap

it  all,  yesterday we had the Deputy Prime Minister tell us this is  a  general

National Referendum Bill.

Well  now let us come down to clause 13 of this National Referendum Bill now  no

longer  general. In my amendment, I asked that the questions be  framed  by  the

Assembly. Now that the Minister for Home Affairs, having recognised the error of

his  ways,  is going back to the original intention and saying that  this  is  a

specific  Bill, I would remind him of some remarks he listened to with  a  broad

and  pleased  countenance at the magnificent acumen of his  colleague.  I  would

refer  to the 8th of May, Sir, column 110, No. 3, of the Official Report of  the

Select Committee on the Singapore National Referendum Bill. It is very pertinent

in this context because

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- need I remind you, Sir? - all I ask is that the questions be framed by the

Legislative Assembly. Now, Sir, column 110, we have Mr Byrne, the Minister  for

Law, here. May I refer to one-third of the way down, Sir, so as not to weary you

by reading too far? It is about 15 lines down, Mr Speaker, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'My point here, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that this is a general referendum Bill.

If there was before the Committee a Bill dealing with a



specific  referendum issue, there is nothing to prevent the Legislative Assembly

from deciding the questions to be put to a Referendum. But in this case, this is

a general Referendum

Bill. . . .'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now we have it on the assurance

of  the  Minister  for Home Affairs that this is a specific Referendum  Bill - you

have  got  a  somersault.  Will the Minister for Law  concede - and  I  trust  his

colleagues  too - that there is nothing to prevent the Legislative  Assembly  from

deciding  the questions to be put? May I also remind this House that we  do  not

have  Hansard, that earlier this afternoon the Minister for Law from a  prepared

speech said to us that it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>



true in every specific referendum law he could trace, the question was framed by

the  legislative authority that framed the Act? Now, Sir, need I add more?  That

is all I seek here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is not the purpose of

this amendment for my standing up here to do more than to point their own volte-face.  I  would be very happy if we could now just take a vote quietly and  bury

their own shame.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  am  really surprised at the ignorance of the Member for Anson  in  this

matter. There is no constitutional precedent anywhere in the world where  it  is

written  in  the  law  to provide for the Legislature to  do  the  work  of  the

Executive. The framing of the question is an executive action of the Government,

for  the  simple  reason  that if the Legislature is  allowed  to  do  executive

functions of this character, then there might as well not be a Cabinet.  Let  me

now  quote what the Member for Queenstown said in the Select Committee. This  is

the Official Report of the Select Committee on the Singapore National Referendum

Bill, No. 3, 8th of May, 1962, column 78, the last paragraph. We were discussing

whether  the Head of State should be advised by the Government or the  Assembly.

This is the same principle. Now, this is what the Member for Queenstown said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The suggestion [that is, the Head of State to be advised by the Assembly]

will also allow the elected representatives and political

Parties  to  discuss  the  issue. Although we realise  that  discussion  in  the

Assembly ultimately means that the view of the majority, namely, the Government,

will  still prevail, we feel that in the discussion and in the debate many  good

points will be brought forth,...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will notice, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the Member for Queenstown is only

asking  that  the  issue be brought up in the Assembly for debate  so  that  the

Opposition  will have an opportunity to air their views. And then  far  from  we

being  forgetful as alleged by the Member for Anson - may I quote what he said  in

Select Committee at column



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>



94  of the same Official Report, somewhere in the middle of the column. This  is

what the Member for Anson said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We are not asking that the Opposition should have the right to dictate what

the  Government  should  ask. We are asking that we should  have  the  right  to

participate in a debate whereby we [that is, the Member for Anson and the  other

Opposition Members] could guide the Government on the issue.'



<br><br>Here  it  is  clearly stated in black and white that he is not asking  that  the

Opposition should have the right to dictate what the Government should ask. Now,

be  that as it may, Mr Speaker, Sir, we are going to move immediately after the

Third Reading of this Bill a motion containing the actual questions to be put to

the  people  for debate in this Assembly. The Member for Anson will  have  ample

opportunity to discuss the question.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, we see the dishonesty of the P.A.P. Government in

every  clause of the Bill. In fact, Sir, I wonder if you notice it - they  are  so

crestfallen all of a sudden. Mr Speaker, Sir, something must be happening.  You

will notice their faces - all of a sudden they are long, like those of horses.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I hope the Member for Queenstown has not looked at the

Speaker's face also. It has gone a bit long because he is tired.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You see, Sir, all along when we were discussing clause 5 in

Select  Committee,  they have been saying, "This is a general Referendum  Bill",

and  all for what? They say it is meant for different types of smoking, the sale

of  toddy.  In fact, Sir, I have already marked this paragraph out for quotation

and  I  am glad that the Member for Anson has quoted it because this is a  clear

admission from the Minister for Health and Law that he is the expert on whom the

Minister for Finance depended. I refer you to column 107 of the Official  Report

of  the Select Committee on the Singapore National Referendum Bill, No. 3, dated

8th May, 1962, Sir:

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I give two reasons why these amendments are unacceptable.

First, it contravenes, on the authority of my colleague, -'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>



Well,  this  is the authority of his colleague, and what does he say  in  column

110? It is the same quotation which has already been read out to you. This is  a

clear  admission by the "authority" that if this is a general Bill there  is  no

thing  to prevent the Legislative Assembly from deciding the question to be  put

to a referendum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Specific Bill, yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Now that they

have admitted this Bill is meant for merger specifically, let them not eat their

own words.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> We are not eating our own words. We understand the constitutional

position.  I  have  made the suggestion in this Assembly  that  if  there  is  a

specific Referendum Bill -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> This afternoon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> - this afternoon rather,

that if there is a specific Referendum Bill, then, as in all specific Referendum

Bills, there must be a clause which sets the question. That is a fact. If it  is

a  general Bill, questions have got to be set and it will be the Government that

will have to accept the responsibility for setting those questions. But you have

heard the undertaking given by the Minister for Home Affairs just now that  even

before  the  Third Reading of this Bill the questions will be brought  here  for

discussion.



<br><br>9.45 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson has always accused us of having

short  memories.  Mr Speaker, Sir, you will remember that in  Select  Committee

when  we  were  discussing  certain  representations  made  by  representors,  a

memorandum from one of them had this to say:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There is no precedent in the world where a section of opposition in the

Assembly,  which does not shoulder the responsibilities of government  is  given

the right to decide what the Government should ask the people in a referendum.'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Where is that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> That is from the Official

Report of the Select Committee on the Singapore National Referendum Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>



No. 3, of 8th May, 1962, column 90.

It is the same quotation that was referred to by the Minister for Home

Affairs just now. He accepted that, Mr

Chairman.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> What?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> No, I am sorry, Sir. Mr Marshall said at column 94:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...the absurdity of that suggestion indicates the imbecility of the person who

wrote it. We are not asking that the Opposition should have the right to dictate

what  the Government should ask. We are asking that we should have the right  to

participate in a debate whereby we could guide the Government on the issue. That

is  a  far cry from the Opposition arrogating unto itself the right of dictating

when or if there should be a referendum.'



<br><br>He is going to be given that opportunity very shortly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I just want to add a few more words, Sir. They still

maintain that it is a general Bill for a specific issue. I do not know how  they

can be contradicting themselves all the time.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, you will remember in my earlier speeches

I  did  make  mention that when we come to the amendment to be proposed  by  the

Member  for Anson, it was my intention to propose an amendment to the  amendment

to  ensure  that  the assurance given by a Minister of the Government  that  the

questions  to  be  posed in the merger referendum will be the subject  of  frank

debate in this Assembly should they embody it in the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has now moved the amendment which I had thought that I

would  have  to move, and the reply given by the Government to us was  that  the

Government  should reserve the constitutional right to frame questions  and  all

that  and  the  other   but  he,  the Minister for Home  Affairs,  repeated  the

assurance  that  a motion will be before this House for debate after  the  Third

Reading of this Bill. I do not see why it should be necessary for a Minister  of

the Government and for some Members of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>



Opposition to bring in extraneous matters, try to stand on their dignity and try

to  tear  one another down by flinging back and forth words of abuse,  words  of

distrust and words that are bound to heat up the debate unnecessarily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what we are very concerned about is that the questions should be fully

debated in this Assembly and decided upon before they are posed in a referendum.

Sir,  we would like to see that written into the law, but the Minister said.  It

could  not be done. They reserve their constitutional right. The assurance given

by  the  Minister that a motion will be before this House for debate  after  the

Third  Reading  of  the Bill makes me think that it might be a quicker  process.

Because if it were written into the law, then there would have to be more delay,

and  it  would be necessary for the Yang di-Pertuan Negara to give assent.  That

takes  time and later on the Government will have to come to this House  with  a

motion  for the questions to be debated. That takes a longer time than the  time

promised  by  the Minister that the questions will be debated in this  House.  I

find  it  very  difficult, in view of the exchange of harsh  words  between  the

P.A.P.,  the ex-P.A.P., and the spokesman for the Barisan Sosialis,  the  Member

for Anson -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am not their spokesman.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order. Mr Speaker. I do ask, Sir, that that

reference that I am the spokesman of the Barisan Sosialis be withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have already indicated it is not proper to refer to a

Member of this House other than by the name of his constituency or by the office

he  holds.  All  these  remarks which deviate from that  ruling  are  completely

irrelevant and can be taken as offensive at times.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, in the interest of not unnecessarily prolonging the

debate  on  this  issue  of national importance, I am  prepared  to  accept  the

assurance of the Minister on this one condition: that if the S.P.A. does not see

the  notice of motion before the Third Reading of the Bill, the S.P.A. will vote

against the Third Reading of the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, so yet once more we ram one more falsehood down the

throat  of  the  P.A.P. The Minister for Home Affairs says,  "We  stand  by  the

constitutional  position." What constitutional position?  The  Minister  on  his

left,  a  distance  away,  tells us the constitutional position  is  that  every

specific  law  for referendum contains the question. That is the  constitutional

position.  He has heard his colleagues refer to the Newfoundland Referendum  Act

of  1948.  Perhaps he thinks that is unconstitutional? He has seen the  Jamaican

Referendum  Act  of  1960.  Is that unconstitutional? What  constitution  is  he

thinking of? Mr Mao Tse-tung's?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The P.A.P. Constitution!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Or Hitler's, or may be Stalin's. I do not know on whom they

pattern  themselves.  What  hypocrisy is this? Are we  using  the  same  English

language? Here is the Minister for Law specifically stating that where there  is

a  specific  referendum, then there is no question but that the  Legislative  Assembly can and should decide it. Here, he has said, in this House, not in Select

Committee,  that  that  is so in every referendum Act he has  seen.  What  other

constitutional position is the Minister for Home Affairs thinking of?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You do not talk the same language!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Thank God I do not talk the P.A.P. language, the language of

hypocrisy  and  humbug.  I  wish  that Member who  has  just  opened  his  mouth

understands  one-tenth of what is taking place here. He would  not  merely  turn

pale, he would turn tail and get out of that company.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> We do not talk the same language!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, order. The Member for Anson by his extravagant language

excites  comments from across the Floor, and then when the comments are  passed,

he  goes  off  the  deep end. I would suggest that if the  Member  avoids  these

things, he will get on much quicker and there will be better decorum.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, if it does not explain, I trust it does at least ex

cuse  my feelings if you will recognise that it is human to feel indignation  at

blatant  and open dishonesty and the misuse and abuse of words to mean something

totally different.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have had assurances over the radio to our people that we will be

debating  these questions. This is all my amendment asks. My amendment asks  for

it  to  be  written  into  the law that the questions as  debated  will  be  the

questions  put.  Both  Ministers,  who  obviously  do  not  understand   English

adequately, have quoted passages, Sir, wherein we have pointed out to them  that

we  are  not  asking  to dictate. This clause does not ask that  the  Opposition

should  dictate the question. It asks that the questions should be  incorporated

in  the  Bill, and the Government, with its majority, can always have what  ques

tions  it  will. All we ask is that in this Bill there should be a law that  the

questions as debated by this Assembly

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- where the Government has the majority and where it can bulldoze what questions

it  will - will  be the questions put and none other. This is not a  clause  which

will  remedy the Bill. It will improve it a little. Because, unquestionably,  it

still leaves it to the Government to put two or a hundred filthy alternatives to

the  people. But it does at least insist that the questions as debated  in  this

Assembly  will  be  the  questions put to the people.  This  is  what  has  been

promised. Why the objection now to its incorporation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must confess, Sir, I cannot understand why the Member for Cairnhill, says

that he accepts the assurances when' he has had repeated proof of their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>



somersault?  Why an assurance, when, on his own logic, it is a matter  that  can

much more simply be written into the law? Why is he prepared to accept it?

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Member for Anson said he could not understand why I could

accent  the  assurance.  But may I remind the House  that  what  I  said  was  a

conditional  assurance?  If that assurance is not made  good  before  the  Third

Reading of the Bill, we will vote against the Third Reading of the Bill. That is

the conditional acceptance of the assurance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Member for Nee Soon commented

yesterday, it is difficult to make a schizoid understand what we mean and  I  do

not intend to go further on this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point

of order, Sir. If the word "schizoid" is intended to refer to me, I take

objection to it as being offensive.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am afraid I still do not understand exactly what the meaning of

"schizoid"  is. I have not looked up the meaning in the dictionary. Perhaps  the

Member for Anson will let me know. I do not know the meaning of this word.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> As far as I understand, Sir, it is a psychiatric term referring

to a person of mental incapacity. [Laughter]

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I suppose it really depends on what extent that mental

incapacity goes to. Perhaps I should not allow the word. If it is stated by  the

Member  for  Anson  that it is offensive, then it must be  offensive  under  the

meaning  of the Standing Orders and, therefore, I ask that the word be withdrawn

and should not be used again in this Assembly.



<br><br>10.00 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I withdraw that word. The important point is - and that is what, in fact, the

Member for Anson asked for - is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>



the  opportunity to debate the questions in the Assembly. That, as I  have  said

just  now,  is  what the Government is going to do, i.e. the questions  will  be

brought before this House for debate. What else is he asking for? The moon?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment accordingly negatived.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The next clause is

clause 18 - an amendment standing in the name of the Member for Queenstown.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Might I remind you, Sir, whether we

are taking clause 6 at this stage?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No. Under the Standing Orders, all postponed clauses are taken

right at the end.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I beg your pardon.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Clause 18 - as I was saying, there is an amendment standing in the

name of the Member for Queenstown:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A6, line 23, at end, to add "Every ballot paper shall be in the Form

in the First Schedule to this Ordinance.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The First Schedule indicates that there will be one question with an answer

"yes"  or  "no".  So that the same issues are raised and, therefore,  I  do  not

propose  to  allow any debate on that amendment, subject to what the Member  for

Queenstown has to say.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have indicated, when I was speaking on

the  amendment to clause 5, that I will wait until clause 18 because I  did  not

want  to  mix  the  whole thing up. If you will look at the  Hansard,  I  hardly

touched on clause 18.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> What is the issue?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I am talking about the ballot paper.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Would the Member for Queenstown indicate on what issue he

is going to speak? The



issue, as far as I can make out, is: one question with an answer "yes" or "no".

If the Member is thinking in terms of

whether  or not there should, in fact, be a ballot form, this amendment,  as  it

stands, will not let in a debate on that issue. I would suggest to the hon.  Mem

ber  that  he reserves his speech until such time as the Member for Anson  moves

his  reasoned amendment to the Third Reading, which alleges that in his view the

Bill is inappropriate and inadequate for the purpose. So that at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>



that  stage  the  hon. Member could make his speech indicating that  clause  18.

which merely speaks about a ballot paper, is inadequate for the purposes of  the

merger referendum. I hope I have made myself understood.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> So I have to wait until clause 13?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am ruling that there can be no debate on the amendment as

worded  because that will only raise two issues. The issue whether or not  there

should  be  a form of ballot paper has not, been raised, but it can  be  touched

upon - the fact that there is no form for the ballot paper can be touched upon -   when

we  come to the reasoned amendment to be proposed by the Member for Anson.  But,

of course, the Member for Queenstown may ask for a vote.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Then will the Member just move simpliciter?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move simpliciter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, "That the words proposed to be added, be there added."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment accordingly negatived.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There are two amendments standing in the name of the Member for

Anson. They seem to be connected. Will the Member for Anson move the first

amendment? The debate can range over the second amendment*.



<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Amendment (ii) reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A8, line 25, to leave out from "(6)" to "for" in line 27 and insert

"The Registration Officer shall prepare a list of the numbers, names and descriptions of such

electors as he has ordered to be expunged from the register of electors and shall give notice in the

Gazette that such list or copies thereof are open".

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, clause 21 is the compulsory voting clause and I

would like you to notice the sub-clauses.



<br><br>10.30 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first sub-clause says, 'Every elector shall record his vote . . .' - that is

compulsory.  The second sub-clause says that the Superintendent will  prepare  a

list of all those who have not voted.



<br><br>10.32 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>    [Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can ignore sub-clause (3) . We find sub-clause (4) says that the list

prepared  by  the  Superintendent  shall be  delivered  to  the  Registration Officer,  and  then sub-clause (5) -  the sub-clause which I seek to  amend - says

that the Registration Officer will delete from the register the names of  all

persons  who have not voted. Now, what happens to those people - some  of  whom

may  be  away  from  Singapore, some of whom may be sick on  that  day?  What

happens  to them when their names are taken off the register? We  then  come

to sub-clause (8) - they  must satisfy the Registrar that they had a good reason or  they  must

pay  $5. Now, Mr Mammen, Sir, that is not onerous and that is perfectly fair

and  I  accept  it.  But notice the last three lines: "Such  names  shall  be

restored to the register ... at the next ensuing revision     ..." And  that  is

the  rub.  These  people who may, through no fault of their  own,  have  been

prevented from voting are deprived of the right to vote until after the  next

revision of the register and that may he two years, or three years,  or  four

years.  Sir,  it can be said that this is identical with a clause  introduced

by  the  Member for Cairnhill when he was Chief Minister and made the  voting

compulsory. That may be so. In fact, I think it is correct. But I trust  that

that  would  not  prevent him from recognising now that, as is  pointed  out,

there  is  an  unfortunate  and uncalled for penalty  on  perfectly  innocent

people  and that it could be easily remedied. Now, how do I propose to remedy

it, Mr Mammen, Sir? I move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A8, line 22, to leave out from "shall" to the end of line 24 and

insert  "inform every elector on such list by notice addressed  to  his  last

known address, that he proposes to expunge the name of such elector from  the

register  of  electors unless within twenty-eight days the elector  satisfies

the  Registration  Officer  that he had good and sufficient  reason  for  not

having  recorded his vote, or pays to the Registration Officer a  penalty  of

five  dollars. The Registration Officer shall thereafter cause the  names  of

such  persons on the list who have not so satisfied the Registration  Officer

or paid the penalty, to he expunged from the register of electors".



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr John Mammen):</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am sorry. Am I going too fast?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is too fast for the interpreters.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am sorry, Mr

Mammen, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the gist of it, Mr Mammen, is that what I ask is that before you take the

man's  name off the register of electors, you should send him a notice and  say,

"You did not vote in the national referendum on such and such a day and you must

within 28 days give me an explanation or pay me $5." And if within 28 days,  the

man  gives  an explanation which is satisfactory, or if his explanation  is  not

satisfactory and he pays the penalty of $5, then his name remains on that  list.

But  if he does not give an explanation and he does not pay, then, by all means,

Sir,  take his name off that list. Sir, I know that anything that comes from  me

seems  to  be treated by the opposite side as though it would have Machiavellian

intent.  They  see in it their own motivations. But I will ask you to  recognise

here, take for example, a person who is in hospital under operation. Let us say,

the  Member  for  Cairnhill, if he will forgive me. Now,  Sir,  the  Member  for

Cairnhill goes to hospital to have a minor operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The Member for Anson.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Then the position arises that on polling day, he cannot go to the

polls. Now, Sir, he is the leader of a political Party. He is vitally interested

in retaining his name on the register of electors.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I will go on a stretcher.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> it is important to him. Now, what does he do?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Go on a stretcher. [Laughter].



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Mammen, you have an advantage over me there. I must confess I

did not hear the interruption. But I will gladly sit down to hear it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr John Mammen):</b> Mr Marshall, please continue.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 401</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I take it, Mr Mammen, they do not think their reply is worth

repeating. I do not either. Mr Mammen, if I might proceed, what is  he  to  do?

You  will  find that in that unfortunate circumstance, the leader of a political

Party  who has made politics his life is deprived for a period of two  to  three

years  from either standing for election or voting either in a referendum or  at

an  election - not merely voting, Sir, but also standing for election. This  could

happen to anybody. But I will ask you not to look at it merely from the point of

view  of  the  interest  of  the  Members here, Sir,  or  of  the  interests  of

politicians,  but of the interests of the general citizens. Take  anybody,  Sir.

Take a humble servant who is sick. Take somebody who has gone to Hongkong or to

Penang. Now, why should they be deprived of the basic rights of citizens to vote

and  stand for election because they were absent from Singapore on that  day?  I

can  find  absolutely  no  answer to what seems to  be  a  perfectly  legitimate

request, that before a man's name is struck off the register, he should he given

the  opportunity  to say why he did not vote and if the answer is  satisfactory,

then  to leave his name on the register hut if his answer is unsatisfactory,  to

request  him to pay the $5 fine which we authorise, if he pays the $5  fine,  to

leave his name on the register. But if he refuses to answer, refuses to pay  the

$5,  refuses to come, then take his name off the register. That, Mr Mammen,  in

essence,  is  what my two amendments to that clause seek to make. They  seek  to

humanise and rationalise the provisions of this clause for compulsory voting.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It has been proposed as an amendment:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In pace A8, line 22, to leave out from "shall" to the end of line 24 and insert

or  pays to the Registration Officer a penalty of five dollars. The Registration

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Mammen, Sir, I, am indeed very touched by the kind

thoughts  of the Member for Anson for my welfare. Although he has so  many  kind

thoughts  for me, yet he wished that I was in hospital. I do not know which  one

to  take,  whether he wished that I was in hospital or that if I was in hospital

he would feel very sorry for me if something happened to me.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Touch wood!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Anyway, Sir, I have been asked what would happen if I was in

hospital. I say if I was in hospital, I would ask for a stretcher to take me  to

the  polls  to  cast my vote But in order to have a better appreciation  of  the

implications  brought forth by the Member for Anson, perhaps  the  Minister  for

Home  Affairs can tell us the number of people who have been struck off the roll

and the number of people who came forward and gave reasons and paid their fines.

For  as  we know, our registers are all in a way very "cock-eyed", if I can  use

the  term.  For all we know, a man who goes away for even three years still  has

his  name on the register, just because it is automatic. Even the name of a  man

who  is dead, if his identity card has not been surrendered, also remains on the

register.  So if without knowing the implications - the number of persons  who

will he affected by the clauses in the Bill and the number of persons who should

he protected by the amendment proposed by the Member for Anson - it will be very

difficult  to  debate  this matter. We certainly do not  want  to  clog  up  the

Registration  Office to send notices to graveyards of people who  are  dead  but

whose names still appear on





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 403</b></font><br><br>



the electoral register or to people who are ho longer living in Singapore  but

whose  names  are still on the register. Perhaps the Minister can give  us  some

facts  and figures. There was a general election, after, which there was  a  by-election at Hong Lim and another by-election at Anson. It would be very  helpful

for  us  to  have a better appreciation of the Points raised by the  Member  for

Anson.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Mammen, it is well and good to enunciate lofty

principles, but the point is whether these can be put into effect.  I  think  in

this  case particularly, we should consider the practical implications  of  what

the Member for Anson proposed. I can assure you, Mr Mammen, that the amendments

suggested by the Member for Anson are an administratively impossible task.



<br><br>10.45 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21 is taken out word for word from a similar section in the Singapore

Legislative  Assembly  Elections  Ordinance.  I  am  sure  that  when  the  last

Government  passed the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance,  this

section must have been fully considered and the implications fully thought  out.

However, I shall give some facts and figures concerning this particular  clause,

since  we  have had one general election and two by-elections over the last  few

years.  And  from  the  facts,  hon. Members in this  House  will  realise  how

impractical is the

amendments of the Member for Anson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a general election in 1959, the non-voters numbered about 59,000, which

was about ten per cent of the

'electorate. Of this number, a substantial portion represented persons  who  had

things  their  addresses since the registers were certified and, therefore,  did

not  receive the poll card which informed them of the polling station  at  which

they  were  to vote. This resulted in their not going to vote at all.  Among  the

others, a portion represented those who had left the country or had died.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, under the Member for Anson's amendment, notices should he sent to all

such persons informing them that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>



within 28 days they should either pay $5 or give good reasons for not voting.

Mr Mammen, no one can expect such persons to reply if notices are sent to them,

as  the  notices will not reach them. Moreover, the time taken to send  out  the

notices  will be considerable, depending upon the number of nonvoters.  Assuming

that all those who received the notices replied, it would take considerable time

for  the enquiry to be completed in respect of all these cases - extending to some

months  and on occasions going beyond the date due for the next revision of  the

electoral  registers.  If the number of non-voters who  have  replied  is,  e.g.

40,000,  it  would take 200 workers to complete the enquiry at the rate  of  200

cases  a  day. The names o, these electors cannot be expunged from the registers

until  their  cases have been adjudicated upon by the Registration  Officer.  If

there should be an election in the meantime, all these persons would be able  to

vote  as their names would still be in the registers. This, in fact, means  that

while on the one hand we agree on compulsory voting, on the other band, we  make

it so laborious and burdensome for the administrative machinery to carry out the

provisions  relating thereto. Further piecemeal deletions and additions  to  the

registers  resulting from prolonged enquiries are likely to cause  confusion  in

the mechanical processes involved in the preparation of the registers. A further

point is that the names of non-voters are not deleted from the registers without

their  knowledge, as claimed by the Member for Anson. Every elector in Singapore

must  by  now  be  aware of the provisions for compulsory voting  and  that  the

initial  penalty for not voting is the removal of his name from the register  of

electors. If an elector does not vote at an election, he must expect  his  name

to be deleted from the register.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now give the figures of nonvoters at the general elections and at the

Hong Lim and Anson by-elections, and the number of applications received for the

restoration  of names, in the case of the general election, the number  of  non-voters is 58,850. The number of applications for restoration of names is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 405</b></font><br><br>



6,413.  In  the  case of the Hong Lim by-election, the number of  non-voters  is

1,072,  and the number of applications for restoration of names is 227.  In  the

case of the Anson by-election, the number of non-voters is 1,384, and the number

of applications for restoration of names is 32.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be seen that even after three years since the general elections, only

6,400 applications out of 58,000 for restoration of names were received. And the

position  at Hong Lim and Anson even more shows how indifferent people are  with

regard  to  the restoration of names on the electoral registers, and as  I  said

(and  probably the Member for Cairnhill is correct on this point) a large number

of these voters were probably in the grave.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Mammen, Sir, apart from the administrative difficulties con

nected  with  the  implementation of the procedure proposed by  the  Member  for

Anson,  tinder  the  procedure proposed by him, the elector who  has  failed  to

record  his vote will be treated with the tenderness which he does not  deserve.

Surely it is the duty of every citizen to record his vote where voting is compul

sory. And if he fails to do so for any reason whatsoever, the onus should surely

be  on  him  to apply for the restoration of his name on the electoral register.

The  onus being properly placed on the elector, who has failed to vote, to apply

for  the  restoration of his name on the electoral register, it follows that  he

would  have  to  wait until the next ensuing revision of the electoral  register

before his name is, in fact, restored to the electoral register as such revision

of  the electoral register cannot be made on a piecemeal basis. Nor is there any

injustice done to him if before the next ensuing revision of the register he  is

deprived of an opportunity of exercising his vote if a by-election, an election,

or a referendum is held in the interval. Furthermore the knowledge that there is

this  penalty  will  be an added stimulus as it will serve  as  a  deterrent  to

electors  keeping away from the poll and will encourage a larger  attendance  at

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 406</b></font><br><br>



polls,  thereby helping to achieve the objects for which compulsory  voting  had

been introduced. I cannot see how it can be contended that this is undemocratic.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Mammen, it must surprise you, Sir, the extraordinary in

capacity  of  the  Government Benchers to understand  elementary  humanity.  The

Minister says that I seek exceptional tenderness towards a defaulting voter  and

he  does  not  deserve to be treated tenderly. I pointed out to you,  Sir,  that

there are people who have legitimate reasons for being unable to go to the poll.

Singapore  is  a  commercial city. Many of us travel.  They  could  be  away  on

perfectly legitimate business. Do they deserve added penalty? Are they criminals

if  they  do not find their way to the polling booth on polling day?  Do  people

seek  to be sick? You know, Mr Mammen, Sir, that there is not a day in the year

when  each of our hospitals is not full of adult citizens, who are so  ill  that

they  cannot go to a polling booth. Do they deserve added penalty? What talk  is

this?  When  the  Member  for Cairnhill introduced this section,  there  was  no

thought  of  a  penalty other than the penalty of $5. That is why there  is  the

provision that if he satisfies the Superintendent or Registration Officer,  then

he does not have to pay a penalty at all if he has got a legitimate reason. That

is that. That is fair enough. If he has not got a legitimate reason, he is fined

$5. That was the only penalty thought of, Mr Mammen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. now having discovered that, in fact, there is this added injustice

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- not penalty - seek to make a penalty for those who have committed no wrong. They

say  that  there  is administrative difficulty. Mr Mammen, Sir,  curiously  the

Minister  for Home Affairs has himself admitted inferentially that at a  general

election they issued some 600,000 notices addressed to the electors. (I hear  no

dissent.) In that case where is the administrative difficulty of issuing  49,000

after  the  election,  which  is  ten  per cent  of  the  difficulty  originally

experienced?  Now,  Sir, out of that 49,000, you might get 7,000  replies.  Fair

enough. Immediately you get the others automatically expunged from the register.

And as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 407</b></font><br><br>



has  been indicated quite clearly, there are a number who die each year,  Mr

Mammen,  Sir,  and they would naturally not reply. But the majority  of  the

7,000 who do reply may have perfectly legitimate reasons. Why should we  not

treat  them with the same respect which is due to honest citizens who  have

committed  no  wrong?  Why  this  talk of  added  penalties?  What  is  this

administrative difficulty? There is nothing possible, Sir, to  the  man  who

does  not want to do it; and there is nothing impossible or little to  those

who genuinely make an effort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find the excuses specious, and in one instance - not surprisingly seeing

the source - inhuman.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Mammen,

Sir,  we  all  know that the Member for Anson is full of human kindness.  Perhaps  he  will open his house to all those who are poor, and sick  in  heart

and body.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Mammen,

Sir,  the  difficulty with the Member for Anson is that he forgets sub-clause (8).  Sub-clause (8) provides that a person whose name has been  struck  off

from  the  register  will  be permitted to have his  name  restored  to  the

register if sufficient reason has been given to the Registration Officer  as

to  why  he  could  not  vote on that particular  day.  This  is  the  vital

provision of this clause which the Member for Anson has refused to look at.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Mammen, forgive

me,  Sir, I cannot let that pass. He knows that I referred to it and he knows

my  objection.  It is curious that a University lecturer with  his  national

Referendum

Bill  is  incapable of understanding elementary argument. My  point  is  that

your  name will be taken off the register willy-nilly until the next  ensuing

revision. That is my point.



<br><br>11.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, it is not the number who have

applied for registration and restoration of their names that we worry  about. It  is the principle of the thing, Sir. What difference does it make if  they

have to send out tens of thousands of letters?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 408</b></font><br><br>



Now,  in  the forthcoming referendum they are already sending out tens  and  hun

dreds of thousands of cards. Why can they not do the same? If those cards cannot

be  sent out, why can they not get additional staff? What is the money for? Just

only  for the P.A.P. to use! So that they can go on trips round the world, hold

Malaysia Week! And for the Deputy Prime Minister to go round the world!



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Sir, I think it is grossly unfair

for the Member for Queenstown to say that I have gone round the world.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> So that more of

the Back Benchers can be given pleasure trips -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think all this has got nothing to do with this amendment here. If the Member for Queenstown thinks otherwise, he can bring a

substantive motion to that effect, and we can have a nice debate on  that.  Will

the hon. Member for Queenstown please confine himself to the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> He went to Borneo at Government expense!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I went to Borneo, Sir, at Government expense?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You see, Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs gave some very

interesting figures. 59,000 did not vote, and he said only a small section had a

change  of  address, left the country and died. We know, Sir, that  every  year.

round  about 50,000 people die - or is it 5,000? What is the figure? Can the  Min

ister  for  Home  Affairs give us those figures? He is in charge  of  all  those

figures.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> We require notice.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, even if one

man  applied for restoration of his name in the electoral register, that  should

be good enough reason why we must accept



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>



the amendment. The reasons which the Minister of Home Affairs gave are not acceptable.

If they are only administrative difficulties, I am sure they can get experts to streamline the

administration, and I think the P.A.P. after all the recommendations from past Assemblymen should

do better than that.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Mammen, Sir, I was saying that we want to reveal one of

the  most shameful deceptions practised on the people by the P.A.P. I refer you,

Sir, to col. 293 of the Official Report of the Select Committee on the Singapore

National Referendum Bill, No. 5, of 15th May, 1962. I was asking a question with

regard to the declaration







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 411</b></font><br><br>



of the result of the referendum. It is a very interesting piece of conversation, Sir, if you will just follow it right through:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Dr Lee Siew Choh: I see. I would like to ask a question, Sir. What is the

meaning  of  the result of the referendum? Can the Minister give a clarification

so  as  to let us understand? Because in a general election, a certain candidate

is  declared  the winner. Now, it says here. "declare the result of the  referendum."'



<br><br>And there was laughter from the Government Ministers on that day. It reads on:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Chairman: Order. Let the Member continue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee Siew Choh: Let the Minister explain first. What is the meaning of  the

result of the referendum?'



<br><br>Then Dr Goh Keng Swee. These are wonderful words:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Dr Goh Keng Swee: The result means the way the people have voted in the

referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee Siew Choh: For example?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr  Goh  Keng Swee: You count so mans yeses, so many noes, and so on; so  many

as, so many b's, so many c's; and you add up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee Siew Choh: You are merely announcing the totals then?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr  Goh Keng Swee: Yes. That is always the way it is done in other countries.' -

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> On a point of



order.  It  has  been  ruled that Members of this Assembly  should  be  properly

described. Who is Dr Lee and who is Dr Goh?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think that is well taken, but the Member is quoting from the

Select  Committee Report. So the hon. Member for Cairnhill must have been asleep

because it is late at night.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I think the Member for Cairnhill would do well to listen to

this -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Why?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - because it shows up the deceit in the P.A.P. There are

only a few more paragraphs:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Dr Lee Siew Choh: I will just give you an example; A, B and C: one is 45,

another is 45, and another is 10. What is the result of the referendum!'



<br><br>Now, these are very important words, Sir:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 412</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Dr Goh Keng Swee: 45: 45; 10. [Jolly good].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr  Lee Siew Choh: Just announce it like that? So it does not say which is the

one that has won or something?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Byrne: No. There is no contest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr  Lee  Siew Choh: For example, one with 48, another one with 47, and another

5. What happens? Just announce it like that?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Byrne: Yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, that is all I want. I want them to announce 45, 45, 10; 48, 47, 5. That

is  all  I  want in this amendment. You see, Sir, I want to tell  you  how  this

referendum  idea was first mooted. I want to tell you, Sir, that the whole  idea

of  the  referendum was to find safe seats for the Ministers of the P.A.P.  That

was the whole idea of the referendum.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> You have found the safest seat for us.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If the Deputy

Prime  Minister will dare to go to Queenstown with me or if he does not want  to

go  to  Queenstown  I  can  go down to Rochore. Say  yes,  and  we  will  resign

straightaway. Dare the Deputy Prime Minister do that?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> You do it first.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think this debate is getting out of order. Of course, a

little  interruption  i5 interesting and keeps the Members  awake.  But  if  the

Member  for Queenstown is going to answer all the interjections coming from  the

Government Bench, then I think there will be no end to this debate.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> He behaves like a small boy.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You see, Sir, the Little bit which I read cut to you from

the Official Report o the Select Committee, col. 293, shows how the Minister for

Finance  had tried to mislead me when I was in Select Committee -  from the figures

and  from the way their answers were given: 45, 45, 10, and then I said 48,  47,

5. The Minister for Health and Law then said. "Yes." From these answers given to

me, I had understood that a detailed result would be revealed, But no, Sir, that

is  not  the  intention. They do not want to reveal the results of  the  various

divisions in detail.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> National.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The counting will be done in every division, Sir. But the

result  of the various divisions will not he announced and nobody will know  the

details. Why? I want to tell you a story, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Is it a bed-time story?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the story in connection with the counting of votes?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I want to tell you the inside story of the birth of the

referendum idea. I tell you, Sir, it will he very revealing because many  people

thought  the  idea of the referendum came about Only after the  radio  forum  in

September 1961.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think it would be better for the Member for Queenstown to

reserve  all  these arguments - why all these stories have come out, and  why  the

Government  has motivated this Referendum Bill and so on -  when we  come  to  the

debate on the motion to be moved by the Member for Anson on the Third Reading of

the  Referendum Bill as a whole. Now, will he confine himself to this particular

amendment which he has moved?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Mammen, Sir, what I am going to say is directly

relevant  to my amendment and I am going to prove it to you. I was telling  you,

Sir,  that  many people thought that the referendum idea was suggested  late  in

1961  after the radio forum in September 1961. In actual fact, the idea  of  the

referendum  was born long before that. In fact, it was in May of the same  year.

Let  me  tell  you the facts as I knew them because, as you will  remember,  Mr

Mammen,  Sir,  I was still in the P.A.P. then and even the Back Benches  of  the

P.A.P. never knew this story. For example, Mr Mammen, Sir, you never knew  this

and it will be interesting -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Member for Queenstown is trying to get the

Chair  into  the  debate. Of course, I was then in the P.A.P. When  I  take  the

Chair,  I  have to act as the Chairman of the Assembly. I hope the  hon.  Member

will bear this in mind in this debate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 414</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I have no intention, Sir, of involving the Chair, but it

would be interesting, Sir, for everyone to hear this.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Do not make it too long. I am feeling sleepy.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You see, Sir, this is embarrassing to the P.A.P. because this

is their weak spot. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I think, Sir, everybody in Singapore would like to hear this

and  from  this  story which I am going to tell you, you will see  the  original

intentions  of this referendum which the P.A.P. want to hold. When the  fortunes

of  the P.A.P. leaders were at a low ebb soon after the defeat in Hong Lim,  the

idea  of the referendum was mooted with a view to ensuring the political  future

of the P.A.P. Ministers. You see, Sir -



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> On a point of

order.  You  ruled  just now that any matter relevant to the  amendment  can  be

debated  and, in fact, you did ask the Member for Queenstown whether this  story

he  was  going  to tell was relevant to the amendment he moved,  or  whether  it

should  not  be kept for same other occasion. There is a clause in the  Standing

Order on its relevancy. I think it is Standing Order No. 54. I would like you to

apply that clause.



<br><br>11.30 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is Standing Order

54.  I think I will read it for the information of Members:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Speaker or the Chairman, after having drawn attention to the conduct of a

Member,  who persists in irrelevance, or tedious repetition either  of  his  own

arguments or of the arguments used by other Members in debate, may direct him to

discontinue his speech.'



<br><br>When  the Member for Oueenstown began to tell his story, I asked him whether  it

had  any  bearing on the amendment before the House. He promised that  he  would

prove to me that it had some bearing. I think if the Member goes on to tell  his

story, he is inviting an open debate on the story itself. That is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 415</b></font><br><br>



why I have earlier ruled that any stories could properly be debated when we come

to the motion of the Member for Anson on the Third Reading of the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Mammen, Sir, when I say "story" I do not mean a

fabrication.  I  am  telling you the facts, Sir, and I  want  to  link  this  up

directly with the clause.



<br><br>11.31 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was telling the Chair about the defeat that had dealt a humiliating

blow to the ego of the

P.A.P. leadership  and  that it was a bitter pill for  the  Prime  Minister  to

swallow.  The threat to resign at that time, Sir, was never meant  to  be  taken

seriously, and at no time was there any real intention to give up power.  We  in

the  Barisan Sosialis knew of this because we were then in the thick of it.  The

threat  to  resign  was more a reaction out of pique. It was merely  a  ruse  to

muster  and rally support round the once-popular, but then becoming the  not-so-popular, Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain, Sir. The Prime Minister had been living under the illusion that

he  was  so important a figure that he was indispensable to the Left.  And  this

threat to resign was meant to be a test of his indispensability.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The amendment is to clause 27:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A11, line 13, to leave out "declare" and insert "announce the result

of  the  voting  in  detail electoral division by electoral division  before  he

declares".



<br><br>So that the sub-clause will read:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'When the counting of the votes has been completed, the Superintendent shall

announce  the  result  of the voting in detail electoral division  by  electoral

division before he declares the result of the referendum:'.



<br><br>That  amendment  is  a'  lied to the amendment which the Member  for  Queenstown

proposes to move to clause 30,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A12, line 25, at end, to add "Such statement shall be, as near as may

be, in the Form in the Second Schedule to this Ordinance.".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 416</b></font><br><br>



The  Second  Schedule gives details of how the Member for Queenstown wishes  the

statement of the poll, after counting the votes, to be announced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would like to understand how all that part of the speech of the Member

for Queenstown has any relevance to the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, as I have said, I will prove to you the relevance of

my  remarks because it was the intention of the referendum to find "safe"  seats

for the P.A.P. Ministers. You see, Sir, I have put in this amendment to say that

the exact details of the results should be made known to the people. But the

P.A.P. Government want to keep it a secret because, as I go along, you will  see

that that secret is only meant for the

P.A.P. They want to know the detailed

results  of the various divisions, but nobody else will know it. Then  from  the

number of votes cast for the P.A.P. proposals, they can find out what support  the P.A.P. has in the various divisions. That is the plot which I am going

to reveal, and I will do so step by step.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think we should go into very many details. An

allegation  can  be  made, of course, and the Member is entitled  to  make  that

allegation.  But  I do not think we should go into too many deaths  about  that,

because  those details become irrelevant to the amendment itself. An  allegation

of  that nature, I suppose, is perfectly legitimate in urging the amendment. But

if  the  hon.  Member goes into details, we will enter into a  debate  within  a

debate.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will then not go into details and I will only give you the

brief outline.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you the general picture so that you may grasp exactly what it is

all  about.  Although at that period there was talk of throwing in  the  sponge,

there  was also the fear of the Ministers that they would not be able to  regain

their  seats should there be a general election. Hence, the idea of a referendum

was  mooted. At that time, immediately after the Hong Lim by-election, we had  a

lot  of  discussions, Sir, and we were asked to give our views as to whether  or

not the







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 417</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P.  Government should stay in office, and whether the referendum  should  be

held before or after Anson. There are a lot of details which many people do  not

know  about.  They are directly linked with the amendment which I  have  put  in

here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally, the referendum, even from this little bit that I have told you,

was meant to find "safe" seats for the P.A.P.

Even at that period, the P.A.P. realised

that  if  any referendum was going to be held, only one straightforward question

was  to  be  put  to the people. The people were supposed to be asked,  "Do  you

support the P.A.P. Government?" Yes or No? That was all. But, of course,  later

on, they changed their ideas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me then explain how this idea of "safe" seats was to work. You see, Sir,

once the votes have been cast, the constituencies which show the biggest pro

P.A.P. majority margins would be the

first-class "safe" seats; those with smaller majority margins would  be  second-class  "not-so-safe" seats; and a sim majority margin would be  the  third-class

"unsafe"  seats.  Of  course, if there should be a general  election,  then  the

Ministers  would  be assigned to all the first-class "safe"  seats;  the  Parliamentary  Secretaries and some of the blue-eyed boys would  be  assigned  to  the

second-class  "not-so-safe" seats; and some of the other people  would  have  to

take their chances with the third-class "unsafe" seats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see from this that the original intention of the P.A.P. in a referendum

was  not  to  find out whether or not the people wanted to accept  their  merger

proposals,  but  to cater for the selfish interests of the P.A.P.  Ministers  themselves.

Now in the Bill itself, the P.A.P. plot is not to reveal all these facts

to  the  people, and depending on how the votes are cast, the P.A.P. hope  to

find out which seats would be safe for them. And after this referendum, if there

is a general election, their Ministers - especially, I suppose, the Prime Minister

and the Minister for Finance - would be going to those first-class "safe" seats to

make sure that they come in.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 418</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have moved this amendment, Sir, in

order  to  ensure  that there would be no secret kept from the  people.  If  the

voting tells us that so many votes support the

P.A.P. merger proposals, so many votes

support  any proposition which they may suggest to the people as an alternative,

or any other alternative, then all those detailed results must be revealed: and

all the people of Singapore must know about them. Then even if they intend that

certain  safe seats should only be known to themselves, at least all the  people

in Singapore will also share the same secret.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when the Minister for Home Affairs stated that the referendum had

originally been mentioned in July, he made a slight error. He should  have  said

"In  May  after Hong Lim." I can even tell you, Sir, that when the Parliamentary

Secretaries  were  asked  what the P.A.P. should do  at  that  time,  there  was

persuasion  used in many forms. We were given dinners. They were hoping  thereby

to soften our jaw, so to speak, and we were expected to agree to the suggestions

that were put to us with regard to the holding of a referendum after Hong Lim.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): On a point of order, Sir. I think all these

allegations were made only to determine the attitude to a resignation  from  the

Government.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have not heard a

point of order. If the Member is addressing the Chair on a point of order,  then

let the Chair hear it raised calmly. I would like to hear the point of order.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): This allegation has nothing to do with the, amendment

and it is totally irrelevant..



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do agree that the

Member for Queenstown is straying away from the amendment. I would, suggest that

all  this talk about dinners has nothing to do with the amendment. Let  us  come

back to the amendment now.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will then not

tell any more stories but come straight to the amendment itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer you, Sir, to the Select Committee's Report on the Singapore National Referendum Bill, No. 5, of l5th May, col.

295 - towards the end of that column



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 419</b></font><br><br>



immediately after "The Chairman: Shall we proceed?" And Dr Goh Keng Swee said -



<br><br>11.45 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It is only a question of procedure. I notice that when

the  Member reads Hansard, he reads the name of the Member. That is strictly not

correct.  Even  when he reads, he ought to say, "The Minister for  Finance  said

this", or "the Minister for Law said this" or "I said this".



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> In column 295, Sir, I was asking about how, a recount was

going to be taken. And the Minister for Finance said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Therefore, if there is a recount, my guess is that it will be a recount of

all the votes cast and not division by division.'



<br><br>Now let us see. If there is provision for recount, how do we ask for a recount if

we do not know the detailed results? If you will remember, Sir, in the general

elections,  the  S.P.A. candidate for River Valley lost by five  votes  to  the

P.A.P.  Member for River Valley. There were two recounts. They had the  detailed

results and they could ask for a recount. But on this occasion, Sir, there is  a

provision for a recount and we do not know how to ask for a recount. Surely  the

Government is not gong to suggest that we have to wait until the total result of

the  whole island is announced before we ask for a recount? Under those circumstances, bow can our counting agents know when to ask for a recount? If you read

the Bill, Sir, there is provision for a request for a recount to be asked by the

counting agent. But the counting agent will not be able to ask for a recount  if

the  detailed results are not made known to him. So what happens? Sir, my  amendment  here  also, as directed by Mr Mammen, is related to clause 30  about  the

statement of voting. I have moved this amendment in order to get a statement  of

the voting in the Schedule to the Bill in order that the people of Singapore may

know  exactly how they have voted in a referendum. Any honest government,  Sir,

will  not  want  to  hide the result of the voting. Only a  government  that  is

dishonest and wants to rig either the elections or the referendum



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 420</b></font><br><br>



would  like to hide the result of the referendum from the public gaze. In  fact,

it  is  the duty of the Government to inform the people of the exact details  of

the  voting.  And the people have a right to know. But in the Bill the  detailed

results  will  not  be  made known to the people. Even in the  Local  Government

Ordinance,  and in the General Elections Ordinance, there is a form which  gives

the detailed result of the poll.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I refer you, Sir, to the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance, section 49, subsection (2), at the last sentence:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Returning Officer shall forthwith after the result has been declared by

him  compile  a statement of the poll in the Form 17 'In the First  Schedule  to

this  Ordinance and shall cause the name or names of the members so elected  and

also the said statement to be published in the Gazette.'



<br><br>And in Form 17, Sir, you have the number of the ballot papers issued; the number

of  the ballot papers cast for whatever candidate it is, and the number  of  rejected ballot papers. And it all adds up on both sides. Similarly, in the  amendment  which I have moved, I seek, Sir, to have the following. I am now referring

to the Schedule, Sir:

<pre>

 'Number of ballot papers issued



  Number of ballot papers cast in respect of

         do.         do.       do.

         do.         do.       do.

  Number of unmarked ballot papers cast

  Number of uncertain ballot papers cast

  Number of tendered ballot papers'

</pre>

and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment which I seek shows up the utter dishonesty of the P.A.P.

Government  in the referendum. It is a plot to hide from the eyes of the  people

the actual result of the voting in the referendum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us trace the arguments and see how the P.A.P. Ministers argued in the

Select Committee. I refer you to column 388 of the Official Report of the Select

Committee on the Singapore National Referendum Bill, No. 6, Sir, dated 16th May,

1962. The Minister for Home Affairs said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Speaker, Sir, we cannot accept the amendment and the Schedule proposed

by  the  Member for Queenstown, because the result, according to  the  proposed

Schedule,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 421</b></font><br><br>



would  be  declared  division by division; whereas, as  I  think  I  have  said

earlier  in  this  Select  Committee, the result of  the  referendum  would  he

declared for Singapore as a whole.'



<br><br>And he followed up. It is a very interesting bit, Sir, and I think it deserves -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Honourable

mention!

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - to be recorded in the Hansard. The Minister for Home Affairs said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Therefore, the proposed Schedule is not appropriate for a referendum.'



<br><br>Then another excuse:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Then other details in the Form; for example, the number of blank ballot

papers  cast -  this  actually should read the number of  unmarked  or  uncertain

ballot papers cast. They cannot be blank papers. As I say, if we look at the New

Clause  (A),  you  will  find  that unmarked and  uncertain  ballot  papers  are

provided, but not blank papers.'



<br><br>He  was trying to make out that unmarked papers are not blank papers. These  are

excuses. We will read through and see:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Then spoilt ballot papers too, I think, should not be lumped together with

uncertain ballot papers.'



<br><br>You  will remember, Sir, that when I first moved the amendment, the wording  was

not  very accurate and, of course, he had his legitimate objections. He  further

raised objections:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'They are two different things. No mention again in the Schedule, for

instance,  is  made  of rejected ballot papers which are different  from  spoilt

ballot papers.'



<br><br>I  have  now  in the amendment, unmarked paper, rejected ballot paper - everything

that he asked for. Then he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Finally, one common form of statement prescribed in the Bill, which is a

general  referendum Bill, [general referendum Bill again!] may not  be  suitable

for use on all occasions when a referendum is held.'



<br><br>He further said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The declaration of the result of the poll is an administrative matter, and it

is for the Superintendent to compile the statement in the form best suited for a

particular referendum.'



<br><br>Then he repeated again:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is a general referendum Bill. We should not have a Schedule which will be

only suitable for a particular type of referendum.'

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> M. . m. . m. . m!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Member for Cairnhill ought to know better. We

are now reaching the end of this sitting and he makes unseemly noises. Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Then, Sir, this is what I said in reply, in the same

column 388, in the last paragraph:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Chairman, Sir, is the Minister willing to accept the principle that the

statement should be clear to the people?'



<br><br>That is all I ask for, Sir: whether or not

the  Minister is willing to accept the principle that the result of  the  voting

should be made clear to the people. I have emphasised that it is the duty of the

Government  to inform the people, and the people have a right to know  how  they

voted.  But  if you turn to the next page, Sir, at column 389, the Minister  for

Home Affairs said this in' the second paragraph:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said, this Bill is a general referendum Bill [I

think I have said that they have mentioned it about thirty or forty times in the

Select Committee] and we should not have in it a definite form of Schedule which

cannot be applicable for all occasions.'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It is midnight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and took the Chair of

the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to report that the Committee has

made progress on the Bill, and beg leave to sit again on Monday, 2nd of July.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> So be it.
