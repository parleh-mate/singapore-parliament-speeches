<br><br>2.33 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

support  the  Motion of the Member  for  Kim  Keat

expressing our thanks to the

President for his speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the close of yesterday's meeting I was

speaking  on  Education and I would  now  hike  to

continue.   In  the  contents  of  the   education

programme  we  should stress on the  strengthening

and  inculcation of an ethical concept  so  as  to

enable  our  younger generation to be law-abiding.

The  teachers and the authorities concerned should

revise the textbooks by doing away with unsuitable

contents and replacing them with relevant contents

which will add to the moral sense of the children.

As the Addendum on the Ministry of Education deals

with   the  publication  of  textbooks  and  other

programmes,  I  hope my suggestion will  be  taken

into consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is pointed out in the Addendum on the

Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  that  we  need  to

cooperate  with our neighbours. Our  participation

in  ASEAN activities is beneficial to countries in

this  region because it contributes to the  peace,

prosperity  and order of this region. This  is  in

keeping  with  our foreign policy of  making  more

friends  and fewer enemies, and it also  maintains

our  good  relations with peoples  throughout  the

world.  In order to ensure our long term interests

and  survival, our people must learn  to  co-exist

with our neighbours. In this respect, besides  the

official government contacts, we can also keep  in

touch with our neighbours through trade, commerce,

culture  and other exchanges in order  to  promote

mutual interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is mentioned in the Addendum on the

Ministry  of  Labour  that  a  new  Bill  will  be

introduced to amend the Workmen's Compensation Act

to  increase  the  amount of compensation  to  the

injured worker, and that payment will be made more

speedily.  In a fatal case, the compensation  will

be  raised from $21,600 to $35,000 and in the case

of  a  worker  who  is  disabled  permanently  the

compensation will be raised from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>



$28,800 to $45,000. Sir, this is no doubt  a  very

reasonable  figure of compensation for the  family

of  the  victim.  It  is  a  clear  indication  of

Government's  concern  for  the  welfare  of   the

workers  and  their families.  But  what  is  more

important is to safeguard the lives and welfare of

the   workers  because  they  contribute  to   the

progress of our national economy. In view  of  the

increasing  number  of industrial  accidents,  the

Labour   Department  will  have  to  tighten   its

supervision over the safety of the workers and  to

request   employers  to  abide   by   all   safety

regulations. The workers themselves should also be

safety-conscious   and  play  their   part.   With

tripartite  cooperation, we will then be  able  to

reduce  the number of industrial accidents to  the

minimum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Ministry of Culture, I would say that

cultural and art activities are very important  in

the  promotion  of  cultural  development  of  our

people.  In  the past year we have  had  quite  an

active  programme of cultural and art  activities.

Considering  the  fact that tickets  for  cultural

performances at the Victoria Theatre were  usually

sold  out,  we can judge the popularity  of  these

performances, which included dramas, concerts  and

plays in the vernacular. All these speak well  for

the   development   of  our   cultural   and   art

activities.  With  the concerted  efforts  of  the

Ministry  of Culture, the people and the  artistes

concerned,  we  will be able to  promote  creative

arts  and  cultural  forms.  In  this  way,  I  am

confident that we will be able to instill  in  our

people a better sense of culture and art.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the standard of our medical service has all

along  been  maintained at a very high level.  Our

medical  service  has  made  a  good  contribution

towards the health care of our people. In addition

to   the   purchase   of  modern   equipment   and

paraphernalia, the Government has also taken steps

to increase and to train medical personnel to look

after  our  sick. Today, our people  are  able  to

enjoy  a  healthy  life and they  must  thank  the

authorities  concerned for the services  provided.

The Ministries of Defence,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>



Education and Health have the largest share of the

budget  expenditure, but it is well worth spending

because  it  is related to the people's  security,

knowledge  and health. However, I am perturbed  by

the  suggestion to increase the outpatient medical

charges, because it is the poor people who  go  to

the Government clinics or hospitals for treatment.

So  it  will have a very hard effect on the  poor,

because  the additional charge of $2  or  $3  will

increase  their burden. I would like to appeal  to

the  Government  not to increase the  charges  for

outpatient treatment and Third Class Ward charges,

so  that  the  burden  of the  poor  will  not  be

aggravated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past the Community Security Force has

played their role very well in the maintenance  of

security,  peace  and  order  in  various   areas,

including   Housing  Board  estates.   They   have

contributed much to the efforts of the police  and

the security force. This security measure will not

only  train  our younger people in the cultivation

of  a  sense of security but it will also  promote

good  relationship between the Community  Security

Force and the people. We hope that in future  they

will be able to provide a greater contribution  to

the security of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have studied the Addendum on 13 Ministries

but I have not been able to find a single item  on

public construction in the rural areas. I am  very

much   perturbed  by  this.  In  the   past,   the

Government  has allotted large sums of  money  for

public  construction and development in the  rural

areas,  such  as  the provision of drains,  street

lights, the construction of roads, electricity for

homes  and the betterment of the rural environment

or  the  rural dwellers. Although a great part  of

the  rural  areas  have been improved,  there  are

stilt many areas which need improvement. There are

still some kampongs which lack water supply,  good

roads and other facilities. As a representative of

a  rural  constituency, I would like to speak  for

these   people.   I  appeal  to  the   authorities

concerned to continue to allocate large



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>



sums  of  money to remedy the ills  in  the  rural

areas  by  the  provision of public utilities  and

other facilities so that the rural people will  he

very grateful for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are happy to note that although the

Government  has been paying attention to  economic

development,   national   construction   and   the

provision  of means of livelihood for the  people,

yet it has not neglected the recreational needs of

the  people.  According to  the  Addendum  on  the

Ministry of National

Development,  the  Government  has  undertaken  to

develop a 300-acre site along the Tanjong Rhu  and

Bedok  sea coast. This area will be developed  not

only  as a holiday resort for our people but  also

as  a  tourist resort. Various kinds of  amenities

will be provided there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching on other matters, 1 am glad to note

that  the  Ministry  of Social Affairs  will  take

action to curb the unreasonable and high rates  of

interest  charged by the moneylenders in order  to

safeguard  the interest of the poorer people.  The

Ministry  of National Development will also  build

condominium housing in order to meet the needs  of

the  middle-class  people. The  Ministry  of  Home

Affairs will have full-time national servicemen in

the  Police Force. The increased manpower  of  the

Police  Force will curb the increasing  number  of

crimes  and it will also help to maintain law  and

order   more  effectively.  On  the  question   of

hawkers'  livelihood, the Government will  set  up

more  hawker centres in the coming years to  house

the   temporary   hawker  licence   holders.   The

Government is going to improve the environment  of

the  people by reducing all kinds of pollution and

raising the standard of public hygiene. All  these

measures  will show that the Government is  taking

all the necessary steps to try its best to promote

the  interest and livelihood of the people.  In  a

review of the performance of our economy over  the

last  year,  the  President  has  said  that   our

economic growth was about 7%.In the wake of world-wide  recession and inflation, our achievement  is

really  laudable. As the President has said,  this

has all been due to the self-discipline,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>



diligence,  frugality and the spirit of enterprise

of  our  people. In the coming years  we  will  be

faced   with  possibly  even  greater  challenges.

However,    with    the   effort,   determination,

capability   and  the  wisdom  of  the  Government

together  with  the diligence,  effort  and  self-discipline of our people, I am confident  that  we

will  be  able  to  overcome all difficulties  and

achieve  all  the  various  beneficial  programmes

towards nation building in a more glorious way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Motion.



<br><br>2.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I join my colleagues in

thanking the President for his policy statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the old saying, every cloud has a silver

lining,  he  has  forecast that our  economy  will

probably do better in the second half of 1975 than

in  the first half. This is a welcome forecast and

I  have  no  doubt that given the proper planning,

guidance  and leadership Singaporeans will  strive

towards  making  the  best of even  the  deepening

recessionary period that we are facing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister himself has cautioned

the  over-reactive Singaporeans to  any  situation

and  the  Deputy  Prime Minister has  also  warned

against   over-worrying  and  guessing  when   the

recession  would end. In spite of the  possibility

of  an  improved economic situation in the  second

half   of   this  year,  we  must  guard   against

complacency  and its other extreme, panic  of  any

kind.  Even  in the past year, although  our  real

growth  has  been only around 7%, we were  not  so

badly  off  as many other developing countries  in

view of our sound currency, favourable balance  of

payments,  sound industrial relations  system  and

the climate of social and political stability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President confidently stated that

Singaporeans being relatively young will adjust to

slower growth rates. I certainly hope they do.  My

fear  is  that a large number of our young workers

have  come into the labour market after  1968  and

they have tasted rapid economic boom



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>



and  have  taken  the  higher  growth  rate  we

enjoyed for granted. It is incumbent upon  all  of

us to stress the virtue of hard work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to the end of January this year, about 18,000

people have been retrenched in Singapore. This  is

about  2%  of our total work-force. The slackening

of  demand  for the products of existing factories

in  Singapore,  as a result of the world  economic

situation,  was  the main factor that  caused  the

closure  of  a large number of establishments  and

cutting   down  on  the  labour  force  of   other

establishments.  Hardest hit among  the  factories

which  had  to  reduce their work-force  were  the

electronics,   plywood  and  textile   industries.

Fortunately,  the retrenchment situation  has  not

been  manifestly felt until recently because about

79%  of the workers who lost their jobs were women

and  young girls who were apparently not the  sole

breadwinners of their families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is heartening to note that the Ministry of

Labour  has set up a special retrenchment unit  to

assist  retrenched  workers  to  seek  alternative

employment. Although it was known earlier that the

retrenched workers responded very poorly  for  job

placements, things have now changed. In the  early

days  of  retrenchment, the vast majority  of  the

retrenched girls were perhaps depending  on  their

savings or expecting better jobs because they were

not  the  sole breadwinners of their families.  In

recent  months, more and more of these  retrenched

workers  have  come to Members of  Parliament  for

assistance   in  employment.  This  is   a   clear

indication  of  the tightening labour  market  and

jobs  becoming  scarcer as a  result  of  mounting

retrenchments  in the light of world  recessionary

trends.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must in a concerted manner take steps to

prevent  or  minimise the impact of  retrenchment.

These  measures are effected within the  framework

of   a   rational   economic   analysis   of   the

retrenchment    situation    within     tripartite

relationship   of   active   cooperation   between

Government,  trade  unions  and  employers,   with

special emphasis placed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>



on  increasing  productivity through  adoption  by

management  of new productivity techniques,  skill

acquisition by workers and preference given to job

deployment and part-time work as against  complete

retrenchments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore employers whose industries are hit by

economic   recession  should   be   required,   if

necessary  by  legislation,  to  give  the  Labour

Ministry  and the trade unions advance  notice  of

any  impending retrenchment exercise. I  am  aware

that   the   Labour  Ministry  has   advised   the

industries to do so. But I am doubtful as  to  how

many  employers are complying with  this  request.

They  should provide the Ministry with a  list  of

workers to be retrenched and the reasons for their

action.  This  would  enable the  Labour  Ministry

officials,  if  necessary with  the  help  of  the

Economic Development Board, to advise them on  how

best to tackle the various problems involved. This

also  helps  the  Ministry to monitor  the  labour

situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is fortunate in that there is no

dominant  sector  in our economy  which  generates

most  of  our  Gross National Product or  provides

most jobs.



We  have industries and multinational corporations

from all corners of the globe. In other words,  as

it  has  often been said, we do not have  all  our

eggs  in  one  basket.  Such  diversification   is

certainly   Singapore's  hope  and  mainstay   for

economic  survival,  for while certain  industries

are  badly  hit, such as electronics, plywood  and

textiles, other industries like tourism and  ship-repairing continue to expand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Addendum on the Ministry of Labour stresses

the  need  for "discipline, hard work,  efficiency

and  skill of our workers, and the enterprise  and

innovation of our entrepreneurs." This has  always

been  the  NTUC  philosophy. In fact,  to  further

emphasise  it,  the  NTUC has  instituted  certain

changes in its own set-up so that broad principles

for  its  affiliates can be drawn up. One  of  the

important  aspects of this change is the education

of  trade  union officials as well as members.  In

this  context,  we  will  have  to  decry  certain

employers who begrudge



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>



the   granting  of  paid  educational  leave   to

workers.  Such employers are antisocial  as  these

workers'  educational courses  have  a  pronounced

social  value  and  orientation emphasising  basic

economics,   means   and   methods    of    higher

productivity and tripartitism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also welcome the initiative of the National

Productivity  Board  in  convening  the   National

Industrial  Relations Committee  to  consider  the

issue of productivity and wages. The NTUC which is

represented in this Committee is on public  record

as being in full support of the twin objectives of

the  Committee to increase productivity and wages,

but  the difficulties of this Committee should not

be  minimised.  The  past record  of  attempts  to

establish productivity councils under the old name

of works council is dismal indeed and if we are to

make   a  success  of  them  this  time  -a  vital

necessity if Singapore is to progress and  prosper

on the industrial front



-  both  management and labour must discard  their

old  prejudices.  Both  sides  must  approach  the

problems with a positive determination to work out

a just and equal solution in which the key issues,

that  is,  increasing productivity  and  equitable

rewards  for greater inputs are exactly  balanced.

Nothing is more certain than that if the Committee

produces   a   solution  which   ensures   greater

productivity and neglects to see that the workers,

whose   additional  efforts  that  generate   this

increased    productivity   are   not   adequately

remunerated,  the  whole effort will  collapse  in

future as have previous efforts in this direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another welcome feature of the Addendum on the

Ministry  of Labour is the decision to set  up  an

Industrial  Relations Division. I do not  know  if

this  would  be  an extension of the  Conciliation

Section, or a supplement to it, or if it is  going

to be a separate division. It is praiseworthy that

they  intend obtaining high level staff.  I,  too,

happen to be in the same business of looking  for,

if  not  high level, suitable industrial relations

staff  for  our requirements in the  NTUC.  I  can

assure   the  Ministry  that  they  are  extremely

difficult to come by. Even if we recruit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>



some,  the  promising as well  as  a  few  of  the

mediocres  are grabbed by management.  Apparently,

their  need  is  greater than ours  and  they  are

willing  to pay for their needs. I would  like  to

caution  the  Ministry, however,  that  recruiting

staff for the Industrial Relations Division is one

thing,  but recruiting the right calibre of staff,

who   must   not  only  gain  the  confidence   of

management,  but also of labour is  necessary  for

the  success of the Industrial Relations Division.

Gaining the confidence of one party at the expense

of the other is bound to fail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC's call for the inclusion of industrial

dermatitis and noise-induced deafness to the  list

of   compensable  diseases  under  the   Workmen's

Compensation Act was made as early as 1972. We are

grateful that the Ministry of Labour has  at  last

found  the  soundness of this request and  has  so

listed. In the industrial safety and health field,

the  Ministry of Labour is very actively  pursuing

policies  of inspection and enforcement. In  spite

of  the  inadequacy  of sufficiently  well-trained

officers, the Ministry of Labour is doing  a  good

job.  This  division has got to be  congratulated.

Our  industrial  safety and health  standards  are

reasonably  high in comparison with  that  of  the

developing countries despite the recent  accidents

in   building   construction  and   ship-repairing

fields.   However,  inspection   and   enforcement

officials should be ever vigilant and mindful that

our  action  does  not in any way  result  in  the

stifling  of the competitive edge we have  in  the

region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apprenticeship schemes for children between the

ages of 12 and 14 years and allowing young persons

between  14  and  16  years  of  age  to  work  in

industrial  establishments would  help  those  who

leave  school at an early age for some  reason  or

other.   However,  proper  apprenticeship  schemes

should  be drawn up and inspection of such schemes

would   be   necessary   to   prevent   abuse   of

apprenticeship trainees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me make a few comments now on the Addendum on

the   Ministry  of  Health.  Looking  through  the

comprehensive Addendum, it says so much about  our

population policy, hospital



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>



development, disease patterns, etc.,  but  nothing

about  recruitment of doctors, specialists,  etc.,

and  most important of all the retention of  these

specialists.  We cannot just write-off  the  whole

episode  by  just  saying  that  doctors  are  not

dedicated.  There  is  definitely  more  money  in

private  practice.  It appears  as  if  Government

hospitals  train  doctors in the  early  years  of

their career for the private sector. Although this

may not necessarily be a bad thing, the Government

should be in a position to retain some experienced

doctors  and specialists for its own  use  in  the

Government  hospitals.  Perhaps  a  commission  of

inquiry like the Police Services Commission should

be  set  up  to  resolve  the  situation.  Such  a

commission  would indicate the areas of discontent

among our medical officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is gratifying to note that growing numbers of

young  Singaporeans have come to regard career  in

the  Armed Forces rewarding and respected.  It  is

also  with  pride that we can state  categorically

that  we are now embarked on a qualitative instead

of  quantitative defence capacity. However,  there

is  one  aspect in which the Ministry  of  Defence

should direct its planning with a little more care

than now, i.e, the in-camp training for discharged

national  servicemen. It has been  brought  to  my

notice that a few ex-national servicemen have been

called up for full-time in-camp training twice  in

a  year;  each  training lasted for more  than  20

days. Particularly in respect of officers who  are

engaged  in  executive  positions  in  government,

statutory  boards  and  the private  sector,  this

places a strain on the employers as well as on the

officers.  This also disrupts, in some  instances,

important work that the officers are performing in

their place of work. I am sure some device can  be

formulated  so that they are only called  up  from

their  place  of work once a year or this  in-camp

training given during the weekends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that the Ministry of Home Affairs is

going  to  organise more campaigns in  the  coming

years.   Like   the  hon.  Member  for   Henderson

mentioned yesterday, well planned and spaced-out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>



campaigns have their educational effectiveness. If

I  remember correctly, last year the Ministries of

Health  and Home Affairs organised the most number

of  campaigns. If we are not careful, one of these

days,  some  hon.  Members  of  this  House  might

organise  a campaign against all campaigns!  Those

Members  who  are  organising campaigns  for  next

year, please note this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While congratulating the Housing and Development

Board  on  the  record number of 26,000  units  of

flats  built  last  year, I  would  also  like  to

comment  on the qualitative aspect of its  housing

programmes.  I strongly believe that  with  proper

and  vigilant  supervision  quality  need  not  be

sacrificed for quantity. In recent months, I have,

on  behalf  of the Housing and Development  Board,

balloted  for thousands of flats in Telok  Blangah

and  I  have received just as many complaints.  It

appears as if the Housing Board takes over  blocks

of   flats   from  the  contractors  without   the

necessary  full  inspection of the flats,  ballots

them  off  and  hands keys over to the  respective

tenants  or flat-owners. Trouble starts from  then

on.  Complaints of leaking sewerage  pipes,  doors

and  windows which are either jammed or unable  to

be   locked,   floors  that  are   as   rough   as

unmaintained rural roads, pour in. The  complaints

pour  in  as  fast as the flats are  let  out.  It

sometimes takes months for the Board to attend  to

these complaints.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, my friend the Honourable Minister

for Education is not here and if he were here,  he

would be terribly disappointed if I do not comment

on   the   Ministry  of  Education,  my  favourite

Ministry. The policy and the content of changes in

our  Education system has been far too many. While

reserving the details for the Budget Debate, may I

just  make  a few general comments with regard  to

these changes, past and present. Let me start with

History.  The hon. Member for Ulu Pandan mentioned

yesterday  of  the importance of  History  in  the

school curriculum. I will only mention the changes

in our Education



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>



system  with regard to History. Once, Sir, just  a

few  years  ago, we taught History in primary  and

secondary schools in the first language. Recently,

we  taught History in the second language. The new

policy is "History in no language".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite recently too, the second language exposure

time was increased. Even more recently, principals

were  told  that  they can be flexible  about  the

exposure  time  depending upon  language  teachers

available. Yet another change, mind you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some years ago, at the end of primary school,

children were graded into academic, technical  and

commercial  streams  and  later,  practically  all

secondary  one and two pupils were made to  attend

two   years  of  workshop  practice  after   which

streaming  would take place. Now,  again,  we  are

told  that streaming is going to be at the end  of

their primary school career.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Ahmad Mattar):</b> That is wrong.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Well, I will wait for the

reply at the appropriate time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a few years ago, emphasis and more emphasis

was  placed on extracurricular activities.  Inter-District Meets of all kinds were encouraged.  More

recently, there have been directives for reduction

of ECA activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary education is to be extended to seven

years  with provision for some pupils to  complete

it  in  six years. Schools were told that  grading

for six-year or seven-year primary education is to

be  made at primary three level. A proper guidance

in  this regard is yet to be given. Could not  the

same  purpose  be  served in the  retention  of  a

primary pupil if he fails badly in a class for one

year?  In  other  words,  pupils  who  make   good

progress complete their primary education  in  six

years  and  those who fail stay on  in  a  primary

school for one more year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When is the Ministry of Education going to stop

treating teachers and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>



children as robots? Will the new Education Act put

an  end to, to quote the President in his Address,

"short-term  political considerations,  and  that,

instead,  you  will  be guided  by  the  long-term

interests of all our people."?



<br><br>3.16 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to add my support to

the  Motion to thank the President for his Address

to  the  House  and for highlighting the  problems

that  need  our  attention and  the  measures  the

Government  would need to adopt in  the  long-term

interests of the nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the policies outlined in the

Presidential  Address and in the Addendum  on  the

various   Ministries  and  support  the   proposed

measures designed to meet the long-term as well as

the day-to-day administration of our nation. I  am

sure  everyone of us will fully endorse  the  view

expressed by the President that it is the  primary

duty   of   government  to  establish  an   equal-opportunity society, where everyone has  an  equal

chance  to live, learn, work and play to the  best

of his or her capabilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, however, like to comment on a few

issues  relating  to  the  implementation  process

within government machinery. Firstly, however well-intentioned   government  may   be   and   however

meaningful the policies formulated, they will mean

very  little,  unless they can be implemented,  to

achieve  the objectives and the impact,  that  the

government  wants. In this regard, I  support  the

views expressed by the hon. Member for Jalan  Kayu

yesterday  -that the Government should  look  into

the  various  systems under which it now  operates

with  a  view  to  achieving better  co-ordination

between   Government   departments,   and   better

communication   and  interaction   between   civil

servants  and  the  public they serve.  Sending  a

letter,  particularly a badly worded or a strongly

worded   one,  to  a  member  of  the  public   is

communication  at  its lowest  level.  Interaction

implies  that  the reason for the letter  is  made

known to the reader, and the governmental policies

behind it explained, in polite and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>



clear tones. As I see it, there is need in certain

areas,  for better co-ordination, while in  others

there  is  a need for decentralisation. Procedures

and  mechanisms which have stood us in good  stead

in  the  past  may  now require  modification  and

revamping.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the 1980's, if everything goes on well in the

Asian and Pacific region, Singapore will be in the

beginnings  of  the technological  era.  The  main

challenge  to  our society will revolve  not  only

around  the  production of goods  alone  but  also

around the difficulties and opportunities involved

in  a  Singapore of accelerating changes and ever-widening options. While it is true that change has

always  been  a  characteristic of  the  Singapore

environment, in the eighties, the pace  of  change

will  come much faster and will affect every facet

of  life,  from  personal values to education  and

life styles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore glad to note that special

attention will be given to caring for the old, the

handicapped and the youths. In the past, and quite

rightly  too,  the  Government  has  focused   its

attention  on the productive side of  the  economy

such as jobs, tourism, income, and industries.  In

so  doing,  it may not have done as much  for  the

young,  the old, and the handicapped as  it  would

like  to.  As  a  Government  which  has  achieved

considerable success in developing the economy and

redistributing  the economic cake  to  workers,  I

would  think it is time now for the Government  to

pay  more attention to the less exciting but  more

human  and  social  aspects of development.  After

all,  the  aged and the handicapped are  also  our

citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is satisfying to note that the Education

system  will be restructured to meet the needs  of

the  times and the educational facilities expanded

according  to  the  needs of  our  population.  We

should  also remember that teachers play  a  vital

role  in shaping the attitudes and the life-styles

of  our  youths. I would urge for a more objective

and  effective system to reward and  motivate  the

teaching  profession. On the other hand, we  would

also need to evolve a system



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>



to identify and penalise the few black sheep. I am

persuaded  to  think  that the  various  teachers'

associations and unions may be well-placed  to  do

this  to  seek out these few who tarnish the  good

name  of  the  teaching profession. This  need  to

identify and penalise the black sheep should  also

apply  to  other sectors, for example,  the  Armed

Forces. Human nature being what it is, much public

misunderstanding and ill-feeling  can  result  if,

under the guise of discipline, harsh penalties and

labour  are  meted  out  to  national  servicemen,

usually by an irresponsible few. More efforts must

therefore  be  made to minimise such incidents  to

preserve the good image of our army. Trade  unions

should  also  see  to  it that  irresponsible  and

mischievous  elements amongst  their  members  are

weeded out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that we have developed very fast. It

is also true that we may have achieved in 16 years

what it may take some other countries a century to

attain.  At  such  a  rapid rate  of  development,

problems will most certainly loom. Already, we are

experiencing a shortage of skilled and experienced

manpower  in  certain sectors which  can  only  be

developed with time. The Government should try  to

minimise  these problems and not merely shrug  its

shoulders in a "can't-be-helped" attitude or "What

to  do?  The  system is such?"  attitude.  Let  us

recognise   and   drive  home   the   point   that

individuals are responsible for their  actions  as

well  as  inactions.  The Government  should  take

cognizance  of  this  lest,  in  the  process   of

accepting certain systems and not daring  to  make

changes,  it may produce demigods among the  civil

service  and  cause frustration to many  whom  the

service is supposed to serve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final analysis, what is most important is

for   the   Government  policies  to  be   lucidly

explained  to  the public by those  who  implement

them.  Our  people  must know and  understand  the

problems of development, so that they can learn to

accept  the  things they cannot change;  have  the

courage to change



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>



what  they can change; and above all, possess  the

wisdom  to  know the difference. This  wisdom  can

only be developed through better communication and

education.  The Government can and should  take  a

leading role in this.



<br><br>3.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  to  associate  myself  with  the  sentiments

expressed  by the Member for Kim Keat in  thanking

the President for his speech at the opening of the

Third Parliament on 21st February.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has had to face a number of crises over

the  past  decade,  both  internal  and  external.

However, the Government has been constantly on the

alert   and   was  able  therefore  to   draw   up

alternative  plans well in advance.  The  Republic

has consequently managed to weather the storm. The

determination  and willingness of  our  people  to

make    adjustments   to   new   situations   also

contributed  in  this  effort.  In  fact,  it  was

possible for Singapore not only to survive but  to

prosper as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although most people, including well-known

economists, predicted that 1975 would be a year of

economic  recession which could bring in its  wake

very  difficult situations, things appear to  have

levelled  off,  at least for the time  being,  and

there is every hope that with a certain amount  of

sacrifice, determination and careful planning,  we

will  be  able to surmount the more recent crisis.

Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is imperative  that

we ensure that none of our resources is wasted and

that  government  spending will help  bring  about

maximum returns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, I would like to refer to one

item  which  I feel has not been given  sufficient

attention.  The Government, I understand,  intends

to spend a large sum of money to recruit and train

apprentices,  to boost the supply of  skilled  and

semi-skilled personnel for our industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that vocational schools

do not provide the entire



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>



training required for apprentices. The training at

vocational schools cannot be as effective as  that

given  to  apprentices  in factories.  There  they

receive  or the job training which, in due course,

will  enable them to do the actual work  they  are

expected  to  do. Although workshop  practice  and

theory   will  undoubtedly  provide   some   basic

training, it is the practical application of  this

learning-in-industry which is most important,  and

this  sort  of  training can only be  acquired  by

solid work experience in factories. If we leave it

solely  to vocational schools to train our  future

technicians, there will be a time lag  of  two  or

three  years  before  these  technicians  can   be

efficient  in  the work that they will  eventually

have to do in the factories, the workshops and  so

forth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would respectfully submit, therefore, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, that Government should evolve  more

training schemes for apprentices in factories  and

utilise  funds for these training schemes  instead

of  spending  more  money in  building  vocational

schools.  I feel sure that industry would  welcome

this  move,  for  although  many  industries   are

willing   to  train  apprentices,  training   also

consumes the employer's time and money. Perhaps  a

scheme could be worked out whereby the apprentices

receive  simultaneous on-the-job training  in  the

factories  as well as instruction in the  existing

vocational  schools. This, Mr Speaker, Sir,  would

appear  to  be  a more practical approach  to  the

problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering training schemes, with joint

participation from industry, provision  should  be

made  to  disallow apprentices from joining  trade

unions,  because they are trainees, and  as  such,

are  students. There appears to be no valid reason

why   students   should  join  trade   unions   of

employees.  If the apprentices join  in,  one  can

appreciate  the employer's reluctance to  take  on

apprentices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in regard to the Ministry of

Education's proposals for the coming year, I would

like  to draw the attention of this House  to  the

problems that are being created and the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>



irritation that is being felt by local students

as  a  result of the University's policy  to  give

foreign  students their share of accommodation  in

the  hostels, ignoring the requirements of our own

students.  This is not to say that I am advocating

the  total  ban  on  accommodation  at  University

hostels  for  overseas students. On the  contrary,

they  are most welcome, in principle, for it is  a

good  thing for our students to live and mix  with

students   from  other  countries.   It   promotes

understanding,  tolerance  and   a   widening   of

horizons.   However,  I  feel   that   a   correct

proportion  must be maintained for  many  reasons.

Perhaps I need only mention two. One is that if  a

large proportion of our students are unable to get

accommodation, they are bound to feel  disgruntled

and  dissatisfied and this, instead  of  promoting

harmony,  will  ultimately bring about  resentment

against  overseas students. This should  naturally

be  avoided. Second, if large numbers  of  foreign

students  are permitted in our hostels, they  will

tend  to  group together and form little societies

of their own, and this will inevitably be counter-productive in a very real way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad to note that the

Government is planning to impose stiffer penalties

for certain crimes.

It  is a well-known fact that it takes a long time

to  change laws. It is true that in recent  times,

some laws and regulations have been updated, but I

feel  that  most  of  our laws could  bear  closer

scrutiny and are worthy of updating and revision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore inherited quite a large number of laws

which  were  enacted during colonial days,  for  a

different era. Circumstances have changed over the

last  25 years. Social values have changed, social

problems  have changed, in fact the very  form  of

Government has changed. And yet, we are attempting

to  govern  on the basis of some of these  archaic

laws.  I have no doubt that the Attorney-General's

Chambers  must have given this matter thought  and

have  updated some of the laws, but  I  feel  more

could  be  done  to bring the laws  in  line  with

present day requirements.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take, for example, the penalty for

kidnapping or armed robbery. In certain countries,

for  instance,  Taiwan or China, the  penalty,  on

being  found  guilty,  is death.  They  are  shot.

Although  in  recent  times,  penalties  for  some

offences  have  been increased - fines  have  been

raised  and longer sentences imposed and  whipping

introduced in some cases - it is apparent from the

crime  rates  that it is necessary to ensure  that

the penalty fits the crime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may appear to be a hard approach but, as I

mentioned earlier, society has changed and  it  is

possible that some laws cater for situations which

probably do not exist any more and even as we deem

it necessary to modernise and update our industry,

to meet new technological needs, so also should we

update  our  laws to meet new social and  economic

needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think nobody can deny that

Singapore  is  the  foremost  State  in  providing

attractive  housing  schemes  for  its   citizens.

Today, the working man is able to purchase a  flat

of  his own, even though he may be earning $300  a

month  or less. I feel we can be justifiably proud

of  the  fact  that  Singapore has  been  able  to

provide this basic social amenity for its citizens

and  indeed  it is an important one.  Without  the

Building Control Division and without proper  laws

governing  the construction of private  dwellings,

both   by   individuals  and  developers,  serious

problems must arise. Nevertheless, I hope that the

Building  Control  Division will  divert  more  of

their energies to the bigger issues and the bigger

projects,  rather than to small matters and  minor

issues.  .I  understand that the Building  Control

Division  appears  to be spending  a  considerable

amount  of  time  and energy chasing  after  small

house owners who, in their ignorance or need, have

somehow  committed minor infractions of  the  law,

such  as putting up awnings nearer the fence  than

permitted  by law. I think we should ask ourselves

whether  certain  sections of the regulations  and

laws which were enacted many many years



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>



ago,  when  land  area was no problem,  are  still

valid  today.  Some of the rules may  have  to  be

changed to meet present day circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two decades ago, bungalows were the order of the

day and the rules were made for ample space around

the  houses,  but  today when we are  cramped  for

space, should we really have the same yardstick?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly then, Mr Speaker, Sir, rethinking of a

very  vital kind is necessary regarding the issues

I  have touched upon. I would be grateful if  time

would  be  allocated for the  House  to  give  its

attention to these matters.



<br><br>3.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support my

colleagues in thanking the President of  Singapore

for his important and calculative address which he

delivered in this Chamber on 21st February, 1975.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President has outlined the many problems that

the country is facing or will be facing and he has

suggested  solutions which the various  Ministries

intend to do to offset these ills. However,  these

proposals  must  be  carefully and  systematically

implemented. Otherwise the masses will be taken by

surprise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is indeed a welcome move that the Government

intends to increase the Police manpower by  taking

in full-time national servicemen. This move has to

be introduced because of the growing crime rate in

Singapore.  However, one setback is that  we  must

see  that the people who are being trained in this

field are loyal and dedicated personnel, otherwise

the Police Force would be made a laughing stock if

crooks  are  found in their midst. I have  to  say

this because I understand that some of the present

lot  of part-time national servicemen are a  bunch

of  rogues.  Some  even engage in part-time  crime

activities after their duty hours. Some  part-time

national  servicemen in the Police Force are  even

sporting  long hair. So, steps must  be  taken  to

ensure that the move is well implemented with, out

creating problems in the future.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the point on the park and ride

scheme.  I  believe that in certain countries  the

shuttle  service in this scheme is given  free  of

charge.  But  we  in Singapore cannot  allow  this

because  the  privilege may  be  misused  or  will

affect  the overhead cost. Nevertheless,  I  would

like to mention that though this is a wise move to

solve  our  traffic problem, there  will  be  many

businessmen  in the Central Business District  who

can  afford  to pay the mere $60 Area licence  fee

for  their  vehicles. They might buy licences  for

most of their employees and thereby this will  not

solve  the  traffic problem. It  will  defeat  the

purpose  of  the  park and ride  scheme.  I  would

suggest  that we limit or apportion the number  of

licences for every business enterprise in the CBD



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Education system has gone through a

revolution during the last decade. There have been

so  many  changes that most parents are  confused.

Though we must admit that we have to keep up  with

the  times in our Education system, it should  not

be   changed  so  often.  Otherwise  teachers  and

principals will adopt a carefree attitude in their

methods of teaching. I hope the Ministry will take

my  advice  and see that changes are not  made  so

often.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year there was a headline in the Straits

Times  regarding  the pledge by the  Minister  for

Communications that there would not  be  any  more

problems of public transport in the years to come.

I   must  congratulate  the  Minister's  move   in

improving  the public transport system  from  then

on.  But,  nevertheless, there is still much  room

for improvement. Daily we find many breakdowns  of

the  buses,  infrequency of services and  snobbish

conductors  and reckless drivers.  Every  now  and

then  we  hear  that the SBS is commissioning  new

buses  on  the roads. This is indeed a  heartening

move. But, on the other hand, what about the buses

that  are  being involved in major accidents.  The

SBS  should  set up a committee to look  into  the

rising  rate of major accidents. Furthermore,  the

new  buses are of poor quality. Very often we  see

that  the  seats in the new buses are damaged  and

they are not very safe.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>



The SBS should not only look into the question  of

quantity but also on the quality of buses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last one year, bank rates on fixed

deposits  and  savings accounts had  been  revised

several  times. At one time the rate was increased

by  2%.  It was reduced subsequently. Though  this

may  be good for investments, it might cause  some

side  effects on people who are misguided by these

constant fluctuations, and it might result in  the

promotion of illegal activities like tontines  and

chit funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a wise act that the Government is

introducing  benefits for couples  to  have  their

parents  live  with them. This  is  to  allow  the

parents to work while the grandparents look  after

the  children. By this move, it will induce  close

relationship within the families and will  relieve

to  a  certain extent the social problems  of  the

country. This concept should be greatly publicised

to  let  the  people be more aware of  it  and  to

follow it accordingly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I did speak something on the subject

of  medical charges. I had asked the Minister  not

to  increase the medical charges. He did not reply

to  my question. I am sad to note that there is  a

hint  that  the  cost of medical services  may  be

increased.  I hope that the Minister  will  review

his    intention,   because   there    is    great

dissatisfaction   among  the  people   over   this

increase  in  the cost of medical services.  As  a

result, some people even turn to quack doctors  as

an alternative to the expensive hospital charges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we must admit that the people of

Singapore  have complained of the rising  cost  of

living   which   is  the  result   of   world-wide

inflation.  Nevertheless,  the  problem  is  being

eradicated  by  and  large and  let  us  hope,  as

predicted, that in the second half of the year  we

will do better.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to join hon. Members

of  this  House in supporting the Motion moved  by

the Member for Kim Keat to thank the President for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>



his  speech  delivered on behalf of the Government

at the opening of the Second Session of the Third Parliament on Friday,  21st

February, 1975.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President's speech together with the

Addendum  on  the various Ministries give  us  the

full picture of what the Government intends to  do

for   the  people  of  Singapore,  especially   to

maintain  political  and economic  stability  with

industrial  and economic growth. It is  also  very

necessary  to preserve the tripartite  cooperation

between Government, Management and Labour in order

to  solve all the various problems caused  by  the

present  world  inflation and recession.  However,

let  us  all do our very best to achieve the  same

real  growth  around 7% like  last  year,  and  if

possible, to score a higher percentage if we  can,

by the end of this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to learn that the Singapore birth

rates  continued  to fall and  that  total  births

declined  in 1974 to 44,000 from 48,000  in  1973.

For  a  country to achieve industrial  growth  and

economic progress, it is important that its  birth

rates  must be controlled. I sincerely  hope  that

all  the  young  married people in Singapore  will

have  small families and to limit each  family  to

two children only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is true that crime rates have been

increasing. The President had rightly said in  his

speech on 21st February, 1975, that "they want  the

good things in life but without working to pay for

them."  Quite frequently you will find reports  in

the  newspapers about theft, armed  robbery,  gang

fights,  rape  and murder. We must find  ways  and

means to stop them. I fully support the Government

in  introducing full-time national service for the

Police  Force to help deal with the growing  crime

rates.  I would request the Government to  recruit

more   Police  officers  to  maintain   its   full

strength.  Also the public must give full  support

and  cooperation  to the Police  in  dealing  with

criminals.  I think we can be proud of our  Police

Force. It is efficient in dealing with crimes  and

not  tainted by corruption. I would also  like  to

praise the good work the Vigilante



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>



Corps  are  doing under the establishment  of  the

Community  Security Force, especially  in  helping

the regular Police in crime prevention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Housing and Development Board is doing a

fine  job.  Last  year it completed  a  record  of

26,000  units.  I  am  happy  to  learn  that  its

building  programme will eventually  reach  40,000

units per year. In view of the fact that there  is

a  waiting list of 80,000 intending purchasers and

20,000 applicants to rent HDB flats, may I request

the  Government  to  limit the private  developers

from  building too many luxurious and costly flats

or  houses.  Most  Singaporeans cannot  afford  to

purchase them because of the high prices. They are

specially   built   for   businessmen   and   rich

foreigners  in  order to make  big  profit.  These

private  developers  care for their  self-interest

first,  purely  for  profit-making  and  not   for

national interest. With the present inflation  and

recession, most of the luxurious and costly multi-storey flats and houses are vacant in spite of the

fact that their prices have slightly gone down.  I

believe  by  limiting the private developers  from

building  unnecessary luxurious and costly  multi-storey  flats and houses, the Government can  make

good  use of the construction workers and building

materials  to build many more HDB flats  to  reach

the  target  of  40,000 units  a  year  so  as  to

eliminate   the  long  waiting  list   of   80,000

intending purchasers and 20,000 applicants to rent

HDB flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, several thousands of our young workers have

been  retrenched  from  the  electronic,  garment,

plywood  and  other  industries  because  of   the

present   inflation  and  recession.  Workers   in

America,  U.K., Europe, Japan and other  countries

have  also suffered retrenchment. Unemployment  is

on  the  increase everywhere. I am happy that  the

Ministry  of Labour has already set up  a  special

retrenchment  unit  in August  1974  to  help  the

retrenched workers to get other employment.  Young

workers  should not be too choosy in  accepting  a

job.  They  should  realise  that  all  jobs   are

dignified, but to remain idle, unemployed  and  to

depend   on  parental  support  is  shameful   and

disgraceful.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Ministry of Labour together with the

unions will keep a close watch on the retrenchment

situation  and  see that employers  do  not  abuse

their  right to retrench workers unless  there  is

real  justification to do so. Should there be  any

retrenchment, it is appropriate that the employers

should  discuss  these questions  with  the  union

leaders  as early as possible - whether  there  is

any  possibility  of avoiding it;  or  lessen  the

number  of workers to be retrenched; or to  deploy

them  to  other  departments or worksites;  or  to

operate a four or five-day week; or any other ways

and means to solve the problem to the satisfaction

of  both  parties.  If, finally,  retrenchment  is

unavoidable, the employers should give them  ample

notice  so  as  to cushion a sudden shock  and  to

enable  them  to make preparation  to  seek  other

employments.  Also  the workers  should  be  given

substantial  compensation as retrenchment  benefit

for the years of service that they have given.  If

this  procedure  of  retrenching  the  workers  is

adopted,   I   am   sure  there   will   be   less

misunderstanding   and  all   hostile   industrial

disputes  or  confrontation  can  be  avoided.  To

achieve  industrial peace, employers must  respect

the  workers as human beings and not to treat them

like machines but to appreciate the importance  of

understanding the human feelings of  the  workers.

To  enjoy  job  security, good wages,  and  better

conditions of service, workers must do their  duty

honestly,  sincerely,  efficiently  and  help   to

increase  productivity. However, it  is  necessary

for  both  sides  to develop trust, understanding,

confidence   and  cooperation  to   achieve   good

industrial relations and industrial peace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the Government's intention

to  raise  the standards of industrial safety  and

health, especially in building construction, ship-building and ship-repairing. These industries have

the   highest   rates   of  industrial   accidents

involving  serious bodily injuries and even  death

as  happened  in several cases. In  spite  of  the

warning  given  by  the  Ministry  of  Labour   to

employers,  there  is  not  much  evidence  of   a

reduction  in  the number of industrial  accidents

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>



deaths  in  these industries. These employers  are

only  interested in making big profits as  quickly

as  possible.  They do not care  very  much  about

adequate  safety equipments necessary to safeguard

and protect the workers from industrial accidents.

I am happy to learn that the Factories Act will be

amended  to  provide  for  more  stringent  safety

measures  and enhanced penalties will  be  imposed

where contraventions are likely to cause death  or

bodily  injury. I think we have given them  enough

warnings about giving proper industrial safety and

health  protection to their workers.  It  is  time

that severe action was taken against employers who

neglect  the  safety  of  the  workers,  as  their

negligence  may cause severe bodily  injuries  and

death to their workers. I would recommend that  we

impose maximum penalty of a fine and imprisonment.

Disciplinary  action should also be taken  against

workers  who  refuse to use the  safety  equipment

supplied to them. We cannot afford to lose so many

workers  in the industries, especially the skilled

ones,  through  incapacity  caused  by  industrial

accidents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is most appropriate that a new Workmen's

Compensation Bill will be presented to  Parliament

for  approval to increase the maximum compensation

from  $21,600 to $35,000 for a fatal case and from

$28,800   to  $45,000  for  a  case  of  permanent

incapacity.  I  am sure all hon. Members  in  this

House will give full support to this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would request the Government to expedite

the   passing   of  legislation  to  control   the

operations and management of private welfare homes

and  to  ensure minimum standards for the care  of

inmates and cleanliness of homes. This legislation

will  stop the exploitation and suffering  of  the

poor   aged   people.  May  I  also  request   the

Government  to allocate a number of Housing  Board

flats  to  the  aged  people  who  wish  to   live

collectively with their aged friends and  near  to

members  of their families in the Housing estates.

They  prefer  to stay in Housing Board  flats  and

near to their own people rather than going to  the

Homes of the Aged.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to the Sunday Times report on 16th

February, 1975, under the heading "Tax Sleuths  to

make  the  hawkers pay up", it is stated that  the

Inland Revenue Department has got several aces  up

its  sleeve  to  make hawkers who  are  liable  to

income  tax to pay up. Hon. Members of this  House

are  fully aware that a good number of hawkers are

making very good profit from their business.  Some

of them are earning more than hon. Members of this

House.  It is a fact that some hawkers are  owners

of houses, cars and partners of other enterprises.

Hon. Members of this House will agree with me that

when  hawkers  make  big  profits  they  have  the

capacity to pay income tax, and the Inland Revenue

Department  should not delay any further  to  make

them  pay  income tax. It will be  interesting  to

know how many hawkers have been paying income  tax

so far.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is some improvement in the public

transport,   especially,  the  bus  service.   The

implementation of the scheme to use  school  buses

to  carry  office commuters and other workers  has

greatly  helped to ease the long wait  for  buses.

Several  new buses have already been added  and  I

hope  many more will follow. I would request  that

the  school  buses should not be  withdrawn  until

there are adequate buses to serve the commuters. I

also  welcome  the  employment  of  women  as  bus

drivers  and  conductresses. They are doing  their

jobs  quite  satisfactorily. I  hope  more  female

workers will be employed in the bus service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Motion.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the

Motion of the hon. Member for Kim

Keat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President of our Republic has reminded us

that  we have thrived in the past because of self-discipline,  hard work, thrift and enterprise.  He

also  exhorted  hon. Members to be guided  by  the

long-term interests of our people and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>



not  to  be  swayed  by  short-term  political

considerations.  We should take his  reminder  and

his exhortation seriously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have only to ponder upon the twin problems of

inflation  and recession, affecting  the  advanced

countries   and  the  international  economy,   to

realise the truth of the President's words. In the

advanced  countries, government expenditures  tend

to  increase inexorably, spurred by misguided,  if

well-motivated, compassion for the unemployed  and

the underprivileged. Every congressman and senator

tries  to  get  government projects  for  his  own

constituency.  Subsidies are used as vote-catching

devices. Such expenditures and subsidies  must  be

financed  by  higher  taxes or  by  printing  more

money,  or  both. Higher taxes hit those  who  are

able  to  pay, penalising in the process not  only

the  feudal rich but also the hard-working and the

enterprising.  Since higher taxes are  politically

unpopular,   governments  then   resort   to   the

additional, and easier, way of printing more money

to finance the higher expenditures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The net result of the process is, firstly, the

erosion   of   incentives  for   hard   work   and

enterprise,   and   secondly,   inflation,   which

penalises the thrifty, pensioners and fixed income-recipients,  and  which causes  disorientation  in

production and consumption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governments then react to curb inflation,

principally  by reducing the rate of  increase  in

money  supply.  However, in the meantime,  demand-pull  inflation, which was caused by the  monetary

and  fiscal excesses, becomes wage-push inflation,

as trade unions attempt to compensate for cost-of-living  increases.  The  problem  is  made  worse,

because  trade  unions demand  wage  increases  in

excess    of   productivity   and   cost-of-living

increases. Thus, inflation continues; at the  same

time,  recession  is  brought about,  as  business

firms  experience  a liquidity crunch  on  top  of

increasing  costs of production. Since  recession,

which    causes   unemployment,   is   politically

dangerous,  the next reaction is to stimulate  the

economy by cutting taxes and easing credit. It  is

politically difficult to cut expenditures. In  the

meantime, tax



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>



revenues in a recession tend to decline, as income

and  employment are lower. Therefore, the  tax-cut

results  in a huge budget deficit, which  must  be

financed   by  borrowing  or  by  easing   credit.

Borrowing  at a time of recession is  supposed  to

depress the economy further; hence, printing  more

money or easing credit is the standard solution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, we see in America, President Ford's

proposal  to  cut  taxes  to  the  tune  of  US$16

billion,  and  we  read about his difficulties  in

getting  Congress  to trim expenditures.  The  two

most depressed sectors in America are housing  and

the motor vehicle industry. Whether people who get

the   tax  rebates  will  spend  on  housing   and

motorcars  is  one question. What happens  to  the

money supply is a more critical question. And  the

rate  at  which the economy will turn  around  and

with  what degree of inflation depends on how much

the  confidence  of businessmen has  already  been

eroded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, the Europeans are also easing

fiscal and monetary policies and the Japanese  are

expected   to   do  likewise  shortly.   What   is

disturbing  to  me is that, with  so  much  global

interdependence  in  trade, investment  and  money

flows, there is hardly any attempt at coordination

of  policies  as  vital  as monetary  and  fiscal.

Therefore,  I  would  expect  another   round   of

inflation,    without    much    alleviation    of

unemployment.  I hope that the harvest  this  year

will  be  good,  for, with world  food  stocks  so

precariously  low,  any shortage  will  send  food

prices soaring, thus compounding inflation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three reasons why I expect further

inflation.    Firstly,   monetary    and    fiscal

stimulation produce considerable price effects for

a  given reduction in unemployment. Secondly,  not

many  people  are aware that monetary  and  fiscal

policies  do  not  work  the  same  way  when  the

exchange   rate   is   floating   and   there   is

considerable   mobility   of   capital.   Thirdly,

although there is controversy among economists,  I

am  inclined  to  the view that floating  exchange

rates  are  an engine of international  inflation.

This  is  because  wages and prices  are  flexible

upwards but not downwards. So  a  depreciation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>



of the exchange rate causes

prices  and  wages to rise while  an  appreciation

does  not  do the reverse to the same degree.  The

result is a net increase in world inflation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another worrisome aspect about floating exchange

rates  is  that there is a loss of stability  -  a

loss  of  a  stable  point of reference.  As  hon.

Members   know,  the  American  dollar  has   been

depreciating  rapidly and the OPEC  countries  are

concerned  about  the  price  of  oil  as  it   is

currently  denominated in the American dollar.  So

far  as  I  can  see, there can be  no  return  to

stability  and  fixed  exchange  rates  until  and

unless  the major industrial countries are willing

to  coordinate  their monetary, fiscal  and  trade

policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us in Singapore, we have no choice but to

accept floating rates as our trade and sources  of

investment  are diversified. We can have  a  fixed

exchange rate if the international economy returns

to  a  fixed  rate system or if we  tie  ourselves

exclusively to a particular currency and therefore

a  particular trading area. Our floating  exchange

rate  poses  a  policy dilemma. On the  one  hand,

allowing  our  rate to float upwards,  as  it  has

recently,  may  be  helpful in  reducing  imported

inflation,  provided our importers and wholesalers

pass  on  the benefits to retailers and consumers.

On   the  other  hand,  allowing  our  dollar   to

appreciate  would penalise the competitiveness  of

our  goods and services abroad. To hold  down  the

value  of  our currency would require the Monetary

Authority of Singapore to buy up foreign exchange.

However,   unless   such   foreign   exchange   is

sterilised,  this would result in  an  undesirable

increased  money supply generated by  the  banking

system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sound monetary management is vital to the health

of  our economy especially when our exchange  rate

is  floating.  Our  problem is compounded  by  the

international  mobility  of  capital.   If   other

financial  centres raise their interest rates,  we

have  to raise ours, or else money will flow  out,

and  conversely.  To  maintain  our  own  set   of

interest   rates   independently   would   require

controls   on   capital  movements   or   interest

equalisation taxes, or both. Such measures, however,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>



would hinder our development as a financial

centre.  We  have therefore to balance  the  gains

from being a financial centre against the loss  of

control over interest rates and money supply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, therefore, welcome the amalgamation of the

Currency  Board  with  the Monetary  Authority  of

Singapore to form a central bank. However, I would

urge  Government to keep careful track of monetary

policy  at  the highest level. This is because  of

the  instability  in  the  international  monetary

system and because, under floating exchange  rates

and  capital mobility, monetary policy is a  major

instrument of control over economic activity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lessons that emerge for us should be quite

obvious.  Firstly, we should continue to  exercise

financial   prudence,   making   sure   that   new

expenditures are properly justified and  that  the

means  to  pay for them are available. Any  fiscal

deficit  can  only be justified  if  the  projects

enhance  development and will eventually  directly

or  indirectly  pay for themselves.  Secondly,  we

should  maintain  our climate  of  confidence  for

investors,   ensuring  that  we   do   not   erode

incentives for hard work and enterprise.  Thirdly,

wages  should be related to productivity.  Workers

must  not get the attitude of wanting higher wages

without  acquiring the skills, the experience,  or

putting  in  the effort. In this connection,  Sir,

the  National Productivity Board will do its  best

to  promote productivity committees, and  to  help

formulate  policies to gear wages to productivity.

The  National  Industrial Relations Committee  has

already  met to discuss these issues. The  members

of  the  committee are drawn from  the  NTUC,  the

Singapore  Employers'  Federation,  the   National

Employers'  Council,  the Singapore  Institute  of

Management  and  the  Labour Ministry,  under  the

aegis   of   the   National  Productivity   Board.

Acquiring skills and raising productivity are  the

keys  to our survival and prosperity. Some  people

have  argued  that it is meaningless  to  increase

productivity at a time of recession because  firms

already have difficulty in selling



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>



their products or services. Increasing output with

a  given  input  is  only one way  of  looking  at

productivity. More important to us at  this  stage

is  to  minimise inputs for any desired  level  of

output.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore welcome the Labour Ministry's move to

set  up  an Industrial Relations Division and  the

reorganisation  of  the NTUC. Tripartism  must  be

exercised,  not just at the top level. To  achieve

results, Sir, the principle must permeate down  to

the  rank and file. What we should learn from  the

mistakes  of the advanced countries is that  wages

are   too   important  to  be  left  to   ordinary

collective bargaining and that a spirit of  mutual

cooperation  must  prevail.  Workers   should   be

committed  to the viability of the firm  and  both

workers  and  management should keep in  view  the

national interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth lesson we can draw is that fiscal and

monetary policies should he made to serve the long-term   interests   of   the   nation.   Short-term

expediency leads to traumatic stop-go policies. We

must   indeed   educate  our  people   to   accept

unpleasant, even painful, measures that  will  pay

off  in  the long run. We complain about high  PUB

bills,  bus fares and HDB conservancy charges.  It

would  be  expedient,  easy and  popular  for  the

Government not to raise such charges. But how will

these  services  be  financed?  Higher  taxes   or

printing  more  money are the alternatives  -  the

first penalises the hard-working and enterprising,

and  the second produces inflation which, as  hon.

Members know, is indirect taxation. In the end, if

we  follow expedient measures, we shall all be the

losers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are many difficulties

ahead  as  there  is considerable uncertainty  and

instability in the world economy. As a small, open

economy,  we  are  highly vulnerable  to  external

events.   We  can,  however,  by  being  vigilant,

insulate  ourselves to some degree. We can  ensure

our viability by working harder, by being prudent,

and   by  maintaining  a  proper  longer-term  and

national perspective. Our younger people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>



must acquire greater skills and diligence. Perhaps

the  current  difficulties will bring  a  dose  of

realism  to  the spendthrift and the  job-hoppers,

spurring   them   towards   thrift   and   greater

endeavours.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in the midst of

world-wide     inflation,     unemployment     and

uncertainty, and at a time when many countries are

faced   with   all   kinds  of  difficulties   and

pressures,  it  is  gratifying to  note  that  the

President  was  able to deliver a  speech  in  the

Second  Session of the Third Parliament  outlining

the   various   political,  social  and   economic

policies.   In   the  Addendum  on   the   various

ministries  we  can  see the various  measures  to

provide  solutions to the problems  faced  by  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's speech is a shot in the arm for

the  people,  both  within and outside  Singapore.

They   are  imbued  with  greater  confidence   in

Singapore when they face the future and our people

will  be  more  steadfast in  their  pursuits  and

contribution  to  nation building.  The  immediate

task  is  to implement all the measures  patiently

and  carefully.  This  is  a  very  important  and

difficult task, especially when we have to  adjust

to  the  lower economic growth rate. In  order  to

fulfil  these policies and objectives,  the  first

requisite is to have a government which  is  fair,

pragmatic  and  dares to face up  to  reality  and

which  can rally talents around it. I believe  the

People's  Action Party is the one party which  can

form   such  a  government.  Secondly,  the  civil

servants in the various ministries should be  hard

working,  honest and dedicated to their duties.  I

agree  with  the Member for Jalan  Kayu  that  the

civil servants should enhance the quality of their

service.  They should shun bureaucracy  and  serve

the people. Thirdly, our people should be aware of

their  civic duties. They should not be complacent

nor should they be despondent. They should be self-disciplined,     hardworking,     thrifty      and

enterprising, and should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>



place  national  interests  above  personal   and

sectional  interests  at  all  times.  With   such

cooperation and unity, we will be able to surmount

all difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum on the Health Ministry, the

President stated categorically that we must fulfil

the objective of a two-child-family, otherwise the

standard of social service and the quality of  our

environment  will  deteriorate,  because  of   the

pressure of population and congestion. This  is  a

sharp reminder to the people in Singapore that the

concept  of  family planning must be accepted  and

that  there  must be a curb on population  growth.

The  campaign on family planning not  only  has  a

direct  bearing on the well-being and interest  of

the  present and the next generations  but  it  is

also  a  major social and national task. We should

pay  tribute to the Health Ministry for  the  good

job they have done in bringing down the birth rate

to  19.8 per thousand. However, we should  not  be

complacent with such mean achievement.  We  should

continue  to  make greater efforts to achieve  our

ultimate  objective. Our success  in  curbing  our

population growth depends upon both the people and

the Government. Of the people, everyone should  be

aware  of  the  importance of family planning  and

that  they  should  accept  the  social  need  for

control   of  population.  Every  family,  whether

affluent  or  destitute,  should  adhere  to  such

principles.  They should strive for the  objective

of a two-child-family. Of the Government it should

always  review  the  services  and  increase   the

facilities  provided for the people  in  order  to

ensure effectively that every family has an  equal

share in enjoying such facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the results of the family planning campaign,

we  find  that people from the lower income  group

and  in rural areas do not respond well to such  a

campaign.  This is perhaps because  of  their  low

level  of  education  or  because  of  their  more

conservative  attitude.  They  therefore  find  it

difficult   to  accept  the  concept   of   family

planning.  This requires our immediate  attention.

As a matter of fact they are the ones who are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>



in  greater  need of family planning,  because  if

they  can  keep  their  families  small,  it  will

alleviate  their  burden.  But  because  of  their

educational background and environment  they  have

not  been  able to pay heed to such problems.  The

Health   Ministry   should  therefore   pay   more

attention  to  this class of people.  They  should

provide  more  and better facilities to  publicise

such campaigns. Adequate educational campaigns and

good  public relations facilities should  also  he

provided,  otherwise  we  will  not  be  able   to

establish  a  stable society where  everyone  will

have  an equal opportunity to live, learn,  train,

contribute their best and earn their living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum on the Ministry of National

Development,  we note that the Primary  Production

Department  is  doing well. In the  past  we  have

often  experienced shortages of  imported  primary

supplies  and high prices. But we have been  self-sufficient in the production of pork, poultry  and

eggs,  and this has a stabilising effect  on  food

prices. Thus, it can he seen that our farmers have

a  great role to play in bringing down our cost of

living.  This is especially so when the  world  is

experiencing   food   shortages.    The    Primary

Production  Department should make greater  effort

to   promote  and  widen  the  range  of   farming

activities   rather   than  concentrate   on   the

production of a few agricultural items,  resulting

in a surplus of supplies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to develop and protect water supplies,

certain  pig-rearing  farms  would  have   to   be

resited. This is unavoidable. The farmers  realise

the  need  for  such  resettlements.  The  Primary

Production Department should advise the farmers to

carry out other alternative farming activities. So

long as the Government can give them encouragement

and  help,  they  will  he  able  to  succeed   in

embarking  on other farming activities to  make  a

living.  This will both maximise the use  of  land

and benefit the farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Motion by the Member for Kim

Keat.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.26 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support

of  the  Motion  to  thank the President  for  his

speech to this house. According to the President's

speech,  last year there was a 7% economic  growth

in  Singapore, while our foreign reserves exceeded

$6.5  billion,  showing a 20-fold growth  compared

with  1959. 1974 was a most eventful year for many

countries.  The  energy crisis and inflation  have

caused  many  developed countries to  suffer.  All

over  the world unemployment is mounting and  many

factories  have  closed down.  In  some  countries

there  have  been no economic growth at  all,  and

some  countries  have  only 2-3%  growth.  But  in

Singapore, without natural or energy resources and

with  very  limited  land, we have  been  able  to

achieve  a  growth rate of 7%.  This  is  a  clear

indication that the Government and the people  are

able    to    adapt   themselves    to    changing

circumstances,  and we could change  according  to

the  changes that are taking place. This  is  also

one  indication of our ruggedness  and  our  cool-headed adaptability, which are very laudable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President said in his speech that our economy

may  probably do better in the second half of this

year.  We must therefore prepare ourselves, always

with  our fighting spirit to meet the better times

ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President has pointed out in his speech that

steps  will be taken by the Government to make  it

attractive for young couples to have their parents

live  with  them,  so that their children  can  be

educated  and  taken care of by their grandparents

and at the same time the problem of the welfare of

the  old people can be solved. To have taken  note

of  this matter is something praiseworthy. This is

entirely in keeping with the ethical values of the

eastern  culture. Those who propound that the  old

people should be sent to Homes for the Aged should

take note that their proposition



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>



will  not solve the problem because the old people

will  still  feel  lonely and miserable  in  those

Homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attitude taken by the Government in this

direction reminds me of the many grievances that I

have come across in my Meet-the-People sessions. I

have  received complaints from those who live with

their  parents in one- or two-room flats that  the

space  available is very limited and as a  result,

old  parents  have  to sleep in the  sitting  room

while  further  addition to the family  makes  the

premises  even more congested. When they  ask  for

larger  flats, the normal reply from  the  Housing

Board is that the allocation of larger flats  will

be  made  on  a  "first come first  served"  basis

without  taking into consideration the  fact  that

the  old people have to sleep in the sitting room.

Because  of  this  situation  young  couples   are

compelled  to move out of the flat of the  parents

and  set  up  their own homes, thus leaving  their

parents  behind. Mr Speaker, Sir, in view  of  the

encouragement by the Government for young  couples

to   stay  with  their  parents,  I  propose  that

priority  for transfer to larger flats  should  be

given to people who have their parents living with

them in Housing Board flats and who find that  the

accommodation is inadequate. This is one  concrete

step towards the encouragement of young people  to

have  their parents stay with them. If the present

policy  remains unchanged, then the young  couples

may  have  to move out and stay on their  own  and

this  would be contrary to the Government's policy

of looking after the aged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From next month onwards, the Ministry of

Communications  will  implement  the  new  traffic

ticketing  system and the points  demerit  system.

This  new  legislation will  greatly  enhance  the

power of the traffic police to do good or evil.  I

would like to remind the authority concerned  that

in  implementing  this  new  law,  more  care  and

justice  should  be  exercised.  I  have  received

complaints  from various sources that some  police

officers have abused their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>



powers.  They seem to be very fond of persecuting

certain   motorists   and  harassing   them   with

innumerable  summonses. At first  these  motorists

put up with this over-excessive implementation  of

the law because of fear, until they could bear  it

no   longer.  When  they  complained   to   me   I

straightaway   referred  them  to   the   relevant

authorities,  after  which  the  complaints   were

easily resolved. In some cases, the traffic police

officers themselves are guilty of traffic offences

by  not  setting good examples. There was  a  case

where one police personnel himself did not observe

the traffic rules and knocked into somebody's car,

yet  he threatened the other party involved in the

accident. I am very concerned about such policemen

when  such wide powers are given to them,  thereby

creating  more  ill-will between  members  of  the

public and the police. This is particularly so  in

the  case of transport workers who are on the road

the whole day to earn their living. With such wide

powers,  the traffic police are able to break  the

rice  bowl  of  these  workers  and  affect  their

livelihood immensely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the cases that I have mentioned touched on

the   relationship  between  the  Police  and  the

people.  In  the past, of course, the Police  took

note of the question of public relations and there

have  been  a number of Police Weeks,  forums  and

Public Relations Promotion campaigns and so forth.

In my view, campaigns, exhibitions or forums alone

cannot succeed in promoting public relations.  The

main  crux of the whole matter is that the  police

officers themselves should behave properly in  the

course  of  their duties and gain the  respect  of

members of the public.
