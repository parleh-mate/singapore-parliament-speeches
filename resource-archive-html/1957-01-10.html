<div align="center"><b>SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 2 of 1957)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate in

Committee of Supply on Motion (9th January, 1957),



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly resolves that the sum of

$540,291 shall be supplied to the Government under

the  heads  of  expenditure and for  the  services

specified  in the Schedule contained in  Sessional

Paper   No.  Cmd.  2  of  1957."-(The  Financial

Secretary).



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>Announcement by the Chairman</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Before we resume I would like to

clear a point under the Standing Orders which  was

raised  yesterday  by  the Honourable  Member  for

Tanjong Pagar and commented upon by myself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The item under discussion was:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sub-head 1, new item - Permanent Secretary

(Establishment), Grade C ($1,950)... $23,400.00"



<br><br>under  Head  8,  Chief Secretary.  The  Honourable

Member  stated  that the reason  why  he  had  not

tabled  any amendment to this item was because  it

would have required the Governor's consent, and it

was  doubtful if the Governor would allow  Members

of  the Opposition to interfere with the terms and

conditions of service of serving officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I commented that there was nothing to prevent an

honourable Member from giving notice of  a  motion

to  reduce  any  item in any head of  expenditure,

that  he might be faced with having to obtain  the

Governor's recommendation or consent, but  that  I

did  not think that he was entitled to assume that

he  would not get the recommendation or consent of

the Governor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the opportunity to look into the

matter  a  little more closely and I am  satisfied

that, in this particular case, it was incorrect to

presuppose that it was in fact necessary that  the

Governor's  recommendation or consent  would  have

had  to  be  signified. The  relevant  portion  of

paragraph (1) (b) of Standing Order 33 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Except with the recommendation or consent of the

Governor signified thereto, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1272</b></font><br><br>



Assembly  shall  not  proceed  upon  any  bill  or

motion,  which, in the opinion of the  Speaker  or

the  Attorney-General, would effect any alteration

in the salary, allowances or conditions of service

(including leave, passages and promotion)  of  any

public officer...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, the provision under the relevant

item  is  for  a  new post of Permanent  Secretary

(Establishment) and no public officer has  as  yet

been   appointed  to  that  post.  In   my   view,

therefore,  no  public  officer  is  affected  and

consequently  the Standing Order  would  not  have

applied. It follows that the Honourable Member  in

fact   would  not  have  required  the  Governor's

consent  had  he given notice of an  amendment  to

reduce the sum allotted to that particular item. I

thought  it  was wise that I should  correct  that

misunderstanding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of debate on Question (9th January,

1957) proposed on Head 26 of the Schedule,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $10,000 for Head 26 stand part

of the Schedule."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schedule-







<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 26-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $10,000 for Head 26 stand part

of the Schedule."



<br><br>10.05 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr D. S. Marshall (Cairnhill):</b> If it please you,

Mr  Chairman, Sir, in objecting to the  grant  of

this  sum to the Royal Singapore Flying Club,  the

learned  Member for Tanjong Pagar  gibed  that  we

were  training pilots for bombing the Suez  Canal.

Sir, much as we may loathe the colonial breed,  it

would be wrong and churlish not to recognise  that

it  was these young men who not so long ago  stood

between humanity and Hitler; that it was they  who

changed  the  destiny of the  learned  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar from that of a nihongo  functionary

to that of a Kuo-yu patriot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Royal Singapore Flying Club, Sir, supplied

30 pilots in actual combat in Singapore during our

war  with Japan. I received this information  last

night  from  a man who was a member of that  group

and  who  himself is a domiciled Malayan  born  in

Singapore. But I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1273</b></font><br><br>



think  one useful purpose has been served by  this

objection. The learned Member for Tanjong Pagar is

right  in  complaining that the  majority  of  the

members  of this club are Europeans. That  is  not

the  fault of the Europeans who see an opportunity

for  healthy and interesting activities  and  take

advantage of it. It is the fault of our own  youth

and  it  is my hope that this debate will  receive

sufficient  publicity in the Press in  order  that

our  youth  should  be aware of the  opportunities

which  the  club  offers and that they  will  take

advantage of them. I, for one, Sir, fully  support

this subsidy.



<br><br>10.06 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir,  I  fully endorse the comments  made  by  the

Member for Tanjong Pagar yesterday regarding  this

grant  of  $10,000  to the Royal Singapore  Flying

Club. I cannot understand how this grant has  been

recommended.  Could  it  be  that  it   has   been

recommended on the ground that the word "Royal" is

there? "Royal", Sir, is a very big word!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Down with it!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Down with the word "Royal"! I

am told that only 30 per cent of the members learn

to fly. And out of this 30 per cent, a number will

gradually leave because they have failed, just  as

the  Member  for Cairnhill said that he  tried  to

learn  how to fly and he failed and now he  is  no

more  interested in flying. The other 70 per  cent

of  the  members do not learn how to  fly  because

they  are not interested in flying. What they  are

interested in is to get drinks in the early  hours

of the morning!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Certainly they do. If some

hon.  Members say no, let me tell them, Sir, that

I  have been there on one or two occasions. I was

introduced by members of that club -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Shame!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> It is not a shame, it is an

experience. If I had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1274</b></font><br><br>



not  been  there, I would not have known that  the

club do supply drinks up to the early hours of the

morning. Sir, I was asked by my friend who  was  a

member that if I wanted to get drinks even in  the

early  hours  of the morning, or if  I  wanted  to

entertain  my friends right up to the early  hours

of the morning, I should join the club. I was told

that  there  is no other bar or club in  Singapore

that  provided this amenity. The only alternative,

if  you want to get a drink in the early hours  of

the  morning, is to join the club. So since 70 per

cent of the members join this club for the purpose

of  drinking only, why not change the name of  the

club  to  the "Royal Singapore Drinking Club",  as

the Member for Tanjong Pagar put it.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> You start

one!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> There is no necessity for me

to  start another one because one already  exists.

So  why should I start another one to compete with

the Royal Singapore Drinking Club?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Communications and Works said yesterday that we have the M.A.T.C. and the

M.A.A.F. which provide flying facilities,  and  if

anyone  is  interested in flying, he  should  join

either one of these organisations rather than join

this  posh  and  very, very exclusive  club.  Many

flying  enthusiasts have refused to volunteer  for

service with these two organisations because  they

are  subject  to  discipline.  To  join  a  Force,

discipline is necessary, but to join the Singapore

Flying  Club it is considered that one must  be  a

personage before one can join. That is the  reason

why  many  people  have refused to  volunteer  for

service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister said that the Club teaches people to fly. If he is thinking of merdeka, then by all

means  let us fly to merdeka rather than  walk  to

merdeka!  I  oppose this grant of $10,000  to  the

Singapore Flying Club and I wonder whether  it  is

in  order for me, Sir, to move to delete this  sum

from the vote?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No notice has been given.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1275</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>10.12 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,

we   do   need  local-born  pilots  and  therefore

training in flying is necessary, but the objection

to  this grant is, I think, because of the conduct

of  the members of this flying club, late drinking

hours and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a pilot is supposed to be a man of sober

habits.  That is true, Sir, because  I  have  been

flying very often and I have asked the pilots, who

refuse  to drink, especially on the day when  they

are on duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have a suggestion to make which will, I

think,  meet  the  objections of  the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar  and the Member for Queenstown - that

whilst approving this grant of $10,000, we make it

a  condition that this flying club should  not  be

misused by those who are not interested in  flying

but  in drinking. This is actually a condition  to

be  made  in their own interests. I think that  is

the only solution.



<br><br>10.13 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, the

Minister   for  Communications  and   Works   said

yesterday,  in  all seriousness, that  it  was  an

intense desire on his part to see a large group of

flyers  which  motivated  his  recommending   this

particular item. Sir, I have discussed this matter

with the Malayan Airways Local Employees Union and

they  tell  me  that  they  saw  the  Minister  in

February last year. They are as concerned as he is

over  the need for pilots, and they then presented

him with a memorandum which set out the figures of

the pilots available - European and local - for flying

civilian airplanes: they also put forward a scheme

to   the   Minister  suggesting  how  the  present

unfortunate  state of affairs could be  corrected.

In this scheme they suggested:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(1) To undertake the training scheme, the

following  training staff and equipment  would  be

required:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) A professional flying instructor on full-time duty to train in the air and organise

lectures  on  theory  for  commercial  pilot

licences, instrument rating syllabi.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) A professional engineering instructor on

full-time duty to give basic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1276</b></font><br><br>



aircraft   engineering   lessons   and    to

organise  training to both Singapore  flying

clubs and commercial operators' workshops.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) One twin-engined aircraft fully equipped

with  instruments,  radio communication  and

navigational  sets  to  enable  twin-engined

instrument rating to be given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Certain equipment for both pilot and

engineer  lectures  most  of  which  can  be

obtained or made in Malaya."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister received this memorandum and he will remember that he had present a man called Mr

Warcup  who did not think very much of the scheme.

The Member for Cairnhill claims that, this being a

democratic   country,  everybody  can   join   the

Singapore  Flying Club, notwithstanding its  royal

prefix.  Let  me remind him how much it  costs  to

qualify,  not  including  the  entrance  fees  and

subscription fees, the cost of keeping the  social

habits  of  the  other members in  the  club.  But

assuming one abjures all these, how much would  it

cost  to get an "A" Licence? Regulations lay  down

that  there must be a minimum of 40 hours'  flying

experience  before one can obtain an "A"  Licence.

The  club's fees are $24 per flying hour. Assuming

that  one graduates in the minimum time (40 hours)

and  does  not meet with a misfortune - as  did  the

Member for Cairnhill who never graduated - it  costs

$960   per   licence   minimum,   without   paying

subscription  fees, entrance fee, without  joining

in  all the drinking orgies. $10,000 on that scale

would  produce ten pilots a year. If this vote  is

passed  and this Government is still in  existence

next year, we will want to know whether there will

be  ten  new  local pilots by next year - not  white

pilots - because  it is local money that  is  paying

for  all  this,  although it is a nominated  white

Minister who is recommending it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a small matter really- $10,000.

After  all, last month we agreed to give away  $23

million.  It seems to be straining at  a  gnat  to

argue  about this $10,000. But it is a  matter  of

principle  that  is  at stake.  [Laughter.]  There

being  all  kinds - it is not a laughing matter.  It

may be a laughing matter for those who do not have

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1277</b></font><br><br>



stand  before  the people, contest  elections  and

answer for what they have done.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Terrible!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Yes, it is. A terrible fate

will  befall  him if he should appear  before  the

people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> He will.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> And then we shall see what

happens. For those who do, let me remind them that

$125,000    to   the   Young   Women's   Christian

Association, $10,000 to the Royal Singapore Flying

Club - clubs  frequented  by magistrates  who  bring

dubious  women  there in the early  hours  of  the

morning,  whose pictures are subsequently produced

in  court  as exhibits, will all not be forgotten.

The Member for Cairnhill was then touring China, I

believe. But these are facts. These are the habits

of  these  people. $10,000 to aid  and  abet  this

nefarious conduct is a disgrace.



<br><br>10.17 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> This has raised quite an undue

amount  of  excitement  in  the  Opposition,   Mr

Chairman.  I  had  really prepared  myself  to  be

attacked  on the grounds that the grant  has  been

inadequate,  and I was rather taken aback  when  I

heard these allegations of subsidising drinking. I

think  I  had  better  go  quietly  and  seriously

through  a few of the facts and perhaps afterwards

if  there is time and the House will bear with me,

I  will deal with a few of the fantasies which are

floating  around in the rather ill-informed  minds

of the Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I had better start by pointing out that

the  $10,000 grant proposal is, of course,  linked

with  another item which stands next to it in  the

paper  before  us, i.e., for the purchase  of  the

flying club's properties, and these two items  are

linked  together with the object of  enabling  the

Club to pay off its debts and to equip itself with

new aircraft.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, I might mention that we have

been  seeking from the Government of  India  under

the Colombo



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1278</b></font><br><br>



Plan the provision of an H.T.2 trainer made by the

Hindustan Aircraft Company and although  I  cannot

say  that  we  have got it yet, I am very  hopeful

that  we  shall get it; and it would be  very  odd

indeed  if  the  Government  of  India  was   more

generous  to  our local flying club  than  is  the

Member   for   Tanjong   Pagar,   supported   with

enthusiasm by the Member for Queenstown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I had better deal with one point which

was   raised  by  the  Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar

yesterday,  and  that is, the calculation  of  the

grant  to  the  Club.  I have here  the  estimated

budget for the Flying Club for 1957 on which  this

grant  is  finally based, after the  Treasury  had

very  rigorously and closely examined the finances

of the Club, not only now but throughout the whole

of its post-war history. Under "Direct maintenance

costs - licensed  engineer, labour force,  Provident

Fund,  insurance, electricity and  so  on - $63,580:

Radio     maintenance - $4,800:    Direct     flying

costs - $23,232",  giving a grand total  of  $91,612

expenditure anticipated during 1957. Against  that

you  have estimated income from private owners  of

$4,000 for hangar space: let to other requirements

$5,000:  profit  on  the club-house  $5,000:  paid

trips in commercial flying $12,000: club flying at

about  140  to  150 hours per month, estimated  at

$50,400.  You  will see. Sir, that  that  gives  a

total  of  $76,400  and  an  expected  deficit  of

$15,212.  The  proposed grant will not,  in  fact,

meet  the estimated deficit, but we hope that with

the  provision of new and better aircraft the Club

will  be  able  to increase the number  of  people

using  its  planes, using its capacity  much  more

fully, and that in fact the income figures will be

higher.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since a great point has been made by Members of

how one has heard of people drinking very late and

not of oneself drinking very late, I think I might

point  out  that  $5,000 profit on the  club-house

amounts to about 6½ per cent of the gross income

expected  in  1957,  and I should  think  this  is

probably one of the smallest club-house profits of

any  club in Singapore. The suggestion, Sir,  that

this is a drinking club and not a flying



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1279</b></font><br><br>



club   is  most  rigorously  refuted  by  the  Club

Secretary who is himself a local-born Eurasian  and

comes  from  a  very fine old Singapore  family  as

well. He says that 75 per cent of the members  come

to the club purely for flying.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> 30 per cent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> And I regret that the hon. Member

used  his privileged position in this House to make

absolutely  slanderous allegations  against  people

who are unable to answer for themselves here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Have it out in a public forum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Sir, a public forum is an essential

part  of democracy and, of course, it must be  open

to  abuse  by  those who wish to  abuse  it  either

through ill-will or through ignorance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us turn to another aspect - this was not

mentioned  yesterday - but if hon. Members will  turn

to their Estimates they will find on page 292 under

the     Head     "Civil    Aviation",     Singapore

Headquarters - Other Charges Annually  Recurrent - sub-head  5, the figure of $2,500 in respect of renewal

of  instruments ratings and flying  for  radio  and

testing;  and further under "Singapore Airport"  at

page  296,  under  O.C.A.R. again,  the  figure  of

$1,500  for  "Aircraft Charter  for  Inspection  of

Runway  and Approach Lighting", giving you a  total

of  $4,000  allocated for chartering  aircraft  in

order  to  calibrate radar and instruments  and  to

make  inspections  of lighting  and  that  kind  of

thing.  When  we  get further equipment  coming  in

shortly,  there  will be a need  to  fly  over  and

around  the  beacon on St. John's Island  and  that

kind of thing in order that they can be tested  not

merely  by  commercial  aircraft  flying  on  their

correct   routes,  but  on  the  possibility   that

somebody would fly off the correct routes,  and  to

make sure that the coverage is overall.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This figure of $4,000 required for aircraft

charter  is based on the assumption that the  Royal

Singapore   Flying  Club  will  be  available   for

chartering its planes at a cost of $50  to  $60  an

hour.  If the Club is denied this grant and has  to

close down, as it would, then it will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>



necessary  to  charter planes from  the  commercial

airlines. The cost would be between seven  and  ten

times as great, depending on what type of plane you

are  able to get and the time at which you want it;

and  consequently, instead of a figure  of  $4,000,

you  will  get  a  figure of  between  $30,000  and

$40,000, at least $20,000 more on the public budget

than  is available and is charged on the budget  by

this  grant. So that quite apart from the  question

whether  the bar is a popular part of the  Club,  I

hope that the charter services will be popular with

this  Assembly and will not force us to  come  back

for  an  A.S.V. for another $25,000 or  $30,000  in

order to charter aircraft to maintain the safety of

the  airport. If hon. Members would scrutinise  the

Estimates  with more care and ask useful questions,

they would learn these things and would not have to

be  taught them when they misrepresented the  facts

to  the public and show that they do not, in  fact,

know what is going on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for the club's estimated budget and the

fact  that we are not meeting its deficit.  Let  me

turn  to  the  information we sought  about  flying

clubs  in  other  countries. There  are  subsidised

flying   club   systems  in  a  number   of   Asian

countries - in  Pakistan, Indonesia and India - and  we

have particularly attended to the very full details

which  we  were given by courtesy of the  Director-General  of Civil Aviation in New Delhi.  In  India

clubs  are placed in four classes- I, II,  III  and

IV.  A Class I club is one which is expected to fly

3,500  hours in the course of a year;  a  Class  II

club 2,500 hours: a Class III club 1,500 hours, and

a  Class IV club 1,000 hours. A Class I club has  a

direct subsidy grant of 100,000 rupees; for a Class

II  club  75,000  rupees; a Class III  club  60,000

rupees;  a  Class  IV 40,000 rupees.  In  addition,

Class   I   and   II  clubs  get  40   rupees   per

instructional  hour grant related directly  to  the

actual  instruction given; Class III and  IV  clubs

get 50 rupees per instructional hour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, in India clubs get free hangars, one-third of their aeroplanes free, free landing, free

V.H.F. radio equipment, both air and ground, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1281</b></font><br><br>



they  also  have generous free scholarship  flying

schemes. Sir, if we compare all that with what  we

are proposing for the Royal Singapore Flying Club,

we  will find that the estimate of $50,000 revenue

from flying is based on the expectation of 140  to

150  flying  hours  per month, or  somewhere  over

1,500  to 1,900 flying hours per year, which  puts

them  in  the  Class III category  of  the  Indian

scale.  Therefore, if it were an  Indian  club  it

would  be  eligible for a grant of  about  $40,000

(converted  from  rupees)  plus  about   $30   per

instructional  hour, and of course it  would  also

get   all   the  other  free  hangars  and   other

facilities which I have just mentioned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> They are teaching Indians how

to fly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> The hon. Member is obsessed with

what  he calls the white races. He is not prepared

to accept anybody who has not got certain pigments

in his skin, either as a fellow being or a friend.

I  will  refer  again to the Flying Club's  racial

construction at a later stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have some very spirited remarks about the

M.A.A.F. and  the M.A.T.C. The  M.A.A.F. is,  of

course, providing training for Service pilots  and

the  hon. Member has, I think, supported it in the

Estimates,  and the Service pilots are  of  course

those  who, if they wished, would be able to  drop

bombs  on  people. The idea that the  owner  of  a

private pilot licence, who has been taught to  fly

in  a Chipmunk in Paya Lebar is going to leap into

his Chipmunk and fly off to drop bombs on Egypt is

so    fantastic   that   it   does   not   deserve

consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The Member for Cairnhill said

one of them fought with Japan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> They might fight in defence of this

country  and  they would, like the pre-war  pilots

who   included  local  men,  as  the  Member   for

Cairnhill pointed out, be able to defend their own

country.  This is perhaps the objective which  the

hon. Member does not support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The M.A.T.C. does not itself provide flying, but

it  does get from the Royal Singapore Flying  Club

facilities for what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1282</b></font><br><br>



it  calls "familiarisation flights" in order that the

M.A.T.C. members may be able get off into the  air

and  have  an idea of what flying conditions  are.

This  is  one  of  the services  which  the  Royal

Singapore Flying Club provides for those uniformed

and disciplined sections of the aviation world  in

Singapore.   It  also  provides  a   free   junior

membership service for students from the  M.A.T.C.

The M.A.T.C. will, of course, be deprived of these

services  if the hon. Member succeeds in  stopping

this grant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now turn to the distressing complaints

about the white man put forward by the Member  for

Tanjong Pagar. I myself am a white man and  he  is

unable  to forgive me for that unhappy element  in

my  background in spite of the fact  that  I  have

spent  more  than half my life here, that  I  have

been  domiciled in this country and that I have  a

Malayan wife, and that I am heart and soul and for

much longer than himself a worker on the political

scene  on  behalf of the labour movement  of  this

country.  But leaving that aside, I may point  out

what  I  said  yesterday and what he  conveniently

ignored, that the Royal Singapore Flying  Club  is

progressively malayanising itself, and that of the

student pilots under instruction - he did not listen

to  this yesterday and now laughs at it - more  than

40  per  cent  are  in  fact now  Asian.  He  also

asserted,   and  it  is  quoted   again   in   the

newspapers - I  think  twice  over  in  the  English

papers  (this is the Singapore Standard, which  is

all  I  have  with me here)- "so far not  a  single

qualified pilot from Malaya has been offered a job

in  any  of the airlines. This alone is sufficient

to  indicate the nature of the times."  I  am  not

sure  whether  the Straits Times did  not  publish

this  inaccuracy. In any case,  the  fact  of  the

matter  is that four of the Malayan Airways pilots

were  trained in the Royal Singapore Flying  Club.

The  hon.  Member will have an opportunity,  I  am

sure,  Mr  Chairman, Sir, of rising to  apologise

for  this wilful misrepresentation of the  facts - I

must not use the word "lie". I do not suppose that

he  would  rise to apologise because it  would  be

confessing that he had been wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the membership of the Flying

Club, I happen to have here the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1283</b></font><br><br>



figures  year  by year, the names and  details  of

those  who  were  taking student pilot  and  other

licences. As I look down the first page  alone,  I

see Chinese, British, Australian, Chinese, Indian,

Chinese,   Indian,  Canadian,  British,   Chinese,

British,  Filipino,  American, Eurasian,  British,

Indian,   Malay,   Eurasian,   Chinese,   British,

Chinese,  British.  Further on  I  find  Arab  and

Ceylonese  and others. This is the answer  to  the

allegation that this is a white man's club seeking

to  drain  the lifeblood of the people  and  spend

money on drinking. It is a club in which there  is

a   happy  all-races  membership  happily  working

together  as fellow club members. His  attempt  to

make racial bars where they do not exist seems  to

be  abominably mischievous in the circumstances of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we are on this question of drink, I might

mention once again this further point, that if you

have  a lot of people drinking in the club and  if

their profits are used for subsidising flying,  it

has  pretty much the same effect as when we put  a

tax  on drinks and cigarettes in order to increase

the   revenue  of  the  colony.  When  people  are

drinking,  they  are  actually  assisting  in  the

flying  needs  of the club, but the  club  is  not

necessarily disqualified for a grant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar referred to the

Malayan Airways Local Employees Union's memorandum

about  the  training scheme. He did not quote  the

cost which would be incurred if you were going  to

employ   full-time  instructors  in   flying   and

engineering  and  a full-time aircraft  and  other

costs. We did not go into that in great detail. We

have  looked  at  the scheme and it  was  obvious,

however, that a grant of $10,000 would by no means

be   enough  to  pay  for  a  full-time  qualified

instructor  and  to  provide  an  aircraft  to  be

available  for  training. We have, in  fact,  been

working and are still working on schemes which,  I

hope,  will  in  due  course produce  considerable

expansion  of training facilities. It may  not  be

wise  or  necessary  to  set  up  a  costly  local

organisation if we can get the training facilities

we need in friendly neighbouring countries such as

India.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, I have taken rather longer over this than I would have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1284</b></font><br><br>



wished,  because I felt that it was  a  matter  of

some  importance  to deal with these  ill-informed

statements made by the hon. Members. Perhaps I can

conclude by making the three points which  I  have

already  made. I will summarise them.  First,  the

Flying   Club   does  provide  specific   training

facilities which have been used and which we  hope

will  be used more extensively in the future,  and

that  is  a very valuable factor. Second, it  also

provides charter facilities which do bring genuine

revenue into the Civil Aviation Department and  do

help  to  reduce  the  taxes quite  significantly.

Thirdly,  it  does  provide  a  stimulus  to  air-mindedness  which is of very great  importance  in

this  mid-20th  century time  when  all  technical

training  is  of  the  greatest  importance,   and

technical  training depends partly on interest  in

technique.  If  I  may,  I  will  just  read,  Mr

Chairman,  from the opening paragraph of  the  New

Delhi notes to which I referred just now:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The flying club movement in India has been in

existence  for  a  very long time.  In  fact,  the

development  of  civil  aviation  in   India   has

proceeded  side  by side with the  growth  of  the

flying clubs. The very first flying club in  India

dated  back to 1928. More flying clubs have  grown

up  since. The total number now active is  twelve.

They  are  centred in various big cities all  over

India. They provide flying facilities for students

from  various universities and also cater for  the

needs  of the general public in respect of  sports

and  hobby  flying. They have all along helped  to

promote  air-mindedness and have  created,  so  to

say, a pool of people interested in flying out  of

which  have  emerged young men who  have  selected

flying  for  a  profession. Being fully  aware  of

this,  the Government of India have accepted  that

the   flying   clubs  must  be  given  substantial

financial aid. The operation of aircraft  being  a

costly  affair, the flying clubs are not on  their

own  able to meet the expenditure involved in  the

running of the clubs."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the policy of our great neighbour and

friend, India, and I must say that I think it is a

very much more realistic and competent policy than

the  policies  enunciated by the  Members  of  the

Opposition  who  have objected  to  this  proposed

grant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $56,700 for Head 55 stand part

of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, what a

shame  that,  apart from asking us to approve  the

grant  of  $10,000  to the Royal Singapore  Flying

Club, we are now asked to provide $56,700 for  the

purchase  of  a building for this club.  A  fierce

attack has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1286</b></font><br><br>



launched  against  the grant  of  $10,000  to  the

Flying  Club  and  if  we approve  this  grant  of

$56,700 to purchase a building for the club, I  am

afraid in the future they will come back to us and

ask if we can provide equipment for their bar.  It

is  a  real shame. The last paragraph of this item

at page 5 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Club was in receipt of a subsidy from

Government  from its inception in 1928  until  the

war. In 1938, the subsidy amounted to $30,000  per

annum."



<br><br>Sir, between 1928 and up to the period before  the

war,   there   were  no  elected  Councillors   or

Assemblymen  at  all.  This  is  now  a  different

Government with elected Ministers, and  I  do  not

think  we  should  follow  the  footsteps  of  the

previous  Legislative Council where  most  of  the

Members  were nominated. Let us try to save  money

rather  than throw away money. The last  paragraph

says  that  "in  1938, the subsidy amounted  to $30,000  per annum." What I am afraid will  happen,

Sir, is that when next year's Budget comes up  for

consideration,  we  might  be  asked  to   provide

another grant of $50,000 or $100,000 or even more.

Then where will we end again, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Maybe you will not be here!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I do not think this is right,

Sir,  because once you give a grant you will  have

to stick to it; and now we are asked to purchase a

building   for   this   club.   There   are   more

applications  that  will  be  coming  in  for  the

purchase of buildings or for assistance, and I  do

hope  that  the  Chief Minister or his  Government

will  look carefully into them, because I am fully

aware  that there is already an application asking

for  some  grant and I would like to see  how  the

Government treat that application.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister (Mr Lim Yew Hock):Mr

Chairman, Sir, it would seem that the hon.  Member

has  not learnt any lesson at all from the  debate

on  the  grant  of $10,000 to the Royal  Singapore

Flying Club.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I was never convinced.



<br><br>10.46 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, on the arguments advanced

by the Minister for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1287</b></font><br><br>



Communications and Works, we would at some  future

date  be  asked to support the principle that  the

Minister for Health's Singapore Gun Club should be

granted  a  subsidy. And if this  club  gets  into

difficulties   because  the  Minister's   drinking

companions have not been frequenting the  bar,  we

would  be asked to take over the building  of  the

Singapore Gun Club, on the grounds that it  trains

marksmanship  and we want more rifle  shooters  in

this colony. Sir, we could argue on that basis  ad

infinitum. It is quite a different thing  to  come

to  this  Assembly  to cite India  to  prove  that

because  the  Indian Government has a flying  club

scheme, and since our Royal Singapore Flying  Club

is  analogous to the Indian flying club  movement,

therefore we ought to support it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was talking to an expatriate yesterday

and he told me that there was only one other place

in  the  world, to his knowledge, where one  could

enjoy  pleasure flying more cheaply, and that  was

Egypt. But when Colonel Nasser came in, he  put  a

stop to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also told, Sir, that although the number of

pupils  seeking instruction is 40 per  cent  local

people  as  against 60 per cent  expatriates,  the

number of people who make use of flying facilities

does not correspond to that ratio at all. The bulk

of  the expenditure is incurred in the maintenance

of  the  aircraft, and that is a facility  enjoyed

almost altogether by the expatriates. Let us  face

facts.  These  expatriates are not  Malayans,  and

never  will be, although they often write  in  the

newspapers, "We Malayans so and so...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the actual sum involved- $56,700 - we would

like  to  know what is the market value  of  these

buildings, what was the cost originally,  and  how

much has been allowed for depreciation.



<br><br>10.48 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, it is now clear

whom the hon. Member regards as a better model - Mr

Nehru  or Colonel Nasser. It is now clear that  he

regards Colonel Nasser as the finer person of  the

two.  I  must say that I personally prefer  Pandit

Nehru.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1288</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asks a specific question which I think we

ought  to try to answer, and that is the valuation

of  the  club. The buildings, I think,  cannot  be

easily  valued  precisely because  they  were,  in

fact, built very largely by the labour of the club

members themselves and with the loyal co-operation

of  the bar-boys who worked side by side with  the

members  in carrying the bricks and spreading  the

concrete and that kind of thing. There is a spirit

of  comradeship in that club which  is  singularly

lacking in the Member for Tanjong Pagar. But I  am

advised  that  the cost of the transfer  from  the

Kallang  club-house which they had to give  up  to

the reconstructed club-house at Paya Lebar was  in

the  nature of $72,000. That is the only figure  I

have  got. It would probably vary considerably  if

we  went into the detailed costing of it all,  but

that  is a recognisable figure to take. The  gross

valuation  for  the club-house was $39,000  but  a

certain  amount had to be deducted from that,  and

that  is  the cost of making certain repairs.  The

value  of the hangar was $33,600. Again deductions

were  made  for the cost of replacing one  of  the

walls  and  various other minor improvements  were

effected   if  it  were  to  become  a  government

building.  The figures are, I think, adequate  for

the Member's needs.



<br><br>10.50 a.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I think the

Government side have an obsession that,  with  the

help  of the Nominated Members' votes and the  ex-officios'   votes,  they  will   carry   anything

through.  They  will not admit any mistakes.  This

side  of  the  House has already pointed  out  the

defects  of the Royal Singapore Flying Club-house,

but  the Minister for Communications and Works has

neither assured us nor touched upon the subject of

drinking  at  late  hours at the  club.  I  cannot

understand the logic of just putting everything to

the vote and carrying it through because they want

it to be so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I should say that

I  have  dealt  repeatedly with  the  question  of

drinking at the clubhouse. I pointed out that  the

profits  to  be expected were $5,000 or  6½  per

cent of the total estimated revenue



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1289</b></font><br><br>



for  1957.  That  was one mention which  the  hon.

Member  failed  to  notice.  I  referred  to   the

drinking  habits of the Member for  Tanjong  Pagar

and  the  Member for Queenstown who  made  remarks

about  it. I indicated that if, in fact,  some  of

the  members  did  help to  support  the  club  by

lifting  their elbows, well that, of  course,  was

common practice in almost every club in Singapore.

It  is,  in fact, the practice of Singapore  as  a

whole to derive revenue from taxes on liquors  and

cigarettes and similar consumption in order to pay

for  necessities. The fact that the club does what

the Government does is not a very bad thing to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I might take this opportunity of saying

this,  Mr  Chairman, Sir. We have, I think,  very

fully  argued  the  reasons  why  this  grant   to

purchase  buildings  is  necessary.  If  the  hon.

Member is not convinced, then he will no doubt  be

fully convinced if we can stop the grant. He  will

no  doubt  fully  support my  application  in  due

course for a very large A.S.V. to meet the cost of

chartering  aeroplanes and that alone might  serve

to  convince  him  that he ought to  support  this

purchase and this grant. I hope that if this House

has again to consider possibly increased subsidies

rather nearer to the Indian rates, Members will by

that  time study the facts more carefully and will

be ready to give favourable consideration. This is

the  minimum subsidy which can possibly  keep  the

club  going as a useful part of the civil aviation

structure in Singapore. It is possible that it may

be  too  low  and that we ought to  have  made  it

bigger.  That will take, of course, experience  to

find out.



<br><br>10.53 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Since the Minister is so

anxious  to give the impression that this club  is

intended  for  a  serious  purpose,  we  ought  to

acquaint  ourselves with the facts. The memorandum

that  was  presented to him in February last  year

pointed  out the acute shortage of Malayan pilots.

If  we  intend  to run our internal  airlines,  we

should have a big scheme, not this feeble idea  of

supporting  a  flying  club  meant  primarily  for

recreational purposes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the pilot position in civil airlines is as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malayan Airways - 39 expatriates; 12 Asians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federation Air Service - 3 expatriates; 1 Asian.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabba Airways Limited (Borneo) 5 expatriates;

no Asian.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International operators are left out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total comes to: 47 expatriates and 13

Asians.  There  is  no  Asian  who  is  flying  an

aircraft as a captain. No local aeroplane can  fly

over  Malaya without a white man on board. Let  us

face  facts. We are fighting colonialism  and  the

white man stands for colonialism. So we fight him.

When  we  settle that fight, we will settle  other

fights amongst ourselves. But first we settle  who

is  to  be  master  in  this country.  I  make  no

apologies  for being anti-colonialist.  I  do  not

quibble  and  say, "Oh, I am against the  colonial

system,  but  I am really a friend of the  British

and  I  love the British." I do not. I am  against

colonialism  and as long as the British  represent

colonialism   in  this  country,  I  fight   them,

unrelentingly, as they fight me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It offends my sense of propriety to have every

local  aeroplane piloted by a European. I  support

the  union when the union said, "If you are really

serious about training pilots, then have a serious

scheme."  I  have  already  pointed  out  to   the

Minister that $10,000 could, if used for no  other

purpose  than just pay for the training of pilots,

produce ten pilots a year with an "A" Licence.  He

said  he had not costed the scheme which the union

put forward to him, but it was something much more

than  $10,000.  And  so it would  be.  If  we  are

serious  about  it and not just  toying  with  the

idea,  let us set about it in a serious  way.  The

union  put forward these suggestions - I am  reading

from their memorandum:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Providing for reasonable expansion of aviation

and for the replacement of expatriates, there is a

requirement  of some 60 pilots for the  next  five

years   (60   fully  qualified  pilots)   to   fly

commercial aeroplanes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making allowance for trainee wastage, it would

be necessary to have an intake of 20



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>



pilots  each  year to begin with, which  could  be

decreased   or   increased   in   the   light   of

experience."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now told that we are going to give

$57,000  to  take  over some buildings.  From  the

description of the way in which the buildings were

put  up,  they must be very unsound,  if  bar-boys

were used to carry bricks and stick them up with a

bit of mortar! No wonder nobody is able to give  a

correct  estimate of the value of these buildings!

But  we  are asked to subscribe the sum of $56,700

for  these  buildings. We have not been told  what

they  really are worth. The Minister says he  does

not  know what they are worth. Obviously  it  does

not  matter. All he wants to do is to get the club

out of a jam.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are these buildings going to be used for?

Are  they  really necessary? Is $56,700 worth  the

price  we are paying for what we want to make  use

of these buildings for? We come back to this basic

objection.  We  are  not here  to  give  financial

support to European recreational activity in  this

country.  We object to it even more when they  try

to  camouflage  it behind some beneficial  results

for the local population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indian flying clubs, Sir, are teetotal. That

perhaps is the reason why my friend the Member for

Telok   Ayer  kept  on  insisting  about  drinking

habits. They have a serious purpose. They may have

grown  out  of the old colonial flying clubs  they

had  in India when Europeans amused themselves  by

flying.  But  the  Indian  flying  clubs  are  now

engaged in the serious pursuit of trying to  build

up  as  large  a  field of  men  who  can  fly  as

possible.  But the flying clubs are not the  basis

of  India's Air Force, or India's growing force of

flyers.  They  have  properly  organised  training

courses. And further - there is no need to laugh  at

this - even  Ceylon  has  an Air  Academy  to  train

people  how to fly, in a serious way, and  not  to

throw away public funds on a European - whatever  is

the  colour  of  the flying club  secretary - flying

club  in which we are sinking $57,000 and to which

we  are  giving  a grant of $10,000  a  year.  The

Singapore Flying Club might as well make up  their

minds now how to find their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1292</b></font><br><br>



money  next  year, because if there is  to  be  an

election  this  coming August,  whatever  happens,

whoever  wins  the  election  will  not  be  in  a

position to vote another $10,000 next year.



<br><br>10.58 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I am afraid, Mr Chairman, Sir, we

must  pursue  this subject more.  A  most  helpful

contribution from the Member for Tanjong Pagar was

that we should give a further grant of $10,000  to

the  Flying  Club so that they could take  on  ten

Malayans, give them 40 hours' training each  at  a

cost  of $960 each and they would then be able  to

go  ahead  and produce ten more pilots  among  the

wastage  of  people not getting  through  and  who

should get through somehow. Sir, I will give  very

serious consideration to that possibility and I do

welcome  the  fact  that he  recognises  that  the

Flying  Club could perform a most valuable service

if  we cannot get the service performed elsewhere.

I  cannot go into the scheme since we are  working

on  it  at  the  moment because it involves  other

governments and it must be brought to a final form

before  I can make statements about it. There  is,

of  course, always the possibility that it may not

come  to a successful final form, and in that case

it  is  certainly very reassuring to know that  we

can  count  on the support of the People's  Action

Party   for  at  least  another  $10,000  to   pay

specifically for ten pilots to be trained  by  the

Flying  Club,  and  I  do  welcome  this  generous

gesture  on  his part which I think  is  the  most

fruitful contribution made to the debate so far.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that I did not give any figures of the

cost  of the buildings. I would remind him that  I

gave him the cost of the transfer - $72,000 - and  the

estimated valuation was $39,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He further complained that he did not know what

use  was  going to be made of the buildings  which

are going to be used by the Royal Singapore Flying

Club.  In  the  event  the Singapore  Flying  Club

ceased to exist, the buildings would be taken over

for government use. There are a number of uses  to

which  they could be put in the Paya Lebar Airport

for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1293</b></font><br><br>



which space would be required ultimately and could

be  used right now. We have restricted building at

the  airport as far as we possibly could and there

will probably be further buildings required. These

buildings would fit in very well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any further Opposition Members are going to

make  speeches, I hope they will take into account

the facts that have been stated and not get up and

say  we have not said what we have, in fact,  said

very clearly and in great detail.

<br><br>11.05 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I have to move the motion  standing

in my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly in accordance with subsection

(1)  of  section  25 of the Singapore  Improvement

Ordinance (Cap. 259) approves of the borrowing  by

the   Singapore   Improvement   Trust   from   the

Government  of  the  sum  of  $44,737,000  at   an

interest  rate  of 5¼per cent per annum  repayable

over  a period of 60 years, the repayments  to  be

made  by  half  yearly instalments  based  on  the

annuity  method  and together with  repayments  of

previous  loans to be secured by a legal  mortgage

of  all the immovable properties belonging to  and

to  which  the Trust holds legal title and  by  an

equitable  charge of all the immovable  properties

belonging   to  and  to  which  the  Trust   holds

equitable  title for the purposes of enabling  the

Trust  to  meet the cost of constructing buildings

required  for  carrying out the  purposes  of  the

Singapore Improvement Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this application is to meet the cost of

what  is known as the Singapore Improvement  Trust

Building  Programme No. 8. This programme consists

of  5,582 housing units and 235 shops. The loan is

a  very  large  one and it is therefore  incumbent

upon me to explain to this Assembly the policy  on

which  this  programme is based and to outline  in

some  detail the building schemes of which  it  is

composed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1295</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion, Sir, is a very clear indication of

this  Government's firm intention to  continue  to

give  high  priority  to the provision  of  public

housing  in  order to keep pace with  the  rapidly

increasing population and also to rehouse the many

thousands  of  people who are now living  in  slum

areas. The Government will endeavour to fulfil the

great demands of the lower income groups for  good

housing accommodation at rents within the capacity

of these groups to pay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Land Clearance and Resettlement Plan

makes fair and adequate provision for compensation

and rehousing of people living in temporary houses

required for public development. This should  make

it  possible,  Sir,  to  clear  sites  for  public

housing   more  quickly  and  enable  the  housing

programme   of   permanent   dwellings    to    be

accelerated. Present plans, Sir, provide a rate of

construction of up to about 5,500 housing units  a

year  by 1960. As hon. Members are aware, the slum

areas  in  this  city  present  serious  problems,

demanding  a solution which will be acceptable  to

300,000 people living in these areas. The  key  to

the  problem is the re-development of these  areas

and   it   is  the  intention  to  set   aside   a

considerable  proportion  of  current  and  future

housing  programmes for the rehousing  of  persons

displaced from such slum areas. Thus, Sir, a large

proportion  of Programme No. 8 will be devoted  to

the   rehousing  of  families  of  this  category;

approximately  1,400  housing  units   are   being

reserved  for this purpose. The remainder  of  the

housing  units, amounting to 4,215 units, will  be

used  mainly  for  accommodating families  of  the

lower  income  group who are now  on  the  Housing

Register,  but some of these houses will  also  be

required to rehouse families from sites which will

have to be cleared for public development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, Sir, now to give you the breakdown

figures  of  Programme No. 8. 2,923 housing  units

and  92  shops  are being constructed  at  Kallang

Airport.  339  housing units and 59 shops  in  the

Short Street/Rochore Road/Albert Street area.  128

housing units and 14



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1296</b></font><br><br>



shops  in  Upper  Hokkien Street, Upper  Pickering

Street  and  South Bridge Road area. 192  housing

units  and 6 shops at the old filter beds at Bukit

Timah.  200 housing units at Bukit Panjang.  1,800

housing  units and 64 shops at St. Michael's  Road

radio station area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from this, improvement to Trust

houses is also being made at Balestier Estate. Two

markets  are being provided - one at Kallang Airport

and the other one at St. Michael's Road. The costs

of  these  two projects, Sir, are not included  in

the housing programme as they are recoverable from

the City Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The housing units provided are flats and houses

built  to  permanent low-cost standards  providing

accommodation  which  is suitable  for  the  lower

income  groups. Considerable economies  have  been

made  in  accommodation standards and construction

standards   have  been  reduced  to  the   minimum

compatible  with  safety. The majority  of  flats,

Sir,  have  either  two or three  rooms.  A  small

proportion of 4-roomed flats are being provided as

well  as  self-contained tenements. All will  have

their own kitchens, bathrooms and W.Cs. Lifts will

be   provided  for  all  multi-storey   buildings.

Shopping and marketing centres will have  a  place

in each estate at convenient locations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also proposed, Sir, to provide a specially

designed  workshop with a small number of workshop

buildings  to re-house the shophouse factory  type

of  businesses which will require to be  displaced

on   slum   clearance   areas   and   which   will

appropriately be included in the housing estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members will note, Sir, that  the  rate  of

interest  proposed for this loan is 5¼ per  cent

per  annum.  This approximates to the  present-day

market  rate and is in accordance with the  policy

of the Government as set out in the White Paper on

housing subsidies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one question which I know

everybody  will be asking, and that  is,  at  what

rents will these houses be let? Sir, I am not in a

position today to give full details of the rentals

which  it  is  proposed to charge. These  will  be

presented to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1297</b></font><br><br>



the  House when the motion for the approval of the

subsidy which will be necessary is introduced. But

I  can say now, Sir, that the aim of Government is

to  build standard 2-roomed flats which can be let

at  a  standard inclusive rent of $30 per  mensem.

There   are   families  both  on   the   Singapore

Improvement Trust housing register and in the slum

areas  which  will  have to be  cleared  who  will

require  and  who can afford to pay  for  somewhat

more  spacious accommodation. The needs  of  these

families, Sir, will be met by the construction  of

3-roomed  flats  for  which  the  rent   will   be

somewhere in the region of $40 per mensum. But the

subsidy  which the Government has in mind will  be

weighted in favour of the standard 2-roomed flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, Sir, the House will be given the

opportunity of going into the question  of  rental

policy in greater detail at a subsequent sitting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have given sufficient details of

the  programme which is to be carried out from the

loan for which I seek this Assembly's approval.  I

repeat  again, Sir, that it is the firm  intention

of   this  Government  to  devote  itself  to  the

solution  of the housing problem with a  sense  of

urgency and to press on with determination towards

the  ultimate  goal of healthy and decent  housing

for  all  the people of Singapore. Sir, I  beg  to

move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Sir, I second the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>11.14 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I presume

that  the  introduction  of  this  motion  is   in

conjunction  with the White Paper on  the  housing

subsidy policy tabled yesterday, and it is  rather

surprising that this policy and the motion  itself

are  tabled after my question for oral  answer  in

the  Assembly yesterday, No. 7 in the Order Paper.

At  long  last  the Government has  fulfilled  its

election pledge and the Minister has redeemed  his

promise  in  introducing this housing  policy  and

motion. Had it not been for my question yesterday,

this policy and the motion would have remained  in

the pigeon holes of the Fullerton Building



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1298</b></font><br><br>



for  years and years to come and no one will  ever

dream of having any housing subsidy at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Wonderful!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> It is wonderful - how long it

took! However, the motion in itself does not  give

any  indication  as  to  a reduction  in  rentals.

According  to  the subsidy policy, Sir,  the  only

benefit  that  existing tenants will  get  is  the

waiver  of  the service, lighting and  conservancy

charges.  Apart from that, there is no benefit  at

all.  Where is the reduction in rentals? I  cannot

see  it at all. According to a Press report in the

Singapore  Standard a few days  ago,  Sir,  it  is

stated  that  the  Government  intends  to  reduce

rentals below $60 but those above $60 will not  be

benefited.  I do not know where is the  source  of

this report.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> The usual source.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> According to this report,

there  is  discrimination, as the  subsidy  (after

this  loan  is  granted) will be for 2-room  flats

only. Houses with three or four rooms will not  be

subsidised  by Government. I wonder  whether  this

report  is  correct. If it is, I  cannot  see  why

there  should be discrimination between  a  2-room

flat and a 3-room flat. If it is the contention of

that  report in the Singapore Standard and of  the

Minister  himself that those who  live  in  houses

with  three or four rooms are rich people, then  I

think  their contention is entirely wrong.  It  is

nonsense.  People are not happy to live in  S.I.T.

houses.  They  are forced to because  they  cannot

find  accommodation elsewhere. They are forced  to

pay whatever rentals are charged. The only benefit

they  derive from living in S.I.T. houses is  that

they  do not have to pay "tea money". If they were

to try and get a private dwelling, they would have

to  pay some form of "tea money". In the case  of

the  S.I.T. houses, the high rentals charged could

be  said  to be some form of "tea money", but  the

public  have  no alternative but to  accept  their

terms.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1299</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was told by the Minister, when moving this

motion, that the new houses to be built out of the

loan  money  will be subsidised by the  Government

and  the  rentals charged for them will be  tabled

before  this Assembly after they have been  worked

over.  The Minister has not been able to  give  an

indication as to the rentals to be charged, but he

says  it  may be around $30 to $40. What  I  feel,

Sir,  is  that  the rentals will be based  on  the

working  of  the initial capital plus  maintenance

plus  interest  and any other charges,  especially

the   administrative  charges  incurred   by   the

expatriate officers in the S.I.T. They  have  very

fat salaries and that adds to the high cost of the

rentals.  Why  then, Sir, in  this  motion  it  is

stated the loan will be repayable over a period of

60  years.  Why  not increase the  loan  repayment

period  further? In this way, the rentals  charged

will  be  less. The reason is that if you work  on

the basis of the initial capital plus interest and

maintenance  charges and the fat salaries  of  the

expatriate officers and stretch all that out  over

a  period of, say, 80 years, instead of 60  years,

the   rentals  will  be  cheaper.  The   Financial

Secretary  or the Minister himself may  come  back

with  the  argument that the rentals charged  will

not  be  based  exactly  on  the  factors  I  have

enumerated.  Although the actual  figure  will  be

based  on  this, the difference will be subsidised

by Government. If this is true, Sir, then I should

say that it is going to be a very heavy burden for

the Government to bear. If, worked on the basis of

a  60-year period, the rental comes to $60, and if

the  Government  feels  that  an  economic  rental

should  be $30, then the Government will  have  to

bear  the extra $30 in the form of a subsidy.  But

if that figure is spread over 80 years, the actual

cost  may  come to only about $45,  and  then  the

Government  need only to subsidise  $15  stretched

over a longer period. The actual gross figure will

be  recovered. There is no difference at all.  The

difference is that repayment will be over 80 years

instead of 60 years. If the Government intends  to

limit  it  to 60 years, then the subsidy  will  be

higher,  and when the Budget comes up before  this

Assembly, it will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1300</b></font><br><br>



again  show  a  very big deficit.  To  cover  this

deficit,  taxes  will  be  raised.  But   if   the

repayment  is  spread  over  80  years,  then  the

subsidy  will  be lower. Then the  Budget  deficit

will  be  smaller. Maybe there might be a surplus,

and  in  that  event there will be no increase  in

taxes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am told, Sir, by some quarters that the

working  of  this 60-year period is based  on  the

life  of  a building. May I draw the attention  of

the  Minister,  the  Financial Secretary  and  the

officials  of the S.I.T. that there are  buildings

which  are about 40 years old and are still strong

and  they are not built of brick? They are  wooden

structures built before the first world war  on  a

temporary  basis. If these wooden  structures  can

last  for  40  years and more, I  cannot  see  any

reason why structures built with brick cannot last

80  years. I will refer the Minister to a block of

wooden houses along Rangoon Road. They were  built

before  the first world war and today they are  as

strong as any other building. If a notice to  quit

were given to the tenants of these buildings, I am

sure they would rather prefer to remain there than

be  moved out into permanent structures. Why then,

Sir,  suggest  that  the life  of  a  building  as

envisaged  by the Minister will last for  only  60

years  when a temporary wooden structure can  last

for 40 years and more? I certainly believe that if

the  Improvement Trust were to give their building

contracts to a reliable contractor and he were  to

build  the  Trust  houses according  to  plan  and

specifications, such houses would last far  longer

than  60  years. According to the existing  houses

built by the contractor for the Trust, Sir, I  can

definitely say that they are not worth a  cent  at

all. The house in which I am now staying was built

about   four   years  ago  and  it   is   cracking

everywhere. I have had to complain to the Trust on

many occasions about leakage. I think that is  the

fault  of  either the Trust or its  contractor.  I

think  it  is the responsibility of the Trust  and

the  contractor  to see that such  structures  are

properly  built rather than work on the  basis  of

limiting their life to 60 years. I think  that  is

the fault - to limit the life of a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1301</b></font><br><br>



building  to 60 years. I hope I am in order,  Sir,

if I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line 5 to leave out the figure "60" and

insert "80".

please?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> The S.I.T., Sir, is my pet

hobby and I can enlarge on what I have said, but I

think  I have said enough to explain my amendment.

Sir, all these years the Trust has been telling us

that we are subject to its control. Again, Sir,  I

have come across occasions where the Trust housing

inspector has taken a lot of trouble to look,  not

into  the  condition of the houses, but  into  the

bedrooms  and  the  beds, and under  the  beds.  I

cannot  see  how he is authorised  to  do  such  a

thing.  I  do  not know whether that is  right  or

wrong,  but  since  the officer-in-charge  of  the

S.I.T. is smiling, I think I am correct in making

that remark.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, the S.I.T. has all this while been

saying that the City Council-



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> May I enquire, Sir, whether the

remarks made by the hon. Member are relevant?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was just wondering how an S.I.T.

officer  looking  under a bed could  increase  the

period from 60 years to 80 years!



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> It would shorten his life, Sir!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, whether that is relevant

or  not, I wonder whether any Member of the House,

on  my  side  and not on the Government  side,  is

prepared to second my amendment. Unfortunately the

Member who has agreed to second it is not here. If

I  cannot  get a seconder, I think it  is  a  real

shame on the part of the Opposition.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> In the circumstances, Sir, I

would like to second it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1302</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the figure '60' proposed to be left out,

be left out."



<br><br>11.31 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> With respect to my friend the Member

for Queenstown, Sir, I doubt very much whether the

proposed amendment would have much effect. Let  us

take  an  example: the capital sum of  $1  million

borrowed  at 5 per cent and lent to the  Singapore

Improvement  Trust at 5 per cent to be  repaid  on

the  annuity system over a period of 60 years. The

annuity  then would be $52,828. If the  period  of

repayment  were extended to 80 years, the  annuity

repayment  per  annum would be $51,030.  In  other

words,  the  saving will be $1,798. If you  spread

that  over the hundred odd houses which  might  be

built from the $1 million, the effect in the rents

would not be very great.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore. I recommend that the amendment put

forward,  I  know in all good faith  by  the  hon.

Member, be rejected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the figure proposed to be left

out, be left out," put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Original Question again proposed.



<br><br>11.32 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,   unless  I  heard  the  Minister  for  Local

Government, Lands and Housing wrongly,  my  figure

for the proposed expenditure of $44,737,000 is for

the  building of approximately 5,500 houses, which

works out at about $8,000 per unit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it seems to me that the cost of the

Singapore  Improvement Trust housing,  judging  by

these  figures, has suddenly gone  up  by  a  very

considerable  degree.  My  understanding  is  that

units  of  2 bedrooms and a sitting-room would  be

round  about $4,000 each. It had been round  about

$4,000  up to last year. A unit consisting of  two

rooms,  that is, one sitting-room and one bedroom,

should  not cost more than $3,000 at the  outside.

We  are told that the major programme would be  in

the construction of very low-cost units for which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1303</b></font><br><br>



a  rental  of  $30 per unit would  be  charged.  I

therefore think that most of these houses intended

to  be  built with this $44,737,000 would be round

the  $3,000 to $4,000 figure. How is it then  that

the  average should appear to be $8,000 per  unit?

We  must  make allowances because the  shop-houses

will  cost well over $10,000 or even $15,000 each.

We  are assured that the majority of them will  be

low-cost houses but some houses are going to  cost

at  least  $20,000 per unit which will  bring  the

average  up to $8,000 per unit. That, Sir,  to  my

mind, is a departure from the intention of housing

the poor people or the people who cannot afford to

look  after themselves in this country and I would

deprecate  any increase for any unit costing  more

than $5,000 a unit. With this $44,737,000 we shall

get  units of houses costing $8,000 to $10,000 per

unit and not about $5,000 for each unit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that I wish to bring up is the

rentals  charged. I have never been able  to  come

down to figures or to understand how the flats  in

Elizabeth  Estate,  I am told, cost  about  $8,000

each  and the rent comes to about $60 a month  for

each  flat.  I  know for a fact  that  people  who

purchase   their   own  houses  through   building

societies and who have to pay 7 per cent  interest

on  the money borrowed, if they are able to obtain

100  per  cent mortgage on an $8,000  house,  they

will  be  paying  $80 per month  for  capital  and

interest  for 13 years, after which period,  those

houses  will belong to them. Therefore,  this  $80

per month for an $8,000 house includes payment  of

capital  by instalments as well as interest  at  7

per  cent.  On those houses charged  $60  a  month

rental,  I  think  that  the  Government  is  only

getting a return of three per cent interest and  I

find  it  very  difficult to  understand  how  the

Singapore  Improvement Trust  can  justify  $60  a

month  rentals  for so long as  the  houses  last.

According   to  calculations  based  on   building

societies, the capital for those houses should  be

recovered  in  about  20 or  25  years.  There  is

therefore, in my mind, room for a reduction in the

rents of those houses.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1304</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>11.35 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

this motion would not have been necessary if there

were  many houses in Singapore and everybody  were

comfortably housed but because of the shortage  of

housing  and the high rentals charged, we are  now

trying  to  find  ways and means  of  helping  the

people  of  Singapore. I put it to you, Sir,  that

the  housing shortage in Singapore will ease,  not

only  when the Singapore Improvement Trust starts

building  more  houses,  but  also  when   private

builders  accelerate their rate of  building.  For

private builders, however, they cannot hold on  to

their houses all the time and rent them out and so

we  must have a class of people who are willing to

come forward to buy such houses. We have many such

people coming forward to buy these houses.  A  few

of  them  buy them outright, but many  others  buy

them  after  receiving  loans,  either  from   the

Colonial  Development Corporation, or  from  other

building   societies.   These   people   must   be

encouraged  not only to buy houses but  to  retain

them  and  by  so  doing set an example  to  other

people to buy and own houses of their own. We  are

trying  to spread the good things of life  to  the

people  of Singapore. We always talk about wanting

to  help  the  poor people and I  think  that  the

people  who  do not buy luxurious houses  outright

but just ordinary houses to live in cannot, in any

way, be classified as rich people. If they do  not

like such houses, then they will have to depend on

the  Singapore Improvement Trust to  provide  them

with houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to my calculation, Sir, for 5,500

houses  costing $44,737,000, each house will  cost

about  $8,000.  Now, on an average, the  Singapore

Improvement  Trust expects to get rentals  in  the

region   of   $30  per  month.  In  many   housing

estates - and  I  will point out one, the  Serangoon

Garden  Estate - houses  are  put  up  for  sale  at

$11,000 each but from that $11,000 the builder has

already  had  his  cut, and for a  2-room  terrace

house,  the  cost as calculated should  be  around

$8,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Phew! That is about 25 per cent.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1305</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Yes, I think that that is

about  the amount of money that they make in  that

housing  estate.  Let us put  the  cost  at  about

$1,000   or  $2,000  higher,  yet  the  basis   of

assessment which the Government is levying on them

is  not  $30 or $40 a month but in the  region  of

between $80 and $100. That, Sir, I maintain is not

the way to encourage these people to own their own

houses  and that is why I believe it will make  it

more  necessary for the Government to come to this

Assembly again and again to ask for more money  to

be  loaned  out  for  Singapore Improvement  Trust

buildings. I maintain, Sir, that if we  are  going

to  help the people of Singapore, then we must not

just  help only those who are lucky enough to come

and  live in Trust houses, but also those who have

the courage to try and own their own houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I invite Government to look into this matter of

assessment  on private houses again  and  to  levy

such  assessments as to encourage these people  to

own their own houses. The necessity for coming  to

this  House  to ask for more loans to  build  more

buildings will then be less frequent.



<br><br>11.40 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair (Assistant Minister, Chief Secretary's Ministry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister, Chief Secretary's Ministry (Mr M. P. D. Nair):</b> Sir, this motion is

very  significant and very wise. This also sets  a

new phase in the housing history of Singapore.  In

the  past,  Sir,  the Singapore Improvement  Trust

which is the housing authority has been confronted

with many difficulties. The most important one has

been the cost of building. Some Members have dealt

with the cost of housing in detail but from my own

experience,   as   a  member  of   the   Singapore

Improvement Trust, I have found that the Singapore

Improvement  Trust  has to face  competition  from

private  builders. Things have not  been  so  very

easy  for the Singapore Improvement Trust and they

are  so  even now. I understand, Sir, that in  the

past  two  or  three months, the cost of  building

materials  has  risen 10 per  cent  more  than  in

previous  months. This goes on to prove  that  the

Singapore Improvement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>



Trust  will not be able to build houses at cheaper

prices  now  than they were built before.  I  have

also  reviewed the question of tenders  that  were

put  up by the Singapore Improvement Trust and  it

was  evident, from all these things, that the most

important  factor in building - it has always  been

and it will be for some time more, I believe, from

what I have been told by some experts - is the cost.

I think, Sir, that because of this fact, the rents

also  had  to be increased. We are all aware  that

since  the  Government took office,  it  has  been

looking  into  this  matter  very  seriously   and

earnestly.  In  the past, they declared  that  the

interest on loans would be 2½ per cent and  this

had  no  effect  on  the people who  were  renting

houses.  We worked it out and found that a  tenant

could only get a reduction of $2 to $3 if we  were

to  reduce  the  interest to 2½  per  cent.  The

Government has now taken a bold and decisive  step

in  subsidising public housing which will directly

affect  the tenants who are badly in need of  help

from  the  Government. This motion, in conjunction

with  the subsidy policy of the Government, should

enable the poorest man in Singapore to be happy in

a  very decent home. It has been declared, Sir, in

this  White Paper, that the service charges  will,

in future, be withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, this motion has also tackled in

the  right  way  the slum clearance  situation  in

Singapore. Much criticism has been levelled in the

past  at Government's inactivity although  it  has

not  been  inactive  about  slum  clearance.  This

Kallang   project,  Sir,  will  enable  the   most

congested  area of the town to be  replaced  by  a

decent housing estate and the existing barren land

at  St.  Michael's Road will be filled with decent

houses  and  occupied by our people. I feel,  Sir,

that  this first step towards slum clearance  will

be  continued  with all vigour by Government  and,

within  a few years' time, we will all be able  to

see  a very decent Singapore with no slums at all.

I  am hopeful, Sir, because, from my experience. I

have  found that the Government has at no time  in

the past been so sincere and honest in tackling  a

problem  which is a great social need in Singapore

than it is doing today. It is from the need for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>



houses that discontentment and frustration arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a Member of this Assembly has spoken about

the period for the loan. He tried to amend the 60-year  period to an 80-year period some  time  ago,

with  little  support from Members.  It  has  been

found  from  experience  that  a  sound  financial

policy  and  loan  policy do not  allow  the  loan

period  to be so extended as to have no comparison

with  the  approximate life  of  the  building.  I

understand,  Sir, that it is a universal  practice

for  all permanent housing loans not to exceed  60

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel sure that the people of Singapore,

from  now on, can hope to obtain houses for  which

they  pay rents which they can afford. Sir, I must

congratulate  the  Minister for Local  Government,

Lands  and Housing for introducing this  bold  and

decisive policy on housing in Singapore.



<br><br>11.46 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I listened with interest on the subject of

housing  and  the housing policy of the  Singapore

Improvement  Trust. I find here that the  interest

rate  charged  is 5¼ per cent. In the  Legislative

Council,  my  hon. Friend the Chief Minister,  who

was  then  a member of the Labour Party,  and  the

Hon. the   Assistant  Minister  to   the   Chief

Secretary, also a member of the Labour Party - if  I

remember  correctly - generally opposed the interest

of  2½  or 3½ per cent given. Their contention

had  been that the Government should give all  the

money  free  of interest as a subsidy.  Now,  from

this  3½ per cent, the Government is seeking  to

charge  us 5¼ per cent. I cannot understand  why

there  is such a wide change and I would  like  to

know on what basis the Government is charging 5¼

per cent for a period of 60 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the postwar period, we have seen

fluctuating  changes  in the  money  market.  Even

during   the   postwar  period,  if   I   remember

correctly, the Government and the Municipality had

loans  at  3, 3¼, 3½ and even 4 per cent,  but

5¼  per cent is incredibly high. If it  was  for

six  months  or  a year, that would  have  been  a

different matter altogether. We are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1308</b></font><br><br>



charging  this continuously for 60 years and  this

in turn will be charged on to the tenants who will

have  to pay such a high rate of interest. Sir,  I

would like an explanation for such a high rate  of

interest charged on this loan.



<br><br>11.50 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> First of all, Sir, the Member for Paya

Lebar raised some interesting points in connection

with   the   existing  rents  of   the   Singapore

Improvement Trust and I shall be very glad  if  he

can come and discuss the matter with me some time.

The  points raised are very involved and  I  think

that  it is rather difficult to discuss them  over

the floor of the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the increase in the cost of

housing, I think that most Members will agree that

this  is  perhaps the most elaborate scheme  which

the  Singapore Improvement Trust has ever evolved.

It  makes  a  very serious attempt to  tackle  the

question of slum clearance and to erect on central

sites  which  are very expensive and require  much

preparation  houses which we hope  will  last  for

many years and provide suitable accommodation  for

the  poorest  classes in Singapore. The  cost  has

increased owing to building costs going up but, in

the  main,  to the cost of acquiring and preparing

very difficult sites.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the points raised by the Member

for  Serangoon, we do hope that every interest  in

Singapore  will endeavour to build  houses  either

for  sale  or  letting and thus ease  the  housing

problem of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of interest rates raised

by  my  friend the Member for Telok Ayer,  it  has

been  suggested  in the past by  Members  on  both

sides  of  the  House that the  interest  rate  on

existing  loans from Government to  the  Singapore

Improvement Trust should perhaps be reduced  to  2

per  cent.  Indeed, I think that in the past,  the

Hon, the Chief Minister has himself advocated that

it  be reduced to nothing! That argument-if it has

any  validity,  which I confess  I  am  unable  to

agree-only applies to loans which have  been  made

from surplus funds. All the loans to the Singapore

Improvement Trust in the past have been made  from

funds which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>



had  been accumulated by Government owing  to  its

inability to press on with development projects in

other  directions. Now, of course, we are entering

into  a  new phase and as far as the loans to  the

Singapore   Improvement  Trust  or   the   housing

authority  of  Government are  concerned,  we  are

going  to have to borrow money from the public  to

re-lend to the Singapore Improvement Trust  or  to

the housing authority. In these circumstances,  it

is  no  more  than  sound finance  to  charge  the

Singapore  Improvement  Trust  the  same  rate  of

interest and the same terms of the repayment as we

have to re-pay the people from whom we borrow  the

money.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> rose-



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr R. C. H. Lim):</b> In reply?



<br><br>11.56 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> In reply, Sir.

Mr  Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am glad to note  that,

generally, the Opposition Members do believe  that

there  is  a great demand for accelerated  housing

programmes in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may, Sir, attempt to reply to the points

raised by the Member for Queenstown (Mr Lee Choon

Eng)  and the Member for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim  Koon

Teck).  The  Member for Queenstown appears  to  be

under a misapprehension when he said that but  for

the  Question  which  he had tabled  today,  there

would not have been a White Paper. Sir, I am not a

magician  and  I can tell him that,  not  being  a

magician, I could not, within the space of a  day,

produce a White Paper out of my hat. This  is  the

result  of  months  of  hard work  and  continuous

meetings  and  I  must say, Sir, that  this  White

Paper is the ultimate result of close co-operation

between  a  number of Ministries and the Singapore

Improvement Trust.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members will refer to the White Paper, Sir,

the  policy,  as  I  have mentioned  earlier  this

morning, is in regard to the housing policy of the

Government of Singapore for the future. As for the

present,  the best that we can possibly do  is  as

mentioned in page 5,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1310</b></font><br><br>



paragraph 24 of Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 6 of 1957

which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As an immediate measure, however, in order to

afford  some relief to present Trust tenants,  the

Government  has agreed to pay the service  charges

at  present  levied on tenants for  lifts,  common

lighting  and conservancy. This form of relief  is

considered  to be more practical than  an  overall

reduction of interest rates on loans and will give

relief where it is most needed."



<br><br>Sir,  that  is as far as we can possibly  go  with

regard  to  reliefs  for present  tenants  of  the

Singapore Improvement Trust houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other point raised by the Member for

Queenstown was that people are forced to  stay  in

the  Singapore  Improvement Trust flats.  This  is

completely untrue because my information  is  that

there  are  thousands  of people  on  the  housing

register  who  are only too willing  to  be  given

accommodation  in the Singapore Improvement  Trust

flats  and, at the same time, those who have  been

afforded   this  opportunity  have   very   seldom

complained of the question of rentals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon mentioned certain

points but the most important one was the question

of  the cost of buildings. Here again, Sir, I must

point  out to the Member that his figure of $8,000

per  flat is not quite correct in that it includes

not  only  the cost of the building but  also  the

cost  of  land and site preparation  and  it  also

includes  piling, and so on. I will  give  you  an

example,  Sir. In the Rochore Road/Albert  Street

area, the building cost of a 2-room flat is in the

region  of  $6,250 which includes piling  cost  of

$1,200. Here, Sir, the total figure of the cost of

building  and  the cost of piling  is  $7,450  but

then,  Sir,  the  cost  of  the  land  itself   is

somewhere  in the region of $2,500 per unit  which

naturally  would  bring the figure  to  well  over

$8,000  per flat. As I said, Sir, the cost  of  an

S.I.T. flat  must be looked at from  all  angles,

that  is  to  say, the cost of land, the  cost  of

preparation  of  sites,  piling  costs  and   then

eventually  the cost of the building  itself.  For

instance,  in  the old Kallang Airport  area,  the

cost  of  a  2-room flat is $6,300 which  includes

piling cost of $1,400 whereas in Bukit Panjang



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1311</b></font><br><br>



where we have put up 200 houses, the building cost

is  about  $3,200  per  unit,  the  cost  of  site

preparation  is  $1,590 and the cost  of  land  is

$123.  So  there  you  are, Sir,  that  where  the

question  of  piling is involved, it is  bound  to

happen that the cost of a building would naturally

be high.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of interest rates,

my  colleague the Hon. the Financial Secretary has

given  a very apt reply and I do not think that  I

will dwell on that question. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Original Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly in accordance with subsection

(1)  of  section  25 of the Singapore  Improvement

Ordinance (Cap. 259) approves of the borrowing  by

the   Singapore   Improvement   Trust   from   the

Government  of  the  sum  of  $44,737,000  at   an

interest rate of 5¼ per cent per annum repayable

over  a period of 60 years, the repayments  to  be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1312</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this motion seeks the approval of the

Assembly  for a loan of $44,737,000 on  the  terms

and  conditions  specified in the  motion  to  the

Singapore  Improvement Trust for Housing Programme

No. 8.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend and colleague the Minister for Local

Government,   Lands   and  Housing   has   already

described  in  some detail the scope of  Programme

No.  8.  It  is,  as  I said, the  most  ambitious

programme   yet   drawn  up   by   the   Singapore

Improvement  Trust in its capacity as the  Housing

Agent  of Government. I do not think that  I  need

add  to the Minister's description. My task is  to

describe   the  financial  implications   of   the

programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members are aware, the Government has

already  undertaken  to provide  funds  for  seven

Housing  Programmes. Details of these undertakings

are  given  in Appendix F of the annual  Estimates

for  1957 and a summary is given on page 2 of  the

White    Paper   on   Housing   Subsidies.   These

undertakings  amount  to  $95.9  millions  against

which  $71  millions  have so far  been  advanced.

Programme  No. 8 will increase Government's  total

commitments to $140 millions of which $70 millions

still  remain to be advanced. This, of course,  is

not the limit of Government's liability in respect

of  housing.  With  population increasing  at  its

present  rate and the need for a large-scale  slum

clearance becoming more and more compelling, it is

difficult   to   put  a  limit   to   Government's

liabilities  in  this  respect.  In  the   revised

development  plan  to  which  reference  was  made

during  the Budget debate, allowance was made  for

an  expenditure of $115 millions on  housing  over

the  five  year period from 1958 to 1962  and  the

expenditure in subsequent years will no  doubt  be

of the same order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be clear from these figures that the

supply  of  public  housing presents  a  financial

problem   of  considerable  magnitude   and   hon.

Members, no doubt, wonder where the money is going

to  come from. Here again, I must refer to what  I

said when introducing the Supply Bill in November.

Singapore's most urgent needs for capital



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1313</b></font><br><br>



development over the next five years are  estimated

at  $570  millions. This total includes  some  $226

millions for general development, $235 millions for

the  City  Council  and  other  agencies  and  $115

millions  for housing. To meet this expenditure  of

$570  millions,  it is estimated that,  subject  to

certain  conditions being fulfilled, $280  millions

can  be  obtained  from reserves and  contributions

from  the  revenues  of Government  and  the  other

authorities concerned and $290 millions from  loans

including   a  special  loan  for  the  electricity

undertaking  of  the City Council.  The  conditions

which must be fulfilled are briefly as follows: (a)

that  Government revenue is increased by stages  to

yield  at least an additional $50 million by  1959,

thus  enabling larger contributions to be made from

revenue  to development; (b) that the City  Council

and    other    agencies   can   make   substantial

contributions from their revenues towards the  cost

of their development projects, as they have done in

the  past; (c) that a special loan can be  obtained

for  further electricity development and  (d)  that

local capital resources are mobilised to the full.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think these conditions can be fulfilled. The

measures of taxation introduced this year will go a

considerable  way to increasing Government  revenue

by  the  required  amount and I have  little  doubt

about  the  capacity of Singapore  to  provide  the

balance  required.  The  City  Council  and   other

agencies   must   continue  to   make   substantial

contributions  from revenue to  development  and  I

hope  that the proposals which we will make  for  a

loan  for  a  new  power  station  will  meet  with

acceptance.  The  proposals for a national  savings

campaign and other steps to mobilise local  capital

are under active consideration at the present time.

Members will hear about them in due course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, other conditions which must

be fulfilled. Confidence in Singapore must be built

up and maintained. We must have peace, security and

freedom  to go about our business without  fear  of

civil    disturbance,   provoked   by    subversive

interests.  The  rule  of law must  be  maintained.

Reason



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>



must be introduced into employer-employee relations

and the rank and file of trade unions must learn to

recognise  and to reject the malevolent  influences

which have hitherto used them for their own ends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these conditions can be fulfilled, there is no

doubt  that  all  the funds which  we  require  for

development  will be obtained, and Government  will

be  able  to meet its obligations in the sphere  of

housing.  If  these conditions are  not  fulfilled,

then I am afraid that we will not be able to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as regards the terms and conditions, the

rate of interest proposed for this loan is 5¼ per

cent.  This  is  the same rate of interest  as  was

agreed  in  the  case of the loan to the  Singapore

Telephone  Board  which was approved  at  the  last

sitting of the Assembly. It is about the rate which

we  should  probably have to offer if we wished  to

float a loan on the Singapore market at the present

time. The rate of interest is approximately that of

current  market  rates and it  follows  the  policy

which  Government  has adhered to  since  it  first

started    advancing   money   to   the   Singapore

Improvement Trust. I am sure that it is the correct

policy, particularly as the time has now come  when

money  will have to be borrowed from the public  in

order  to advance it to the Housing Authority.  The

loan will be repaid over a period of 60 years, this

being  the period taken not only here but in  other

countries  as  the  period of  useful  life  for  a

permanent building for loan repayment purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repayment will be by equal bi-annual instalments

of principal and interest calculated on the annuity

system. Repayment in this way is preferred  by  the

Singapore  Improvement Trust to the alternative  of

equal instalments of principal with interest on the

balance  of  the loan outstanding.  The  last  four

loans are repayable in this way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the case of previous loans, the loan will

be   secured  by  a  legal  mortgage  of  all   the

properties to which the Singapore Improvement Trust

has legal title



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1315</b></font><br><br>



and by an equitable charge over all properties  to

which the Trust holds equitable title. Sir, I  beg

to move.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> I second the

motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>12.09 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the

reason  given by the Hon. the Financial Secretary,

that the rate of interest is 5¼ per cent because

we  shall  be borrowing the money on the Singapore

market   and   re-lending  it  to  the   Singapore

Improvement  Trust,  may be  a  perfectly  logical

financial  reason,  but it does  not  answer  this

question.   This   Government  is   committed   to

subsidise   housing.  In  other   words,   it   is

committed,  whatever the form of the  subsidy,  to

provide  housing below the normal economic  rates.

If the Government continues this practice which it

pursued  in the past of just borrowing  money  and

acting  as the guarantor and re-lending it to  the

Singapore   Improvement  Trust  on  mortgage,   in

effect,  there is no housing subsidy.  People  pay

economic  rents  to  defray  both  the   cost   of

management and the cost of the interest rate. Now,

we were told by the Minister for Local Government,

Lands  and  Housing that there is going  to  be  a

review  of  the rents of the Singapore Improvement

Trust  flats  and  houses - to redeem  his  election

pledge.  However we juggle between the rents  paid

by  the  new houses and the low rents paid on  the

prewar   houses  or  the  earlier   built   houses

increasing  the  rents for the prewar  houses  and

decreasing  slightly  the rents  for  the  postwar

houses, the fact remains that the total collection

of  rents  must  be  sufficient  to  pay  cost  of

management  and the interest rate. [Interruption.]

If  I  am wrong, I shall be delighted to be  shown

where I am wrong.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I will suspend the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1317</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>2.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> During the luncheon

adjournment,  Sir,  I had the advantage  of  being

enlightened  on  the  Government  housing  subsidy

plans.  According to the White Paper as  explained

by  the  Minister for Local Government, Lands  and

Housing,  the  plan  is to fix rentals  below  the

economic rent and the deficit will be made up by a

vote  in  this Assembly annually. Hence that  vote

will represent the annual subsidy for housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on principle, there is nothing wrong with

that plan. I am told also that from the accounting

point   of   view,  everything  will  be   clearly

disclosed and not concealed. But I think Ministers

on  the  other side must also be aware  that  this

means an annual debate. This means, in effect, the

possibility  of  subsidies  going   up   or   down

depending upon the play of local political  forces

year by year, perhaps even month by month. I would

ask  them  seriously to consider  some  method  by

which once a subsidy rate has been fixed, it stays

there  until there is, as a result of major policy

changes  in  the Government, a need to revise  the

whole   subsidy  rate,  otherwise  like  the   old

Emergency  Regulations, we will have it  up  every

year.  I do not think this is to the advantage  of

those  who  reside  in houses  subsidised  by  the

Government.  It appears to me on principle  to  be

not   altogether   a   satisfactory   method    of

subsidising housing.



<br><br>2.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the possibility of

the  matter  of  subsidy  becoming  a  subject  of

political bargaining was foreseen. It was  thought

that   we  should  act  like  grown-up  men.   The

Government in power should take the responsibility

of acting like men and not pander to the whims and

fancies  of the electorate if it thinks  that  the

electorate is wrong. If the electorate  is  right,

by  all means, yes, but not if it thinks that  the

electorate is wrong. There is also the possibility

that  there may be certain irresponsible  elements

in  the  Opposition at any time in  any  year  who

might try to play up to popular sentiment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1318</b></font><br><br>



and feeling by advocating a very low rental and  a

higher rate of subsidy but it is up to the men who

feel  that they are responsible to stick to  their

guns.   If   the  time  comes  when  our   elected

Government  does  not  behave  like  grown-up  men

capable  of  undertaking responsibility,  I  would

feel sorry for Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> In reply, Sir. I have very little to

say  in reply. The subsidy policy outlined in  the

White Paper has been evolved after a great deal of

thought. We do not claim that it is perfect. It is

possible  that  there  may be  better  methods  of

subsidising  housing in Singapore. If  the  Member

for  Tanjong  Pagar can think of any  of  them,  I

shall be delighted to have the details. Sir, I beg

to move.

instalments  based  on  the  annuity  method   and

together with repayments of previous loans  to  be

<div align="center"><b>TRADING IN RICE</b></div>



<br><br>2.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  take pleasure in moving the motion standing  in

my name on the Order Paper,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House is of the opinion that

Government's trading in rice and/or stockpiling of

rice  should be abolished and that trading in rice

should be free.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the whole object of moving this motion is

to  bring  down the cost of rice for  our  masses.

This  is  the staple food for our masses and  when

voting, I would like hon. Members to consider that

the interest of the masses comes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1319</b></font><br><br>



first. Even one cent a katty less in the price  of

rice is something to the poor man.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I proceed, I would like to deal with

the  prewar  history of rice. During that  period,

rice was sold at five to seven cents a katty. Even

during the war, before the Japanese attacked,  the

Government  Gazettes  I have  here  show  that  in

September 1940, the price of rice was from five to

seven  cents a katty. In March 1941, it was  seven

cents  a katty. Then in May 1941, it was from  six

to nine cents a katty. I have quoted these figures

also  for the benefit of my friends who are on  my

side  of the House, especially for the P.A.P. who

call themselves the People's Party.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> No "Action"!



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Now, Sir, rice is produced

throughout South-East Asia: in Burma, Thailand and

Indo-China.  Rice  was imported  here  during  the

prewar  period  all the time and re-exported  from

here.  Rice  from  Burma was exported  to  Africa,

Ceylon and many other countries and rice from Indo-China  and  Thailand was also exported to  various

countries.  We  have the shipping facilities  over

here in addition to the low handling charges which

make it possible for those countries to ship their

rice here for our local merchants to re-export.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the prewar period till December

1941,  I was a member of the Food Advisory Council

and  we  had  a  plan by which every family  could

store a bag of rice for an emergency. Now, Sir, in

February 1942, the 100 years of British rule ended

within  only  nine  weeks. Then  the  British  re-occupied  this  territory again in September  1945

with  the help of the Allies and during that  time

when  the  Japanese left, things  were  in  chaos.

There was shortage of every foodstuff and consumer

goods.  During  that period which  was  under  the

British   Military  Administration,  a  department

called the Supplies Department came into being. It

was  a  great  necessity, at  that  time,  to  get

supplies  from  every possible  source  especially

when  shipping was scarce and the prices were  not

steady and therefore that department



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1320</b></font><br><br>



was  very necessary. As time went on, things  were

becoming  normal.  Many things were  de-controlled

and there was no restriction on imports. Flour and

sugar  were  the  last  to be de-controlled.  Rice

should  also  have been de-controlled about  three

years ago when the supplies were plentiful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the days from September 1945 when the

British  occupied this territory till three  years

ago, rice was sold from the producing countries on

a   government  to  government  basis.   All   the

representatives of the Governments  in  South-East

Asia  used to meet here and arrange the allocation

of   rice  amongst  themselves  at  a  round-table

conference presided over by the then Commissioner-General. Each country was allocated its quota.  So

far,  it  worked quite well as it was  a  seller's

market.  Nobody  could  import  rice  on  his  own

account though we have heard the smuggling of rice

did  take place from Thailand into the Federation.

I  think  that Government's objection to free  the

control of rice at that time was correct but  then

the time came, Sir, when rice was plentiful. Burma

has been sending delegations to sell rice to every

possible  country. Thailand has  enough  rice  and

even  if  there  is trouble in Indo-China  and  we

cannot import rice from her in the future, I think

there  are  plenty  of  supplies  available   from

elsewhere and there can be no shortage. Even China

is supplying rice to Ceylon and only the other day

I  read from a newspaper report that 5,000 tons of

rice from China was arriving in Singapore for  the

Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if rice is plentiful, is it necessary

to  maintain  a  department costing  the  taxpayer

about $68,000 to $70,000 a year? In addition, Sir,

Government has its own stockpile policy and I will

deal  with  that  later at length but  the  system

prevailing is that if an importer has to import  a

certain  quantity of rice, he has to buy one-third

of that quantity from the Government stockpile.  I

understand   that  Government  has  a   continuous

stockpile  of 11,000 to 15,000 tons of rice.  Sir,

Government has to pay the handling



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1321</b></font><br><br>



charges, the godown rents - if the godowns  belong

to  the Government, then the rents which could be

derived  from them by letting them  out  will  be

lost  to  the  Government - and  perhaps  insurance

which  I  am  not sure about. There is  also  the

possibility of the rice deteriorating. All  these

have to be taken into account and added on to the

price at which the importer has to buy this  one-third quantity from the Government stockpile.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me give some figures to show how the

masses  have suffered by payment from revenue  to

meet  the huge losses in the past. In 1953,  over

$4  million  was lost. In 1954, it was $2,441,000

and in 1955, there was a profit of $413,000. Now,

this  Government might say, "Well, that  was  not

our pigeon. It was under a different government."

But   then  I  would  ask  whether  the   present

Government  is  working for the  benefit  of  the

people  or  not? In 1956, the loss was  $278,958.

Sir,  may  I  point out that this is  a  minority

Government?  Yesterday,  I  read  that,  on   the

Municipal Bill, Government won by 16 to 11 votes.

Now,  out  of  those  16 votes,  you  have  three

Nominated and three ex-officios which add  up  to

six,  thus  leaving ten who are actually  elected

Members  as  against 11 Opposition  Members,  not

counting the one Member who is detained. This  is

how  the  Government functions from day  to  day.

[Interruption.] Sir, it may be so, but  you  have

to  have your responsibilities to the people  and

you  should not forget that but for how long  can

you  carry  on  with the votes  of  the  colonial

power? [Interruption.] May I ask the Minister for

Health  to  speak louder so that I can  reply  to

him?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have said this before and

very  often.  If  the hon. Member  speaking  will

address  the  Chair and ignore side comments,  he

might get on a little faster.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Thank you very much, Sir, but

one  would  not like to be unduly disturbed  when

one is speaking and we on our side do not disturb

others.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1322</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Oh

dear!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Now all those factors are added

on  to the cost. It may be a quarter cent or half

a  cent - whatever  it may be - but  why  should  the

consumer be made to pay this for the silly policy

of  the Government when it is not necessary to do

so  at all? Sir, why is this done? The Government

say that they must have a stockpile. For what?  I

understand - unless   Government   contradicts - that

this  emergency  stock is very necessary  in  the

interest  of  the people. Why? It  is  said  that

there may be war again or it is possible that the

Communists  might attack Burma or Thailand  which

will  affect Singapore or Malaya. What I  say  to

them  is  this, Sir. A hundred years  of  British

rule was ended within the space of nine weeks. If

Burma  or  Thailand were to fall what can  we  do

here?  How long can we protect ourselves?  I  ask

those  questions.  This is nothing  but  a  bogey

based on unnecessary fears. I suggest that it  is

not  necessary to have any stockpile at  all  and

tax the people indirectly by making them pay more

for  rice.  Let me ask another question.  Who  is

going to attack whom in this part of the world?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> The Opposition.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Yes, who is the aggressor? Sir,

the  aggressor  today is the minority  Government

who  have  made the Opposition mad the  way  they

keep on talking to cover their mistakes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, rice is available and is wanted. There is

no  necessity for any stockpile and there  should

not  be  any control on the rice trade. I may  be

told  that there is no control whatsoever  but  I

say that there is control of rice. If one imports

rice  from  another country, he has to  buy  one-third   of   the  quantity  imported   from   the

Government and at Government rate. If that is not

control, then what is it called?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if rice is not controlled, it will

stabilise  automatically at its own  price  level

like any other commodity. If the argument is that

it cannot be done or that it will not be so, then

why not control the other commodities too? You



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1323</b></font><br><br>



have   sugar  and  flour,  etc.,  which  are   not

controlled. Why is control limited to rice only? I

would  like  to  hear  an  explanation  from   the

Government as to why this is necessary?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been told that my motion will be

defeated by the Government. I am not surprised  at

that as they have seven extra votes which are  not

the  people's votes and it is because of the votes

of  the  colonial power that make it possible  for

them  to  defeat us. What I will say  to  them  is

this: they have already dug their graves and  they

will be burying themselves if we are defeated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I hope to send a wreath.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> It will be so as far as Katong

is concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I have not received a proper answer to

my  question  about the names of the importers  of

rice  from Pakistan and India so that we  will  be

able  to  know how much rice was bought direct  by

the regular importers of rice in Singapore for resale  to  other importers. The reply was that  the

Chamber of Commerce publishes these facts and that

I  had  better refer to them. Why? Government  has

got  its  own department and they have  their  own

import  permits. Why should I not get  a  straight

answer  as to who are the importers and exporters?

The licences to import rice, I am told, are issued

freely to applicants and are they not regularised?

Is  no record made? One has to apply for a licence

to import rice and there must be a record of that.

The  information required as to what is  happening

will  help the People's Action Party make  up  its

mind.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> What is so obvious?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Rice is imported from Thailand

and  from  Burma.  From  July  1955  onwards,   we

imported  rice from Pakistan and India. Now,  what

happens,   Sir,  is  this.  Besides  the  handling

charges, the insurance and the godown rents,  rice

is bought through a middleman or a broker. This is

what  I wanted to prove from my question. In other

words, all these factors are added on to the cost.

For  instance, you buy a pencil directly from  the

manufacturers and it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1324</b></font><br><br>



will  cost you cheaper than if you were to buy  it

through  a  middleman who will  want  to  add  his

commission on to the cost. The consumer will  then

have to pay much more for it here. That was why  I

raised that question. In other words, the consumer

pays  more  for  everything that  Government  does

wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have nothing more to say and I beg to

move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang (Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, I

second the motion. I reserve the right to speak at

a later stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  as  pointed out by the mover of  the  motion

that  this commodity is the staple food of  Asians

and that the control of rice was introduced during

the period of the British Military Administration,

I  think  that  it  is  not necessary  for  me  to

elaborate  further but to draw  the  attention  of

Members  to  the  fact that when  legislation  was

introduced on the control of rice, it was done  at

a  time  when expatriate officers and not  elected

Ministers  were in power. At that time,  when  the

expatriate officers were in power, they  were  not

in  any  way concerned about the question  of  the

staple  food  for Asians although, as was  pointed

out  by  the  mover of the motion, it was  thought

necessary to control rice as there was a  shortage

of  rice. This control is now out-of-date  because

we  all know that we can get rice everywhere at  a

far  cheaper  price. Rice is imported  from  every

country  and  I  do not see why  this  control  is

necessary.  In fact, public money is wasted  as  a

separate  department has to be set up  to  control

and distribute rice. If this money is utilised for

more  social welfare work, I think that the public

will  be far more benefited. This control  is  not

only causing hardship to the consumers, as pointed

out  by the Member for Telok Ayer, but I think  it

is  also causing hardship to the retailers as well

as   to   the  wholesalers  because  everyone   is

affected.  The trouble starts from the Government,

downwards  to  the wholesaler, passed  on  to  the

retailer and the worst sufferer is the consumer.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1325</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, that not only the price of

controlled rice is dearer but that the "free" rice

is  of  a better quality than controlled rice.  If

you  buy  free rice from anywhere and  compare  it

with  controlled rice, you will find  that  it  is

far, far better, as I myself have bought free rice

and  controlled rice. So there is no sense at  all

in controlling rice. Why not throw it open and let

it  be  run  on a competitive basis? We have  many

wholesalers here who are prepared to import  rice.

Let  them run the trade on a competitive basis and

let  the consumer benefit as it is the staple food

of  the Asians. Without this staple food, an Asian

finds it difficult to exist. An argument given  by

the  Government is that it is a precaution against

a  possible  war.  How ridiculous  is  that,  Sir!

Again,  it  was pointed out by the mover  of  this

motion that there should not be any such fear of a

possible   war.  All  Asian  countries   are   now

promoting  peace and I do not see  why  we  should

fear  the possibility of such a war here. The only

enemy  that  we  are afraid of, I think,  are  the

Communists  and  they  are within  Malaya.  So  we

should   not  have  any  fear  from  any   outside

Government.  Even  China is now prepared  to  sell

rice  to  Malaya and Singapore. I have  been  told

that  before,  China suffered from a  shortage  of

rice and it was rationed but now, according to the

delegation  which  went to  China,  it  can  offer

25,000  tons  of rice to Malaya. Just imagine  the

figure  of 25,000 tons of rice offered! Therefore,

you can see where is the necessity for controlling

rice.  The question of control comes in only  when

there  is a shortage of rice but if supply exceeds

demand, there is no necessity for its control.  If

supply far exceeds demand, then why control rice?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, that the public should not be made

to  suffer  because  of  the  foolishness  of  the

Government in enforcing this control. I have again

and  again  said  that control  encourages  black-market:  the  more  you  control,  the  more   you

encourage black-market.



<br><br>3.06 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not propose

to  deal with the technical details of this matter

which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1326</b></font><br><br>



can  be  better handled by the Minister for  Trade

and Commerce but I would like to make one point of

general   importance.  We  have  had  a   lot   of

references  to  the controls during  the  time  of

severe  shortage and to the black-market  of  rice

and  I  think that it might be helpful to Members,

in   thinking  about  this  problem,  to  have  an

assessment  of  what actually did happen  and  the

degree  to which the public was exploited, not  by

the controlled rice provided by the Government but

by  the  black-market rice provided  by  the  rice

trade. This is from "The Economy of Malaya" by the

Professor  of Economics, University of Malaya.  He

estimates that for 1947, the total sales of black-market  rice  were between $250 million  and  $300

million  and  this was a margin of  125  per  cent

above  the  control price. He derives  from  these

figures  the deduction that nearly 50 per cent  or

well over $100 million went in profits to the rice

trade.  That was at a time of shortage -  if  these

figures  are correct; they have never been refuted

although  the  pamphlet is  more  than  two  years

old - when  the  rice traders made a  very  handsome

profit  indeed,  thank you, out of the  sufferings

and  hardships  of the people.  They  did  so  not

because  there  were  controls  but  because   the

controls were not good enough. They were  able  to

defeat them at a time when the Government was ill-organised  as  a result of the great  difficulties

arising from the Japanese occupation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do think that it is valuable to bear in mind

that  if  you have the rice trade solely  operated

for  profit with no element of Government interest

or  control at all, you are putting the poor man's

rice bowl at the mercy of businessmen who, in  the

natural  course of capitalist business, will  seek

to  get as much as they can out of it. It would be

absurd   to   suppose  that  they  will  sacrifice

possible profits in order that the consumer should

get  his  rice  more cheaply. That  would  be  the

function  of  the  Government food  supply  system

rather  than  of  a  private  enterprise  and,  in

connection  with that, I have a newspaper  cutting

in my hand which says:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1327</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nehru's economic programme envisages the

creation of state trading corporations to  be  put

into  operation soon to import and stock essential

foodstuffs,   a   method  to  counter   widespread

speculation in rice and wheat."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just make these very general points, Mr

Speaker,  which  are,  however,  relevant  to  the

debate.  Since  we  have here a small  element  of

public  control -  which  perhaps  as  an  entirely

Socialist House, with the exception of perhaps one

or   two   Independents,  all  the   Parties   are

wholeheartedly  and  sincerely Socialist - I  think

that they are likely to take into account the need

to  preserve at least a measure of control in  the

public  interest, so that the worker  may  not  be

exploited by the middleman who brings in the  rice

from the producer.



<br><br>3.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am of

the opinion too that "Government's trading in rice

and/or  stockpiling of rice should  be  abolished;

and that trading in rice should be free."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably the Minister for Commerce and Industry

is  afraid that war will break out in the East. As

the  mover  of  the motion has  said,  it  is  all

unnecessary worry. It is unlikely that a war  will

break out in the East or at least in this part  of

the world. The neighbouring countries have no time

to  think  of  wars  now. They are  very  busy  in

rehabilitating themselves and growing rice. I have

information  from  a  very  reliable  source  that

Thailand, Burma, Indo-China and Taiwan have  large

surpluses of rice. The United States of America do

not  know  where to dump their rice now. Australia

is  coming  into the field now to see  if  we  can

allow  her to dump her rice here. But as  long  as

Government restricts trade, the people  will  have

to  pay - I would not say through their noses - a high

price.  The merchants, I am told, are prepared  to

guarantee  that  they will, at  any  time,  supply

25,000  tons  of  rice which I understand  is  the

quantity of the Government stockpile reserve.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> At

what price?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang:</b> The price will certainly

drop if we get all the rice here.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1328</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  why does Government want to cling  on  to  a

losing  business? I would suggest that  Government

de-restrict and then there will be a glut  in  the

market   and   the   price  of  rice   will   drop

considerably.



<br><br>3.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

as  the  Government is a Socialist  Government,  I

think  that  it is Government's duty to  take  the

interest of the masses at heart-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Well said.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim:</b> - and the stockpile of rice is

certainly  not for the benefit of the  Members  of

the  Government nor for the benefit of the Members

of  the  Opposition. The flesh and  blood  of  the

masses  have been built up since birth with  rice.

To  free  rice or to give up stockpiling rice  for

the  benefit of the masses would mean  that  in  a

time  of  crisis, the masses will not be  provided

for  with  rice, their staple food. The danger  of

war  is  real. We can at least say that the danger

of  war is not unreal and it is Government's duty,

with such a threat hanging over our heads, to  see

that  there  is  enough rice in  this  country  to

provide for the requirements of the masses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A figure of about $280,000 was given as the

amount  lost by Government last year. Sir, if  you

were  to  divide $280,000 by 1,200,000 persons  in

Singapore, you will find that Government lost last

year  about 23 to 24 cents per person per year  or

two cents per person per month. It is not expected

that  Government  should make money  on  rice  but

Government  is justified in losing money  on  rice

for the benefit of the masses.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

everyone knows that rice is the staple food of the

Asians. It is a "must" in every household  in  the

country and, as such, it is the paramount duty  of

the  Government to reduce the cost of rice to  the

lowest  possible  level  so  that  the  consumers,

particularly the working class, will benefit  from

it. Yet, it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1329</b></font><br><br>



strange  that Government sees fit to maintain  the

Department  of Control of Supplies on  the  flimsy

excuse  that  it  is necessary  because  it  is  a

measure in case of war. This is sheer nonsense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was told that Government will refuse to

support the motion before the House not because it

is  against  the interest of the people,  so  they

claim,  but because a Member on this side  of  the

House had the foresight to introduce such a motion

into  this  House. I can quote, for instance,  why

the  consumers are now paying more for  what  they

should  pay. For B rice, it is 10 per  cent  more.

Government  sells  to the dealers  at  $27.14  per

pikul and the same quality of rice is sold in  the

open  market by the dealers to anybody at $24  per

pikul - less $3.14 per pikul of rice. This $3.14  is

passed on to the consumer. Why? It is because  for

every  1,000  bags of rice that a  dealer  imports

into  this  country, Government  forces  the  same

dealer to buy 500 bags from the stockpile; that is

to say, for every two bags imported, he has to buy

one  bag from the stockpile. Therefore, this $3.14

is not a loss to the importer but it is just added

on  to the price of rice which is imported.  If  a

consumer  goes to a grocery shop to buy  rice,  he

has  to  pay more. For C rice, it is 15  per  cent

more.  Government sells to the dealers  at  $26.43

per pikul and the same quality of rice is sold  by

the  dealers at $22 per pikul. I can quote another

instance  from information which I have  received.

The  successful dealer who intends to  tender  for

the sale of rice to Government for stockpiling has

to pay the sum of $4,000 for 1,000 tons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> To whom?



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> I can ask the Government to

check from records to see how many dealers have

been successful in getting tenders for all these

years?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Is

the hon. Member saying that the dealer has to pay

$4,000 as a bribe or as a deposit?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1330</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is not a point of order. It is a

point for elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Why I said $4,000 is because if

a dealer is to import the B rice, the C.I.F. value

is  only  $23  per pikul and together  with  other

charges, it comes to about $25.60 per pikul. If  I

am  a successful tenderer why should I import rice

at $25.50 per pikul when I can get from the market

at  $24 per pikul - the price other dealers have  to

pay to buy from the stockpile? Instead of new rice

going  into the stockpile, the old rice goes  into

circulation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> That is nonsense.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> So for every pikul of rice,

they save $1 and for a ton of rice, they save $16.

Therefore  for  1,000  tons  of  rice,  they  save

$16,000.  Why  can they not afford to  pay  $4,000

then? If I were a dealer, I would gladly pay it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the hon. Member giving way?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I will be grateful if we

could have this $4,000 cleared up because I do not

quite  follow this sleight of hand,  not  being  a

businessman myself.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> That $4,000 is the sum of money

that a dealer has to pay in order to be successful

in getting approval for his tender.

Yes, Mr William Tan.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> All in all, I think that

Government   should   decontrol   this   essential

commodity  and make the price of rice  cheaper  so

that the working people can benefit from it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I can assure this House that,

immediately  you  lift the control  of  rice,  the

price  will  drop automatically. The Minister  for

Communications and Works spoke a little while  ago

on  the  question of the stockpile.  Why  can  the

Government not pass a law by which every dealer in

rice should be made to stock a certain quantity in

a  godown? That will bring down the price of rice.

The  rich  man  will not suffer. For  every  three

cents  more for a kati of rice, he will not suffer

but it will be the working people who will suffer.



<br><br>3.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

oppose the motion. If a couple of years back,  the

Member  for Telok Ayer had made such a  motion  in

the  then Legislative Council and if I had been  a

Member there, I would have gladly supported him in

such   a   motion  because,  not  being   in   the

Government,   I   would  not   have   known   what

responsibility was. Now, Sir, that I know what the

true  position  is, I am afraid  that  I  have  to

oppose this motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said about the forcing up of the

cost  of rice to the poor consumer. Let me clarify

it, Sir. The extra price that the consumer has  to

pay,  because of the existence of a stockpile,  is

about a cent per katty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Ayer quoted pre-war prices

of rice. He did not quote



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1332</b></font><br><br>



the  post-war prices of rice which I am  sure  all

hon.  Members are aware of. However, I do not  see

what  relation that has with the stockpile because

the price of rice is something beyond our control.

It  is  a  price that is dictated by the producing

countries to the buying countries and as you had a

seller's  market a few years ago, they  took  very

good  care to see that they got the very best  out

of  their  rice  because  rice  formed  the  major

portion  of  their economy. Even now, Sir,  though

rice  is in plentiful supply, the prices have  not

gone  down  to  any appreciable level.  "Rice  has

always  been  imported here and  re-exported  from

here."  That  is what the hon. Member  said.  That

position  has not changed. Rice is even now  being

imported here and even now being re-exported  from

here to various countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to his question, I have given him in

the  answer  the extent of the re-export  of  rice

from  Singapore.  I did not have  figures  of  the

transhipped  rice from Singapore on through  Bills

of  Lading  because  we do  not  have  records  of

transhipments  on  through  Bills  of  Lading  but

according to the figures here, from July  1955  to

June  1956,  more than 100,000 tons of  rice  have

been re-exported from Singapore. Half of that  has

been sent to the Federation of Malaya and about  a

similar quantity to Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there has been a lot of talk about the

control  and the de-control of rice and  I  notice

also that the motion puts in the words " . . . and

that trading in rice should be free." Sir, rice is

not   controlled  at  the  moment.  Rice  was  de-controlled  in 1953 or 1954 - I have the exact  date

somewhere.   Since  then,  rice   has   not   been

controlled. What is happening is that there  is  a

stockpile  obligation on the part of the merchants

to  buy  a  certain  quantity,  according  to  his

imports,  from  the  stockpile  but  there  is  no

control  on  rice as such. Anybody  who  wants  to

import  rice  is  free  to  do  so,  provided   he

undertakes to buy the corresponding ratio from the

stockpile.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Ayer also said that in 1953

when  other  items like flour and sugar  were  de-controlled,  it was not thought fit to  de-control

rice, meaning



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>



that it was not thought fit to exempt it from  the

stockpile. But the stockpile decision was taken in

1953  by  the  then  Government in  the  Executive

Council of which the hon. Member did take part and

that  decision of the then Executive  Council  was

that all commodities should be de-controlled, that

there  should be no price control, and that  there

should  be  no restriction on import  except  that

rice  should be under a stockpile obligation.  The

stockpile  was  fixed in that  year  by  the  then

Government of which the hon. Member was  a  Member

in  the Executive Council. It may have been a more

colonial  Government than it probably is  now.  In

January 1954, a working party was set up with  Mr

Tan Chin Tuan as the Chairman and they tried their

best   to  get  an  acceptable  solution  to   the

stockpile  by  trying  to  get  a  guarantee  from

traders, but it was found that none of the Chinese

or  the  European  business  interests  would  co-operate  in  giving a guarantee  that  they  would

maintain  a  stockpile  of their  own  free  will.

Therefore, a decision was taken in the  middle  of

1954  that  a  stockpile should be maintained.  In

essence, the stockpile is still the same today and

there  is no change. So it is wrong to say that  a

stockpile  was then necessary because rice  was  a

seller's market and in short supply. In fact, rice

became  a  buyer's market in 1953 and I will  give

you  the  proof why it became so. The hon.  Member

quoted figures showing that the Government lost $4

million in 1953 and a couple of million dollars in

1954. Now, why did the Government lose that amount

of  money  on  rice? It was not our Government  at

that  time. It was a more colonial Government with

the  hon.  Member  taking part  in  the  Executive

Council  thereof  but  Government  did  lose  that

amount of money and the reason was this. The  year

before,  it had been decided to allow free imports

of grades that were either superior or inferior to

the  Government's rationing grades. I  hope  I  am

clear on that. A certain type of rice was imported

by  Government for rationing purposes. Now, if you

wanted  to  import  better or inferior  rice  than

that,  you  were at liberty. There was no  control

over it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1334</b></font><br><br>



The   position  had  become  such  that  when  the

countries  started  producing  so  much  rice  our

merchants  here  imported a big  quantity  of  the

superior  grade rice and they were  able  to  sell

much  cheaper than the Government could  sell  its

rationed rice. This showed that rice was  in  free

supply and that there was no short supply of  rice

in   the   producing  countries  at   that   time.

Therefore,  when  the Government here  found  that

they could not sell their rice unless they lowered

their  price because the merchants were  importing

better  rice  and selling it at a  cheaper  price,

they had to lower their price and sell the rice at

a  loss. That was why there was a loss. It was not

the  fault of our Government and I would  not  say

that it was the fault of the then Government,  but

the  position is clear that rice was not in  short

supply  at that time and yet, in spite of that,  a

decision was taken to maintain a stockpile. So  it

is clear that the stockpile decision was not based

on  the  availability of rice or the short  supply

position  of  rice  but  was  based  on  emergency

requirements and the same position stands now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a suspicion, Sir, that behind this move

is  not so much the interest of the masses but the

interest of the merchants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mostly Telok Ayer.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the role of the

merchants in the old days was different  from  the

role  of  the merchants today. At that  time,  any

merchant  prince  could  carry  on  any  trade  or

commerce  he liked, thinking only of the  benefits

and  the  profits that accrued to him and  if  the

country did benefit, to a certain extent,  it  was

just incidental but there was no obligation on the

part  of the merchant to provide a service to  the

country.   Now,  conceptions  have  changed.   The

merchant  now says that he is providing a  service

to  the community and therefore if he is providing

a  service to the community, he should fit in with

the general scheme of things in that community and

with  the  general requirements of that community.

If the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>



general  requirements of that community  demand  a

safety factor in a stockpile, I do not see why the

merchant  should grumble especially as he  is  not

paying  for that stockpile. The consumer is paying

a little more in the price as an insurance premium

for  some  future  unknown contingencies  but  the

merchant is not paying it so why should he grumble

about it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will find, Sir, that in all enlightened

countries,   the  activities  of   merchants   are

harnessed to the needs of the country and they are

not  allowed to carry on haphazardly like the  old

merchant   princes  were  allowed  to  carry   on,

thinking   only  of  themselves   and   if   their

activities do clash with the requirements  of  the

country, a check is put on them. You have  quotas,

tariffs,  and  so  on, which  are  checks  on  the

freedom  of  trade because of the need to  harness

the  activities of the merchants to the  needs  of

the community and I think our merchants should not

grumble over that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been said that the taxpayer has to

pay  the  cost  of  the  upkeep  of  the  Supplies

Department - $60,000 to $70,000 a year.  That,  Sir,

is  not  true. Perhaps the hon. Members have  been

misinformed. If they had cared to come and ask me,

I  would have enlightened them. If they had  cared

to  look up the Budget when it was presented, they

would  have seen that that is not so. The cost  of

the  Supplies Department is borne by the stockpile

and the consumer, in that the extra one cent he is

paying,  is paying for the upkeep of the  Supplies

Department.  There  is  no  extra  cost   to   the

taxpayer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, figures have been quoted to show that the

taxpayer  lost about $280,000 last year and  that,

in  1955,  there  was a profit of  $413,000.  Now,

again  I  want  to  make it very  clear  that  the

taxpayer  is  not  paying this loss.  We  run  the

stockpile  on  a  no  profit, no  loss  basis  and

therefore,  when  I found that the  stockpile  had

made  a  profit of $413,000, I issued a  directive

that  we  should reduce the price of rice so  that

the  profit  which  we had accumulated  should  go

back,  by giving a reduction in the price, to  the

consumer  until  that  profit  was  absorbed.  The

stockpile, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>



repeat,  is run on a no profit, no loss basis.  If

we  make a profit, we reduce the price of rice and

we  give the profit back to the consumer and if we

make  a  loss, we increase the price slightly  and

recover  the  loss. This "bad" Government  of  the

Labour   Front   Coalition,  the   much   maligned

Government  of the Labour Front and the "minority"

Government,  has  reduced the price  of  stockpile

rice  four  times  after it took office.  On  15th

February, 1955, before the elections, ten per cent

rice  was  $494  and fifteen per  cent  was  $476.

Immediately after taking office, on 12th May,  the

price  was reduced all round by $15; on 7th  July,

another  $15 reduction; on 13th January,  1956,  a

further  $15 reduction and on 1st February,  1956,

another $10 - a total reduction up to February which

went  on till 11th September, 1956, of $55,  since

this "bad" Government took over. However, when the

Government had to buy dearer rice, they had to put

the price up slightly and on 12th September, 1956,

we  increased the price by $20, still giving a net

reduction of $35 since the time we took office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general comment is that this "minority"

Government  moves on haphazardly from day  to  day

and  yet,  Sir,  it is this "minority"  Government

which is moving on so haphazardly that is going to

get us merdeka, if we at all do get merdeka.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Thanks to Mr Marshall.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> They are too shy to take the

credit. "Why should the consumer pay for the silly

policy  of  Government?" I forget  who  made  that

remark. "This is a bogey about emergency and wars,

and  so on." I am afraid that some of them do  not

understand the position. "If rice is free, it will

stabilise  at its own price." A general  statement

like  that is probably high-sounding to  the  non-businessmen  but to a businessman who probes  into

it, he will find that there is not much in it. "If

rice is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1337</b></font><br><br>



free,  it will stabilise at its own price." It  is

stabilised  at its own economic price  or  at  the

price  of  the producing countries.  There  is  no

makeshift  about it. There is no  control  and  no

artificial  fixing of prices. It is stabilised  at

the  price  the producing countries can afford  to

sell  and  according  to the  law  of  supply  and

demand.   Where   does   Government   create    an

instability in the price? It does not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why control rice only? Why do you not control

sugar, flour and a host of other things?" The hon.

Member  himself gave the answer in the early  part

of  his  speech and that is, "Rice is  the  staple

food."  Unless you have this staple food available

in an emergency, you will have starvation. But one

can  live  without sugar and flour: at least,  our

population  is accustomed more to rice-eating  and

as  to  rice and flour, they both serve  the  same

purpose;  they are both starchy. I think,  Sir,  I

read  in  hygiene books when I was schooling  that

starch  turns into sugar when you put it  in  your

mouth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point was made that rice is bought by

middlemen - that  is. Indian and Pakistani  rice - and

the  consumer pays more. This is a free  port.  We

cannot   control  anybody  if  he  wants  to   buy

anything.  Why  blame us if a middleman  who  buys

rice  from  India  or Pakistan is  not  a  regular

dealer?  I  do  not know what the  term  "regular"

means  because Singapore is a free  port  and  the

activities of trade are free. But if the middleman

wants  to  make a bit of extra profit, the  direct

importer will undercut him and it will not be long

before the middleman will not be able to reap  his

profit.  The Member for Queenstown (Mr Lee  Choon

Eng)  also  talked on the same lines, Sir,  and  I

think   that   I   have  answered  his   arguments

sufficiently well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main point that was raised by the Member for

Bukit  Panjang (Mr Goh Tong Liang) was  that  the

merchants are prepared to guarantee a stockpile of

25,000   tons.   Sir,  when  the   stockpile   was

suggested,  at its very inception in  1953,  as  I

have  pointed out, they did try under Mr Tan Chin

Tuan  to try to get the trade to agree to maintain

a  stockpile but they failed and the same position

still holds good today. We tried even last



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1338</b></font><br><br>



year to get the traders to sit around and come  to

an  agreement  to keep a stockpile  on  their  own

responsibility  and  we even  offered  to  advance

money to them if they would keep the stockpile  of

rice in Government godowns so that they would  not

be  financially  embarrassed by locking  up  their

capital for stockpile purposes. But no, they would

not  come  to  an understanding and they  refused.

They  gave a general guarantee which was very much

in the air: "Oh, yes, do not worry. We will keep a

stockpile."  Is  that of any real value  when  you

have  an emergency? What will happen is that  rice

will  disappear in the black market  and  probably

all  the  rich Members of this Assembly and  other

rich  people will get their rice because they  can

afford the black market price but not the rest  of

the poor public. They cannot afford the price.  So

a  guarantee in general terms is no use unless the

traders  can agree to a specific scheme of putting

so  much  rice in a godown and getting an  advance

from  Government on it. But they  refuse  to  give

approval for such a scheme. Therefore, it  is  not

our  fault that this sort of idea does not operate

and that we are forced to carry on a stockpile.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point was made by the Member for Tiong Bahru

(Mr  William Tan) that if we lift the control  of

rice,  the  price  will  drop.  That  is  a   mis-statement.  The  price is not  controlled  by  us.

There  is  no price control here. Neither  is  the

cost of rice controlled by us. The cost of rice is

controlled by the selling countries, not by us and

the  rice is bought at the price operating in  the

selling  countries either by us or by  the  trade.

Both have to pay the same price. Therefore, if  we

exclude the stockpile obligation, it does not mean

that  the price will drop. It only means that  the

extra  one  cent  which is added  because  of  the

stockpile obligation will come down. Even that one

cent  per katty when it is spread over two katties

which is imported direct by the importer comes  to

half  a  cent  per  katty to the  consumer - if  the

merchants are honest about it - because they pay one

cent  more for our one katty of rice but they  buy

two  katties  of  rice cheaper by one  cent,  they

therefore get two cents cheaper in the price of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1339</b></font><br><br>



two  katties  of rice and if you add this  up,  it

only comes to half a cent or less extra.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A serious matter was raised by the Member for

Tiong  Bahru who mentioned that $4,000 had  to  be

paid  before a man could tender. Sir, I would like

him  very  much to bring the matter up to  me  and

give me all the necessary details in confidence if

he can. I will say that if he were aware of it, it

was  his duty as a public-spirited citizen to have

gone  to the Anti-Corruption Branch of the  Police

and  informed them. He can still do so if  he  has

not  done yet or he can come to me and give me the

information in confidence and I will pass  it  on;

but  if  he does not like that, he can go  to  the

Anti-Corruption  Branch and  lay  his  information

there. I will be the happiest man to see that  all

such business - if there is such business - should  be

stopped.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Check the records of the

Police.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I can give one assurance

that  his  name will not be divulged, if the  hon.

Member  lays  his  information  before  the  Anti-Corruption Branch.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we come to the main cause for the

stockpile. The Member for Bukit Panjang said  that

perhaps the Minister for Commerce and Industry was

afraid of a war breaking out. He said that it  was

unlikely that a war should break out in this  part

of  the  world because the neighbouring  countries

have  no  time  for wars and that they  were  busy

about their own economy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Famous last words!



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Perhaps, the hon. Member has

forgotten the day when we were all asleep  on  the

morning of the 8th of December, 1941, and at about

4  a.m.,  we suddenly heard explosions and  rushed

out to see what they were. Some of us thought that

it  was just anti-aircraft firing and some thought

of  other things. Others took it seriously, and so

on.  So  there is no saying when a war  can  break

out.  In  the sick position that the world  is  in

today,  Sir,  it is presumptuous on  the  part  of

anyone to prophesy when war



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1340</b></font><br><br>



is or is not going to break out. It is the duty of

a   responsible  Government  to  see  that  if  an

emergency does take place there is provision  made

for  feeding the masses. Sir, the Member for Telok

Ayer and probably others were fortunate enough -



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> To run away.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> -to have had the opportunity

to  go  away when war broke out here in 1941.  The

general  population of Singapore, Sir,  could  not

get  that  opportunity. I was  one  of  those  who

stayed here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I too.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I saw what the plight of the

people  was then. Sir, just before the  war  broke

out,  I  understand, certain essential  foodstuffs

were  stockpiled  and it was this stockpile  which

stood  us  in  very good stead for the  first  few

months   when   there  was  no  organisation   yet

immediately after the Japanese occupied Singapore.

During   this  period  of  disorganisation,   that

stockpile laid by a colonial Government  stood  us

in very good stead. Now, I have seen what happened

after  that. I have seen the pathetic look in  the

eyes of children who had to eat ubi kayu (tapioca)

and who could not get sufficient rice. I have seen

miserable  men and women lying on the street  like

skeletons  because they developed beri  beri  when

they  could  not  get rice. Sir,  those  who  went

through  that  experience, I  am  sure,  will  not

grudge  but, in fact, will support that Government

should  provide  for a future emergency,  in  case

there is one, especially when the merchant is  not

paying  but the consumer is paying for it and  for

whose  benefit this insurance against  the  future

is.  If  they do not, Sir, and they vote for  this

motion  and if there is an emergency when supplies

are cut off - this can happen, without the producing

countries  being occupied by Communist powers;  it

may  be  due to lack of shipping that our supplies

may   be  lessened - it  will  be  a  crime  against

humanity  when you find those little children  and

mothers  going about with a hungry look  in  their

eyes.  Of course, the richer section of the public

will have stockpiles of their own in their homes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1341</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have here an authoritative report on the

supply position and I will quote from it. I am not

able   to  divulge  the  source  but  it   is   an

authoritative  report and I give  that  assurance.

Regarding Burma, it reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was still not known what proportion of the

expected export quota of 1.6 million tons would go

in  barter trade with Communist countries; but  it

appeared that supplies of Burma rice coming on  to

the  free world market in 1957 would be scarce  in

relation to demand."



<br><br>Now,  that is without a war intervening.  So,  you

can  have  a  position where  supplies  run  short

because some countries suddenly buy more than they

had expected. We had the case when Japan came into

the  market to buy 200,000 tons of rice early this

year. They did not buy that much, but there was  a

case  in  point.  Indonesia  might  suddenly  find

herself  short  and buy a big quantity,  in  which

case, there will be a run on rice on the producing

countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I ask hon. Members not to treat this as a

Party   issue.  This  is  a  matter  of   national

importance, of importance to the people to provide

for  their future and therefore it is a matter  of

importance  to Members irrespective of which  side

of  the House they sit in. If they want to provide

for  the  future of the masses, as the Member  for

Telok  Ayer  said,  then  I  say  that  he  should

withdraw  his  motion or they should vote  against

it.  If they think only in a short-sighted way for

today and not care for tomorrow, it is up to them.



<br><br>3.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very

happy  to  hear  the  Minister  for  Commerce  and

Industry  reminding us that we  should  not  treat

this issue on a party basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the lengthy speeches from both sides of

the  House,  I think the arguments fall  into  two

classes.  One,  we  look at it from  a  commercial

point  of  view, and, two, we look at  it  from  a

military strategy point of view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to talk from the commercial point of

view.  The mover of the motion made it very  clear

that  the  stockpile of rice policy will not  only

make the taxpayer suffer but also the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>



masses.  On  this  point, I do  not  know  if  the

Minister   for   Commerce  and  Industry,   as   a

buinessman, can say whether it is true or not that

the  outcry  to  abolish the stockpiling  of  rice

comes  only  from the merchants in the Telok  Ayer

area  and  not  from  the public.  Not  long  ago,

certain   quarters  which  did   not   deal   with

foodstuffs   or   belonged  to  any  organisation,

printed  literature  to  reach  every  leader  and

Assemblyman  seeking  his  support  to  press  the

Government  to abolish this stockpile policy.  The

basic reason is that Singapore, as we all know, is

an entrepot city and there is free competition. We

experienced rice rationing during the reoccupation

and  when  the price became more stable, rationing

was  abolished together with food control in  1953

or  1954 - I am not sure when it came about. So  the

reason  why the Government abolished food  control

two   or  three  years  ago  was  that  Government

believed  in  free enterprise to  bring  down  the

actual  price  of  rice,  and  I  wonder  why  the

Government cannot maintain the same confidence  in

the  policy of free enterprise to bring  down  the

price  of  rice. So, from the commercial point  of

view,  I  am  sure the Minister for  Commerce  and

Industry, who was a businessman before, will admit

that  if the stockpile policy is dropped, the cost

of  imported  rice will be reduced because  of  the

many  extra charges added. We have also heard  the

serious  charge  that was made by the  Member  for

Tiong Bahru that a certain amount of money has  to

be  paid  in order to ensure a successful  tender.

This smells of corruption. Therefore, in order  to

put  this  on a more practical basis,  the  trader

should be given the chance to show that with  free

enterprise in the trading of rice, there will be a

reduction in price. The Minister for Commerce  and

Industry  said  the  traders refused  to  give  an

assurance that a certain amount of rice  would  be

stocked by them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a press cutting dated 4th December, 1956.

The statement was issued by the then President  of

the  Rice Importers Association, Mr Teo Han  Sun.

On  one  item, it says that the authorities insist

that for three months'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>



local consumption, there has to be a reserve of at

least  25,000 tons. The Rice Importers Association

did  try many a time to give an assurance  to  the

authorities   to  that  effect.  The   Association

President   also  pointed  out  clearly   to   the

Government  that the actual stock of rice  in  the

godowns  of Singapore was always more than  25,000

tons   of   rice,  which  was  required   by   the

Government.  I wonder whether or not the  Minister

for  Commerce  and Industry has looked  into  this

assurance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I want to speak from the military point

of   view.   If  we  have  faith  in   our   great

neighbouring countries - and we like to call  India,

China,   Thailand   and  Indonesia   our   brother

countries - why should we suspect that all these big

brothers are going to bully this small brother? So

the  whole thing rests on the tradition  that  the

question  of  our  external defence  and  external

relations  still lies in the hands of  the  United

Kingdom Government. This is the atomic age and yet

we  base our strategy on the fact that this island

must  have a certain amount rice stocked  for  the

people: how many infantries are required to defend

this island; how many battleships to guard our sea-coast.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think this is the right time for the

elected   Government   to  make   this   important

point - that   in  this  atomic  age  the   military

strategy of the United Kingdom is not to think  in

terms of submarines, battleships or even an atomic

bomb, but the feelings of the local people. If the

local   people   support  the   United   Kingdom's

strategy, then I think that even a stock of  three

months' foodstuffs is not sufficient to carry  on.

But  the  local people do not share that point  of

view.  We  must take this opportunity to show  our

Asian-African spirit, that we have  faith  in  our

Asian  and  African brothers who, for years,  have

suffered under imperialistic rule. War could  only

possibly  come  from  this  side  because  it   is

suspected  that  we have been influenced  or  have

been  infiltrated  by  the  Communist  forces  and

therefore  there is a possibility of war  breaking

out  at any moment, as has been pointed out by the

Minister for Commerce and Industry. But I  do  not

think



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1344</b></font><br><br>



that  the local people, especially the man in  the

street, can understand this, and I wish to ask our

intelligent   leaders  in  this  House   why   the

Americans,  in  recent years,  have  rapidly  lost

popularity  among our Asian nations. Why?  Because

the  Americans  talk of war the  whole  time,  war

everywhere and military bases everywhere. How much

support do they think they can seek from the Asian

and  African  people? Sir, so from this  point  of

view,  why  has the Government not the courage  to

tell  Whitehall?  "The people  of  Singapore  have

faith  in their own destiny. We do not think there

is  going to be any war now at all. We believe  in

peace  and co-existence." If we can get away  from

the  influence of the United Kingdom, I think  the

question  of stockpiling will be much  easier  for

the Government to think of.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after saying all this, I must say that I am

in  no  way  opposed  to this  motion,  but  I  do

sincerely suggest to Government that (1) it should

abolish  the stockpile policy, and (2)  it  should

seek  an assurance from the rice importers whether

it  is  true  that  they can  satisfy  the  United

Kingdom  strategists' demands, and  (3) ,  that  it

should  drop its plans for the time being and  see

whether  the  price  of  rice  will  increase   or

decrease. This will prove to the people  that  the

Government  is  sincere in  its  concern  for  the

welfare of the people. Sir, I wish to repeat again

what  the  Minister for Commerce and Industry  has

said,  that  this issue must not be treated  as  a

party  issue  but  as  a  national  issue  in  the

interests of the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Masses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Masses. So I take this

opportunity, not as a champion of the  masses,  to

repeat  what the masses really think, and that  is

that  during the Japanese occupation,  they  could

purchase  rice  at eight cents per katty  although

stocks  were  insufficient  and  the  simpleminded

citizens  cannot understand why they have  to  pay

much  more now when we have assured them that this

Government   is  far  better  than  the   Japanese

military  government.  So,  Sir,  Government  must

carefully consider this issue which is a  national

one.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1345</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, everybody

seems  to  be  concerned over the welfare  of  the

people,  whether the people will be able  to  have

their rice the next day and whether they are going

to  pay a cent less or a cent more. In fact,  that

is most commendable.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> However, the method of

approach seems to me that one set of people  think

about  it  in the form of a Government  guarantee.

Other  people  think  that  we  can  provide  that

guarantee without Government's interference.  Now,

let  us see. We have been having our stockpile for

a  long  time.  Let us see what  are  the  reasons

behind it. The first reason is that if there is  a

war  or an emergency, then where are we to get our

rice  from?  The second reason for stockpiling  is

that if there is black-marketing in rice, then  we

must  stop  the  merchants  from  exploiting  that

situation.   Of  course,  the  third  reason   for

stockpiling  may be similar to the stockpiling  of

rubber in America which is needed as a sort  of  a

buffer.  If the price should rise, then they  push

out  a  little bit of the rubber to put the  price

down,  and so on. It will keep down prices at  the

correct level to their advantage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I certainly feel that the third reason is

out  because  Government has never tried  to  keep

prices down in favour of the people but allows the

price to go up or down as the market dictates.  So

that reason is out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on the second one about the control of

rice,  probably stockpiling and rice control  will

be  necessary during the war years when there will

be  a  shortage of supply. According to the  usual

laws  of supply and demand, prices will go up when

there  is  a  shortage of rice. Price control  and

distribution  become  necessary  during  emergency

years.  But the balance has already swung over  to

the other side and today we find that there is  no

shortage  of  supply. In fact, supply  is  greater

than demand. I have never heard of China exporting

rice before but today she seems to be able to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1346</b></font><br><br>



export  rice to Ceylon. Thailand, after  the  war,

was still short of rice but today, she seems to be

offering  rice to everybody and so is Burma  which

is  trying to offer her surplus stock. Ceylon  too

is trying to trade with other countries and trying

to barter her rice for something else. Now we have

plenty  of  rice  all around and because  of  this

situation, the price of rice in a free market must

necessarily come down. Here is where price control

can  stop, and the usual way of supply and  demand

be  allowed  to  work  for the  advantage  of  the

people. Of course, if there is a further glut, you

will  find that the merchants are willing to  sell

their  goods  even  below cost.  That  will  be  a

greater advantage to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us come back to the first reason which

is  said to be the most important, and that is, we

must  have  a stock to tide us over any emergency.

We  agree  with  that. I would  like  to  ask  the

Government how Hongkong manages this. They have  a

stockpile but I think the merchants are  giving  a

helping  hand  there. In Singapore, I  have  heard

from  the Minister for Commerce and Industry state

that  a few years ago, the traders were approached

by  the  Government  about the question  of  being

responsible  for  a stockpile  of  rice  and  they

refused  to  undertake this task. Sir,  ideas  can

change. We know that the Government has changed  a

lot of its ideas and plans all along and merchants

also  are  privileged in the same  way  to  change

their plans. During the last few days, I have been

around in the market to find out the position, and

I  was  pleasantly surprised to find that quite  a

number  of merchants were willing to carry stocks.

This  question can certainly be investigated into,

and  if  they  are willing to carry  stocks,  then

stockpiling   may   be  done  by   the   merchants

themselves. Perhaps, in order to help the  public,

Government  may  still extend the  same  offer  of

capital  and godown space for the stockpiling  and

keep  a check on the actual amount of rice in  the

godowns.  If that can be done, it will save  us  a

lot  of  trouble. But, of course, when  Government

thinks about giving anybody any responsibility,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1347</b></font><br><br>



it   must   also  think  of  giving   them   some

privileges,  because privilege and responsibility

always go together.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> To put a flag on a car!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Yes, there must always be

responsibility with privilege and vice versa.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> On a point of

clarification,  Sir. What does  the  hon.  Member

mean  when he referred to Hongkong? Does he  want

the  Government to form a ring of rice  merchants

of  a  limited  number  with  a  monopoly  as  in

Hongkong?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I am not a Member of the

Government  and  I  will  save  the  trouble   of

cracking  my  head  over this  question  but  the

Government should be able to think out as to  the

best  way of doing it. I am giving the Government

the  idea  that  there  is  the  offer  from  the

merchants.  You have the material in  hand,  make

the best use of it!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us turn our attention to other

commodities. We all say that rice is imported and

that  it  is the staple food. Yes, rice  is  most

important  but without rice, there can  still  be

other  substitutes  and such substitutes  may  be

found in flour and other grains-



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Tapioca.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> - and even tapioca. I

suppose many people have tasted tapioca



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> A long time ago.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> - a long time ago and they

still  live,  otherwise quite a  number  of  them

would not be sitting here.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> M and B pills.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Perhaps. But I am thinking

of  flour. If rice is important, if there  is  no

substitute  for rice and if the whole country  is

going  to  starve because there is no  stockpile,

why  can  we not have another stockpile of  flour

also? This is easier to store and would be a very

good  substitute for rice. Of course, the reasons

are obvious. It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>



is in the hands of the expatriates and not in the

hands of the local people, and therefore that may

be a good excuse-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Do you prefer flour to

rice?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> - for leaving flour out of

control?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Do you prefer flour?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> You may say that it is

silly  and that this is not in your line, and  so

on; but, I say that it was the colonial policy to

control  everything - even the rice business  which

was  not  done by them during the period  of  the

British Military Administration.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Are you a member of the

P.A.P.?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I am not a P.A.P. member. I

am  only stating a truth. Those are facts. Nobody

can deny those facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see how Government control and how

Government stockpile have helped in doing  things

that are against the interest of the people. As a

matter  of  fact,  Government is  never  good  at

trading.  Whatever  they do, they  always  pay  a

higher  price  than the price  paid  for  by  the

merchant  and  even if the price  paid  were  the

same, you will find that a lower grade of rice is

usually  shipped to them. All in all, the  people

will be paying



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Ayer crossed the floor.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Hon. Members must not cross

the floor unnecessarily.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I just-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it on a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Thank you. My friend has

given  me a little note and he is still  on  this

side of the floor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Government has never been good in trading

and  no  matter  what Government  does,  it  will

always get a raw deal from hardened businessmen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Even from the Opposition.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1349</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> if there is control, you

will  find that price goes up all the time.  There

is  always loss of weight during transhipment, and

when goods come in and out of godowns. I think the

Government cannot deny that, and usually you  find

that  the grades of rice may not be as they should

be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that this motion is a justifiable one and

I  agree  with my colleague that if  it  had  been

proposed  by  Members on the opposite Benches,  it

would,  in all probability, be applauded and  said

to  be  good motion; but, in this case, it happens

to  be proposed by a Member of the Opposition  and

it  must  be  treated  as not  so  good!  If  the

Government  had such an intention at  heart,  then

let  it openly agree to no further stockpiling  of

rice. If the Government thinks that stockpiling is

necessary, then keep this stockpile throughout its

life.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> On a point of explanation, Sir. The

hon. Member thinks that he supports the motion.  I

think  he  said  just now that he also  agrees  to

having  a stockpile. I am not quite sure which  he

means.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I said that, "if the

Government  thinks that a stockpile is necessary".

Sir, I have had the privilege of being interrupted

so many times.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It is confusing, is it not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Yes, they are doing their

best  to confuse the people in order to have their

own way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand too that the Government tries to

operate  this  business on a no  profit,  no  loss

basis,  in a case like this, Government may  think

that  it  is  operating on a no  profit,  no  loss

basis. Every time it buys stocks, it will sell out

at  the same price at a later date to the merchant

who  buys it. If the price happens to be low,  the

merchant  buying it will benefit hut  the  benefit

will  not be passed on to the public; if the price

is  high, the public will suffer because the extra

will  be added on to the price by the merchant.  I

feel  that in a matter of stockpiling and  control

of  any  goods,  the best way to go  about  it  is

either control it fully, or not control it at all.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1350</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague will probably be answering

questions  put  by the Minister for  Commerce  and

Industry  and  I  will leave him to  wind  up  the

debate.



<br><br>4.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the number

of  times  reference has been  made  to  the  word

"masses"  leads me to believe that  there  may  be

elections this year after all. Sometime last month

when  I referred to the "masses", I was criticised

for being preoccupied with the lumpen proletariat.

But now, I have respectable company in the use  of

the  word  "masses" in the Member for Telok  Ayer,

the  Member  for  Tiong Bahru,  the  Minister  for

Commerce  and  Industry, the Member for  Serangoon

and  the  Member for Changi. We get more and  more

respectable as we go along.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two facets to this problem of the

stockpile.  I promised the Member for  Telok  Aver

that  I would keep an open mind till I have  heard

both sides and, like a good judge, I have tried to

keep an open mind although my colleague the Member

for  Ponggol-Tampenis  (Mr  Goh  Chew  Chua)  had

already  more or less decided what should  be  the

right  stand. On the one side is the  question  of

the efficient running of the stockpile. The Member

for  Tiong  Bahru (Mr William Tan) has  mentioned

the mysterious figure of $4,000 paid by importers.

And  another Liberal-Socialist Member has lectured

about  how middlemen can make profits on even  one

graphite  pencil.  If anyone  seeks  the  road  to

personal happiness and prosperity, well, join this

Party.  We  have  been told that  the  middleman's

profit   is   a   wicked  thing   and   from   the

distinguished merchant, the Member for Telok Ayer.

He says. "It is a wicked thing. We must get rid of

the  middlemen." And I was wondering at that  time

whether  he had already left the Liberal-Socialist

Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had the astonishing suggestion that if rice

were  freed, meaning not that controls are removed

but that stockpiles are abolished, its price would

stabilise itself automatically. I am not sure what

it  means.  All I know is that no price is  static

unless it is controlled. It will move up and  down

according to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1351</b></font><br><br>



supply and demand. We are asked to believe that it

will   stabilise  itself  automatically  for   the

benefit of the masses. Sir, if we are convinced of

that,  then,  of course the People's Action  Party

which  the Member for Telok Ayer has congratulated

for  representing  the people will  vote  for  his

motion.  Unfortunately, I am in some doubt whether

if the stockpile were removed, it would be not the

masses who would benefit but the merchants.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Of Telok Ayer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> We were told that the

stockpile was needed for the contingency of a  war

or an emergency. I suggest to this House that even

without  a war or an emergency situation, one  may

have  all  kinds of temporary shortages  of  rice,

either genuine or man-made, which may boost up the

price  of rice. If there is this buffer, then  the

opportunities for windfall gains will be denied to

the  merchants in the Telok Ayer division  because

the  Government  being a benevolent  and  paternal

guardian  of  the  people  will  sell  from  their

stockpile and not make the windfall gains. By  the

time  the  Liberal-Socialist  Party  so  earnestly

urges  that  the  benefit of the  masses  will  be

brought  about by the free operation of  merchants

and  middlemen, there must be something, - I  would

not  use  the  word  "fishy",  Sir:  it  might  be

unparliamentary  to use such a word - I  think  that

there must be a catch in it.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, there is a short point

arising  out  of  the speech  of  the  Member  for

Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong) and also the speech

of  the  Member for Changi (Mr Lim  Cher  Kheng).

They  say that merchants have stated recently that

they  are prepared to guarantee the stockpile  but

they have not stated that what they want, as their

pound  of flesh, is a monopoly of the trade.  That

is what was meant by the Member for Serangoon when

he  said  that  with responsibility you  must  get

privileges. What he is asking for is that in order

that  the  rice trade can be responsible  to  look

after the stockpile,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>



it  must be given the privilege of exploiting  the

consumers. The Member for Serangoon said that rice

is  not the only food for which we should pile  up

stocks  and that there are other commodities  like

tapioca  and  flour, and yet he blamed,  shall  we

say, the Colonial officers, for having too much of

a  say  in the stockpiling of rice. If they really

had a say, Sir, I think they would rather have had

a  stockpiling of flour instead of rice,  so  that

they  could train us in the Western way of living.

The  Member for Serangoon also said, "Well, we can

eat  tapioca",  and the Member for  Tanjong  Pagar

(Mr  Lee  Kuan Yew) said, "Perhaps,  everyone  is

thinking that there is an election coming soon and

maybe  the Liberal-Socialists can have as  one  of

their   election  banners:  'Join   the   Liberal-Socialists and eat tapioca.'"



<br><br>4.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  we,  who have  lived  through  the

Japanese occupation, know what distress was caused

when  rice  supplies were short and how  labourers

could  not  work  unless their  cup  of  rice  was

assured to them. No amount of Japanese money could

tempt  them  to  work unless a  cup  of  rice  was

guaranteed  to  them.  Sir,  the  lessons  of  the

Japanese  occupation do not  seem  to  be  of  any

concern  to the Member for Telok Ayer. Of  course,

this is to be expected because being a rich man he

could  afford  to  make  his  escape  before   the

Japanese came in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy</b> rose-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it on a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, this is personal. I am not

a rich man. May I tell him that?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon. Member wishes to

rise  on  a  point of order, he may do so.  If  he

wishes  to rise on a point of explanation, he  may

also do so but in the latter case, the hon. Member

holding the floor must first give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Sir, we who remained behind

know how the poor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1353</b></font><br><br>



people suffered then and I am therefore determined

to   see  that  they  do  not  undergo  a  similar

experience  again so long as we are able  to  help

them.  Are  we sure, Sir, that if the  Member  for

Telok  Ayer who represents the rice importers  has

his  way and when the stockpile is abolished, that

our  poorer classes of people will not suffer  and

also  that the importers will not raise the price?

At  any  rate,  Sir, the cost  of  upkeep  of  the

stockpile comes to a little more than one  cent  a

katty. If the stockpile is abolished, are we  sure

that the wealthy rice importers who are members of

the same kongsi will not raise their prices? It is

because  Government  has a  stockpile  that  these

merchants can be kept under proper control and  if

they  try to raise the price, naturally Government

can  release from the stockpile and keep the price

under  control. Sir, it is quite natural  that  if

the  stockpile is abolished, those who will be the

first  to suffer are the poorer classes of people.

The  poorer people pay one cent more per katty for

the  stockpile  of  rice but what  is  this  extra

charge  compared with the higher prices that  they

will  be  forced  to  pay  if  the  stockpile   is

abolished?  I am surprised, Sir, that  the  Member

for  Telok  Ayer  who belongs  to  a  Party  which

believes in fair slices of the political cake  for

all  should now want to increase the larger slices

of  the  rice  importers and  reduce  the  smaller

slices of the poorer section of the people.  This,

Sir,   is   not  Liberal-Socialism.  It  is   only

exploitation of the poor man and unworthy  of  any

Party with a seat in this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> On a point of clarification,

Sir.  May I say that it is not one cent per  katty

that  a consumer pays? The stockpile price is  one

cent  dearer which is reflected, when they  import

two  katties of free rice, to work out to  half  a

cent on the consumer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy</b> rose-



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> In reply?



<br><br>4.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> In reply, Sir. Mr Deputy Speaker. Sir, I will deal first with the Member

for  Ponggol-Tampenis (Mr Goh Chew Chua). Let  me

tell



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1354</b></font><br><br>



him  and those who heard him that I am not talking

on  behalf  of the merchants. Also let  him  state

what is his idea of a rich man - $1,000, $1 million,

$10  million  or $50 million? My definition  of  a

rich man is a man beyond want - I hope he learns  in

his old age.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> How much have you got?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> If the contention is that this

commodity should be controlled in the interests of

the  masses, may I ask the Government why  control

only this commodity?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I was amused to hear the Nominated

Member,  Mr  Richard  Lim,  a  race-horse  owner,

talking  of Socialism. I was glad that  the  other

Nominated  Member,  Mr Francis  Thomas,  did  not

touch  on  the technicalities but only in general.

My reply to him is that if he cares at all for the

masses, then there are so many other things  which

the  Government can control in the interest of the

masses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not replying to the Member for Tanjong

Pagar  (Mr  Lee  Kuan Yew), who  thinks  that  he

represents all the masses but he is mistaken. What

I  said was that it was not in the interest of the

merchants but the masses. If he can endorse it, it

is all right. If he does not, it is his look-out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, it seems that the Government is

unrepentant  and  I told you the reason  why.  The

Minister  for Commerce and Industry touched  in  a

lengthy  way on so many matters. I will deal  with

them  one by one. I dealt with rice from the  time

when he was not yet born.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> He has learned a lot since.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> It seems that he has learnt

many  things in the regular school of his colonial

friends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he made reference to my being a Member of

the Executive Council and the Legislative Council.

I  cannot divulge anything as I was under oath  as

an  Executive Council Member and I have not  taken

any advantage of any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1355</b></font><br><br>



secrets  I know, in this debate, but let  me  tell

him  and others that when we were there, we  tried

our  level best and succeeded as far as  we  could

till the present Coalition Government took charge.

He  also made mention of my not being here  during

the   Japanese  period.  I  left  on  6th  or  7th

February,  1942,  when the Japanese  just  entered

Singapore and I had to leave because of my  public

position which I held then, and the thought that I

might not be safe. With good luck, I returned  and

I found him clotheless, foodless, penniless, and-

<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Mr  Deputy  Speaker:</b> That  is  not  a  point  of order. Carry on, Mr R. Jumabhoy.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker. I am not

casting  aspersions on anybody but  I  am  stating

actual  facts  and  he should  be  proud  that  he

remained  honest in that period. He did not  amass

money as many others did.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Mr  Deputy Speaker:</b> Order, please. I think  that

would be out of order. Will the hon. Member please

continue, avoiding making such references?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> May I not, Sir, make a

statement of facts?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Mr  Deputy Speaker:</b> Not in  the  way the  hon. Member has done.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> It is not casting an aspersion

at  all;  it  is  a credit to him.  Now,  Sir,  he

touched on the export trade of rice saying that it

is  still going on in the same way. This is  quite

incorrect.  Singapore  may  import  the  rice  and

forward it to the Federation, but in fact this  is

not  re-export in the real sense of  the  term.  I

mean, we used to re-export big quantities in those

days  to  Ceylon, India and Africa and  not  small

quantities like five tons to Ceylon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1356</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has not made any point at all to

defend its policy of a strategic stockpile for  an

emergency. I say that there is no emergency or the

threat  of war in this part of South-East Asia.  I

believe  the  Minister also  mentioned  about  the

Japanese attack. Yes, those days have now  passed.

Whom  do  we fear now in South-East Asia?  If  the

Government  can prove that there will  be  a  real

emergency  or  an attack, well, that  is  quite  a

different matter but the Government has not proved

it  at  all.  We  were only told  of  sad  stories

happening   during  the  Japanese  occupation   of

Malaya.  We  know all that. That is  nothing  new.

What I want to ask is whom are we afraid of now?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be very interesting to know what is the

total  tonnage in the stockpile and  what  is  the

total  tonnage sold to dealers? The Minister  made

reference  to  the honesty of the rice  merchants!

Only  recently, he was a merchant and he  can  ask

himself that question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, prices will always adjust according to

supply  and  demand. On the other hand,  the  rice

dealers are willing to have a minimum quantity  of

stockpile, not in Government godowns but in  their

own  godowns  which can be checked  from  time  to

time. A solution can be arrived at very easily, if

it is found that they can manage it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much was said about the cost of half a cent or

one cent more to the consumer. May I point out  to

the  People's Action Party that if a family of ten

pays  half a cent or one cent more for a katty  of

rice,  how much would it cost them monthly? Is  it

not in the interest of the masses that they should

pay less?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point was also made that it is not the

merchant who suffers but it is the consumer. May I

ask  why  should the consumer suffer at  all?  The

consumer  should  not  suffer  because   of   this

stockpile or control of the rice trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was also told that there is no control of rice

imports.  What else can you call it  if  a  person

wants  to import rice which he can import, but  he

has  also to buy rice from the Government  in  the

ratio of one to two? If this is not control,  then

what do you name it?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1357</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A point was made that by stockpiling, the

Government  is  not  incurring  expenses  for  the

running of the department, it works out like this:

taking from one pocket and putting it into another

pocket.  It comes to the same thing. My  point  is

this.  Whether  you charge it to  revenue  or  you

suffer a loss or you charge the merchant extra for

taking  your tonnage of rice in proportion to  his

imports, ultimately the consumer pays. The  object

of  my  motion  is  that the consumer  should  not

suffer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have covered almost all the points

in  reply  and I will urge the Government  and  my

friends on this side of the House to vote for  the

motion.

<div align="center"><b>DISSOLVED UNIONS</b></div>



<br><br>4.58 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I move the motion standing in my

name, namely,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House is of the opinion that

legislation be introduced to protect workers whose

interests  may  be  adversely  affected   by   the

dissolution of their unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 5th December, 1956, I brought the attention of

the  House  to  the  fact that some  35,000  trade

unionists  are  facing the possibility  of  having

their union dissolved because of the folly of some

of their officials.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the position is serious because there are

in  existence, so far as the Singapore Factory and

Shop   Workers'  Union  is  concerned,   some   50

agreements  with employers. Unless some  provision

is  made for these contracts to remain valid after

the  dissolution  of  the union,  it  is  doubtful

whether these contracts can be recognised  by  the

employers after the union's dissolution. With  the

disappearance of the union, the contracting  party

disappears,  and  some kind of provision  must  be

made  to  prevent  the  workers  from  losing  the

benefits of these agreements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is very little to add. The issue is

simple.  I  have, however, had the benefit  of  an

informal discussion with the Minister for  Labour.

I do not wish to prejudge what will happen when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1359</b></font><br><br>



the  Registrar of Trade Unions holds his  enquiry

with regard to the missing funds of the union. If

the Chief Minister will give an assurance in this

House  that  the matter will be considered  after

the decision of the Registrar of Trade Unions,  I

will withdraw this motion till a later date.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

rise to second the motion and reserve my right to

speak later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in

view  of the line taken by the hon. mover of  the

motion, I would like to say this. The Factory and

Shop-workers' Union is the only union now  likely

to   be   dissolved,  but  dissolution  will   be

completed only if the union fails to show cause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the Member for Tanjong Pagar said

that  he  is  willing  to  withdraw  this  motion

pending   the  result  of  the,  shall  we   say,

dissolution  proceedings that are at the  present

time  being  taken  against this  union,  I  will

therefore  not  touch  at great  length  on  this

motion.  But there is one point I would  like  to

make  clear,  Sir. I find that  I  am  not  in  a

position to support the motion as worded but I do

sympathise  with  him  in  regard  to  the  fears

expressed  by him on the conditions of employment

that  have been matters of contract between  this

union  and the employers in Singapore. I  am,  at

the  present time, Sir, exploring the feasibility

of setting up machinery for the better observance

of  wage  contracts, and I would assure the  hon.

Member that the point that he had discussed  with

me   informally  before  this  sitting  will   be

thoroughly investigated and I will do whatever  I

can  to see to it that if the points are possible

of protection, the Government will do all it can.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg

leave to withdraw this motion for debate today.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Have I the assent  of  this

<div align="center"><b>PROFIT-SHARING BETWEEN EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEES</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(MALAYAN AIRWAYS LIMITED)</b></div>



<br><br>5.03 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, I

move the motion standing in my name which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House supports the principle of profit-sharing between employer and employees and urges

Malayan  Airways Limited to share 15 per cent  of

their  accumulated net-profits with their workers

at the end of their 10-year franchise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members in this House know that since 24th

December  last  year,  members  of  the   Malayan

Airways  Local  Employees'  Union  have  been  on

strike  for a goodwill bonus claim to be paid  at

the end of the company's ten-year franchise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I urge the merits of this claim on the

House,  I  would  like  to  give  the  House  the

background of this dispute. First, the  facts  of

the  company's position: Malayan Airways  Limited

is  a  company with $2½ million capital running

internal air services in Malaya and Borneo  on  a

franchise  given  by  the Malaya/Singapore/Borneo

Governments.  In other words it is  a  Government

monopoly  given  to the company.  Of  this  $2½

million  capital, $1½ million is owned  by  the

Straits Steamship Company Limited, about $500,000

is  owned  by some shipping company in  Liverpool

and the rest by Mansfield and Company Limited and

a  few  other private individuals. From  a  share

capital  of  $2½ million, the  company's  books

today show that it is worth $7¼ million. In the

meantime, the company has been paying profits  at

approximately three per cent per annum. The union

has  been able to obtain accurate figures of what

the  company considers its capital to  be  worth,

and these figures have not so far been challenged

by the company. But the union says that there has

been  a great undervaluation of the assets; that,

in   fact,  the  accumulated  profits  plus   the

original  capital amount to much more than  $7½

million.  For instance, the union says  that  the

aircraft



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1361</b></font><br><br>



- eleven Dakotas - are now book-valued at $81,000 and

by  the end of the franchise, each Dakota would be

valued  at $1, whilst motor-vehicles owned by  the

Company  are  valued at $184,000. If one  were  to

look  purely  at the accounts of the company,  one

might  be  led  to the conclusion  that  it  is  a

transport   company,  not  an  airline.   However,

members  of  the union, who are in a  position  to

know  the  price of Dakotas say that  each  Dakota

would  cost somewhere around $300,000, not $8,000.

Let  us assume that it is not as high as the union

pitches  it  but that it is somewhere  around  say

$100,000. Even at that figure, the company is  now

worth  about  $10 million from a capital  of  2½

million.  In  the years 1951 to 1956, the  company

paid  the  following  dividends:  1951,  $105,000;

1952, $140,000; 1953, $140,000; 1954, $52,500;

1955,  $70,000 and 1956, $175,000 and  these  were

out  of profits made from 1951 to 1956 as follows:

1951,    $1,128,000;   1952,   $l,823,000;   1953,

$1,318,000;  1954,  $201,000; 1955,  $345,000  and

1956,  $1,407,000. Now, Sir, it may be claimed  by

the  company  that they risked their capital - their

$2½ million - to make these profits  and,  having

paid  their  workers the wages they contracted  to

pay   them,  a  bonus  is  therefore  out  of  the

question.  The union's claim is that  the  company

should  pay them one month's salary for each  year

of  service; they have helped to make the  company

these profits; without them, the company's capital

would not have produced these profits. In the boom

years  of  1951 to 1953, when the union approached

the  management for bonuses - and bonuses were given

by  all good employers then who were cashing in on

the   boom - the  company's  reply  was  that  these

profits  were  being accumulated to  purchase  new

aircraft  so  that, at the end of  the  franchise,

there   will   be  better  aircraft  and   further

employment  provided for union  members.  At  that

time,  sister  companies of Malayan Airways,  like

Mansfield  and  Straits  Steamship,  were   paying

bonuses. Malayan Airways was the one company  that

never paid any bonus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in July 1956 it was announced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1362</b></font><br><br>



that  the major shareholders of the company  would

not  wish  to  retain their shareholdings  in  the

company  and  were selling out. It  was  announced

also  that  the  management of the airline  would,

although still in the name of Malayan Airways, be,

in  fact,  vested in B.O.A.C. The union approached

the  Managing Director of the Company in September

last  year,  on two occasions, the  12th  and  the

27th,  and  asked  the  management  if  they  were

prepared  to  consider the payment of  a  goodwill

remuneration  to  the  employees  for  their  past

services  to  the  company. The Managing  Director

then  replied  that  he was  not  opposed  to  the

payment  and went as far as to discuss the various

ways  and means of distributing payment. He agreed

that  the union should put in a formal claim.  The

union  did  this on 17th October. Later the  union

notified  the company that if the company insisted

on  refusing  to  consider the  payment  of  their

claim,  the  union would have to  consider  taking

action.  There  was  a final meeting  between  the

union  and the company on 18th December. The union

asked  for  an assurance from the Management  that

consideration would be given to share with the men

at  the  end  of  the franchise a  part  of  these

accumulated  profits, which  are  hidden  away  in

written-off assets. Four Directors of the  company

were  present. They were evasive and they  refused

to  give  any assurance whatsoever. All they  were

prepared to say was that if, at some time  in  the

future,  they were in a position to make any  such

statement,  they  would,  but  it  depended   upon

whether  they would be getting this new franchise,

whether  they would be getting a good  price  from

B.O.A.C., and oh so many other factors. The  union

and its members were not prepared to wait for some

indefinite  reply at some indefinite future  date.

As the franchise was running out, they took strike

action. They decided to take strike action on  the

20th and took strike action on the 23rd and 24th.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, what does all this come to? It is a

fight against an employer who has, showing on  his

books,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1363</b></font><br><br>



accumulated reserves out of profits of  $2,850,000

in   cash.  They  said  it  was  to  purchase  new

aircraft.  They  have other assets which  together

with  this  $2,850,000  total,  according  to  the

company,  $7½  million  but,  according  to  the

union,  at  least  $10 million.  In  other  words,

having  paid approximately three per cent dividend

every year, it has quadrupled its capital and  now

proposes   to   sell  out,  i.e. those   of   the

shareholders who want to sell out, to B.O.A.C. or

such  other purchasers as the Government may  come

to terms with for a new franchise. The union says,

"Give  us  one  month's  pay  for  every  year  of

service."   This  would  amount,   including   all

expatriate  staff, to $1¼ million, approximately

15  per cent of the accumulated profits - hidden and

shown profits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if Malayan Airways were an ordinary

commercial  company,  this  might  be  termed   an

unusual claim; although in certain countries  like

Japan,  at the end of every year, unions negotiate

with  employers for bonus payments on the  showing

of the past year's transactions. But there are two

features  which  make Malayan  Airways  a  special

case.   First,   it  operates  on   a   Government

monopoly - a  franchise.  No  person  can  open   an

airline  to  compete with it, and the  Member  for

Cairnhill  (Mr Marshall) will know how,  when  he

urged on behalf of Nanyang Airways the opening  of

another competitive airline, it met with strenuous

objection  from  Malayan Airways Limited;  and  no

competition  was  allowed. Second,  the  Hon. the

Chief Minister will remember that when he asked  a

question in the Legislative Council then in  March

1954,   he  was  informed  by  the  then  Colonial

Secretary   that  the  Government  had  subsidised

Malayan Airways to the tune of $850,000. These are

two  extraordinary  features  which  take  Malayan

Airways  out  of  the  ordinary  run  of  European

concerns in this country. First, it operates on  a

Government  franchise - a monopoly; second,  it  has

received  subsidies from the Government.  If  this

House  has  the right to discuss the  question  of

whether subsidies



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1364</b></font><br><br>



should  be  paid to this company, to  maintain  an

internal  airline,  I submit this  House  has  the

right, to urge this company to share 15 per  cent

of its accumulated profits showing in the books of

the  company,  with  its local  employees - $7½

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first half of my motion may, to

orthodox Socialists, sound very conservative. In a

mild motion, I urge,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House supports the principle of profit-sharing between employer and employee."



<br><br>In  more politically literate countries, employers

have discovered that if they want to preserve  the

free enterprise system, they had better offer  the

workers a greater share of the profits, and profit-sharing  is,  in fact - and I repeat  this  for  the

benefit  of my Liberal-Socialists who sit on  this

side  of  the House - a principle advocated  by  the

British  Conservative Party in order  to  preserve

British  Conservative  Party  members'  interests.

There  is nothing revolutionary in this principle.

It is just a method by which you keep your workers

contented.  Those in favour of violent revolution,

of  course, oppose this policy. It is a retrograde

step  because  it  tends to make the  workers  get

involved with the interests of the management. For

instance, if you get a "good" employer like  Henry

Ford who gives you shares in the company you begin

to  have  an  interest in the profits the  company

makes,  and the class conflict weakens.  You  will

not  be  fighting  the employer but  you  will  be

working  harder to make profits for  the  employer

and  for  yourself. So, it will be interesting  to

know whether our local Conservative Party, namely,

the Liberal-Socialists, support this principle, as

I  am  urging them to do. If they do that, I would

like to know further whether, as a logical outcome

of  that, they would urge Malayan Airways - I am not

saying we are compelling Malayan Airways; all I am

asking  is an opinion, the opinion of the  elected

representatives  of the people  of  Singapore - that

they consider that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1365</b></font><br><br>



15  per cent of the accumulated net profits of the

company should be shared with the workers  at  the

end  of the 10-year franchise. That, in brief,  is

the issue. The union are still on strike and they,

in  my opinion, have made a morally just claim. It

may  not  be a claim that one can enforce  in  any

court  of  law,  but it is a fair  and  reasonable

claim.  The company has made these profits out  of

their labour and has never paid any bonus for  the

past  ten  years  on the grounds that  they  were

accumulating  these profits to buy  new  aircraft.

Furthermore,   every  year,   when   the   company

complimented its workers by a notice on the notice-board,  it  drew attention to the  fact  that  all

these profits that they were making were, in fact,

to  ensure  the  happiness and employment  of  the

employees because the company could then carry  on

with new aircraft. Sir, the management, I am told,

is  alarmed at the principle, not because, in this

particular  case,  it  is  an  unjust  claim,  but

because  the  Directors of the  company  are  also

Directors of other sister companies connected with

Malayan   Airways,  such  as  Straits   Steamship,

Mansfield, and so on. But unlike Straits Steamship

and  Mansfield, Malayan Airways is  in  a  special

position  with  regard to this  Assembly.  If  any

Liberal-Socialist is frightened  of  keeping  away

foreign capital, may I remind them of this: we are

concerned here with British capital employed on  a

Government  monopoly, in which the Government  had

thought fit to subsidise by the year 1954 the  sum

of  $850,000. If we could do that surely we can do

more for its workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a way, this particular dispute spotlights a

much  wider issue - namely, that after the  transfer

of  political  independence from  the  British  to

Malayans,  will  come  the  question  of  economic

independence.  I would not like today  to  discuss

generally  the  question of foreign investment  in

Malaya,  but  I would ask this House  to  make  it

quite clear that if foreign capital comes to  this

country  to  operate  Government  monopolies   and

expect  security  not  only of  capital  but  also

against losses, and are paid subsidies by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1366</b></font><br><br>



the  Government against losses, then  it  must  be

prepared   to   adopt  a  liberal   profit-sharing

attitude towards its workers. I urge the House  to

support my motion.



<br><br>5.23 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I rise to

second  the  motion. Malayan Airways  Limited  was

formed  in  1947 with a paid-up share  capital  of

$2½   million  and  a  10-year  franchise.   The

franchise   ends   this   year   and   the   major

shareholders,  Mansfield and Company  Limited  and

Straits  Steamship, are selling out  their  shares

this  year  to  the B.O.A.C. On the company's  own

figures,  Malayan  Airways started  with  a  share

capital  of  $2½ million and had on  April  1954

assets valued by the company at $7,300,000.  Among

the  assets  included in the  $7,300,000  are  the

eleven  Dakotas of the company valued at  $81,512,

that  is  about $7,500 for each Dakota  plane.  In

spite of this absurd undervaluation of its assets,

the  company's  figures show an  increase  from  a

share  capital of $2½ million to over $7 million

worth of assets. The net profits earned by Malayan

Airways over the six-year period from 1951 to 1956

alone amounts to over $6 million. Other commercial

firms also made large profits over this period but

many  of them paid bonuses to their employees.  It

is  well known, Sir, that employees in the  rubber

industry were paid large bonuses in 1951 and 1952,

especially  by  local  employers,  but  when   the

employees approached Malayan Airways in  the  boom

years  for a bonus, their employer, while agreeing

that  the workers should get a bonus, claimed that

they  were setting aside the profits for  reserves

to  buy  new  aircraft and equipment. The  workers

accepted  this  explanation and have  received  no

bonus whatsoever from the beginning of the company

till now. The company has not, in fact, bought any

new  aircraft.  The accumulated  net  profits  are

still  there for reserve and now that the  company

is selling out, the workers feel quite justly that

a  small  proportion of these  profits,  which  in

other commercial firms would have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1367</b></font><br><br>



distributed  to  the workers and  which  were  put

aside  by the Malayan Airways for reserve,  should

be  paid  to them. The workers helped to make  the

profits. This principle of sharing a part  of  the

profits is recognised in all good local commercial

firms. A bonus of one month's salary, Sir, for one

year  is nothing exceptional in commercial  firms.

In  the case of Malayan Airways, no bonus was paid

to  the  workers on the pretext that  the  company

would  have  to purchase expensive aircraft  which

were never, in fact, bought.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the franchise is coming to an end, to

give 15 per cent of the accumulated profits to the

workers  who  made the profit for the  company  is

only fair and reasonable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the motion

before  the  House is divided into two parts.  The

first  is  in regard to the principle  of  profit-sharing  between employer and employees;  and  the

second part is in connection with the claim of the

local employees of the Malayan Airways Limited who

are now out on strike.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in regard to the first part of the motion,

the  principle of profit-sharing between  employer

and  employees, it has been said by the  mover  of

the motion that it was a Conservative Party device

to   retain  workers  to  remain  loyal  to  their

employers.  Sir,  it  is the view  of  many  trade

unionists that the most important aim is to secure

adequate  regular  wages  and  salaries  for   all

workers.  According to their view,  profit-sharing

and  bonuses  after  the requirement  of  adequate

wages  has  been  met,  are  really  matters   for

employers  to  decide.  If they  choose  to  offer

bonuses as additional inducement to their workers,

everyone will applaud it, though some shareholders

may  have  reservations.  Sir,  the  position   in

Singapore   with  regard  to  profit-sharing   and

bonuses  is  undoubtedly  complicated  by  Chinese

custom. The Chinese New Year bonus has become,  in

Chinese  firms  and  also  in  many  other  firms,

hallowed by tradition, and it is because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1368</b></font><br><br>



of  this  tradition,  and  only  because  of  this

tradition,  that  the Government  is  prepared  to

support the first part of the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the second part, Sir, which

refers to the claim of the local employees of  the

Malayan  Airways  Limited, since  my  return  from

London only a fortnight ago, I have endeavoured to

bring about a settlement of the strike. I have met

the  employers  five or six times, and  the  union

representatives,  Sir,  also  about  five  or  six

times, but in spite of all my efforts, I feel that

I  have to say in this Assembly that I do not  see

any possibility of a settlement. My frank view  is

that,  Sir, if the workers will return to work,  I

will give an assurance that the Government will do

everything possible to secure for them a  suitable

token  payment by the employer at the end  of  the

franchise period. I feel, Sir, that if they  would

go back, it would strengthen my hand in my further

discussions  with the employer. I would  therefore

urge  the  hon. mover of the motion to advise  the

union that it is in their best interests to return

to  work  immediately  on my  assurance  that  the

Government will do everything possible  to  secure

for  their members a suitable token payment at the

end of the franchise period. I have, Sir, a letter

which  I  will  be sending to the  union  to  this

effect,  and I repeat again, Sir, I hope the  hon.

mover   of  the  motion  will  advise  the   union

accordingly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of what I have said, Sir, it is clear

that  the  Government can only support  the  first

part  of the motion and cannot support the  second

part for the simple reason that there is a dispute

on.  I am not saying anything about the merits  or

the  demerits  of  the strike in order  to  pacify

feelings on either side. I feel, Sir, there  is  a

solution  to  this strike, and  that  is  for  the

workers  to  listen to my plea  that  they  should

return  to work in their own interests and in  the

interests of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore beg to move an amendment to the

motion,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out all the words after the word

"employees" appearing in the second line.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1369</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The amendment is in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Thank you, Sir, I have

already  said  all that I wanted  to  say  on  the

subject.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  rise to second the amendment and  reserve

the right to speak at a later stage in the debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original Question was,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House supports the principle of profit-sharing between employer and employees and urges

Malayan  Airways Limited to share 15 per  cent  of

their  accumulated net-profits with their  workers

at the end of their 10-year franchise."



<br><br>Since  which an amendment has been moved to  leave

out  all  the words after the word "employees"  in

the second line. The Question now before the House

is,  "That the words proposed to be left  out,  be

left out."



<br><br>5.39 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at

the  last sitting of the Legislative Assembly  the

Government  and  its supporters on the  Opposition

side of the House were only too glad to shower the

fantastic   sum  of  $23  million  on  prematurely

retired   expatriate   officers.   This   was   in

recognition of the services they have rendered and

would  have  rendered had they stayed on.  In  the

case of the Malayan Airways Local Employees Union,

the  sum  involved is, compared with the abolition

bounty, a mere flea-bite; but I wonder how many of

those  who  voted  for  the spectacular  abolition

bonus would have trembled at the thought of having

given  a  mere million as goodwill bonus to  local

employees.  We  shall no doubt be  told  that  the

demand  of  the workers for a small share  in  the

profits   the   Malayan   Airways   Limited    has

accumulated   during  the  last   six   years   is

unreasonable  and  not  in  accordance  with   the

commercial  practice. But is  the  demand  of  the

Malayan Airways workers unreasonable?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the facts. Malayan Airways is a

private   limited  company.  It  has  had  virtual

monopoly  of air transportation in Malaya.  It  is

not surprising that this lucrative monopoly should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1370</b></font><br><br>



have  been  handed over to the British  controlled

firms  like  the Straits Steamship Company  (which

holds   $1,500,000  of  the  issued   capital   of

$2,500,000),  the  Ocean  Steamship   Company   of

Liverpool (which holds $545,000 worth of  shares),

and  B.O.A.C.  (which holds about  $545,000).  The

rest  is held by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking

Corporation and a few private individuals. Malayan

Airways  is a big British business and the  former

colonial  Government was very conscious  of  this.

Between 1947 and 1953 the Government helped  these

private firms with considerable subsidies.  I  beg

to  quote  from  the hon. mover  of  the  original

motion  that  the  present Chief  Minister  should

recollect  the  answer given to  him  in  the  old

Legislative Council by the then Colonial Secretary

in March 1954. This is what the Colonial Secretary

then said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Between 1947 and 1953 Government subsidy to

Malayan Airways amounted to over $850,000."



<br><br>That  was  presumably  goodwill  payment  to   the

shareholders  of  Malayan Airways.  That  was  all

right  by the Government. That was sound business.

That  was all right because of the services  which

the  shareholders were rendering in this  country.

Let  us not, however, be misled into thinking that

Malayan  Airways  was  living  a  hand  to   mouth

existence. Between 1951 and 1956 the net profit of

the  company totalled about $6 million;  but  even

more  important is this: this Company, which began

with  a share capital of only $2,500,000, has,  on

the   basis  of  its  old  conservative  estimate,

exceeded  three  times the value of  its  original

share  capital.  It  is  a debatable  point,  Sir,

whether  the shareholders of the Straits Steamship

Company, the Ocean Steamship Company of Liverpool,

and  the shareholders of the Hongkong and Shanghai

Banking Corporation contributed anything by way of

labour  and skill to treble the assets of  Malayan

Airways.  But  what  cannot  be  doubted  are  the

decisive  contributions made by the  employees  of

Malayan  Airways towards increasing the assets  of

the  company; and what is not in doubt also is the

fact that Malayan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1371</b></font><br><br>



Airways has made profits which during the last six

years it never once shared with its employees.  At

least many other private firms in the colony  have

shared their good fortune with their employees  by

way  of  a yearly bonus; but not Malayan Airways - a

private  company  enjoying not only  the  monopoly

protection from the Government but even subsidies.

But   now   the  company  is  to  sell   out   its

shareholdings at its present enhanced  value.  The

workers  are  naturally resentful  that  only  the

shareholders  of the Straits Steamship  and  their

friends should share out among themselves  the  $3

they  would  get  for every dollar they  invested,

this in addition to the dividends they have got so

far.  In  other  words, Sir,  not  only  will  the

shareholders get back their $2,500,000 capital and

enjoy  dividends during the last  six  years,  but

they will, when they sell out, have a million more

as  profit  from  the sale. All that  the  Malayan

Airways employees are asking is that a small  part

of  this  profit from the sale should be  siphoned

off  to them. After all, it was their efforts  and

skill  and  not  those of the  shareholders  which

increased the value of the company. All  that  the

workers  are asking, Sir, is for a small share  of

what  would  have got into one of the small  side-pockets of the British capitalist company.



<br><br>5.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do

not actually oppose the motion, as amended, if the

granting   of  bonuses  by  employers   to   their

employees means profit sharing



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The motion has not been

amended  at the moment. We are still dealing  with

the amendment.

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I understood the hon. Member to say

"the  motion,  as  amended".  It  is  really   the

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir. I am

speaking  on  the amendment. Sir, I  cannot  agree

that the question of entitlement arises. I do  not

deny  that  profit  sharing  may  exist  in  other

countries on a mutually agreed basis between



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1372</b></font><br><br>



employer  and  employee but  not  as  an  accepted

practice,  which  seems  to  be  what  many  local

employees  want.  Sir, local companies  have  come

under  a  great  deal  of  fire  from  politicians

recently  and I think I will take this opportunity

of  saying  something in their defence.  They  are

singled  out for dishonourable mention because  of

their  splendid profits. I say "splendid  profits"

because  I  do  not think it is possible  to  make

excessive profits except when monopolies exist.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> This is a monopoly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> But what on earth can be wrong

with making good profits? It is what the companies

are  in  business for and most of them  have  very

little to feel ashamed of in their records. Indeed

many  of  them  can be very proud of  the  balance

sheets they present, revealing, as they do to  the

initiated,   a  record  of  good  management   and

stewardship.  If  they were bad  employers,  there

might  be  some cause for complaint, but they  are

not. Many of them are, in fact, model employers.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Perhaps I did not make

myself  very  clear. We are now  on  an  amendment

which urges that the following lines in the motion

be left out:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"and urges Malayan Airways Limited to share 15

per  cent  of  their accumulated net-profits  with

their   workers  at  the  end  of  their   10-year

franchise".



<br><br>We  are  now concerned merely with Malayan Airways

Limited. It appears to me that the hon. Member  is

probably  speaking  on  the general  principle  of

profit sharing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> I am afraid I was, Sir. It is my

fault.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member will have an

opportunity  later  on  to speak  on  the  general

principle of profit sharing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>5.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

disappointed to see that in a House of 25  elected

representatives, other than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1373</b></font><br><br>



two  P.A.P. Members, one Independent and the Chief

Minister  who cannot escape from having to  speak,

no  stalwart representative of the people has  had

the courage to declare his stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I started speaking on this motion, I had

every  intention  of  pitching  my  speech  in   a

moderate  tone.  I did not wish to  embarrass  the

Government because the Government may have certain

intentions as to the franchise it will grant after

this  one expires. I did not wish unduly  to  give

grounds  for  criticism that, on an occasion  like

this,  I took the opportunity to slosh up European

capital  in  general. But I am  disappointed  that

when this Assembly is asked to express its opinion

as  to what a company should do with regard to its

employees  on accumulated profits, it should  have

nothing to say, though in the past the Legislative

Council  thought  fit  to  give  $850,000  of  the

people's money to Malayan Airways Limited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all like foreign capital provided it is fair

and  just. It has not been fair and just. In  this

particular case it has been very unfair  and  very

unjust.  The  risk  of loss was minimised  to  the

barest minimum-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) By the monopoly:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) By subsidies from the Government.



<br><br>It  is  now  going to continue - God knows  for  how

long - but I hope the present Government will honour

the  pledge given by the last Chief Minister  that

the franchise will be debated in this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do not know what role European capital

is  going  to play in this country after  merdeka.

The  Economic Bank Commission did not  think  that

many  European investors would want to  come  into

South-East Asia, and they said so in their report.

We  do not want to chase away the European capital

that  is already here. But we would like to remind

European  capital,  particularly  those  companies

dependent  on government monopolies and  goodwill,

such  as  the Singapore Traction Company  and  the

Malayan Airways Limited, that if its purpose is to

make profits on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1374</b></font><br><br>



the basis that it had been making in prewar years,

then it will come to a sorry end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways in which European capital

comes to an end in Asia. One, as in India where it

took  in Indian capital with it and gradually went

into  partnership with Indian capital; and with  a

benevolent government, no exploitation  of  Indian

workers  is allowed. Second, it comes to a  sticky

end,  as  it did in Shanghai and Tientsin and  the

other  China  ports.  It was  not  a  question  of

sharing profits there. It was a question of paying

for  the  exploitation they had done in the  past,

until  finally, quite legally and quite  properly,

the  Government  of the Chinese People's  Republic

squeezed  the last ounce of capital out  of  these

foreign companies and drove them out of China.  We

do  not want to do that here, but we would like to

remind these companies that unreasonable attitudes

towards  their  workers, bad  working  conditions,

poor  wages and the desire to get the most out  of

the  workers will lead to a situation  which  will

make it very difficult for them to do business, as

most  people  would like them to do  business,  in

this  country, but on terms fair and just to local

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I oppose this amendment to my motion and I

deplore the fact that the Government did not  have

the  courage to declare its stand. That it did not

do  what  it  wants to do, namely, to endorse  the

workers'  claims because it knows it is just.  The

Government  has  the  power, in  the  granting  or

withholding  of  the  franchise,  to  support  the

workers' claims. The Chief Minister has given  the

assurance that he will do everything in his power.

Sir,  if the Chief Minister means that, then I  am

confident there will be a settlement, because  the

Chief  Minister and his Government have the power.

It  is  quite  true  that  his  is  not  the  only

government   involved  in  this  franchise,   that

Malayan  Airways can, presumably, ply between  the

Federation  and  Borneo and bypass Singapore,  and

move its operational headquarters to Kuala Lumpur.

But  I should hardly think many people would  want

to fly to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1375</b></font><br><br>



Kluang  or  Johore Bahru. If the  Chief  Minister,

with  this knowledge that the franchise is  coming

up,  gives the assurance, in all seriousness, that

he  will do everything possible to secure for  the

union - not  quite  the words that the  union  would

like,  "a  suitable token payment" - but a fair  and

just portion of these accumulated profits, then at

least   the  workers  would  not  say   that   the

Government - a "Labour" Government - sold them out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot tell the Chief Minister what the union

will  do  with regard to the plea he has made  and

the letter which he proposes to send. For my part,

I  would  be more satisfied if the Chief  Minister

would confirm, in full knowledge of the powers  of

the  Government in this matter, what he  has  said

that  "if  the  workers will return to  work,  the

Government   will  do  everything  possible   (the

operative words are 'everything possible', because

a  lot  of  things  are possible  with  regard  to

Malayan Airways Limited) to get a token payment at

the  end  of the franchise." If that is confirmed,

for  my  part, I will try my best to get his  plea

answered.  I would remind the Chief Minister  that

600  men, most of them local-born (40 per cent  of

them   English-educated  and   the   rest   Malay-educated),  are involved and they will not  forget

this  assurance.  If this is meant  seriously  and

taken  seriously,  there should be  a  settlement,

because the Government has the wherewithal to  see

that there is a settlement.

legal adviser of the union who can speak and speak

well  on their behalf; but there is nobody to meet

the other side if the other side, in fact, has any

reasonable defence, which is not admitted. But  it

is  unfortunate,  Sir, that this  type  of  motion

should  be brought and this Assembly be  made  the

forum  for discussion of disputes current  outside

this  Chamber  and  thereby biasing  their  proper

negotiation  procedure. But whilst  I  understand,

sympathise and support the attitude adopted by the

Government from the point of view that  it  cannot

accept  a motion which interferes with the  normal

procedure for negotiation and which seeks to  bias

negotiation, I would like to say for myself that I

find  myself in complete sympathy with the second

part of the motion moved by the Member for Tanjong

Pagar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malayan Airways has had a monopoly. I believe

the monopoly was an illegal monopoly - the point  is

not  now  in issue. It has had it and although  we

were very near to challenging the monopoly in  the

court,   unfortunately  that  challenge  was   not

pursued.  But the important thing to recognise  is

that  when a government grants a monopoly, whether

legal or otherwise, and when a company receives  a

franchise for monopolistic services, the  emphasis

is on service to the people of the country. Now in

fairness  to Malayan Airways it has given  service

to  Malaya  a  hundred  per  cent  free  from  any

accident.  That is a magnificent record.  But  the

service  has not been efficient from the point  of

view  of the excessive fares they charge and which

they  could extract, because they are a  monopoly.

The  service has not been efficient from the point

of  view  of excessive profits - repeat,  excessive

profits - that they make, and their service  is  not

efficient  in  that, having made  these  fantastic

profits  over the years, they do not  see  fit  to

give a portion thereof to the people who work  for

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, socialism, of which I am not a pandit but

which  I seek to understand, as a basic philosophy

tries  to obtain a minimum adequate for the decent

livelihood of a human being and compatible



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1377</b></font><br><br>



with  the  fact  that  he is a  human  being.  The

emphasis  is always on salaries and conditions  of

service.  Bonus as such does not come in,  but  it

has  been recognised over the years that where  an

employer has more than a modest profit, it is only

right  and  proper,  as  an encouragement,  as  an

inducement,  and also as part of its  humanitarian

duty to its employees, to share those profits. But

the  conduct  of Malayan Airways is inhuman.  They

are  gorged and bloated with profits year by  year

and  they cannot and will not pay just that little

which  even  commercial companies, with commercial

morality   (or   immorality)  in  this   territory

pay - even banks have the decency to pay bonuses  to

their  staffs. Why should Malayan Airways, with  a

monopoly granted by the people of this country, be

permitted  to  act as Scrooge? Why should  Malayan

Airways  seek to refuse what is a moral obligation

now  recognised  by every decent company  in  this

country? Year after year it makes profits. Not one

year  does  it give just one month's salary  which

every   reasonable   employer   has   learnt    is

traditional  and  fair  in the  treatment  of  its

employees. I would like to say, Sir, that though I

support this amendment, I support it with a  heavy

heart  on the basis of the principle that  motions

of  this  character should not be brought  to  the

House   in   order  to  bias  proper   negotiating

machinery,  but  my  whole sympathy  is  with  the

Malayan Airways employees - and may they win!



<br><br>6.03 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, before I speak on this

amendment, I wish to answer the remark made by the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar that he was ashamed  to

observe  that only his P.A.P. clique had dared  to

touch on this controversial issue and champion it.

I  wish  to point out, Sir, that while the  Member

was  moving his motion, I was not here  because  I

had  a  very urgent appointment elsewhere,  but  I

tried  to  rush  back in time  to  speak  on  this

debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I take a keen interest in this issue

because  I  fight for the principle of the  thing.

The Chief Minister has divided the motion into two

parts -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1378</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It appears to me that the

hon.  Member is speaking on the general principle,

but  at the moment we are debating whether Malayan

Airways  Limited should be urged to share  15  per

cent of their accumulated net profits. If the hon.

Member will speak about that, he will be in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, actually I wish to

oppose  the amendment and I will say why I  oppose

it.  As  I have said, Sir, the Chief Minister  has

divided  the  motion into two parts - that  I  fully

agree. The Chief Minister is quite contented  with

the  first part and maybe it can win the  approval

of this House, even of the Opposition. But, Sir, I

think  it is wrong in that the Government  has  no

courage  to comment on this issue, whether  it  is

right  or  wrong. The principle of profit  sharing

between  employer and employee, according  to  the

main speaker, derives from a Chinese tradition -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think if the hon. Member

will  assume that the principle is accepted,  then

we  can go a little faster. He can assume for  the

moment  that  the principle has been accepted  and

debate the second part of the motion, namely:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House urges Malayan Airways Limited to

share 15 per cent of their accumulated net-profits

with  their  workers at the end of  their  10-year

franchise."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I will make it short, Sir. I

am  sure  the  House agrees with the principle  of

profit sharing between employer and employee.  The

various  Parties in this House have  put  this  in

their  programme. So to me it seems  rather  silly

and  a waste of time to debate this. To the people

of  Singapore,  this makes no  sense  at  all.  By

tradition,  the employer shares his  profits  with

his employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I oppose this amendment because I do not

think  this is the right time to introduce it.  If

this  House has no power to compel an employer  to

share  his profit with his employees, what is  the

use  of  our  coming to this Chamber and  debating

this  issue? It is a waste of time. Sir,  I  think

the mover of the amendment has not the courage  to

face the issue. I also fully agree with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1379</b></font><br><br>



Member  for Cairnhill that an issue  like  this

should  not  be  debated in this  Assembly  but

should  be  debated  at  a  public  forum.  The

passing  of  this motion in this Assembly  does

not  carry  any  weight at all at  the  present

time,   even  the  passing  of  the   amendment

supporting  the  principle  of  profit  sharing

between  the employer and the employee,  is  it

doing any good at all?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must rule the hon.

Member completely out of order. If he wishes to

speak  on the principle, he will have  to  wait

until  we  have disposed of the amendment.  The

amendment  is  merely to leave  out  the  words

relating to Malayan Airways Limited sharing  15

per cent of their profits.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I am sorry, Sir. In

conclusion, I would like to say that  I  oppose

the   amendment  because  it  is   at   present

impracticable.



<br><br>6.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

Singapore today we are all agreed I think, that

profit-sharing is recognised as being right. We

will  examine how companies share their profits

in  Singapore. I will quote cases which I  know

are prevailing in Singapore



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Point of order, Mr Speaker,

Sir. Is  the  hon.  Member  speaking  on   the

amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I take it the hon. Member is

going   to   relate  profit-sharing  in   other

companies with Malayan Airways.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Absolutely, Sir. I was

saying just now, Sir, that in Singapore we have

profit-sharing. Let us take Market  Street,  as

an  example. There a large number of  companies

are  run  by Hokkiens. They put in capital  and

they  manage the business. Every year they find

out  how  much  net profit they make  and  they

usually  divide it up this way: 80 per cent  of

the  profit will go to those who invest in  the

business. 10 per cent of the profit goes to the

managerial  staff, and the balance  of  10  per

cent to the labour force.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1380</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then along Circular Road and the New Bridge

Road  area, every year they allow at least  one

or two shares out of 12 shares of the profit to

be  given  to the employees. In other areas  in

Singapore the percentage ranges from 5 per cent

to  25 per cent. As a matter of fact, Sir, even

if  a  company makes no profit at all  and,  in

fact,  is running at a loss, that company  will

still  have to give a little bonus in the  form

of  angpows. Sir, this has been the practice in

the  East  for a very long time. However,  with

European firms they prefer to calculate it on a

salary   basis.  Many  companies   give   their

employees one month's salary as a bonus.  Other

companies  are more generous. I have heard  one

or  two  companies have given  their  employees

something like six months' salary as bonus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all these cases, Sir, the bonus is not

given  at  a  fixed rate. A bonus is  a  matter

between the employer and the employee. There is

a  dispute  today. I think Malayan Airways  are

morally bound to give their employees a  bonus.

How  much  it  should be, I am not prepared  to

say.  If  they are not generous, they  will,  I

suppose,  earn  a  not  so  good  name  as   an

employer,  if  they  are  more  generous,   the

employees  will be more grateful and  will  co-operate with them more. But for us to prejudice

the case and say that they should only give  15

per cent and not 20 per cent or 25 per cent  or

even 10 per cent - that, I think, is wrong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Make it more if you like.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I suggest that the

employer   and   the  employees   should   come

together. A bonus must be given, but  how  much

we  will  not  say because we do  not  wish  to

prejudice the dispute.



<br><br>6.16 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support  the  amendment moved by the  Hon. the

Chief Minister. He has ably explained that,  by

tradition, the companies do give bonuses and we

agree with him on that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill rightly

pointed out that this type of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>



motion  should not be brought before  this  House.

The  reason  is this: how can we, without  knowing

the  facts advanced by both sides, pass  a  motion

that  so much should be paid to so and so?  It  is

impossible for us to pass judgment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in sympathy with the employees of Malayan

Airways  and  I  am glad to note  that  the  Chief

Minister  has given an assurance that he will  try

to settle the dispute amicably.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the leader of the P.A.P. always quotes

India.  I wonder whether he follows what is  going

on  in  India.  What I know is that he  constantly

quotes  India.  One Indian company  works  on  the

basis of sharing profits between the employer  and

the  employee. Does the hon. Member know that this

is  done  voluntarily  and  not  as  a  result  of

legislation? India is advancing towards  socialism

and doing it in a very liberal manner



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> That is why you are a Liberal-Socialist!



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Exactly! India is not forcing

the  issue  but doing it in a way which suits  the

country, and she is not doing it by legislation or

making empty speeches. So let me point out to  the

Member for Tanjong Pagar that he should follow the

Indian example which he is always quoting.



<br><br>6.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise also

to support the amendment to the original motion on

the  question of principle. It is not  within  the

province  of this Assembly to interfere  with  any

dispute that is going on in Singapore between  the

employer and the employee



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> But we can give $850,000 away.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> It is not within our province

to  put pressure on any party to a dispute, be  it

in favour of the employer or the employee. When  a

dispute arises and negotiations are going  on,  we

here  in this Assembly can only svmpathise  and  I

think in this case all of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1382</b></font><br><br>



us  are  in great sympathy with the employees  of

the Malayan Airways, but



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Say so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> I do say so, but it is

another proposition altogether for us to approve a

motion  to  request Malayan Airways to come  to  a

settlement  with  its employees, particularly,  as

the Member for Telok Ayer has pointed out, we have

only heard one side of the story.



<br><br>6.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> By way of explanation, Sir.

I  know  I have no right to reply on an amendment,

but  by  way of explanation, I should like to  say

this.  The Member for Tanjong Pagar has  asked  me

whether  I  meant what I said, Sir. I always  mean

what  I say in this august gathering, and I repeat

what  I  said: if the workers will return to  work

immediately, I will do everything possible to  see

to  it  that they get a suitable token payment  at

the end of the franchise.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> On a point of information,

Mr   Speaker,  Sir.  From  the  Chief  Minister's

statement,  Sir. Why must the Chief Minister  wait

until  the workers go back to work before  he  can

settle this dispute?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, in moving my amendment

to  the  motion earlier on, I said that I had  met

the   employers  five  times  and   the   workers'

representatives also five times, and I  feel  that

if I keep on meeting them again, there could be no

possible  solution. I said my frank view was  that

if the workers would return to work immediately, I

think I could do something.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Stop the franchise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, "That the words proposed to be

left out, be left out."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Division, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Clear the Lobbies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment accordingly agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Main Question, as amended, proposed, "That this

House  supports  the principle  of  profit-sharing

between employer and employees."



<br><br>6.29 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before

this House went into a division just now, I really

believed  in  the sincerity of the  mover  of  the

motion  in that he was acting in the interests  of

the  people, especially for the workers. But, Sir,

the  motion  seems to me now to be a Party  issue.

The  mover  of the motion has an eye  on  the  600

votes,  because  I see the Malayan  Airways  union

leaders   are   present  in   the   gallery   now.

Opportunist leaders speak in this House on  issues

in  order to win the support of the people, but  I

feel  I  must discharge my duty to the people  and

say this. When the debate was going on just now, I

thought that the whole thing was a farce, that all

this debate was just a waste of time. Although the

motion  says  that  this House urges  the  Malayan

Airways  to  give 15 per cent of their accumulated

profits-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We have finished with

Malayan  Airways  Limited,  and  are  now  on  the

principle  of profit sharing. If the  hon.  Member

agrees with this, he can say that he does. If he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1384</b></font><br><br>



does   not   agree,  he  can  speak  against   the

principle.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I am against the

principle   of   sharing   profits   during   this

transitional period. We are still under the  Crown

and  this  is still the Colony of Singapore.  Sir,

the  Chief Minister said not so long ago  that  we

are going to fight for merdeka, a merdeka which is

only    for    self-government   and   not    even

independence. The fight for merdeka  has  come  to

the stage



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Question now before the

House  is, "That this House supports the principle

of profit-sharing between employer and employees."

Will the hon. Member confine himself to that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I am sorry, Sir. But the

principle is still there. We have not yet come  to

the  stage  where we can frame policy  and  compel

employers  to  share  their  profits  with   their

employees.  Although I support  the  principle  of

this   motion - the  first  part  and   the   second

part - wholeheartedly. I think that it is introduced

at  the  wrong time and not in the right way.  The

motive  of  the mover of the motion is  not  truly

fighting for the interests of the people. It is to

seek the 600 votes from-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That, of course, is imputing

an  improper motive to a Member of this House.  It

is completely out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I am so sorry, Sir. Can I

say  his Party then? The Party which seeks to move

this motion is not sincerely seeking a solution to

this controversy between Malayan Airways and their

employees. I say this is not the right  time.  For

example,  I know a legal firm called Lee  and  Lee

and  I  wonder  whether the  proprietors  of  this

company  are  sharing  their  profits  with  their

employees  at this time. I think the principle  of

profit sharing at the moment is out of place, Sir.

Sir,  to  me the point at issue is whether Malayan

Airways has been given a monopoly



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon. Member does not

keep in order, I will have to request him to stop.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1385</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, in view of the many

difficulties  crossing my path,  I  will  not  say

more.  However, I give my sympathy to the  workers

of Malayan Airways. I support the actual intention

of  the  motion, but because of the motive  behind

this  motion and in view of the present situation.

I beg to oppose the motion.



<br><br>6.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after

hearing  the  speech by the Member for  Changi,  I

must confess I do not know whether I am sitting or

standing!  I  cannot  understand  why  he  is  now

opposing this motion, even on principle. One thing

I do agree with him, however, is that the original

motion as framed by the leader of the P.A.P. does

appear to be meant as a vote-catching stunt.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have ruled that out

already.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> I apologise, Sir. I do confess

that  I  have  been  confused by  the  Member  for

Changi. By supporting the motion as it stands  now

after  it  has  been  amended, however - "That  this

House  supports  the principle  of  profit-sharing

between  employer and employees" - we are, in  fact,

supporting the claims of the employees of  Malayan

Airways,  and  definitely  all  Members  here,  by

expressing  their  approval and  voting  for  this

motion, are  in  fact telling  all  employers  in

Singapore   that  they  approve  their  generosity

towards  their employees. After all. Sir,  profit-sharing is actually a bonus and is something  that

has  to  be  given  freely,  to  be  given  as  an

inducement   for  the  employee  to  give   better

service,  and it must be left to the  employer  to

judge  at  the end of the year the performance  of

his  employee  and  how much  he  has  contributed

towards the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1386</b></font><br><br>



success of the business in making profit for  that

year.  To  attempt to legislate  for  any  profit-sharing between employer and employee would  be  a

very  wrong  move  and I am quite  sure  it  would

frighten away capital from this already frightened

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore, Sir, have pleasure in supporting the

motion  as  amended and I am quite sure  that,  by

supporting the motion, this House will go very far

towards  helping in a settlement of  this  unhappy

dispute.



<br><br>6.39 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the

amendment  was proposed. I was surprised  to  hear

from  the  leader of the P.A.P. that the  Liberal-Socialists did not support the principle of profit-sharing  between  employer and  employee.  Sir,  I

think the hon. Member knows full well that one  of

the platforms of our Party is that there should be

profit-sharing between employer and employee.  But

I am a little surprised to hear that the P.A.P. is

adopting this attitude, because their attitude,  I

think, was "Down with capital!" and anything  that

has to do with capital must be destroyed. This,  I

think,   is  a  change  for  the  better   and   I

congratulate the P.A.P. for coming round  to  this

moderate line which we have been taking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of profit-sharing, I think it is

important  for all employers to realise  that,  in

order  to  make  greater profits,  there  must  be

greater  goodwill towards their employees, because

then the employees will respond favourably towards

such  treatment, work harder and make more  profit

for  the employers. If employers try to be  stingy

and  grudge a fair share of their profit  for  the

employees,  then  they will  be  faced  with  such

things  as go-slow tactics, and finally, a  strike

which  will  bring  no  benefit  to  either  party

whatsoever. Employers

giving a share of their profits as an incentive to

their  employees,  employees  working  harder  for

their employers - all this will create a much better

situation.  This  motion, I  think,  deserves  the

support  of  every right-thinking  person  and  we

support it, as amended, unreservedly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Main Question, as amended, "That this House

supports  the principle of profit-sharing  between

employer and employees," put, and agreed to.
