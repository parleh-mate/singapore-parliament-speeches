<div align="center"><b>NANYANG UNIVERSITY GRADUATES</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Recruitment into Government services and Government and Government-aided secondary schools)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Lin You Eng</b> asked the Minister for

Education  in  1962 (a)  how many Nanyang  University

graduates  were  recruited (i)  into  the  Government

services  and  (ii)   to  teach  in  Government   and

Government-aided secondary schools; and (b)  how many

graduates were rejected in each case.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I suggest

to  the  Member for Moulmein that the first part  of

his  question "how many Nanyang University graduates

were  recruited  into Government services  in  1962"

should  be  addressed to my colleague, the  Minister

for  Finance,  who will, I am sure,  be  pleased  to

supply the answers when the question is put to him?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Nanyang University graduates appointed to

teach  in  Government and Government-aided secondary

schools in 1962, the answer is 98. The breakdown  is

as follows:



<pre>



  Government secondary schools		  26



  Government-aided secondary schools      72



</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number not selected for teaching appointments

in   1962  was  62.  However,  53  others  who  were

considered  suitable for teaching appointments  were

put  on the reserve list for 1962 pending vacancies.

Of  these,  29  have  since been appointed  to  fill

vacancies in 1963.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Lin You Eng</b> asked the Minister for

Education  in  1962  (a)   how  many  University   of

Singapore  graduates  were recruited  (i)   into  the

Government  services and (ii)  to teach in Government

and  Government-aided secondary schools; and (b)  how

many graduates were rejected in each case.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> As in the previous question,

may I request the Member for Moulmein for the second

time to direct the first part of his question to  my

colleague,  the Minister for Finance, if he  desires

information  regarding the number of  University  of

Singapore   graduates  recruited   into   Government

services in 1962?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the number of University of Singapore

graduates  appointed  to  teach  in  Government  and

Government-aided  secondary  schools  in  1962,  the

answer is 44. The breakdown is as follows:



<pre>



  Government secondary schools 		   28



  Government-aided secondary schools	   16



</pre>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No University of Singapore graduate desiring to

teach  has had his application rejected because  the

number  of  applications is  less  than  the  number

required  for  ideal  staffing  in  English   medium

secondary schools.

<div align="center"><b>(Number from Taiwan and Hongkong)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Lin You Eng</b> asked the Minister for

Education  how  many  teachers  in  Government   and

Government-aided secondary schools are  from  Taiwan

and Hongkong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid

the question from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>



Member for Moulmein is somewhat ambiguous. I presume

that  by "teachers from Taiwan and Hongkong", he  is

referring to those teachers who, immediately  before

they  were  allowed  employment in  Singapore,  were

either  residents of or were employed in  Taiwan  or

Hongkong. If so, the total number of teachers is 27,

the breakdown of which is as follows:



<pre>



                        From       From       Total

                       Taiwan     Hongkong

 secondary

 schools

             Total      11          16         27



</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the 27 teachers are on Professional Visit

Passes and are allowed to continue in employment  on

a  year-to-year basis. May I add that  21  of  these

teachers were employed before June 1959, four before

July 1961 and two in 1962?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  Minister has given  information

about  teachers from Taiwan and Hongkong. But  there

are  many Nanyang University graduates who were  not

recruited  into  the  Government education  service.

From this, we can see that the P.A.P. Government -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We are now on Question Time.

The  hon.  Member  now must ask a  question.  If  he

wishes  to  debate this matter, then  he  must  find

another opportunity. He must ask permission to raise

this  matter on the adjournment or file a notice  of

motion.  He  can now ask supplementary questions  to

get any further information he requires. Mr Lin You

Eng.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

do  not  understand it. Since there are  many  local

graduate teachers, why should the Government recruit

so  many teachers from Taiwan and Hongkong?  I  hope

the Minister will clarify this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> It is very simple, Sir. I have

already  explained that of the 27 teachers, 21  were

employed  before June 1959 and 4 before  July  1961,

making a total of 25 of the 27 teachers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>



who are on year-to-year Professional Visit Passes. I

think  he  can  ask his colleagues, the  Member  for

Upper   Serangoon  and  the  Member  for   Serangoon

Gardens,  who  were my Parliamentary Secretaries  at

one  time and who approved them every year, why they

approved them then.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are teachers who are here mainly to teach in

secondary and upper secondary classes in the Chinese

secondary schools and they all have been reported as

extremely  competent  in  their  subjects   by   the

principals of the schools, the supervisors  and  the

Inspectorate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> Can the Minister

inform us whether there are teachers with equivalent

qualifications in Singapore, because,  according  to

the  Minister's information, these 27 teachers  from

Taiwan  and  Hongkong  are  on  Professional   Visit

Passes?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I have already explained that

the  majority  of these teachers are in  Government-aided  schools  - 24  out of 27.  If  the  management

committees of these aided schools together with  the

principals and professional officers think  well  of

their  work,  I  think  they should  be  allowed  to

continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon):</b> Can the

Minister  further  inform us  how  many  of  the  27

teachers are teaching Science?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> That is a question of detail of

which I would like more notice.

Chinese  Senior  Middle  III  Examination,  (b)   the

Chinese  Secondary  IV  Examination,  and  (c)    the

Cambridge  School Certificate Examination;  and  how

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the latter part of the question seeking

information  as  to the number in each  case  having

been  employed in Government service, may  I  remind

the  Member for Moulmein for the third time that  he

<div align="center"><b>DISRUPTION OF TRADE UNIONS; REGISTRATION OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>S.A.T.U.; AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF WORKERS</b></div>



<br><br>2.42 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of motion [25th July,

1963],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this Assembly condemns the People's Action

Party  Government  for its use  of  State  machinery

against  workers  and  their  organisations  in   an

attempt  to  disrupt  non-P.A.P. trade  unions  and

thereby  further P.A.P. interests: and demands  that

this abuse of State power he forthwith stopped, that

the  Singapore Association of Trade Unions he  given

immediate  registration  and  that  the  fundamental

rights  of association, assembly and publication  of

all  workers  he  recognised and  respected  by  the

Government.'-(Mr S. T. Bani).



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this

Government  has  shown  complete  disregard  of  the

principles  and  ethics of trade  unionism.  It  has

abused State power in an unprecedented manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have seen how in the case of the Singapore

Harbour Board dispute the whole State machinery  was

used  ruthlessly  and  in full force  regardless  of

ethics and principles in industrial relations.  Sir,

because  of  the  control over the Press  and  other

media  of  propaganda, confusion  has  been  brought

about as to the basic issues involved in the dispute

of the Harbour Board workers,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>



and also a deliberate distortion of facts  has

taken place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Harbour Board workers have been

subjected  to all sorts of victimisation  for  quite

some   time   now.  They  have  been  subjected   to

victimisation  since  the  days  of   the   previous

Government.  Today, the Singapore People's  Alliance

led   by   the  Member  for  Cairnhill   comes   out

championing the cause of the Harbour Board  workers.

I  notice  the Member for Cairnhill wishes to  raise

the  dispute  of the Port workers in an  adjournment

motion.  Sir, I would like to say here that  he  and

his  Government have not been any more  tolerant  or

sympathetic to the water-front workers. The Lim  Yew

Hock  Government encouraged union rivalry, sponsored

yellow  unions and victimised generally the  Harbour

Board  workers because they rejected the anti-labour

policies  of  his Government. It will be  remembered

how  his Government had refused recognition  of  the

union  and had withdrawn the citizenship certificate

of  the Secretary-General. Therefore, I suggest that

today  if  the  Member for Cairnhill comes  out  and

support  the cause of the Harbour Board workers,  it

is  because elections are around the corner  and  he

has  some vested interests in going to Tanjong Pagar

as we can see from the newspapers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to understand the dispute of the Harbour

Board  workers  in  the proper  perspective,  it  is

necessary to go back a little to trace the source of

dispute. In 1957 -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I trust the hon. Member is not

exciting a debate on the Harbour Board dispute as  a

dispute, because the motion is in general terms.  It

does  not  refer specifically to the  Harbour  Board

dispute. It can be mentioned, of course, in passing.

But  we  are not debating at the moment the  Harbour

Board dispute.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I wish to touch on the Harbour

Board  dispute merely to show how and to what extent

the  present Government is using State machinery  to

disrupt unions which reject political control by the

Government. Before I could touch on the actual  acts

indulged in by the present Government in the  recent

Harbour Board dispute, acts which show



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>



conclusively  that the motivation  is  political,  I

think  it  is  necessary to understand  briefly  the

problems  that the Harbour Board Union is  concerned

with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We submit that the Government has been completely

unprincipled  in its handling of the  Harbour  Board

dispute.  Today, the Harbour Board Staff Association

registration has been cancelled. The Prime  Minister

has unilaterally appointed a committee on behalf  of

the Harbour Board workers. All this has been done in

the name of solving the dispute of the Harbour Board

workers.  But we say this is just a cover,  and  the

Government  act in the Harbour Board  only  confirms

our  contention that the Government has consistently

been using State machinery to break trade unions and

trade union unity in the sector where the P.A.P. has

no influence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may just briefly say this. In 1957 a

Court  of  Inquiry  was appointed  by  the  previous

Government which made certain recommendations to  be

accepted  by both disputing parties - the  Board  and

the  workers.  The  present Prime Minister  was  the

legal adviser to the Union then and he presented the

case  on  behalf of the Harbour Board  workers.  But

since the recommendations were published, they  have

never been implemented. After the elections in 1959,

there   was   a  general  expectation   that   these

recommendations would be implemented, but the  major

recommendations   up  till   now   have   not   been

implemented.  Ever since 1959 after  the  elections,

the  Government attitude to the Harbour Board  Staff

Association   has   been   governed   by   political

considerations. The P.A.P. Government sought to make

the  Harbour Board Staff Association a tool  of  the

Government.  It was decided that if they  could  not

get  control of the Harbour Board Staff Association,

it  would  discredit and disrupt  the  organisation.

Sir, in the minds of the P.A.P., it was a very clear

decision. Either the Harbour Board Staff Association

had  to  be  a P.A.P. organisation or it had  to  be

broken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All attempts since 1959 to control the Union

failed.  Then, having failed in this, the  force  of

State machinery was introduced. Leaders of the Union

were prosecuted and smeared. Following the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>



court case, the Secretary-General of the Union,  Mr

Jamit  Singh, and the Vice-President, Mr  Chok  Koh

Thong,  were  detained  under  the  Preservation  of

Public  Security  Ordinance.  Immediately  following

this,  yet  another attempt was made to capture  the

Union. In the process of it, the State machinery  as

usual  was  used.  The  C.I.D. called  up  Committee

members,  questioned them and threatened  them.  The

Registrar  of  Trade Unions meddled  and  interfered

with  the  affairs  of the Union. But  unfortunately

for,  the  Government,  Sir,  these  attempts  again

failed. In March, the State machinery was used to  a

greater  extent.  On  instructions  from  the  Prime

Minister,  the  Harbour  Board  management  withdrew

recognition of the Executive Committee of the  Union

on the grounds that there were two Committees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to explain this myth of two Committees

because  a  certain amount of confusion  has  arisen

because  of  Government propaganda. The position  in

March  in  the  Harbour Board Staff Association  was

that there was only one Executive Council led by Mr

S.  Markandu,  and that had been the position  since

November   1961.  In  November  1961,   there   were

elections in the Union. The Executive Council led by

Markandu was elected. A member had taken a case  out

and  the  High  Court is to determine whether  these

elections  were in accordance with the  constitution

of  the  Union. Sir, my understanding of  the  legal

position  is  until  such time  as  the  High  Court

decides  that  the elections conducted  in  November

were not in accordance with the constitution of  the

Union,  the Committee that had been elected was  the

rightful  authority in the Union. The Harbour  Board

management  had  recognised this  position  and  had

entered into industrial relations from November last

until  March  this  year. But  in  March,  when  the

Government  had  failed  in all  its  endeavours  to

capture  the  Union,  it gave  instructions  to  the

Harbour Board management to withdraw recognition  of

the   Union  and  seize  the  Union  premises.   The

Government instructed the Registrar of Trade  Unions

to  freeze  the  funds  of the Union,  amounting  to

$120,000.  This  was a very blatant abuse  of  State

power. Following this, further attempts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>



were  made  but they could not deceive the  workers,

and the resistance to Government control remains.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, the Prime Minister called officials of

the new Committee to his office. Perhaps one reading

the  newspapers  would have felt  that  it  was  the

officials  of the Union who were going  to  see  the

Prime  Minister. The fact is that the Prime Minister

sits in his office; he decides he wants to have  Mr

Markandu  and company and someone else  on  the  old

Committee to come to his office; and all he does  is

to  phone  up the Harbour Board management and  tell

them  to  put these officials in the car  and  bring

them safely to the Prime Minister's Office. Sir,  it

is  not  an exaggeration to say that these officials

had  to  be manhandled in order that they  could  be

brought  to  the  Prime Minister's Office,  to  have

their  pictures taken by television cameramen, Press

cameramen and so on, to give the impression that the

Prime Minister was neutral and impartial, trying  to

solve  the  dispute  by  getting  two  rival  groups

together. There were no two rival groups. There  was

only  one  group. The other group was a group  being

instigated by the P.A.P. to put up some rivalry. But

the  legal  status, as I have said,  was  such  that

there  was  only  one  committee.  However,  in  the

process  of all these so-called conferences  in  the

Prime   Minister's  Office,  the  P.A.P.  Government

succeeded, to some extent, in giving the public  the

impression  that  there were two Committees  in  the

Harbour  Board,  that there was  rivalry,  and  that

therefore the Government was justified in asking the

Harbour Board to withdraw recognition of the  Union,

to  take  away the Union's funds, to take  away  the

Union's  premises.  It all suited  the  Government's

machinations,   Mr  Speaker,   because   what   the

Government  wanted  was to set  up  a  Committee  of

stooges in the Harbour Board; and if they could play

up  this  myth that there were these two  Committees

fighting each other, that both had no legal  status,

then  the  Government  hoped they  could  give  some

justification in selecting a handful of henchmen  to

represent the Harbour Board workers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at these meetings, the Prime Minister put up

a  suggestion  of electing a Committee  and  it  was

turned down. The Union's view was, briefly, that  if

a  negotiating  Committee or, for that  matter,  any

other Committee, was going to be elected in the name

of  the Harbour Board workers to represent them  and

their  Union, then that right of selection  must  be

with  the  workers and not with the Prime  Minister.

Sir, it is particularly farcical in a situation like

this where the Singapore Government is, in fact, the

employer. Sir, no employer in Singapore arrogates to

himself the right to appoint a negotiating Committee

on  behalf of its employees. This is a farce and  no

trade unionist worth his salt will ever accept  such

a   position.  Needless  to  say,  Mr  Speaker,  if

tomorrow every employer follows the example  set  by

the Government, which claims to be pro-labour, which

claims  to  be  a  model employer,  and  insists  on

unilaterally setting up a Committee on behalf of its

employees,  then there will be chaos and unrest  all

round.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Union took a strike decision to get the

demands met, and the demands were very simple.  One,

recognition  of  the  Executive  Committee.  It  was

pertinent at that moment to have this matter  fought

out,  because if the Union had kept quiet, the Prime

Minister  would  have proceeded to appoint  his  own

Committee.  Sir,  we  know what happened  after  the

workers  took a strike decision. The Prime  Minister

got  panicky. The Government got panicky. The  Prime

Minister,  who  since  1959  had  not  gone  to  the

Singapore Harbour Board Staff Association to see the

Harbour  Board  workers, who had  not  gone  to  the

Harbour  Board  to  see  the workers,  went  to  the

Harbour  Board this time. We saw grand  pictures  in

the  newspapers  of  workers  shouting  pro-Malaysia

slogans  and greeting the Prime Minister. Sir,  here

again  I would like to take just one moment  to  say

how   the  facts  were  distorted.  There   was   no

justification   for   the   Government   to   refuse

recognition   if   the  Union  and   its   Executive

Committee.  They knew that when the workers  took  a

strike  decision, they were caught out publicly.  To

overcome  this,  the Prime Minister  instructed  the

Harbour Board



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>



to  get  all the workers together for a meeting.  He

decided  to  go  direct  to the  members  to  get  a

decision  from them. We know that the Harbour  Board

had  a  lot of gates. All the gates were locked  up.

Riot  squads and police personnel stood  by  at  the

Tanjong  Pagar  Police  Station;  plainclothes   men

filled  the  Harbour Board area, and  Harbour  Board

personnel  were  used to go around  to  force  every

worker to attend this meeting. The instructions were

very  simple. "These are working hours. You  are  an

employee of the Harbour Board. The orders are,  `You

attend  this  meeting. If you  do  not  attend  this

meeting,   you   will  be  subject  to  disciplinary

action.'"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this meeting the Prime Minister announced that

he  would make this award of a Malaysia bonus.  Sir,

in   the   first   place,  his  conduct   was   very

unprincipled,  because  he had  no  business  to  go

direct to the workers on an industrial matter that a

trade  union was representing. In the second  place,

the  State  power was used to intimidate and  coerce

the  workers  and to get them to see  his  point  of

view.  There was no fair play. It was all  described

as  a big victory for the Prime Minister. But he had

no  courage to allow Union officials to address  the

meeting. The whole exercise carried out by the Prime

Minister was to prevent a strike, because if it  had

taken  place,  the misdeeds of the Government  would

have  come to public attention. To prevent a strike,

he,  together with responsible people like  Hon  Sui

Sen,  Chairman  of  the  Harbour  Board,  and  other

Harbour  Board  officials,  indulged  in  completely

unethical  and unprincipled conduct. Even  at  these

two  meetings  with  the Harbour Board  workers,  we

found  that  they  were determined to  proceed  with

their  fight  to  gain recognition; and  to  prevent

this,   Sir,   with  a  stroke  of  the   pen,   the

registration of the Harbour Board Staff  Association

was cancelled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a pity that the Prime Minister is not

here.  Since  he  believes  in  open  confrontation,

perhaps this would be an appropriate moment to  hear

what  he  has to say. But I say that in the  Harbour

Board  dispute it was not the Union which was  being

political but the Government. The Harbour Board even

today, Sir, is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>



faced  with  an  explosive  situation,  because  the

Government  wants to play politics with  unions  and

workers.  The  fact  that the  Harbour  Board  Staff

Association   registration  is   cancelled   by   an

arbitrary  decision  of  the  Government  does   not

resolve the dispute in the Harbour Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has set up a Committee of six people to try and look after the affairs of the workers. In the first place, Mr Speaker, he has no right whatsoever to appoint such a Committee. In the second place, the appointment of this Committee does not solve the problem. Sir, if a strike takes place,

either  today, tomorrow, or one week or  two  months

from  now,  it  is not because there are  Communists

trying  to  create industrial unrest. Sir,  for  ten

years  now  the  Harbour  Board  workers  have  been

patient.  They were patient when their leaders  were

arrested.  They were patient when their claims  were

referred arbitrarily to the Arbitration Court.  They

were  patient when their premises were seized.  They

were  patient  when  $120,000  of  their  funds  was

frozen.  But  they could not be patient  any  longer

when  the Government proposed to set up a Committee,

a  P.A.P. Committee, to represent them in industrial

relations.  The fact that today the Government  have

cancelled  the  registration of  the  Harbour  Board

Staff  Association only increases the  problem.  The

struggle of the Harbour Board workers continues, and

I  have no doubt, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the victory

will  be that of the Harbour Board Staff Association

members, and Harbour Board workers as a whole. It is

not   going  to  be  a  personal  victory  for   any

individual,  be  it  the Prime Minister  or  anybody

else.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Harbour Board issue is a very clear

example  of  the extent to which the  Government  is

prepared  to use State power for its party political

interest. Sir, in the past, we have quoted  numerous

small  examples of C. K. Tang, Tiger Breweries,  and

the Steam Laundries and so on. I do not think I have

to repeat all this at this moment. There is no doubt

in  the minds of the officials of all unions of  the

intention  of the Government. All trade unions,  all

employers  and many people who are one  way  or  the

other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>



connected   with  industrial  problems,   industrial

relations,  know full well that today the  Singapore

Government's abuse of State power for its  political

purposes  in the trade union field is unprecedented.

On  the  one hand, attempts are made to disrupt  the

unions which are non-P.A.P., to discriminate against

them,  to deny them of their fundamental rights  and

privileges. On the other hand, State power  is  used

to  foster  the  growth of the N.T.U.C.  The  P.A.P.

outfit  is led by renegades and discredited  leaders

in  the  trade union field. Sir, today, the N.T.U.C.

is  a  big racket. It is supposed to be the P.A.P.'s

vehicle for working class support, and it is used to

make  P.A.P. propaganda to gather support  for  the

P.A.P. amongst the workers. Sir, I have had occasion

in  the  past to say in this House how public  funds

have  been  used  to assist in the running  of  this

organisation,  the  Labour Research  Unit,  $300,000

annually  to pay salaries to P.A.P. trade unionists;

how  the Labour Ministry is being used to pressurise

employers into meeting the excessive demands made by

this   organisation;   how   the   office   of   the

Commissioner  for  Labour is  being  used  to  order

secret  ballots, to withhold secret ballots  in  the

process of determining union representation, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to quote from a letter that

appeared  in  the Malayan Times. I do not  have  the

paper, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have mentioned time and

again  that  if  a  Member wishes to  quote  from  a

newspaper, the newspaper ought to be brought.  Which

date is that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> 23rd of July.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I take it the newspaper must be in

the  Library.  But  in future I might  be  a  little

stricter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> It is a letter in the People's

Parliament  column  in the Malayan  Times,  23rd  of

July.   Sir,   I  quote  this  letter  because   the

Government  has  a sickness. Everything  we  say  is

branded  as  Communist propaganda.  I  think  it  is

worthwhile  taking note of what this  gentleman  has

said  because, in the first place, I  do  not  think

this gentleman is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>



a  Communist  by  any standards. He  starts  off  by

condemning   the   S.A.T.U. as  well.   With   your

permission,  Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to  read  this

part  because it gives a clear picture of what  sort

of racket exists in the N.T.U.C.:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`One of the biggest unions affiliated to the

N.T.U.C. is AUPE whose leader is Mr G.  Kandasamy.

He has been at loggerheads with Mr Devan Nair since

the very inception of the N.T.U.C. This resulted  in

the  division  of  the N.T.U.C. into  two  factions.

Overseas scholarships came in as a handy instrument,

which  the  two  groups  used to  attract  promising

unionists  who,  in turn, would help  to  outdo  the

other group in their empire building.'



<br><br>Incidentally, Mr Speaker, this article is  entitled

"Empire Building":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A few months ago when Mr Kandasamy was able to

secure  a studs course to Israel, sponsored  by  the

ICFTU,  he handpicked his adherents from the various

unions  without reference either to the N.T.U.C. or

to the unions concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the majority group in the

N.T.U.C. pampers  one  or  two  unions  on   whose

potentialities they have great hopes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, let us take the United Workers of

Petroleum Industry which represents the employees in

oil  companies. All the good scholarships,  such  as

study  trips  to  Canada, America,  United  Kingdom,

Germany,  and  Switzerland are  reserved  for  these

pampered chaps. Last year one member from this union

went  on a Canadian and Continental trip. This  year

another  member,  Mr  Aziz Karim,  has  gone  on  a

similar trip abroad. A third one will soon be  going

to Japan and Vienna.'



<br><br>In fact, they have since left, Mr Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Members of this union occupy positions in the

Adult  Education  Board and Central  Provident  Fund

Board. These blue-eyed boys are given pride of place

in all public functions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the affiliated unions of the N.T.U.C.

strained  their very nerve to make this  year's  May

Day  celebrations a success [which, Sir, was  not  a

success because they had an attendance of only about

3,000],  not  even  the  members  of  the  executive

committee attended the rally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, Mr Aziz, Karim, an official of the

United  Workers  of  Petroleum  Industry,  who   was

nominated  by  the N.T.U.C. to work  in  the  Labour

Research  Unit,  had not even shown his  face  there

throughout  the last seven months under the  pretext

of  ill-health. It must be noted here that all those

unionists,  who are seconded to the Labour  Research

Unit,  are paid by the Unit which receives an annual

grant of $300,000. For his seven months' absence Mr

Aziz  Karim  has received a grand sum of $3,000  [an

average  of  about $400 a month, Mr  Speaker]  - the

hard-earned taxpayers' money.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither the Director of the Labour Research Unit,

nor  the  Chairman  of  the N.T.U.C.,  who  is  also

seconded  to  the  above unit,  despite  their  full

knowledge of this, took any action against Mr  Aziz

Karim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man, who was so indisposed that he absented

himself  for  seven months from his place  of  work,

woke  up  one  fine Monday morning (July  15,  1963)

found  himself hale and healthy, produced his health

certificates at the Singapore Airport, and  flew  to

Canada,  leaving a group of unionists stricken  with

bewilderment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means, in addition to his seven months'

absence with pay, he will enjoy another four  months

with  pay  in  Canada and in the Continent.  What  a

terrible waste of public money!'



<br><br>Sir,  I solemnly swear this is not from a Communist.

I  only read it from a paper, and it is signed  "PRO

BONO  PUBLICO".  But as I have said earlier  on,  he

could  not  possibly be anybody connected  with  the

S.A.T.U.,  because there is an initial criticism  of

S.A.T.U. and its control, etc. [Interruption]  Well,

you can read it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I have nothing to hide here. If the

Member  is quite interested, he can take the Malayan

Times  and read it in full - five times over in  this

House - and I will have no objection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point here is to stress the fact that today the

Government  uses State machinery for  its  own  use,

State  funds for its own purpose, and forces  a  few

civil servants to carry out work for the advancement

of  the  P.A.P.'s political interests. Sir, this  is

only  one side of it. On the other side, I hear that

all is not well even in their unions. I hear that in

the  Singapore Manual and Mercantile Workers  Union,

$12,000 is missing, and Mr T. V. Gomez has taken  a

holiday. I do not know what the Government has  done

about  this. In the Federation of Public Daily-Rated

Employees  Union, $2,000 is missing.  A  report  was

made  in  the  Kandang  Kerbau Police  Station,  but

nothing  was  done.  On the other hand,  practically

every day every union in the S.A.T.U. group is being

persecuted  by  the  Registrar of  Trade  Unions  on

instructions from the Government. The  mess  in  the

Manual and Mercantile Workers Union is known to  the

workers.  If  the  Government have  any  decency,  I

believe they will make a categorical



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>



statement  either confirming it or  denying  it.  If

they  have courage, I say hold a public inquiry  and

get  the  Rediffusion workers to testify as  to  the

truth or otherwise of what I have said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the N.T.U.C. today is given full blessing and

official recognition, whereas S.A.T.U. is denied the

right to hold any activity. The application for  the

registration of S.A.T.U. was made in August 1961. It

was  the  first application following the resolution

of  the  Trades  Union  Congress.  Up  to  date  the

Registrar  of Trade Unions has not even the  decency

to   communicate  with  us.  In  order  to  give  an

appearance  of impartiality, I hear the N.T.U.C. is

not  officially  registered  but  it  can  hold  its

conference.  The  S.A.T.U. annual  conference   was

banned.  The Internal Security Council was  made  to

take the responsibility for the ban. We asked for  a

police  permit  to hold a rally, but  there  was  no

police  permit. Sir, the fact that the N.T.U.C. may

not  be legally registered does not mean that it  is

subjected to the same treatment that is given to the

S.A.T.U. It is only for purposes of convenience  and

to  give  the  impression of impartiality  that  the

registration  has not been given. But  otherwise  it

has the official backing of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the trade union movement in Singapore today

is  no  doubt  divided.  But this  division  is  not

something  new to Singapore. In one way  or  another

this division has always existed because there is  a

minority  of  working  people who  are  servile  and

backward  in their thinking and are fearful  of  the

authority of the day. Hence, this minority group has

from time to time lent its support to the government

of  the  day  and has become a tool  of  the  ruling

circles. During the years preceding 1959 when  there

was   an  upsurge  of  trade  union  activity,  this

minority   section  of  the  trade  union   movement

persistently played its role of reaction.  Now  this

group  once again indulges in reaction and stirs  up

differences amongst the workers with the aid of  the

State power and a handful of renegade leaders.  Sir,

the  only  difference is that it is now  the  P.A.P.

Government and renegades like Devan Nair and  T.  V.

Gomez instead of it being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>



the   previous   Government   and   renegades   like

Jaganathan, Lee Chwee Lim and Ang Leong Seng.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. came to power in 1959 with the support

of  the progressive trade union movement. One of the

major  election pledges was to unify the trade union

movement.  As  was  pledged, a unified  trade  union

movement  was  recognised  as  a  pre-condition  for

industrial  peace with justice. Today the Government

have completely forgotten their pledge, and, besides

not  doing  anything  to unify  the  movement,  have

perpetuated and deepened the division by  their  use

of  State machinery. Sir, the trade unions that  are

today  accused of being Communist-led had more  than

demonstrated  in  the past of their  willingness  to

work with the new Government after the elections  in

order  to  bring about a unified strong trade  union

movement which, as I have said, would be a necessary

pre-requisite for industrial peace. However, it  was

Government's fear born out of political  opportunism

that  prevented the unification of the  trade  union

movement.   It  was  the  Government's  failure   to

manipulate and control the T.U.C. in 1961  to  serve

its  own purpose that led to the open breach in  the

T.U.C.  Instead of letting the unions  decide  their

future, the Government announced the dissolution  of

the  T.U.C. with the shameless connivance  of  their

henchmen in the T.U.C. Secretariat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ever since 1961, the Government have been

giving  official blessing and active support to  the

N.T.U.C. and disrupting and discriminating  against

S.A.T.U.  Sir,  we  find it necessary  to  warn  the

Government of the consequences of their actions,  of

the  consequences of their labour  policy  based  on

political   bias  and  discrimination  against   the

majority  of  trade unions and trade union  members.

The  Government alone are solely responsible for any

uneasiness  and  tension in  the  industrial  field.

S.A.T.U. is  the main stream of the  working  class

movement  in  Singapore. The Government attitude  to

S.A.T.U.,  in  effect,  means denying  S.A.T.U. its

rightful place in the country. Sir, S.A.T.U.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>



cannot be crippled and choked out of existence.  Any

attempt   to   do   so  would  only  mean   inviting

retaliation by the majority of the workers. Sir, the

Government would do well to take stock of things and

accord S.A.T.U. its rightful place. S.A.T.U. must be

registered  forthwith  and S.A.T.U. unions'  rights

recognised and respected by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. Kandasamy (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, the Member for Thomson seems rather to be under

an  illusion that any union which is not within  the

S.A.T.U. organisation  is   automatically   P.A.P.

controlled. He has been in the trade union  movement

for  some  time  and I am sure he  understands  that

there are about 128 unions in Singapore of which  34

unions  or  so  are in S.A.T.U. Therefore,  for  the

Member  for  Thomson to come and  say  that  90  odd

unions  in  Singapore are under the control  of  the

P.A.P. or that the P.A.P. controls 94 unions,  I  do

not  think  he is doing himself or the  trade  union

movement any good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by such an appraisal, he is tacitly admitting

that   the  34  unions  who  are  in  S.A.T.U. are

controlled and dominated by the Barisan Sosialis.  I

think  the Member for Thomson who moved this  motion

in  April  had  slightly different ideas.  Indeed  I

would  have  thought  the  speech  would  have  been

different,  had he delivered it in April,  from  the

speech that we heard yesterday and this afternoon. I

can  sympathise with the difficulties in  the  trade

union movement in the industrial field. The pace  is

fast  and  from April to now, several  changes  have

taken  place  that perhaps the Member  for  Thomson,

busy  as he is in preparing black banners, or rather

giving  advice  as to how to prepare black  banners,

has  not had much time to concentrate on the  motion

that he moved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent to the motion being placed on the Order

Paper,  the  S.A.T.U. group of unions  have  adopted

another definition of what "P.A.P. union" means. It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>



is  quite  open  in  Singapore in  the  trade  union

movement that the S.A.T.U. group of unions have said

those unions whose leaders were honoured in June  by

awards  - I  have forgotten the names of  the  medals - that  were  given  for public service,  hence  only

those unions were P.A.P. controlled and unions whose

leaders were not honoured in such a manner were  not

P.A.P. controlled. Sir, it seems today  the  Member

for  Thomson has gone off the track again from  what

the  S.A.T.U. leadership have said. Because  if  the

unions  whose  leaders won awards in June  were  the

only  unions controlled by the P.A.P., then a  close

examination will show that there are only six unions

whose leaders have been so honoured.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the Member for Thomson would have

done  the House a favour if he had defined  what  he

meant by "non-P.A.P. trade unions" -



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> It includes yours. You have fallen out -



<br><br><!-- Mr Kandasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kandasamy:</b> I am still on this side of the

House.  The Member is not suffering from any disease

of  the eyes and I hope he will not suffer. There is

no  such  thing  as "my unions" in the  trade  union

movement.  The trade union movement does not  belong

to  any  individual. It belongs to the workers.  But

the  Member  for  Thomson apparently  has  different

ideas.  He  probably believes that the trade  unions

belong to him personally -[Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kandasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kandasamy:</b> Sir, last evening the Member for

Thomson touched upon the Amalgamated Union of Public

Employees.  He  said  that the  balloting  that  was

conducted  by the Ministry of Labour on the  dispute

involving  nurses  was stopped  by  the  Amalgamated

Union  of  Public  Employees. Very  subtly  he  said

perhaps  that was because there were P.A.P. members

in the Amalgamated Union of Public Employees. Sir, I

would  like to explain this. The Member for  Thomson

should  have spent more time reading the  Industrial

Relations Ordinance and other Ordinances, and if he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>



had,  he  would have found a means of  avoiding  the

difficulty  he  found himself in  in  the  Breweries

case.  Sir,  when  the dispute  was  directed  under

section  28  (b)   to  arbitration,  from  that  time

onwards,  from the moment the Gazette was issued  in

accordance  with the Industrial Relations Ordinance,

the  dispute  comes within the jurisdiction  of  the

Arbitration  Court  and  any  action  taken  by  the

employer or the Ministry of Labour before the  issue

of  the  Gazette is usually null and void.  Sir,  as

soon  as  the Amalgamated Union of Public  Employees

came  to understand that the Ministry of Labour were

going to count and declare the ballot which they had

conducted, they promptly reported the matter to  the

President of the Industrial Arbitration Court.  They

informed  him that if the ballot boxes were  opened,

counted  and declared, that would be prejudicial  to

the  case  before  the Court. The  Court,  being  an

independent  body  as  it is, promptly  ordered  the

Ministry  of  Labour not to open the boxes,  not  to

count  the  ballot and not to declare. I think  even

the  Ministry  of  Labour were caught  by  surprise,

because  when the moment arrived for the opening  of

the  ballot boxes, newspaper reporters photographers

and  various other functionaries were there, and  it

was  only at the last moment that the Court's  order

was  conveyed and obeyed. If the Member for  Thomson

had  done  some reading of the Industrial  Relations

Ordinance and had done a little bit of research into

the precedents set up by the Australian Courts, I am

sure he would have saved a lot of time in his speech

about the Harbour Board workers and Brewery workers.

He  would  have  found that in Singapore  there  are

enough laws, enough avenues, to seek redress of  the

matters that he had raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the T.U.C. was mentioned by the Member for

Thomson. Sir, in the case of the Sassoon workers, he

forgot  to  mention that the P.A.P. and the  present

non-P.A.P.,  including him, when  we  heard  of  the

arrest  of  the  workers who were  involved  in  the

Sassoon strike, promptly went to the Central  Police

Station and not only publicly protested



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>



but we also had a meeting with the then Minister for

Labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next instance was the deregistration of the

Federation  of  Transport  Unions.  The  Member  for

Thomson  was  one of the Secretaries of  the  T.U.C.

then,  and  when the deregistration took  place,  an

explanation was given and there was no protest.  Now

for  him  to  come out at this late hour and  accuse

others  in the T.U.C., I think, is not doing justice

to  his  former  colleagues;  neither  is  he  doing

justice  to  himself because he was, until  1961,  a

member  of the Secretariat. The trade union movement

cannot  be  united by legislation.  No  trade  union

movement   in   the  world  has   been   united   by

legislation.  Legislation has  been  of  assistance.

Legislation sometimes has been a hindrance. But  for

the  trade  union movement to unite, such unity  can

only come from the workers and nobody else.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson touched upon the Harbour

Board  workers. I have some experience dealing  with

the  Harbour Board workers, not since 1959, if I may

say   so,  Sir.  My  experience  goes  before  that.

Strangely  enough, Sir, with regard to  the  Harbour

Board workers, the disputes since 1955 have involved

two   ex-Chief  Ministers  and  the  present   Prime

Minister.  As  far  as I know, the  trouble  of  the

Harbour  Board workers arises from two factors.  One

factor  is  that the Committee of the Harbour  Board

workers from 1955 to 1962 have never prepared  their

cases  for  the workers or created an administrative

machinery,  an organisation, to look after  all  the

workers  in  the Harbour Board. Unfortunately,  Sir,

some  of the leaders  - I will not say all  - have  been

more interested in the political aspect than in  the

industrial aspect. Had the Committee concentrated on

the  industrial aspect from 1955, I do not think  we

would  have  reached the position  today  where  the

workers are now finding themselves without a  union,

very  confused  as  to what is to  be  done  in  the

present  situation. Their claims have been  directed

to the Arbitration Court. They have received a bonus

at the same time. And



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>



the  responsibility for all this rests  squarely  on

some  of the leaders of the union. Surely the Member

for   Thomson  realises  it.  The  former   General-Secretary was a colleague of both of us.  He  was  a

good  friend, I think, of the former Chief Minister,

the  Member for Cairnhill, with whom he had certain

difficulties  at  certain times. He  was  also  well

known to the previous Chief Minister, the Member for

Anson  at the moment. If the Member for Thomson  had

been  able  to  advise as early as  1959,  then  the

General-Secretary and the Committee should have gone

to  work  on  organisation and administration,  Sir,

whatever  has happened to Mr Jamit Singh,  I  think

the organisation would have been there looking after

the  interests of the workers, and any  negotiations

would   have   been   conducted  by   the   workers'

representatives,  by  the  workers  of  the  Harbour

Board, and not by people who have nothing whatsoever

to  do  with the Harbour Board. If we are to  assist

the  Harbour Board workers, may I advise the  Member

for  Thomson  that the best that can happen  is  for

persons  who  are  not connected directly  with  the

Harbour Board to leave the Harbour Board workers  to

resolve  their own difficulties, to elect their  own

representatives, and to conduct the affairs  of  the

union  by leadership elected from the rank and  file

of   the   port  workers  without  any  interference

whatsoever from outsiders'? Sir, I do not  say  this

because  I am not in any way involved or interested,

while the Member for Thomson is directly, I believe,

its  adviser, but I think he would be doing a  great

service  to the port workers to advise them to  look

after  their  own  affairs  without  any  advice  or

interference from outside; whether it is the  Member

for  Thomson or whether it is the N.T.U.C. I  should

think  that both of them should keep away  from  the

port workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Amalgamated Union of Public Employees has

serious   difficulties  with  its   employers,   the

Government   of   Singapore.  It   also   has   some

difficulties with the N.T.U.C. But that is no excuse

whatsoever  for the Member for Thomson to  say  that

there is a Kandasamy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>



faction in the N.T.U.C. For his information, I might

as  well say this - when the N.T.U.C. was formed,  it

was  I  who  proposed that Mr  Devan  Nair  be  its

General  Secretary;  and  I  declined  the  post  of

General  Secretary. I can assure the  House  that  I

have   no  intention  whatsoever  of  standing   for

election   to  any  office  in  the  N.T.U.C.,   and

therefore  there  is  no need for  me  to  create  a

Kandasamy  faction. The Kandasamy faction  that  the

Member  for  Thomson has said is his own imagination

and not a reality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding scholarships, I do not have any

authority  or  the  power to award  scholarships  to

anyone,  whether  it be the Israel scholarship  that

the  Member  for  Thomson  mentioned  or  any  other

scholarship.   Scholarships  are  offered   to   the

Ministry of Labour. The normal procedure, I believe,

lies  with the N.T.U.C. And between them they select

the  participants for the courses. I do not have  an

opportunity to offer scholarships, but as  a  member

of  the N.T.U.C., I may propose certain persons  who

may  have  the support of the N.T.U.C. and  thus  be

awarded  scholarships. But that does not in any  way

substantiate the accusation made by the  Member  for

Thomson that the Kandasamy faction, in trying to win

members over, is offering scholarships.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would say to the Member for Thomson

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- since he has found himself to be in a difficult

situation in regard to the brewery workers  and  the

Harbour  Board  - perhaps if he had done his  homework

better  and  had  spent more  time  reading  up  the

Ordinances,  the possibilities that are  there,  and

had spent less time with black banners, I am sure he

would  have found solutions to his problems  and  he

would have done better for the workers of Singapore,

instead of having to make his very lengthy speech on

the Harbour Board workers.



<br><br>3.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

as the Member for Thomson has touched on the workers

of  the  Harbour  Board, I feel it  is  my  duty  to

clarify certain points which I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>



believe  he  has  been  wrongly  informed  about  by

certain employees in the Harbour Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech he mentioned about the

recommendations of the Court of Inquiry appointed by

the previous Government. The previous Government did

not try to implement the recommendations up to 1959,

and  after  1959 the present Government  implemented

the    main    or   important   aspects    of    the

recommendations. In fact, in 1961 Mr Jamit Singh, I

and  Mr Latiff signed an agreement on behalf of the

Singapore  Harbour  Board  Staff  Association  which

stated  quite clearly that all major recommendations

of  the  Court  of Inquiry had been  completely  and

fully  implemented to the satisfaction  of  all  the

workers concerned; except for one item which at that

time - and   even  Mr  Jamit  Singh  and  the   whole

Committee agreed on this  - was practically impossible

to  implement because of the nature of the  work  of

the Harbour Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on this particular operation - from December 1959 right up to May 1961 - the Harbour Board and the Union sat together. We discussed all the problems and did our best. Even though we differed politically with Mr Jamit Singh, who was a good friend of mine, we did this to the

best  of our ability and to the satisfaction of  all

the  Harbour  Board workers concerned. That  is  the

first  point I want to clarify and that  the  Member

for Thomson has got the wrong information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is the victimisation of the

Harbour  Board workers. He said that this  has  been

going  on since 1955, i.e., about eight to ten years

from the time of the previous Government. He is  now

accusing  that this is going on in the time  of  the

present Government. On this matter of victimisation,

I  would  say that as one who worked in the  Harbour

Board and as one who is closely associated with  its

Union, I cannot find any reason to put the blame  on

the  present  Government. The  whole  setup  of  the

Harbour  Board  is  such that  any  officer  of  the

Harbour  Board, if he wants to play dirty, can  play

dirty,  so  that the reflection falls on Government.

As far as I can see it now, this victimisation is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>



not primarily or mainly directed towards the present

new  Committee or because the workers are supporting

the Barisan Sosialis or S.A.T.U. I do not think that

is the case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that the Member for Thomson has

mentioned  is the election of the new Committee  and

the  legality  of this Committee. He  has  suggested

that  there are virtually two Committees.  Sir,  the

one  problem  which we were faced with  in  1955  is

this.  In  the period from 1955 to 1959  there  were

unions in the Singapore Harbour Board having trouble

with  one another. The problems of the Harbour Board

workers had accumulated since 1955. All the time  we

were  asking  for one single union for  the  Harbour

Board  workers. After a critical strife,  we  formed

one  union but the Board refused to recognise  this.

There  were yellow unions then. So the problems  had

accumulated  up  to  1959. The reason  why  the  new

election   of   Executive  Committee   members,   as

suggested by the Member for Thomson, is illegal,  or

seems to be illegal because an employee of the Board

has  taken  a  case in the High Court.  Before  this

particular  election  of  the  Executive   Committee

members, all sectional representatives met Mr Jamit

Singh   - at that time the Member for Thomson was  not

an  adviser to the union  - and also all employees  of

the  Harbour Board met Mr Jamit Singh and requested

him  that  elections should be held. He refused.  He

said.  "According to the constitution of the Harbour

Board  Staff Association, you cannot hold  elections

because  the  Association  cannot  represent  10,000

workers." And he was correct. I also said this.  But

what  happened was that they suddenly conducted  the

elections ultra vires the constitution.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I understood from the Member

for  Thomson that that matter is sub judice. It  has

been referred to the Court. If that is so, then,  of

course, it cannot be mentioned.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen:</b> I am just mentioning it in passing and

I will not be going into details.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleague, the Member for Kampong Kapor, has

stated, the position of the Singapore Harbour  Board

workers  is a very difficult one. They were made  to

suffer  for  the last eight years because  of  their

active  participation in politics. I am in  complete

agreement  with  my  colleague  that  the  Singapore

Harbour  Board workers should be given a  chance  to

elect their own representatives who are employed  in

the   Singapore  Harbour  Board  itself.  After  the

election  of their Committee, let them he given  the

authority to run a union democratically in their own

interest.  If  there is no outside  interference,  I

think  the Singapore Harbour Board workers are quite

capable of electing their own leaders. I think there

are  quite  a number of good chaps who can  run  the

union  quite efficiently for the betterment  of  the

Singapore Harbour Board workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point, as the Member for Thomson has

suggested, is that the Prime Minister went there and

that  ten  gates were closed. The Singapore  Harbour

Board  employees  are from Gate  1,  that  is,  East

Reclamation Road to the Pasir Panjang Power  Station

and partly the Singapore Slipway at Tanjong Rhu. Can

we believe that 10,000 employees scattered over four

miles can all be locked up within 10 or 12 gates? If

they  refuse  to  go  to  a meeting  called  by  the

Singapore Harbour Board or on the instruction of the

Prime  Minister, there the problem ends. Nobody  can

force  the  10,000  employees from Tanjong  Berlayer

right up to Tanjong Rhu to go to a meeting. So, this

exactly  shows  that the workers  in  the  Singapore

Harbour Board have come to a position where they are

fed  up with all these things and they are too eager

for  somebody to tackle their problems. They are too

eager  to get something, because for the last  eight

years  they  have never received any rate  increases

and  there  has  been  no change  in  their  working

conditions. Therefore in that sense, they thought it

best  to  go  to  the meeting called  by  the  Prime

Minister. They went there to listen to him  and  the

President of the Union was given a chance to  be  on

the platform; for that matter, everybody was given a

chance to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>



be  on  the  platform.  Instead  of  prolonging  the

matter,  let  the  workers of the Singapore  Harbour

Board  get something as an interim award. They  have

been   given   a   chance   to   elect   their   own

representatives  to run their union.  I  think  once

they   elect  their  own  representatives  and   the

Executive  Committee, they should be left  alone  so

that they can look after their own interests.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No other Member wishing to speak?



<br><br>4.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this

motion  is  moved  not because there  is  cause  for

concern  that the fundamental rights of association,

assembly  and publication of the workers  are  being

ignored  or disregarded by the Government as alleged

in  the  motion. On the contrary, it is due  to  the

Government's  pro-labour  policy  that  revived  the

workers'  movement  immediately  after  the  present

Government  took  office.  This  has  led   to   the

restoration  of the workers' fundamental  rights  of

association,  assembly  and publication  which  were

suppressed  by  the  Lim Yew  Hock  Government.  The

emergence  of such a favourable situation  instilled

strong confidence among the workers, so much so that

they took full advantage of the situation created to

reorganise and strengthen their unions. It is due to

this consolidation of the unions' position that  has

enabled  the  workers to achieve  better  terms  and

conditions of service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, why do the Barisan move this motion? To them, the primary role and function of a trade union is to advance the aims and aspirations of particular political ideologies, parties or personalities. But as a result of the successful implementation of the Government's pro-labour

policy,  the pro-Communists in the Barisan  Sosialis

have  failed in their attempt to reduce trade unions

into  playthings of political forces out to  advance

their   own  narrow  aims  and  ideologies.  It   is

therefore understandable that this motion is only an

attempt  to  distort  the  facts  to  conceal  their

misdeeds that have caused so much loss and damage to

the workers in the past.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has touched on the subject

of  the  reunification of the trade union  movement.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, unification of the  trade  union

movement  is to consolidate the bargaining  position

of  the  workers with their employers. This  is  the

real purpose for the move to reunify the trade union

movement.  Let us examine the development  of  trade

union  organisations during the days of the Lim  Yew

Hock  Government and the present Government.  During

the  period  January  1955 to May  1959,  while  the

previous   Government  was  in   office,   139   new

employees'  unions were registered. This  represents

an  average  of  nearly three new unions  registered

every  month.  When  the present Government  assumed

office  in  June  1959, there was  a  total  of  226

employees'  unions with an aggregate  membership  of

134,650. There are at the moment only 121 employees'

unions with an aggregate membership of 189,221. This

represents a net decrease of 105 unions  and  a  net

increase of union membership of nearly 55,000  since

we assumed office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above facts and figures in themselves

constitute  the  conclusive  evidence  of  what  the

Government  has  done  to  achieve  the  object   of

reunification of the trade union movement. The trade

union movement in Singapore is in fact forging ahead

in spite of the hue and cry of the Barisan Sosialis.

The  Government understands that it is not  so  much

because  trade union movement in Singapore makes  no

progress  that  is lamentable, but rather  that  the

Barisan  Sosialis is deprived of the opportunity  to

control and make use of the trade union movement  in

the State as their open front political instruments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson has also accused the Government of having deviated from its pro-labour policy and that it is now no more a pro- labour Government. Let me quote the facts of what we have done in the past: to provide the necessary

facilities  and machinery to assist the  workers  to

achieve  better terms and conditions of service,  to

uphold  and  to  implement the policy of  industrial

peace  with  justice, the Government has  taken  the

necessary steps to set up the requisite machinery



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>



such  as the Industrial Arbitration Courts.  It  has

augmented  the conciliation service and  the  Labour

Courts  in  the Labour Ministry and  has  set  up  a

Labour  Research  Unit. The  extent  and  amount  of

benefit the workers have derived from the pro-labour

policy   of   the   present  Government   has   been

laboriously  dealt with by the Minister  during  the

Budget  sittings. There is no necessity  for  me  to

repeat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the provision of such effective machinery and facilities for the workers to better their terms and conditions of service, the Member for Thomson accused the Labour Office of being discriminatory between the N.T.U.C. and S.A.T.U. unions. Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no truth

in  it.  The  facilities of the Labour Ministry  are

open  to all unions, whether they belong to N.T.U.C.

or   S.A.T.U.  The  pro-Communist  leaders  of   the

S.A.T.U. unions, of course, do their best  to  keep

their  members away from the conciliation facilities

offered  by  the Ministry of Labour. But  even  when

workers belonging to the S.A.T.U. unions come to the

Ministry,  they  are  treated  fairly  without   any

discrimination  whatsoever.  This   is   basic   and

fundamental to the policy of the Government. We  can

assure  the workers belonging to the S.A.T.U. unions

that  while we will fight the pro-Communist  leaders

on every front, we shall be fair and just in all our

dealings  with  workers who have the  misfortune  of

being  under pro-Communist leadership, provided,  of

course,  that their grievances are genuine and  that

they press their claims within the framework of  the

law.  I  say  genuine grievances  because  the  pro-Communist leaders of the Barisan are past masters in

the  art  of  manufacturing  grievances  where  none

exists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson spoke on the registration

of  S.A.T.U. Mr Speaker. Sir, you will recall  that

after  the  split in the leadership of the Singapore

Trades  Union  Congress sometime in July  1961,  Lim

Ching  Siong,  Fong  Swee Suan, S.  Woodhull,  Jamit

Singh,  Puthucheary and the Member for Thomson  came

out and organised the Singapore Association of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>



Trade  Unions. Now why did they come out to organise

S.A.T.U.?  It is quite apparent that they know  that

they  must  exploit  trade  disputes  for  political

purposes  instead  of maintaining  industrial  peace

with  justice  mainly to serve the interest  of  the

workers. I am sure the Member for Thomson will  give

other reasons for the split. But for the record, Mr

Speaker, Sir, the primary cause of the split in  the

Singapore Trades Union Congress was the constant by-passing of the S.T.U.C. by these six members of  the

Secretariat  and  their repeated  utilisation  of  a

group  of  trade unions closely allied  to  them  to

advance  factional  political  aims  and  to   bring

pressure  on  and  to manipulate a properly  elected

Government. After the split, these persons could  no

longer  carry  out  their  anti-national  activities

within the framework of S.T.U.C. Therefore, they had

to  look for a new setup so that they could continue

to  manipulate  the  trade  union  movement  in  the

interest  o, foreign anti-Malayan and anti-Malaysia

forces. Hence the formation of S.A.T.U. Now what has

S.A.T.U. done  for  the  workers?  It  came   into

existence  on  16th August, 1961. The activities  of

S.A.T.U. since its inception, including  its  close

adherence  to  the anti-Malaysia line of  a  foreign

power  and voicing the new colonial charges  of  the

P.K.I.,  have clearly shown that its first  interest

is  political and that its inspiration  to  say  the

least  is  pro-Communist. The record  of  S.A.T.U.'s

affiliated  unions on labour affairs over  the  past

months  has been most deplorable. Over 1,000 workers

have  lost  their  jobs because of  their  misdeeds.

Therefore,  they have to move this motion  to  cover

their   evils.  Because  of  the  sabotage  of   our

industrial progress for political reasons,  hundreds

of  workers have lost their jobs and countless young

men and women have been deprived of the prospect  of

work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now deal with the details of

the cases that were mentioned

by the Member  for Thomson.  Yesterday,  he mentioned

the  holding  of secret ballots. At the last sitting I

have explained to this House why in the case of C. K. Tang a

secret ballot  could not be held when it was asked  for.  I

will just briefly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>



say  that at that time there was legal advice to the

Commissioner  for  Labour  that  when   it   was   a

collective  and  registered  agreement,  no   secret

ballot could be held. So the Commissioner for Labour

was  not  happy with this advice because  this  goes

against the principle of freedom of association.  He

took up this matter further with the State Advocate-General's

Chambers.  The  State  Advocate-General's

Chambers  then  later  reviewed  this  decision  and

advised  the  Commissioner for  Labour  that  secret

ballot  could  be  held  even  in  a  case  where  a

registered and certified collective agreement is  in

existence.  So,  therefore, there is  no  fix-up  or

arrangement  to  suit the convenience  of  any  non-S.A.T.U. union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also mentioned yesterday, the Plywood case. Mr

Speaker,  Sir, this is the very thing I am going  to

say  to  refute  the allegations he made.  When  the

S.A.T.U. union came to know that there was  a  piece

of advice that if there is a registered agreement, a

secret  ballot cannot be held, they quickly  availed

them  selves of this opportunity to go to  Court  to

get  an old agreement registered. This agreement was

signed  in 1961 and it was due to expire very  soon.

But  the  union, afraid of losing their  membership,

quickly  availed  themselves of the  legal  position

then  and  asked the Court to certify  and  register

that   agreement.   After   the   registration   and

certification,  the  union claimed  that  they  were

covered by this ruling and therefore a secret ballot

could  not  be  held. Therefore, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

there  is no such thing as discrimination between  a

S.A.T.U. union and a non-S.A.T.U. union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson yesterday mentioned the

Minister  for Finance and me coercing the management

of  the Plywood not to implement the agreement  that

they  had  signed. This is far from the  truth,  Mr

Speaker, Sir. He threw a challenge yesterday  and  I

am  prepared  to  accept his  challenge.  They  have

cunningly  availed themselves of the technicality  I

have  mentioned  just now to get the  old  agreement

signed, and then later on, by that course of action,

prevent  a  secret ballot from being held.  So  they

then  entered into negotiations with the management.

Arising  out of that negotiation, they have  reached

agreement on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>



the  question of bonus. But then, according  to  the

Industrial  Arbitration  Court's  practice,   though

negotiations  have been concluded and  an  agreement

has  been signed, it should not be implemented until

that agreement has been registered and certified  by

the  Court. Now, because of this technicality again,

Mr Speaker, Sir, the management could not implement

the agreement reached between the two parties. There

is no such thing as that we want to deny the workers

of the benefits they have achieved. That is far from

the  truth.  As  I have pointed out  just  now,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, we are going to face leaders like  the

Member  for  Thomson and his colleagues who  try  :o

manipulate the unions for political purposes. But as

far  as  the workers are concerned, we are all  with

them  to  better  their  terms  and  conditions   of

service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, we are very glad

indeed  that the Member for Thomson has  moved  this

motion.  This shows that we have been successful  in

implementing  our  pro-labour policy.  There  is  no

cause for us to be alarmed. That is why he is  in  a

very  difficult  position to hoodwink  the  workers.

According to his own interpretation, the fundamental

rights  of the workers mean that the workers  should

group   together  and  they  should  be   used   and

manipulated  by  the pro-Communists  for  their  own

ends. But right from the beginning, we have made  it

very  clear that we are going to see that the  trade

union  movement  is  going to be  developed  into  a

national  independent trade union movement  for  the

betterment  of the workers and not for anti-national

elements to make use of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has mentioned the Harbour

Board  case.  This is also another  example  of  why

because the pro-Communists have failed to control  a

union  for political purposes, they have made a  hue

and  cry over it. They raise this up not because  of

the  interests of the 10,000 workers.  They  do  not

care  two hoots whether the workers' conditions  are

improved.  Well,  I will prove it. There  are  facts

down here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I will briefly deal with the

deregistration of the Singapore Harbour Board  Staff

Association. In October 1962, the Registrar of Trade

Unions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>



inquired into the affairs of the Association. It was

found  that  the  Association  had  committed   many

breaches of the Trade Unions Ordinance and  its  own

rules and constitution. The inquiry also reviewed  a

case   of   misappropriation  of   $7,634   of   the

Association's  funds. Following investigations  into

the  Registrar of Trade Unions' report made on  12th

October,   the  police  arrested  the  Association's

General  Secretary, Jamit Singh, and the  Treasurer,

Yeow  Fook Yin, and later charged them in Court with

criminal breach of trust. After a trial of  23  days

in  the  First Criminal District Court, both accused

were  convicted  on 1st of March.  Jamit  Singh  was

gaoled  for 18 months and Yeow Fook Yin nine months.

However, they have given notice of appeal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 26th October, the Registrar of Trade Unions

served  a notice on the Association calling upon  it

to  show  cause why its certificate of  registration

should  not be cancelled for having committed  eight

breaches   of  the  law  and  its  own   rules   and

constitution. The eight breaches are as follows -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think we should go

into  those details. There were breaches and I think

we  do  not want to list the eight breaches. We  are

not debating the cancellation of registration of the

Harbour Board Association. I think the fact  of  the

cancellation  is  sufficient. The  reasons  for  the

cancellation, yes, but not too many details.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> As you wish, Mr Speaker, Sir.

In  case the Member for Thomson would like to obtain

more details, I will reiterate them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Association submitted a lengthy memorandum

in reply to the Registrar of Trade Union's notice to

show   cause.  As  the  memorandum  contained   many

inaccuracies  and inconsistencies,  an  inquiry  was

held  in accordance with the provisions of the Trade

Union  Ordinance on the 15th and 16th of January  by

the R.T.U. to give the Association an opportunity to

clarify   these  inaccuracies  and  inconsistencies.

However,  the R.T.U. was compelled to call  off  the

inquiry because at the two meetings, the officers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>



of the Association were not only unwilling to answer

questions,   but  also  deliberately  concerted   to

disrupt  the proceedings. The Association was  given

another  opportunity on 18th January and  a  further

opportunity  on 11th February to clarify  the  major

inaccuracies and inconsistencies in its  memorandum.

Up  to  date  the Association has not done  so.  The

cancellation  of  the Association's  certificate  of

registration was therefore made last week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on the point of the mystery of the new

Committee  and the old Committee, as the Member  for

Thomson  put  it, Mr Speaker, Sir. On the  15th  of

November,  1962,  the  Association  elected  a   new

Executive  Council. Immediately this  new  Executive

Council  was elected a member later filed a writ  of

summons  in the High Court asking that the elections

be  declared  null and void. This  action  is  still

pending.  Therefore, under those circumstances,  the

Board  and the R.T.U. could not recognise  which  is

the  regular  and  legal body  that  represents  the

workers.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, I will  go  on  to  the

claims later on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the Member for Thomson's allegation that

because the Prime Minister or the Government  failed

to  control  the  Harbour Board  Staff  Association,

therefore, it has to take this action, this  is  not

true.  Why? For instance, the holding of the  annual

general meetings. This Association for the past four

years has failed to hold any meeting to elect office-hearers.  And mind you, Mr Speaker, Sir, a reminder

was  sent  to  the Secretary General, that  is,  Mr

Jamit   Singh  (who  proclaimed  that  he  had   the

interests  of  the workers) on the 5th of  November,

1959,  informing him that his Association had failed

to  hold  a  general election to elect  new  office-bearers.  That  is  a provision  laid  down  in  his

Union's  constitution. Again, on the 9th of January,

1960, a further reminder was served on the Secretary-General  informing  him  of the  holding  of  annual

meetings. Again it went unheeded. So, on the 2nd  of

March,  1960,  a further reminder was  sent  to  the

Secretary-General, but he still refused  to  hold  a

meeting.  This is the point, Mr Speaker, Sir.  They

know  they are going to lose control of the workers'

organisation if they do hold a meeting. They will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>



never  think  or  bear in mind what the  fundamental

rights  of  the workers mean. No, to them,  that  is

immaterial.  As  long as their interests  are  being

served,  that  is,  as  long as  they  can  maintain

control  of  the organisation, to their  minds,  the

fundamental  rights of the workers are being  upheld

and maintained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from not holding an annual general meeting

every  year, the Secretary-General, Mr Jamit Singh,

also  failed  to submit to the members  and  to  the

Registrar  of  Trade  Unions  the  yearly  financial

accounts.  You will remember, Sir, he was prosecuted

during the term of office of the previous Government

for failing to submit the accounts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, briefly, these are the causes why the Registrar had to step in to regularise the position. Of course, for the Government, this is a matter of concern. For the past few years, these people have not only failed to allow the workers to run their own organisations, but they have been making use of them for their own political purposes and have

neglected the interests of the workers. Now they are

talking  about  the  interests of  the  workers  and

asking for more pay and better conditions of service

for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now my colleagues, the Deputy Speaker and the Member for Kampong Kapor, have pointed out how this claim came about. During the Anson by-election, the Member for Thomson and all his colleagues decided to part with us because we were going to seriously and sincerely seek the

achievement of the establishment of Malaysia. So  in

order  to  find an opportunity to rally the  workers

round  to their side, they therefore made out a  set

of  demands to serve on the Harbour Board.  This  is

just  another  cover  to show  that  they  have  the

interests  of  the workers at heart. So  during  the

Anson  by-election, they served the  claims  of  the

workers on the Harbour Board and made a hue and  cry

about it. Chok Koh Thong, one of the members in  the

Executive  Committee, who was then on our  side  and

also an official on our Election Committee, bad been

treacherously making use of this issue to betray  us

in that by-election, and as a result -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have tried to follow the

Parliamentary Secretary very closely, but  I  cannot

see  how that part of his speech has any bearing  on

the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have to

make  this  point in order to refute the  allegation

made  by  the Member for Thomson that the Government

and  the Prime Minister want to get control  of  the

union and also to frustrate the workers' attempt  to

better  their  terms and conditions of  service.  So

when  the  claims were served, negotiations  started

and  agreement was reached on almost  all  of  them,

except  on three or four items, but after the  Anson

by-election the Secretary-General and the Member for

Thomson  just conveniently forgot about  them.  Then

again  at the time of the National Referendum,  this

issue was revived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again in this instance, when we are coming to the

realisation of Malaysia, the Member for  Thomson  is

again  trying  to  make use of this  opportunity  to

create industrial unrest. Now here is the point, Mr

Speaker, Sir. The Member for Thomson always makes  a

solemn  pledge  to  this  House  that  he  maintains

industrial peace with justice and he wants  to  make

use   of  the  State  machinery  to  resolve   trade

disputes.  He is fully aware that this  dispute  had

been  directed  to  arbitration,  and  there  is   a

provision  in  the  Industrial  Relations  Ordinance

which  states that if the Court takes cognisance  of

the  dispute,  then  no further  industrial  action,

either  on the part of the employer or the employee,

can  be  taken. So there you are, Mr Speaker,  Sir.

The  Member for Thomson, who outwardly proclaims  to

protect  the interests of the workers, is trying  to

mislead the 10,000 workers into defying the law  and

thereby  suffer the consequences. He claims to  look

after  the  interests  of the  workers.  During  the

period when the notice was served on the Association

to  call  for  an  explanation why the  cancellation

should  be  withdrawn, if his colleague,  Mr  Jamit

Singh, failed to make a case out of it, why did  not

the  Member  for  Thomson,  if  he  really  had  the

interests of the workers at heart, help him



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>



to make out a case to withdraw the cancellation. No,

Mr Speaker, Sir. The Member for Thomson did not  do

that.  And  here again he talked about  negotiations

and said that there are two Committees. In fact, the

workers have filed a motion in the Court against the

validity  of  the  new Committee. This  is  a  fact.

Nevertheless, he still tries to deceive the  workers

by  saying that they still have a legal and  regular

Committee  and  that the Board should recognise  it.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, in that case, the Harbour  Board

will  have to over-ride the Court and recognise this

new  Committee.  And he is the man who  always  says

that he is law-abiding, that we are undemocratic and

that we always go above the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the cancellation of this Association, if the

Member for Thomson was really serious, he could have

answered the nine questions that were posed  to  the

Association  to  answer.  If  he  had  done  so  and

sincerely made an effort to regularise the position,

the   Registrar   of   Trade   Unions   might   have

reconsidered  the case and the deregistration  might

not  have been necessary. But no, Mr Speaker,  Sir.

He  did  not  do this. He asked the workers - and  by

making use of Mr Markandu - to do something irregular

and illegal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have dwelt at length on refuting the allegations made by the Member for Thomson. The main purpose of this motion is to smear those people who really sacrifice a lot of their time to work for the interest of the workers such as, as he mentioned just now, Mr Gomez, the

Secretary-General  of  the  Singapore   Manual   and

Mercantile Workers Union. The Barisan know that  the

Singapore  Manual and Mercantile Workers Union  have

been  sincerely  and  diligently  working  for   the

interest  of the workers and it is because  of  this

effort that this union has increased its membership -



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta):</b> On a point of

order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> Do we have a quorum?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We do not have it quorum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice taken that thirteen Members were not

present,  Members  summoned as  if  for  a  division

pursuant to the Standing Order, and meeting  resumed

upon a quorum being then present.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will

conclude  my speech. With the formation of  Malaysia

and  the materialisation of our economic development

plan  in  the  offing, the ground is ready  for  the

establishment  of  a  healthy  industrial  relations

through  which  the  present  Government  policy  of

industrial peace with justice will blossom and  bear

fruit to the best benefit of our workers. I wish  to

alert  our  working brothers and sisters  that  they

should  always be vigilant against the  hypocritical

clamouring of the anti-national elements,  as  these

anti-national  elements know  that  they  have  been

defeated  in this round of the battle for  Malaysia.

But  we  must always be prepared to meet any renewed

attack  before 31st August, and there  will  be  the

grim long-term battle thereafter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, this motion in the names  of  the

Member   for  Thomson  and  the  Member  for   Upper

Serangoon bears an old stamp. The language  used  is

singularly the same as in previous motions submitted

by  Members  belonging to the Barisan Sosialis.  The

basic  substance  is  no different.  The  intent  is

common.  And what is more, the tone and the language

is tense. There does riot seem to be any relaxation,

let alone any change, in their approach to the whole

situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the motion, among other things, speak of the

disruption  of  trade unions and the  furthering  of

P.A.P. interests.  This motion is  clearly  a  pro-Communist   manoeuvre.  It  seeks  to  condemn   the

Government  because the Government  is  supposed  to

have disrupted trade union activity inimical to  its

own  interests. The pro-Communist adventurers in the

Barisan  Sosialis can thank their lucky  stars  that

they  are still living under a democratic system  of

government where



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>



they can still make use of their democratic right to

fight the parliamentary system of democracy. If  the

Singapore Government had wanted to abuse its powers,

there  would  not  have been a single  pro-Communist

union in existence in Singapore today. It would have

been  the  easiest thing in the world to stifle  and

liquidate Communist unions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> You dare not do that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Yet the people know that such

has  not  been  the case. The people know  that  the

Government  has given full freedom to  trade  unions

led  by  pro-Communists, to function under the  law.

And where these pro-Communist unions have failed  to

comply  with the law, Government may be  obliged  to

step in to see that they do recognise the law. If it

does  not  do  this,  it would  be  failing  in  its

responsibility of governing the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, lengthy reference was made by the Member for Thomson to the cancellation of the registration of the Singapore Harbour Board Staff Association and various false political motives were given except the real reasons. The certificate of registration of the Singapore Harbour Board Staff

Association  was  cancelled because the  Association

had  contravened the Trade Unions Ordinance and  the

Association's  own rules and constitution  on  eight

grounds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These eight grounds are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Association had wilfully, after repeated

notices   from   the  Registrar,   contravened   the

provisions  of  section  44  of  the  Trade   Unions

Ordinance  for failing to submit its annual  returns

for the financial years 1960/61 and 1961/62.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The General-Secretary of the Association had

contravened  the  provisions of section  44  of  the

Trade   Unions  Ordinance  and  Rule   11   of   the

Association's  rules for failing to deliver  to  the

members  of  the Association audited  statements  of

account for the financial years 1960/61 and 1961/62.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The Treasurer of the Association had

contravened  the  Association's  Rule  11  (e)    for

failing to prepare monthly financial statements.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The accounts of the Association for the year

1961/62   had  not  been  audited  by  the  internal

auditors in contravention of the Association's  Rule

12.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The Executive Council of the Association had

failed  to  exercise proper control and  supervision

over the duties of the General-Secretary as required

under the Association's Rule 10 (b) .



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The officers of the Association had, from time

to  time,  on  matters of importance  affecting  the

Association, passed resolutions by a show of  hands,

contrary to the Association's Rule 15 which requires

such matters to be decided by secret ballot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) The constitution of the Association's present

Executive  Council is unlawful, as  the  Association

had  not held an annual general meeting to elect new

officers    for   four   consecutive    years,    in

contravention of its Rule 8.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) The funds of the Association had been expended

in  an unlawful manner and its Executive Council had

failed  in  its duty to protect union funds  against

extravagance  and/or  misappropriation  as  required

under Rule 10 (f) .



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the S.H.B. Staff Association was unable to answer these eight charges. When an inquiry was arranged to give the Association opportunities to reply to these charges of contravening against the law and the Association's rules and constitution, the officers of the

Association  were  not  only  unwilling  to   answer

questions - probably because they could not answer the

questions    - but   deliberately    disrupted    the

proceedings of the inquiry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson yesterday accused the Government of using the Police against the strikers of Sassoon Company. This is one of those stock charges regularly used by the Communists. Mr Speaker, Sir, the allegation is untrue. There was a strike in this company on 21st

July,  1960. The strikers, however, refused to leave

the  premises after its normal closing hours. On the

advice of the State Advocate-General's Chambers that

the  strikers were committing trespass, the strikers

were politely advised by the police to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>



leave the premises and to come again and picket  the

next   day.  The  repeated  advice  of  the  police,

however,  was ignored and the police were eventually

forced  to take seven strikers to the Central Police

Station.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On arrival at the police station, the leader of

the  strikers feigned illness anti alleged  that  he

was  assaulted by the police. He refused to sit  and

preferred  to  lie on the ground  and  roll  on  the

floor.  Seeing this, another striker also complained

of  assault by the police, and he too rolled on  the

floor. The police immediately summoned the ambulance

to  take  the  two  complainants  to  the  hospital.

However,  when  the  ambulance  arrived,  these  two

strikers  refused to go to hospital as  they  wanted

their   union   representatives  to  witness   their

condition. About 15 minutes later Messrs. Lim  Ching

Siong, S. Woodhull, and Fong Swee Suan arrived. They

interviewed the strikers and persuaded them to go to

the General Hospital for a check-up. So an ambulance

was  called  a second time, to the inconvenience  of

everybody  concerned. Even then on  arrival  at  the

hospital  one of the complainants changed  his  mind

and refused to be examined by the doctor. A few days

later,  when I had the occasion to meet Mr Woodhull

and   challenged  him  as  to  the  truth   of   the

allegations  of assault made by these two  strikers,

he  laughed heartily and had to admit that they were

rather childish in making such allegations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Mr Speaker, Sir, there was the

famous case of the Roneo Company strike in which the

President  and  Secretary of the Singapore  Business

Houses  Employees' Union were charged and  convicted

in  Court  for assaulting non-strikers and customers

who  had  burning cigarette butts pressed  on  their

necks.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  who  were  the  violent

aggressors? Not the police. The police were there to

safeguard the right of ordinary people to  work  and

to  ensure peace in society. Mr Speaker, Sir, it is

becoming  clear  that what the  Member  for  Thomson

meant   by  disruption  of  trade  unions  is  quite

something else. As



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>



I   have  said,  there  is  nothing  to  show   that

Government is doing anything to shut down unions led

by the pro-Communists. This disruption that they are

worried  and concerned about is none other than  the

steady  flow of workers from the unions led by  them

into  the ranks of non-Communist unions. If  anybody

is  disrupting the pro-Communist unions, it  is  the

workers who, having realised that the pro-Communists

and  anti-national  elements  in  their  unions  are

making use of them for their own political ends, are

now  determined to free themselves from the grip  of

the  pro-Communists and anti-national elements. Ever

since  1962  more than 5,000 workers  and  38  union

branches  have  broken away from  the  pro-Communist

S.A.T.U. to  the side of democratic  trade  unions.

These  pro-Communists have only themselves to  blame

if  large  numbers  of workers are disrupting  their

sinister  political designs. Surely they  must  know

that they cannot mislead the workers all the time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if it were not for the fact that the Government has faith in the ultimate wisdom of workers, it would itself be complaining about the disruption of unions in Singapore. As is well known, it is the policy of the Government that whenever union representation in any particular place of

employment is in question, recourse is made  to  the

holding  of  a  secret  ballot  to  determine   such

representation.  Very recent cases have  shown  that

this  provision in the State machinery has, in fact,

resulted  in  an  advantage  to  some  of  the  pro-Communist  unions  under  the  control  of  S.A.T.U.

Secret  ballots taken among workers in the Singapore

Plywood  Company and the C. K. Tang Co.  Ltd, have

resulted  in  a  victory for the S.A.T.U. group  of

unions. Sir, the unions which have lost as a  result

of  this  recourse  to the secret  ballot  have  not

uttered one word of complaint. Surely this cannot be

the  use  of  State machinery for the disruption  of

trade  unions, as is so vehemently contended in  the

pro-Communist  motion  submitted  by  S.A.T.U.   The

Member for Thomson knows this very well.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now wish to deal with that part of the pro-Communist motion about the registration of the

Singapore Association of Trade Unions. Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  time is running out for all anti-national  and

pro-Communist  elements  in Singapore.  Malaysia  is

around  the  corner.  In the  past  the  doings  and

utterances  of leaders of S.A.T.U. have only  helped

to  confirm  their  anti-national and  pro-Communist

character.   Their  anti-Malaysia  and   anti-merger

postures  prove that they are working in  line  with

foreign forces which are also anti-Malaysia and anti-merger. They have repeated the anti-Malaysia slogans

of  alien  and  foreign forces hostile to  Malaysian

nationalism. Under the circumstances, do they expect

people  to  make  them out to be  other  than  anti-nationals and pro-Communists? Or do they think  that

the  Government  and the people are blind  to  their

anti-national activities? If the Member for  Thomson

wants  S.A.T.U. to  be registered,  he  had  better

convince the Internal Security Council, and soon the

Minister  for  Internal  Security  of  the   Federal

Government  of  Malaysia, that his S.A.T.U. is  not

foreign-inspired   and   not   a   Communist   front

organisation.  He had better take a  lead  from  Mr

Dange, the Secretary-General of the Communist  Party

of  India, who realises that in the face of  foreign

hostility and foreign aggression, national interests

must supersede ideological considerations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson can rest assured for a long

time  to  come  that the Government is  a  patriotic

Government and that it will do nothing to register a

group  of unions which constitute a Communist  front

organisation and whose leaders have their ears tuned

to foreign centres for inspiration and guidance. The

Member  for Thomson must never deceive himself  into

believing that any government in the world will ever

allow or encourage internal forces hostile to itself

to  work in conjuction with foreign elements to down

the government. Only traitors will try to do such  a

thing. The Government and the people of this country

will ensure that this type of treachery will not  be

permitted,  and  if there is the slightest  evidence

that it is going to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>



perpetrated, then it will be the Governmen's bounden

duty to prevent it well before it is carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, S.A.T.U. is supposed to be an association of trade unions with trade union objectives. Not only is it political in origin, but since its formation its activities clearly show that its major interest is political. Its main preoccupation is to bring about the downfall of the

Government, to frustrate merger, and to prevent  the

establishment of Malaysia. It does not even  attempt

to  hide  its  true aims. The record  of  S.A.T.U.'s

affiliated unions on labour matters confirms  beyond

a  shadow of doubt that they want to bring  about  a

state  of  unrest and later a state  of  chaos  with

which  they  hope  to  bring  down  the  Government,

leading  to  a  halt  progress  towards  merger  and

Malaysia.  As  a  result of their  sabotage  of  our

industrial progress for political reasons, thousands

of  workers have lost their jobs and countless young

men  and women have been deprived of their prospects

for work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, post-war

history  in most Afro-Asian nations have shown  that

those  countries which have won their  freedom  from

colonial   domination   have   realised   that    no

fundamental rights can be conceded to those  who  do

not  recognise fundamental obligations of patriotism

and national interest.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the Member for Thomson remember that the

Government  is not the first in Asia or  Africa  nor

will  it  be the last to take stringent and positive

measures  against  anti-patriotic and  anti-national

elements who are prepared to sell their country  and

their  people to foreigners. Mr Ben Bella has  done

it;  Mr Nehru has done it; Prince Sihanouk has done

it, and we shall not hesitate to do it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like very much if the Member for Thomson

can give examples of the fundamental rights provided

for  the  Opposition  in totalitarian  countries  of

which  he  and  his colleagues in the  S.A.T.U. are

apparently  great admirers. The Member  for  Thomson

knows very well that it is not at all likely that he

will be able to introduce a motion like this in  any

of   the   countries  from  which   he   draws   his

inspiration. Even if he tried to, he would  probably

be  lined up against the hard wall and shot. In this

country, he knows of course he will not be shot  for

tabling  a motion like this, and that. Mr  Speaker,

is  the  irony of it all. Under this Government,  he

can  table  a motion and still sit there comfortably

and enjoy, and make another speech at the end of it.

This  fundamental right is also extended to him  and

other  pro-Communist elements to form organisations,

hold  rallies,  demonstrations,  print  and  publish

journals  and other literature. But let  the  Member

for  Thomson give examples of these rights  provided

for  the  Opposition  in the totalitarian  countries

which  he admires so much. The Member knows that  so

long  as he issues his union publications to advance

labour  and union matters and protect the  interests

of  workers,  then the right will be recognised  and

respected.  But he also knows that if any  of  these

rights  are  misused and abused by using  them,  for

instance,   to   disseminate   political    material

prejudicial to our national interests and calculated

to  help  foreign  forces hostile  to  the  national

interests, then these rights must be denied them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Government is committed to the

encouragement of a free, democratic and  independent trade union

movement in the State as an essential



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>



prerequisite for the success of its social, economic

and  industrial policies. However, as the  Director-General of the International Labour Organisation has

observed in his Report to the I.L.O. Conference held

in  Geneva in June 1963, the paramount consideration

of  any  government must be the preservation of  the

security  of the State against foreign-inspired  and

anti-patriotic elements. This is what the  Director-General has said on page 25 of his Report under  the

heading "Political Conditions" and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The first imperative for government is the

preservation  of the state, of public order  and  of

the political conditions for carrying out any policy

whether  in  economic, social or other  fields.  The

problems  of maintaining political stability  are  a

greater  claim upon the attention and the  resources

of  leaders  in many newly emergent nations  and  in

other  countries as well than they may he in certain

of the historically longer established states.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this statement of the Director- General of the I.L.O. fits us to perfection. The Government of Singapore is a patriotic Government hut finds itself in a situation in which it has to deal with dangerous anti-national elements. Some of these anti-national elements happen to be trade

unionists who have allowed themselves to become sub-servient tools of foreign powers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all law-abiding states deny rights of association to criminals. Similarly, all states which value their national integrity and independence must of necessity be obliged to deny rights of association to anti-patriotic elements who look for inspiration from foreign sources. However,

for  all practical purposes, the fundamental  rights

of association as contained in the I.L.O. Convention

No.  84  is,  in fact, implemented in  Singapore  in

respect  of  the  free, independent  and  democratic

trade  union  movement in the State.  This  Assembly

might  do well to remember that the democratic trade

union  movement in Singapore is very often  at  odds

with  the  Government, but for them  the  rights  of

association and assembly are guaranteed for they  do

not endanger national security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson knows that

he is not going to get away with it. He  knows that every



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>



word  in this pro-Communist motion which goes  under

his  name is downright hypocrisy to which no one who

believes in democracy will concede. The only  reason

left  for having brought this old, old song is  that

the  Member for Thomson enjoys the freedom to  waste

the  precious time of this House just because he and

his  friends  have  to  wait  for  orders  from  the

Communist underground.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I oppose this motion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Does any other Member wish to speak?

No.? Mr Bani in reply.



<br><br>5.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it always amuses me to

see the great display of hypocrisy of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first of all, I would like to deal with the

Communist bogey which is being raised once again. We

have  told  them in the past and we tell them  again

that  if  they  accuse us of being Communists,  pro-Communists,  Communist sympathisers, they  have  all

the  courts they need, they have all the  laws  they

want.  They can take us to the courts, have an  open

fair  trial and prove that we are Communists. Having

proved  that, they can lock us up and we say, "Well,

fair  enough." But not to lock up 134  chaps  simply

because  the Minister for Finance, the Minister  for

Home  Affairs,  the Prime Minister, three  gentlemen

from  the  British High Commission and the  Minister

for  Internal Security in the Federation think  that

we are security risks to this country!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is hypocritical for anybody on the P.A.P.

side to say that we are anti-nationalists. A man who

is pro-national must necessarily have a love for his

country.  He  must  be prepared  to  fight  for  the

integrity  of  his  country. He must  be  patriotic.

These people who sit across the Floor are right  now

selling the country to the British colonialists  and

the   imperialists,   and   they   call   themselves

patriotic!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first thing any patriot ought to do is to

fight  for the freedom of the country, as Mr  Nehru

did. They have the cheek to stand up and quote names



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>



like   Pandit  Nehru,  Ben  Bella,  Soekarno.   Sir,

Soekarno  fought  for years. He  took  up  arms  and

fought  for the independence of Indonesia.  Mr  Lee

Kuan Yew, our Prime Minister, has not even spent ten

seconds  in  prison. Sir, which anti-colonialist  in

this  world has independence without going to  gaol?

Nehru  - 10 years and over! Soekarno, Ben Bella!  And

these  men  who sell the interest of the country  to

the   British,   Americans,  foreign   powers,   and

colonialists who have exploited and seek to  further

exploit  it  by having a constitutional  arrangement

which will give covert control to the British,  call

themselves patriotic!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, secondly, this question of S.A.T.U. being

political.  I say with no reservation that  S.A.T.U.

is   political,  that  S.A.T.U. trade  unions   are

political.  There is no qualification.  We  are  not

hypocrites  like  Mr Devan Nair. It  is  true  that

S.A.T.U. unions are anti-Malaysia.  We  have  never

made  this  a  secret.  It is hypocritical  for  the

Government  to  suggest that to be anti-Malaysia  is

political,  to  be  pro-Malaysia is  not  political.

Devan   Nair,  the  N.T.U.C. come  out   supporting

Malaysia.  The Prime Minister goes to London;  Devan

Nair  sends  a letter to all N.T.U.C. unions  asking

them  to  go  to  the  Airport to  express  support.

N.T.U.C. unions  have  often  come  out  supporting

Malaysia.  In  their  logic,  Mr  Speaker,  if  you

express  support for Malaysia, it is  non-political.

If  you  say you are anti-Malaysia, it is political.

Sir,  I  do  not have to waste my time dealing  with

such  hypocrisy. The S.A.T.U. unions  are  political

because  we  believe that over 90 per  cent  of  the

population  are  composed  of  workers   and   their

families,  and  trade  unions  as  organisations  of

workers  in  a  society  must  necessarily  interest

themselves in the political affairs of the  country.

Nobody  can  tell the workers not to  be  political.

Those  who tell the workers not to be political  are

people  like  the colonialists and big business  who

have  fear  of  the majority of the  people  in  the

country. Sir, the trade unions in the S.A.T.U. group

are  political. There is one difference between  the

P.A.P. type  of political activities in  the  trade

unions and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>



S.A.T.U. type, and this is a fact that is borne out.

While  they  believe that the trade  union  movement

must  be  part and parcel of the P.A.P., while  they

believe  that  the trade union movement  must  be  a

subsidiary organisation of the P.A.P., the  S.A.T.U.

unions  believe  in  being an independent  socialist

organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kapor is not here. He

knows,  Mr Devan Nair knows, the Member for Kallang

knows  and  Ow  Kheng  Thor, the  Deputy  Secretary-General  of  A.U.P.E. knows. Four  members  of  the

T.U.C. secretariat. They know very well  why  there

was a crisis in the T.U.C. Secretariat. It is all in

the  record, in black and white. The Prime  Minister

wanted  to make the T.U.C. a subsidiary organisation

of the P.A.P. in 1960. We were in the P.A.P. at that

time and we said no. That is a fact. Minutes of  the

T.U.C.  Secretariat meetings, which I have,  can  be

published.  Minutes of meetings of  the  Secretariat

with  the Prime Minister can be published. When  the

Member  for  Hong Lim was expelled, the  Secretariat

was  intimidated into issuing a statement in  favour

of  the  ruling Party, all over a matter  which  was

purely   internal  party  politics,  and  which   we

resisted; and we were threatened that if we did  not

do  that, the T.U.C. would be closed down. These men

want to call themselves independent democratic trade

unionists. I say this is hypocrisy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Culture, who is also not

here  now, once told me in the presence of the  full

Secretariat  - 10 members, including Devan  Nair  and

the  Member for Kampong Kapor - that if there  was  no

P.A.P. there would be no T.U.C.; and this again  is

in the record.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not believe that the trade union movement

must  become  a  tool  of .my  political  Party.  We

believe  that  trade  unions  as  organisations   of

workers,   as  organisations  which  represent   the

majority  of  the  people,  the  majority  of  human

beings, the majority of the people who compose  the

electorate,  must interest themselves  in  political

developments, must   give  expression   to   their

political feelings and must be politically



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>



active. Unlike the N.T.U.C. and the P.A.P., we  have

never  hidden this from the members of  our  unions.

When   the  P.A.P. became  anti-labour,  anti-trade

unions,  we did not hesitate to come out openly  and

condemn them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs says that

fundamental  rights  must be deprived  from  certain

individuals.  Now,  I say this,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

either you are a democrat or you are not a democrat.

The  Minister talks about what happens in  so-called

totalitarian  countries. Sir, none of  us  from  the

Barisan  Sosialis and none of us from  the  S.A.T.U.

unions  have ever asked the Singapore Government  to

set  up  a totalitarian government in Singapore.  We

have   never   preached  the   establishment   of   a

totalitarian  government as the  Minister  for  Home

Affairs suggests. Our starting point has always been

democracy,  and  democracy  must  mean  the   people

deciding  freely what they want. Democracy does  not

mean  the  Minister for Home Affairs  arrogating  to

himself   the  right  to  decide  who  should   have

fundamental rights to exercise. Democracy  does  not

mean  that  a  handfull of discredited,  power-crazy

individuals can decide what is good for the  people.

Anybody  in  Singapore can examine our  records  and

they  will  find from the very beginning till  today

our  claims  and demands have been on the  basis  of

democracy.  We  opposed  the  Referendum   Bill   as

undemocratic.  We  said we wanted  a  constitutional

arrangement to let the people freely decide. General

elections - we say you do not manipulate; let that  be

under United Nations supervision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Harbour Board Staff Association. Mr Speaker,

Sir, the Association called for a general meeting of

all  its  members  on the 15th July,  1963, on  the

grounds of the Singapore Railway Recreation Club  so

that  the  workers  could decide  freely  and  in  a

democratic manner whether they should take a  strike

decision if the demand for recognition was not  met.

The police banned that meeting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every single demand that we have made has been on

the  basis  of democracy. Sir, we believe  in  true,

open, free and fair competition with all political



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>



forces,  be they Fascist, opportunist, or Right-wing

reactionary. We believe we can eliminate the  forces

of  reaction and colonialism. We believe that  in  a

free  and fair competition the people will naturally

choose socialism and democracy. It is because we are

confident  in this belief that we are not afraid  of

democracy,  that we are not afraid  of  giving  them

citizenship status, not afraid of their having their

trade  union  meetings. We are  not  afraid  of  the

N.T.U.C. unions coming out supporting Malaysia.  We

are  not  afraid  because we are  confident  of  our

convictions. We are confident that we are right.  We

are confident that truth will triumph. I venture  to

suggest,  Mr  Speaker,  that  in  the  history   of

mankind,   it  is  those  who  do  not   have   this

confidence,  those  who do not have  the  confidence

that  in a free and fair competition they will stand

a  chance,  that  they indulge in undemocratic  acts

cancel trade unions, deregister trade unions,  deny

registration,  deprive citizenship, lock  up  people

without  trial, it is these people who do  not  have

confidence that they can beat their opponents  in  a

free  competition  who indulge  in  repression,  and

history is full of such examples.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to spend a few minutes to try to

answer  one  or two points raised by the  Government

speakers. First of all, Mr Speaker, the Member  for

Kampong  Kapor and the Member for Telok Blangah.  It

is  well  known in Singapore today that the  Members

for  Kampong Kapor and Telok Blangah are  trying  to

ride  on two horses at the same time. This is a very

difficult  job.  They cannot do  tight-rope  walking

unless  they are prepared to get their necks  broken

one  of  these days. Sir, they are, sooner or later,

going to quit the P.A.P. and come out and save their

independence,  more independent  than  the  N.T.U.C.

trade  unionists and, therefore, now they are laying

the  basis. They say, "You know, the Prime  Minister

may  be  wrong; he must not go to the Harbour Board.

But  the  S.A.T.U. chaps also must  not  go  to  the

Harbour Board." This is elementary politics. We know

how  the Member for Kampong Kapor had difficulty  in

dealing with Government over the nurses' strike.  We

know how he had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>



difficulty  in  dealing  with  Government  over  the

police  strike;  and the motion says,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  "non-P.A.P. unions". By non-P.A.P. unions,  we

mean   unions  which  are  not  submissive  to   the

Government,  which  are not controlled  and  led  by

Government men. As far as the A.U.P.E. is concerned,

the  Union of the Member for Kampong Kapor no  doubt

was   at  one  time  completely  controlled  by  the

Government.  The Member for Kampong  Kapor  was  the

blue-eyed boy of the Prime Minister, and that is how

he  got  elected as Secretary-General of the T.U.C.;

he   was  the  most  acceptable  man  to  the  Prime

Minister.  Lim  Ching Siong could not be  Secretary-General because his conviction was stronger than the

Member  for  Kampong Kapor. But recently  there  has

been  some trouble inside the P.A.P. and the  Member

for  Kampong Kapor is not on the right side. He  has

been  fighting  against  the Government,  calling  a

nurses'  strike, a police strike. He wanted to  call

the midwives out on strike; the dispute was referred

to  the  Arbitration Court. He has  now  called  the

Tamil Murasu strike and God knows what other strikes

he will call in future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if these people, particularly the Member for

Kampong  Kapor  and  the Member for  Telok  Blangah,

think  they  can deceive the workers  by  trying  to

appear  to  be more independent, and more democratic

than  Mr  Devan Nair and company, I think they  are

sadly  mistaken,  because, in the first  place,  Mr

Devan  Nair cannot cheat the workers and even if  he

has deceived some sections of the workers, he cannot

hope  to deceive them forever. It is interesting  to

note  from  the speeches of the Member  for  Kampong

Kapor and the Member for Telok Blangah that they did

not  deny  that the Government uses State  machinery

against certain unions. The Member for Kampong Kapor

wanted to know what were non-P.A.P. unions and  what

were  P.A.P. unions. But they did not deny  it  and

that is the confirmation of what we have said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the time when the Police civilian

personnel were out on strike, posters were put out

condemning the Government for using the police to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>



break  the  strike,  and all the hundred-odd  police

personnel  knew that the Government  was  trying  to

break  the  strike  led by the  Member  for  Kampong

Kapor.  That  was  because  the  A.U.P.E. was  fast

ceasing  to  be a P.A.P. union, and this only  gives

substance to the contents of the motion. The  Member

for Telok Blangah said that the victimisation in the

Harbour  Board at the moment is not because  of  the

Government.  He  said  that it  is  because  of  the

management.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in May, when the Prime Minister started

calling  out  the  Executive  Council  members   and

intimidated them in `in attempt to make them  accept

his  appointment of a Committee, there were not less

than   four   officials  of  the  Union   who   were

victimised.  We  know that the  citizenship  of  the

President of the Union, Mr Markandu, was withdrawn;

the  Vice-President, Mr Chan Joo Tong, was  demoted

and  transferred; an Executive Council  member,  Mr

Han  Teng  Kwang, was also demoted and  transferred;

and  two  weeks  ago, Mr Tan Kwee Tee,  who  is  an

Executive  Committee member, was dismissed.  Surely,

even  if  we  leave  out all the hundreds  of  other

workers who are being and who have been consistently

demoted, transferred, suspended and dismissed, these

four  people  could  not have been  victimised  just

because  some junior officials in the Harbour  Board

felt   like   victimising   them.   Mr   Markandu's

citizenship  was withdrawn because somebody  in  the

Harbour   Board   felt  his  citizenship   must   be

withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, events in the Harbour Board are conclusive

proof  that the Government uses the State powers  to

the  full  to advance P.A.P. interests. Mr Markandu

was  told  quite  openly that if he did  not  behave

himself, he would be put on a boat to Ceylon on  the

28th  of  this month. Perhaps, Sir, on the  28th  he

will  be  going  off.  There is no  possibility,  no

matter what the Government Members attempt to say in

this  House, to cover un the use of State  machinery

in the dispute of the Harbour Board workers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally, the Parliamentary Secretary to the

Minister for Labour and the Minister for Labour have

suggested   that   the  S.A.T.U. unions   are   not

interested  in wage increases for the workers.  This

is  utter nonsense, and they know this is not  true.

Sir,  if  they  look up the Government Gazettes  and

list  out  all the collective agreements  that  have

been  gazetted,  they will find that the  collective

agreements signed by the S.A.T.U. unions are more in

number than those signed by the N.T.U.C. Practically

every  day, the processes of negotiations  for  wage

increases and increased benefits go on and they have

not stopped.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I tell them this in conclusion. They accused

us   of  not  looking  after  the  workers,  no  pay

increases for the workers, not being interested,  we

harm  the  workers through our acts, and, therefore,

thousands   and   thousands   of   workers    become

unemployed.  This is a point which  has  been  made.

They say that thousands and thousands of workers are

leaving the S.A.T.U. and running to the N.T.U.C.  In

other  words, Mr Speaker, they are trying to  paint

this  picture  that  S.A.T.U. is  on  the  verge  of

collapse, unpopular, and if this were true, why deny

us  our right to organise? If, in fact, S.A.T.U. is

unpopular  because it is led by big monsters  called

Communists,  thousands of workers become unemployed,

we  use  workers as political pawns, why  are  they

afraid  In allow S.A.T.U. even to call one  meeting?

We  challenged them last time to allow us to call  a

S.A.T.U. public rally in Hong Lim Green.  We  chose

Hong Lim Green particularly, because the Member  for

Hong  Lim  recently  has been  trying  to  flex  his

muscles at us. So it would be appropriate if we hold

a  rally  at  Hong Lim Green. And we have challenged

the  Government. We have had no reply. Mr  Speaker.

They say that we are given democratic rights. Police

permits  for  meetings are not granted!  As  far  as

possible,  they try to prevent them. The publication

of  the General Employees' Union, Suara Kesatuan, in

3  languages is banned. The official publication  of

the  Singapore  Business  Houses  Employees'  Union,

Bebas, is banned. Sir, no printer in Singapore dares

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>



print   the   Barisan  publication.  For   political

purposes,   they  have  given  us  a   licence   but

indirectly they have told the printers not to  print

it. And, Sir. S.A.T.U. meetings are banned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if they want to fight the giant, let the

giant loose. It is no use talking tough inside  this

Chamber  when  they  have the giant  tied  down  and

restricted.  In  spite of the denial  of  democratic

rights,  in spite of the use of State machinery,  in

spite of all the unprincipled, unethical conduct  of

the   Government,  the  progressive  working   class

movement  continues to grow, and we have  no  doubt,

whether they register S.A.T.U. or do not register



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>



S.A.T.U., whether they lock us up, we will continue

to grow in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion accordingly negatived.
