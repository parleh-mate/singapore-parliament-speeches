<br><br>10.47 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Prime Minister, Leader of the

House, Members of the Government and Members of

the, Opposition ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am honoured to be elected Speaker of this

House. I would, however, be more comfortable in the

seat below reserved for the Member for Tanglin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am consoled by the assurance that I will be

required to shoulder the responsibility for only  a

short period. Whilst I am here, I will endeavour to

discharge my duties to the best of my ability  with

patience  and  impartiality and,  I  hope,  to  the

satisfaction of both sides of the House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 6</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask all the Members to assist me to

conduct  these proceedings in accordance  with  the

rules of procedure and the Standing Orders of  this

House and, above all, with decorum.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, it is the practice

of   parliamentary  legislatures   modelled   after

Westminster  to elect a Speaker from among  Members

of the House who have, in turn, been elected by the

people.  However,  it  has  been  provided  in  the

Constitution  of  the State of Singapore  that  our

Legislature can elect as Speaker either a Member of

this  House  itself, or a person from  outside  the

House.  Your election, Mr Speaker, is  in  keeping

with our constitutional procedure and parliamentary

practice   prevailing   in  many   countries.   You

yourself, Mr Speaker, have indicated that you will

occupy the Chair for only a temporary period. It is

our  intention at a future date to elect  a  Puisne

Judge  to  the  Chair. The consent of  the  Central

Government,   who  is  now  responsible   for   the

judiciary, must of course be sought.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it has been an honour to have proposed you as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. I have no doubt that the experience you have acquired as a respected member of the Bar will stand you in good stead in your present office. You have had a distinguished academic record in your

student  days  and, if I can recollect  accurately,

you  were,  besides  being  a  scholar,  a  skilled

sportsman.  I  am told cricket was  your  favourite

game - a very fair game indeed compared to the hurly

burly  of  soccer  and  rugby  football,  in  which

sometimes   the  referee  becomes  the  object   of

uncomplimentary remarks and the target of  missiles

from the players and the gallery. You yourself, Mr

Speaker, must have umpired many a cricket  game  in

your  time,  and just as you have fairly  acted  as

umpire on the cricket pitch, we have no doubt  that

you  will also be an able umpire in this House, and

that  you  will observe that the rules of the  game

are played as indicated in the Standing Orders.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as

one who has known you



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>



for  many years, I have no doubt, as you have  said

just  now, that you will chair the sittings of this

Assembly, during the time when you are the  Speaker

or  later on when you are the Deputy Speaker,  with

fairness,  patience  and  impartiality  that   will

transcend party politics despite the fact that  you

are  a  Member  of  the Government  Party,  as  the

previous Deputy Speaker of this House who was  also

a Member of the Government had done so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we in the Opposition do mourn the loss

of  Mr  George Oehlers - the great Speaker who  has

established parliamentary democracy in  this  State

- and  we do not hesitate to say that we would  like

to  see  him  here  with  us  again,  but  that  is

something  about which we in the Opposition  cannot

do  very  much. But anyway, Mr Speaker, Sir,  with

for   many  years,  we  have  no  doubt   of   your

impartiality and we have every confidence that  you

will be able to carry out the traditions which have

been laid in this Assembly by the previous Speaker.

<div align="center"><b>ELECTION OF SENATORS</b></div>



<br><br>10.55 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Hon. Members are required to propose

and  second candidates for election as Senators  to

the Senate of the Parliament of Malaysia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, I propose that

Mr  Ko  Teck  Kin and Mr Ahmad bin Haji  Taff  be

elected as Senators to the Senate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hand the Clerk herewith written consent from

both the two gentlemen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written consent handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The statements are in order. Can I

have a seconder?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I second it.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Any other nominations? The persons

nominated  are  Mr Ko Teck Kin and Mr  Ahmad  bin

Haji Taff.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon.  Members  are entitled to vote for  at  least

two  Senators. The names of the candidates will  be

put  to  the vote in alphabetical order.  Upon  the

name  of  each Member being called, he shall  voice

his vote in the usual way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> If I may be of some

assistance to the House, I think the procedure  for

the  election of Senators provides that where there

are  no  more than two candidates being  nominated,

they could be declared as having been elected.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There is one provision which relates

to the period of office of the Senators, and though

both  are elected, the Senator obtaining more votes

serves  for  a longer period. It appears  therefore

that  we  will  have  to put  the  names  of  these

Senators to the vote.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I bow to your ruling. Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We will vote first for Mr Ko Teck

Kin.

<div align="center"><b>YANG DI-PERTUAN NEGARA'S SPEECH AT CEREMONIAL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>OPENING OF ASSEMBLY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Prime Minister)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I would like to explain briefly  why

it  has  not  been possible to have the  ceremonial

opening  of  the  Assembly with a speech  from  His

Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara at the  first

meeting  following upon the general  elections.  On

the  23rd July this year in the last Assembly,  all

the  Opposition Parties - the Barisan Sosialis,  the

Alliance,  and the United People's Party  - and  two

Independents blocked a Bill for general election of 15 Members to the Central Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are aware that the Speaker of Parliament

has   asked   us   for  the   names   of   the   15

representatives from Singapore. These Members  will

take  their  places  as Members  of  the  House  of

Representatives on 2nd November,  in  just  over  a

week's  time. It is not possible before the 2nd  of

November  to  have a speech by His  Excellency  the

Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara,  thereafter  seven  clear

days'  adjournment, followed by  a  debate  on  the

motion of thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, and

then  a Bill for the election of 15 seats - all this

to  be  completed  before 2nd  November.  We  have,

therefore, had to make an adjustment and  have,  in

today's  business session, the swearing in  of  new

Members and the passage of this Bill for 15 Members

to the Central Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After we have ascertained when the business

sittings of Parliament in Kuala Lumpur will  be  in

November  and December, the date for the ceremonial

opening  of  this Assembly will be fixed  when  His

Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara will give his

speech setting out the programme and policy of  the

Government for the next year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, the reasons given

by the Prime Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>



for  today's proceedings do not convince us in  the

Opposition. This Government was elected on the 21st

of  September,  and if they had wanted  they  could

have  had  the ceremonial opening sometime  towards

the end of September.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> A debate on a ministerial statement

is not regular. Members, however, can ask questions

arising from the contents of the statement provided

that  these  questions are phrased in the  form  of

questions and are relevant to the subject matter of

the statement. Would the Member for Hong Lim please

phrase his question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, I would like to

ask  the Prime Minister whether it was possible  to

have  a  Government formed by the 23rd or  25th  of

September  and the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's  speech

made towards the end of September and the beginning

of  October. If that could have been done, we could

have  this  Bill  to  send  15  representatives  to

Parliament  even earlier than today, which  is  the

22nd of October.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would not

wish  to quarrel with what the Member for Hong  Lim

were  to  do if he were the Government and he  were

the Prime Minister. That is the prerogative which I

would  accord him if he were in fact the leader  of

the majority Party. However, he should accord us at

least  the  courtesy of allowing us to conduct  the

affairs  of Singapore in a manner which befits  the

solemnity of the business of State which we have to

dispose  of. Ministers are not appointed at random.

Matters  of State are not disposed of in  order  to

suit  the newspapers or, for that matter, in  order

to  suit  the  opening  of the Federal  Parliament.

There   are  certain  matters  which  have  to   be

considered in their respective priorities,  and  we

consider  that the first policy statement  of  this

Government which shall he contained in the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's  speech  is  one  which  deserves

careful consideration before its delivery.

<div align="center"><b>First Reading</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I lay upon

the  table a Certificate of Urgency signed  by  the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara in respect of the Singapore

(Election to the House of Representatives) Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate of Urgency handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Certificate is in order. Please

proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

introduce a Bill intituled "An Ordinance to provide

for  the first election of Members of the House  of

Representatives of the Federation from Singapore."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Printed copies of the Bill have already been

handed to the Clerk earlier this morning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill read the First time.



<div align="center"><b>Second Reading</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Second Reading, what day?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Now, Sir, If the Clerk will

distribute copies of the Bill to hon. Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Printed copies of the Bill distributed to hon.

Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members will notice that the Bill provides

for  the  election  of 15 Members  to  the  Central

Parliament  in accordance with section  95  of  the

Malaysia Act. For the enlightenment of Members  who

were not present at the last Assembly when this Act

was  adopted, if I may read section 95 (1)   of  the

Act. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Subject to subsection (2), Part VIII of the

Constitution shall not have effect for the  purpose

of elections of members of the House



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>



of  Representatives from Singapore until the second

general  election to that House held after Malaysia

Day,  and  so long as this subsection  applies  to

those  elections  those members shall,  subject  to

subsection  (2), be elected as may be  provided  by

any law passed by the Legislature of Singapore with

the   concurrence  of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Agong

(including any law so passed before Malaysia  Day),

and the period for which they are elected should be

the   period   until  the  second  dissolution   of

Parliament after Malaysia Day.'



<br><br>Sir, Members on the Opposition side, even those who

were  not  Members  of  this Chamber  in  the  last

session, will know that the Government introduced a

Bill for the election of 15 Members direct from  15

constituencies in Singapore, such constituencies to

be  formed  by  grouping in threes  and  fours  the

existing   51   constituencies  to  form   15.   My

colleague,  the  then Minister  for  Home  Affairs,

invited  all leaders of the Opposition  Parties  to

put   up   their   proposals  as   to   how   these

constituencies  were  to  be  formed.  For   diverse

reasons,  each Party having a separate reason,  the

Opposition teamed up to defeat or, if I may be more

accurate, to prevent the passage of the Bill,  with

the votes tying on the Second Reading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the eve of nomination on the 11th of

September, I made a broadcast in which I stated  as

a  main  plank  of the Government's  platform,  the

P.A.P. platform, that the election was to  be  one

for  51 seats and also for 15 seats, the 15  to  be

elected  from the 51. I do not recall, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  having read any contrary platform  being  put

forward  by  any Opposition Party. I did,  however,

subsequently  read, when the election  results  had

been declared for the 51 seats, that the leader  of

the  Barisan  Sosialis, who is no  longer  in  this

Chamber, would now prefer to go back to 15 seats in

a direct election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish to labour this point. But it

does  not require much ingenuity, now that we  know

the  results  of  the elections on a  party  basis,

constituency by constituency, to so re-arrange  the

51 constituencies in such a way as to give a parity

of  total  votes in 15 in which the  Barisan  would

probably not win even a single seat. But that would

be   an  exercise  in  ingenuity  which  would  not

necessarily be in the interest of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>



country. We could even, by this collegiate election

which we have done and which we made an issue of at

the  elections,  like the Borneo territories,  take

all the 15 seats to ourselves. But again that would

not be in the interest of the country. It is useful

to  Malaysia and its 10 million inhabitants  to  be

constantly reminded of the presence of people  who,

whatever  they now piously say about defending  the

sovereignty  of  Malaysia, have  as  their  primary

object  the  destruction  of  the  nation  we  have

founded. I would not wish to arrogate to Members of

this  Chamber  generally the right to nominate  and

vote  for  three  Members of the Barisan  Sosialis,

because  that  is  a  matter for  them  to  decide.

Whether they would wish to send three of their most

affable  and amiable colleagues in order to  smooth

the  way  with the other 159 Members in Parliament,

or  whether  they would choose to send their  three

fiercest  ones  is a matter I leave  completely  in

their hands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would say to them that they should bear

this  in mind - that all the great issues which have

agitated  this  Chamber over the  last  nine  years

since  1955  - anti-colonialism,  abolition  of  the

Preservation   of   Public   Security    Ordinance,

denunciation  and  condemnation  of   arrests   and

detention  without  trial,  brutality  of   Fascist

police  force  - all  these burning  issues  of  the

moment  unfortunately  are  no  longer  within  the

preserve  of the jurisdiction of this Chamber.  Mr

Speaker, we meet now, as I hope from time  to  time

we will, for the more constructive if less exciting

purpose  of getting on with the job of building  an

industrial  base in Singapore, rebuilding  the  old

City  and producing the things for which the people

have elected us. There will not be the great issues

of     foreign    policy,    defence,     security,

confrontation,  all  the things  that  filled  this

Chamber with so many long hours of debate. I do not

know whether the Central Parliament will concede to

what  we  have  followed in this Chamber,  allowing

them  on one occasion, if I remember correctly,  no

less  than eight continuous hours of filibustering.

I would say it is for them to decide how they would

wish to take



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>



advantage  of the three seats that they  will  have

out of the 159 seats in the Central Parliament.  No

doubt   it  is  their  desire  and  their   express

intention to join up with other so-called Socialist

forces  in the Central Parliament. We look  forward

to  meeting them there for the exciting debates  on

security, defence and foreign affairs and  all  the

other  great  things  in  life  which  agitate  the

Communists and the pro-Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>11.35 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The

Member  for Tanjong Pagar has introduced this  Bill

known  as  the Singapore (Election to the House  of

Representatives)   Bill.  The  basic   spirit   and

principles  of this Bill, he says, are  founded  on

the  results of the State election according to the

proportion of representation of the Party in  power

and  the  Opposition to elect  15  Members  to  the

Central  Parliament. We must  point  out  that  the

P.A.P. conducted  a very unfair  and  undemocratic

general   election,  and  after  this  unfair   and

undemocratic  election,  the  P.A.P. is   tabling

another  unreasonable Bill in this House.  We  must

point  out,  in  the first place,  that  the  State

election  was  meant  for  the  election  of  State

Assemblymen. Before the election and  even  in  the

course  of  the  election in all  the  Government's

statements  and circulars and in the  platforms  of

the   various  political  Parties,  there  was   no

disclosure  of the intention to elect Members  from

the State Assembly ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I on a point of

information, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Member who was speaking

had not the advantage of being in the last Chamber.

If  I  may  more  slowly read this section  of  the

Malaysia  Act, a great deal of the written material

which he has, I am quite sure with great diligence,

compiled may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>



appear  to him to he completely irrelevant. Section

95  of  the Malaysia Act, which is adopted in  this

House,   provides   that   legislation   shall   be

introduced either before or after Malaysia  Day  in

this  Legislative Assembly for the election  of  15

Members.  We  introduced direct  elections  for  15

Members. The Bill was blocked. We then had  general

elections of 51 seats, and on the eve of nomination

we, the Government Party, made it an issue that  if

we  were  returned, a Bill would be  introduced  in

order to select 15 representatives from Members  of

this  House. The normal principle underlining  such

an  issue  is quite simple. A matter has been  made

the main plank in an election issue. The votes have

been  given,  the matter is resolved.  I  am  quite

happy to hear the Member out and answer him. But he

should  bear in mind that these points have already

been taken up in this Chamber and he has to pick up

the  argument from the fact that his own Party  had

blocked the election of 15 seats, brought about the

general elections in which we said that we  had  no

intention of repeating another general election for

15  seats  at  the expense of three-quarters  of  a

million dollars.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Member for Jurong please

proceed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Member for

Tanjong  Pagar has just now said that we  prevented

the passage of the Bill to elect 15 representatives

to  the Central Parliament. That is why this matter

was  made  an  election issue in the State  general

election.  That is why it is the intention  of  the

Government to elect from among the Members in  this

House 15 persons to the Central Parliament. I  must

point  out  that  in the last Assembly,  our  Party

opposed  the Bill known as the Singapore (Elections

to the Federal House of Representatives) Bill. That

was  a  matter  of  chronological order  which  has

nothing to do with the principles of this Bill. Our

opposition then was one matter and this Bill now is

another  matter. We must point out that  the  State

general  election was intended for  the  people  to

elect State Assemblymen. In the minds of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>



people, after the general election, there would  be

another    election    for    the    election    of

representatives to the Central Parliament. That was

the  impression the people got. It was very simple.

In the minds of the people, in the general election

they  only  had  to elect representatives  to  this

House   and  not  representatives  to  the  Central

Parliament  as  well. So, if one  is  to  base  the

representation on the results of the State  general

election  and  elect  15  Members  to  the  Central

Parliament,  then that will not be a true  election

made  by  the people, because some people who  have

elected Members to this House may not agree to  the

same  representatives  to the  Central  Parliament.

Then  some people who have not been elected to this

House   might  be  agreed  to  as  being   suitable

representatives  to  the  Central  Parliament.   So

shortly  before  the general election,  the  P.A.P.

declared that the State general election would also

be  an  election for representatives to the Central

Parliament.  But  there  was  no  mention  of   the

nomination  of representatives by the  Assembly  in

the State to the Central Parliament ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, if the Member will allow

me,  I  will  produce a copy of my broadcast  which

will  set out the issues that I placed on the  11th

of September ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of information. If the

Member  for Jurong wishes to give way to the  Prime

Minister, he may; otherwise, please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): But after the

undemocratic and unfair State general election, the

P.A.P. saw  that it was able to obtain a  majority

vote in the State general election. So according to

the proportion represented by both sides, the Party in

power is getting an advantage. That is why  the Party

in power has chosen to discard the Singapore

(Elections to the Federal House of Representatives) Bill.

Instead,  it  is now tabling  the  Singapore

(Election to the House of Representatives) Bill.

In fact, before the House was convened, the Government

declared  that it would choose 12 out of  15  seats from

the Party in power, thus giving three



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>



seats  to  the Opposition only. This is a means  to

deprive the democratic rights of the Opposition. So

we say that the Government intends to get more from

its  own  side by taking advantage of  the  present

situation  to  have  more  representatives  in  the

Central House of Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right thing to do now is to have another

election before the people, so that the people will

be  able  to elect their own representatives  truly

representing  them in the Central Parliament.  That

is why we are rising to oppose this Bill, which has

not obtained the consent of the people, to nominate

Members  from this House to the Central Parliament,

particularly  in  view of the undemocratic  general

election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to oppose this Bill all the more. We must

point  out  that  in  the  course  of  the  general

election  held  last September, the  conditions  of

competition were very disadvantageous and unfair to

the Opposition because the P.A.P. itself was making

use  of public funds to carry out propaganda  work.

The  P.A.P.  Prime  Minister was  touring  all  the

constituencies on public funds. The P.A.P. leaders

said that there is democracy in Singapore, but when

the  Opposition applied for permits  to  hold  mass

rallies,  such applications were invariably  turned

down.  After  this,  the P.A.P. all  of  a  sudden

declared  that a general election was to  be  held.

That  was to catch the Opposition unawares. So  the

P.A.P. was  put  on a more advantageous  level  as

compared  to  the  Opposition.  This  last  general

election allowed only nine days ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order. Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I do not wish to prevent the  Member

from raising anything about the last election,  but

we  are talking about the Bill for the election  of 15  Members from this Assembly. As I understand the

Standing  Orders, the debate is one  on  principle,

and  if he is against it on principle, let us  hear

why not about the last election.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I must point out

that  in  the course of the last general  election,

there was unfairness all around and there was no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>



specific  mention that the State election was  also

an    election    of   the   Central   Parliament's

representatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last general elections, the political

Parties  were  given only nine days  to  carry  out

their propaganda work. In spite of that, the P.A.P.

was  not  quite  assured. So it  also  resorted  to

further  means.  It  made  use  of  all  the  State

machinery,  the  radio,  television  and  all   the

propaganda and publicity machinery to propagate for

the  P.A.P.  In  the last few days of  the  general

election, it even went to the extent of threatening

the  people into believing that in the event of the

Barisan   Sosialis   being  elected   the   Central

Government  would  send troops to Singapore.  Those

who  worked  for  the Barisan Sosialis  by  pasting

posters  at  different places were also  threatened

with   arrest.  Some  of  our  workers  were   even

assaulted during the election campaign.  If  it  is

said  that  we had a fair and democratic  election,

why  is it that the P.A.P. was not prepared to give

up its dictatorial means? We must stress again that

before  the last State general election, the P.A.P.

and  the  colonial  Government  together  with  the

Alliance  arrested some 100 progressive  elements

of  Singapore  on the 2nd February this  year.  The

reason  for the arrests was that these people  were

agitating   for  violence  and  were   engaged   in

subversive activities. But up to the present  date,

the  Government  has not been able to  produce  any

concrete  evidence  to  prove  their  guilt.  These

people have not been tried in court ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I must ask the Member for

Jurong  to  abide by the rules of this House.  This

House  has no constitutional jurisdiction  to  talk

about security matters. I have just explained it in

the opening.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Prime Minister, the Member for

Jurong is new here. Will the Member for Jurong  try

to   confine  his  remarks  to  the  matter   under

consideration?  If we go on debating  on  the  last

election,  we  will  be here for  days.  He  should

confine himself to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>



matter  in question. If he wishes to make reference

to  the  last  election, he can  do  so  merely  in

passing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Before dealing

with  the  Bill, I have to mention that  the  State

general  election was held under most  undemocratic

and  unfair  conditions and this has  relevance  to

this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we would like to say now is that by

resorting  to various means the Government  intends

to deal the Opposition a great blow, to suppress it

so  that  the  Government will  have  a  victorious

status in the Central Parliament. So if one  is  to

base the election of representatives to the Central

Parliament  on  the  results of  the  last  general

election, then I say that such an election  is  not

representative  of the views of the people  because

the  general election was not conducted in  a  fair

and just manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to point out again that this Bill is

unreasonable by itself, it is unfair again to elect

Members   in   proportion   to   the   number    of

representatives  in this House. We  know  that  the

Party in power has 37 seats in this House and  that

it  has  some  70 per cent of the total  number  of

seats in this House, but the Government was able to

pool only about 40 per cent of the total number  of

votes  cast  in the general election;  whereas  the

Barisan  Sosialis, which has only  seven  seats  in

this  House, was able to pool more than 30 per cent

of  the total number of votes cast. That is to say,

each P.A.P. Assemblyman represents only about 7,000

people, whereas each Barisan Assemblyman represents

about  15,000 people. Therefore, it is most  unfair

if we are to elect the representatives according to

the present number of Members in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has said that the State elections were meant to return a political Party to form the Government. In other words, the political Party should elect its own representatives to the Central Parliament according to the party stand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter I would like to point out is that

three  Barisan Members have been arrested  and  two

have been ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Andrew Fong (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Andrew Fong):</b> I think the Member for

Jurong is going out of his way again. As the  Prime

Minister has explained earlier - if the Member could

understand  what the Prime Minister  has  said  - we

have no control whatsoever over the security aspect

of the State of Singapore. If the Member for Jurong

can  understand this, then I say it  is  worthwhile

for him to stand up and speak.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for Jurong had not

completed his sentence when he was interrupted. Mr

Chia, please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Under these

circumstances,  when Opposition Members  have  been

arrested  and are still under detention,  it  seems

unfair for this Assembly to nominate Members to the

House of Representatives. We want to protest in the

strongest  terms  against the Government's  act  of

suppressing the Barisan Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our attitude is this. We are of the opinion that

this   Bill   is   most  unfair  and  unreasonable.

Therefore,  we say that if any representatives  are

to  be  elected  to  the Central  Parliament,  this

should be done by the people themselves under  fair

and democratic conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. has won the last election, but we

would  like to point out that though it has boasted

about  its  so-called  open confrontation,  it  has

failed  because at present the so-called  democracy

belongs  only  to the Party in power. [Interruption

in  Mandarin] The representatives to the  House  of

Representatives  should be elected  by  the  people

themselves.  Before this, all the basic  rights  of

the people should be restored and all the political

detainees  should  be  released.  After  this,  the

election of Members to the House of Representatives

can be conducted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Andrew Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andrew Fong:</b> First of all, I would like to

compliment  the Members of the Barisan Sosialis  on

pledging their support for Malaysia when they  took

their  oaths  of allegiance. I do not know  whether

they  were  compelled to do that, but  I  think  in

their heart of hearts they do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>



support Malaysia now, seeing that there is no other

way out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we read in this morning's papers about the Barisan Sosialis coming out in support of Malaysia. I do not wish to go deeply into replying to the statements made by the Member for Jurong because I feel that they are empty and childish. He did convey the impression that the election last

September  - Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish  to  go

back  to the election in September but nevertheless

I would like to make the Member for Jurong a little

bit  happier by telling him a little bit more about

the  election  - he  alleged that the  election  was

conducted  in a most undemocratic, most unfair  and

most  unreasonable way. It seems  to  me  that  the

impression  I got from him just now was that  every

Member  elected  to  this House through  democratic

voting  cannot  represent the people of  Singapore.

But  in  any  case the Communists never believe  in

democratic  voting.  If  we  were  returned  in  an

undemocratic  way, I would like to ask  Members  of

the  Barisan  Sosialis under what  conditions  they

were  returned  to  this House. This  includes  the

Member for Hong Lim as he was also involved in  the

game.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the election of 15 Members to the

Central  Parliament, I feel that  it  is  quite  in

order  to  have  our 15 Members elected  from  this

House because we were elected by the people. But if

the  Member  for  Jurong or other  Members  of  the

Barisan Sosialis believe that they were not elected

by the people, that is their own funeral.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong was also concerned about

the  number  of representatives to be elected  from

the  Government  benches that  is  to  say,  as  he

stated,  12 from the Government and three from  the

Barisan  Sosialis.  I  think  this  percentage   is

strictly  in  order because, as  we  can  see,  the

Opposition consist of only a handful of sour  faces

and  I  doubt very much whether they can  represent

the  people  of  Singapore. Frankly speaking,  they

were elected on threats and violence, and they  say

in  this  House  that  they  are  the  only  people

returned to this House under democratic voting  and

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>



we  on  the  Government benches were elected  under

undemocratic conditions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we were given

this  Bill,  which has tremendous repercussions  on

the  interest  of  the Slate of Singapore  and  the

Malaysian Parliament, at 11.25 a.m., and  at  11.26

a.m. the Prime Minister delivered his policy speech

on  the  Second Reading of the Bill.  Mr  Speaker,

this  is  a Bill which is very important, which  is

supposed   to  elect  or  appoint  15  Members   to

represent  Singapore in the Central Parliament  for

nearly six years. The Opposition Members were given

a few minutes to consider such an important Bill. I

must strongly protest against the highhanded method

of  Government by not giving a fair opportunity  to

the  Opposition  Members to  study  the  merits  or

demerits of this important Bill. I must put  it  on

record  that we hope this will not be the beginning

of  a series of acts of undemocratic suppression of

the  rights of the Opposition, however we might  be

in  the  minority, because once we are elected,  we

are  here to voice whatever grievances and feelings

there are on behalf of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as for the merits or demerits of the Bill, I must admit that the Prime Minister had, before nomination, made a statement that the first Parliament would be appointed by this Assembly. But you will see that in those circumstances the people were quite confused because of the short period of

the election campaign.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Why

did you not say then?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> There were only 9 days given

to the Opposition Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You had nearly two years.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No more interruptions, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> The issues in the State

election  were  different from the  issues  in  the

Federal election. We are sure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>



that  when the people voted for representatives  to

the  State  Assembly, they believed that they  were

voting  for  a  State Government which  would  look

after  public housing, public utilities,  education

and  various other aspects of local government. But

this Bill is going to appoint Members who are going

to  represent different aspects of the interests of

the  people  of Singapore. It is going  to  appoint

Members to represent Singapore's' interests in  the

Central Parliament. And there, whether one  is  for

or  against,  Malaysia looms huge on  the  horizon.

Whereas  in the State Assembly election, the  issue

of Malaysia is not of so much importance. I am sure

many  voters who voted for the P.A.P. in  the  last

election,  and  during  the last  four  weeks  have

experienced this so-called "New York of  Malaysia",

would not have voted for the P.A.P. in the election

to the Central Parliament. I believe there are many

voters  who voted for the P.A.P. because they  want

the P.A.P., who believe that the P.A.P. can provide

better housing and better public utilities, but who

do  not believe that the P.A.P.'s stand on Malaysia

is  the  correct  stand. For instance,  because  of

Singapore's incorporation into Malaysia,  Indonesia

has  staged  an economic boycott against Singapore,

and  I  understand that at least over 20,000 people

are  unemployed  because of this boycott.  Business

and factories are on the verge of collapse and many

of  them  are closing down. These people who  voted

for  the P.A.P. in the last election would not have

voted P.A.P. if the P.A.P. stands for Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the situation in Sabah and Sarawak is different because in Sahah and Sarawak there is direct appointment from the Assembly to the Central Parliament. The situation there is different because that was the first time election was held. Whereas in Singapore we have long years of

democratic  elections. So what applies  in  Sarawak

and Sabah should not apply to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Prime Minister made his statement, he

did  not  make it clear to the public of  Singapore

- and even this Bill did not make it clear - that the

appointment   of  15  Members  to  the   House   of

Representatives would be for a term of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>



nearly  six years. Many thought that these  Members

of  Parliament would only serve until the  term  of

the  present Malaysia Parliament expires, which  is

about  March or June next year. Therefore, I  feel,

Sir, since the appointment of these Members will be

for  a  long period of six years, we will agree  to

the  Government appointing 15 Members of Parliament

for  the  period  until  this  Malaysia  Parliament

expires,  that  is,  March or June  1964.  But  for

subsequent periods we propose that there should  be

pan-Malaysian   Federal  elections   which   should

include the State of Singapore, that is, after  the

first Malaysian Parliament has expired sometime  in

the middle of next year, we should have election of

the 15 representatives to the Malaysian Parliament.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I consider what the Member

for  Jurong  has said as irrelevant.  What  we  are

talking about now is the Singapore (Election to the

House  of  Representives) Bill. Yet he was  talking

about the general election held about a month  ago.

To  discuss  the  last election  at  this  time  is

irrelevant. I rather gather the impression that  he

has  nothing  to  say but to talk  on  the  general

election.  During the election the  Prime  Minister

announced  to the whole nation that if  the  P.A.P.

were  returned  to power the 15 representatives  to

the  Central Parliament would be chosen  from  this

House.  We  have  now got a new  mandate  from  the

people.  So  we now propose this Bill. Our  aim  is

just  to fulfil an election pledge. The people will

feel  proud because the Government which they  have

chosen  has  fulfilled  its  election  pledge.  The

Barisan Sosialis has not proposed this Bill. Is  it

its  intention to ask us not to fulfil our  pledge?

We  will  fulfil our pledge. In every  election  we

have  to spend $700,000. We have made preparations,

and  we know that if this money is not spent we can

make  use  of  it  in other useful  ways,  such  as

building community centres, constructing roads  and

the  rest  of  it. If there were any  election,  it

should  be based on the democratic system and  this

money should be used for a good cause, otherwise we

would  just be squandering away the people's  money

which are public funds. Do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>



the Barisan Sosialis mean that we should waste this

sum  of  public  money in order  to  satisfy  their

personal wishes?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there is no need to talk about what

the  Member  for Jurong has termed the undemocratic

and  unjust general election. If he does  not  want

the  15  representatives to be  elected  from  this

House,  why is it that in August when we wanted  to

pass  a  Bill in this House so that the  people  of

Singapore  could  elect  15  representatives,  they

prevented its passage? It is because at that  time,

for  the  sake of party politics, they collaborated

with  Lim  Yew Hock's clique in their own interest.

Therefore,  the so-called democracy to  them  means

nothing. It is not worth more than a cent to  them.

They  will try to achieve their aims by any  means,

as  long as the means justify the end. Our original

intention    was   to   have   popularly    elected

representatives to the Central Parliament. If  they

were  able  to  do it, the Barisan Sosialis  should

have supported the Bill which we then proposed  and

they  could well have been in a position,  as  they

thought, to be elected. But they were so scared and

they  dared not see the Bill passed. Now they  have

turned  round  and said that the  number  of  three

seats  for them is not enough and they have boasted

that  they have the support of the masses. If  that

is  true, why did they not dare have elections held

in  August to elect the 15 representatives? If they

did not want these elections in the past, what more

do they have to say now?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for their so-called terms "undemocratic" and

"dictatorial", we in the P.A.P. know that  we  have

been  unreasonably attacked and criticised  by  the

Barisan  Sosialis  for more than  two  and  a  half

years.  Every day these people have been  attacking

the P.A.P. Even our P.A.P. branch property, such as

chairs, tables and daily utensils, has been removed

by  these  people - by their party executives.  They

went  among the rural people spreading the  rumours

that  after merger the Chinese would no  longer  be

permitted  to  eat  pork; there would  not  be  any

provision  for  the  Chinese to live  according  to

their   customs;   all  Chinese  males   would   be

circumcised,  and all that rubbish  talk.  We  have

endured this rubbish talk for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>



about  two  and  a half years and in  the  end  the

people  have proved that they have not listened  to

them. What more do they have to say?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has said that he wants to

protest against the Government's high-handed action

in   arresting  their  Members  and  their   fellow

travellers. But I would like to tell him that  they

should not shirk their responsibilities and put the

blame on the Government. If they want to play  with

fire,  that  is  their own business.  Long  ago  we

warned them about this, if they were to carry on in

such a manner, it would not pay. They should return

to  our  fold. Even on the eve of their  break-away

from  us, I had talks with the Member for Nee  Soon

for  several days and nights. I told him, "Your way

will  not  be profitable. It is useless."  Now  the

people have proved that they have no trust in these

people. They have shown that these people's rumours

are useless.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also said that the present

democracy belongs only to the Party in power. But I

would say that democracy belongs to all the people.

All  those  anti-national and  subversive  elements

should  not  be  protected by the State.  Democracy

should  not be used as a cover for their subversive

and  anti-national activities. We  have  introduced

this  Bill  in this House today as the  first  step

towards  fulfilling  our  election  pledges.  After

that,  we  will  further  carry  out  our  election

pledges. We hope that this House can consider  this

Bill  and  avoid a meaningless debate  because  the

main  issues that concern Malaysia will be  debated

in the Central Parliament and not here. Let us save

time now and come to the point.



<br><br>12.19 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, in order not to give you a wrong

impression. I have to make some clarification. What

the newly-appointed Minister for Labour has said is

contrary  to  facts. The former  Speaker  would  be

laughing  if he heard what the Minister  has  said.

When the Government introduced the Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>



(Elections to the Federal House of Representatives)

Bill  the  last time, we opposed it. We opposed  it

because   it   gave  powers  to  the  Minister   to

monopolise  the whole affair. He would ensure  that

the P.A.P. would win. That was why we opposed it at

that  time. The Minister for Labour has  just  said

that  we  are trying to cheat the people by telling

lies.  But,  in actual fact, our Prime Minister  is

also  the previous Prime Minister. I can give three

examples. Let me tell you, Mr Speaker, Sir, that a

few  days before the election, the P.A.P. at  first

thought that they would be finished, so they  tried

to  make  use  of the State machinery to  propagate

lies.  They  said  that the Prime Minister  in  the

Federation  is  the  Tunku and  not  Mr  Lee.  The

decision was made by the Tunku and not Mr Lee. How

would he know what the Federation would do? One  of

the biggest rumours they spread was that if we won,

Federal troops would come into Singapore. Now,  how

could  they  know? They should be ashamed  of  what

they had said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the new Minister for Labour has said

that  he  had tried to persuade the Member for  Nee

Soon.  What  he  was talking about was  the  M.C.P.

Plen. What they wanted to tell us has already  been

made known to all the people, so it would be better

if  the new Minister did not waste the time of this

House by talking this sort of rubbish.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a convenient time to suspend?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak (Tampines)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker.  Sir, this morning the Prime Minister  has

said



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>



that  the powers relating to internal security  lie

with  the Central Government and that there  is  no

necessity  for  us  to  discuss  it  here.  I  have

something to add to that. We have already expressed

our  attitude towards Malaysia. We have  all  along

said  that  we will lose our rights after Malaysia.

What the Prime Minister has said proves this point.

The  Singapore Government will have no rights  over

the internal security of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last general elections were undemocratic. Our

three  Members are still under detention.  And  now

the  Government have introduced a Bill  for  debate

here. They have detained many of our members during

the  mass  arrests. The P.A.P. should not say  that

there  is nothing to complain about regarding these

arrests.  We  would like to question the  so-called

open  argument of the P.A.P. If it is really  worth

believing, then how would the P.A.P. Government ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

On  a  point  of order. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  we  are

debating  the Singapore (Election to the  House  of

Representatives)   Bill  and  not   the   arrest's,

detention  and  so  forth. If  the  speaker  is  so

interested  in  these matters,  perhaps  he  should

offer   himself  for  election  to  the  House   of

Representatives.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We had this point this morning. I

had  to  rule on it this morning. Could the  Member

confine  his  remarks to the Bill? If he  likes  to

make  passing  references to the  elections  or  to

internal security, he may. But try, if possible, to

speak on the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak (Tampines)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, what

I have said up till now has all been as a result of

the  Prime Minister's questions. That is why I have

to make some explanation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1955, when the P.A.P. was still in the

Opposition, the Members of the Legislative Assembly

had  one  kind  of  attitude  towards  the  Queen's

Government.  At  that time we were  under  colonial

rule.  But now we are still under the same colonial

influence.  That  is why we are persisting  in  our

principle. We have taken up the task that  is  left

over for us.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to point out that because of the

P.A.P.'s  suppressive acts against our members,  it

has  resulted  n  the disappearance  of  a  certain

number  of Assemblymen. If the P.A.P. say that  the

people  are not on our side, why did they not  dare

to  allow us to carry out an election campaign?  If

democracy still existed in Singapore, we  would  be

witnessing a different situation. What do all these

arrests  and  suppression  mean?  Mr  Speaker,  no

matter  how  the  P.A.P. boast about  carrying  out

their pledges and promises, they cannot deceive the

people.  Why  did  they  not allow  the  Opposition

Parties  to  have  enough time to carry  out  their

election campaign, instead of giving them only nine

days?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, this morning the Member for

Queenstown has said that what the Member for Jurong

was saying was entirely irrelevant. I would like to

say   something  on  this.  I  say  that   the   15

representatives to the Central Parliament should be

directly   elected  by  the  people.  The  P.A.P.'s

present  victory  has  been  the  result  of  their

undemocratic   tactics.  Therefore,   it   is   not

reasonable to have Federal representatives  elected

from this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question of the previous Bill in this

House   providing   for   the   election   of    15

representatives  to  the  Central  Parliament,   we

opposed that Bill then because the right to  manage

the  elections was given to the Minister concerned.

All  the  Opposition  Parties  in  the  House  then

unanimously  opposed the Bill, and  this  could  be

found in the Assembly records.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to what the P.A.P. have said about giving

effect to their election pledges, we would like  to

point  out  that all this is false. What have  they

achieved  up to now? We can see that they have  not

done anything. What they have achieved is only  the

arrest  of political opponents. The P.A.P. promised

the  people  of  Singapore that they were  going  to

amend  the Master Plan. This Master Plan had  been

drawn  up  by the Lim Yew Hock Government  and  the

P.A.P. had  opposed it in the past. But  when  the

P.A.P. came  into office, they did not  carry  out

their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>



promise  to  abolish the Master Plan.  As  to  the

compensation ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> On a point of order. The

speakers  have  not been speaking  on  the  subject

matter   under  discussion  but  have  been  making

continuous  references to the last election.  I  do

not  think  we want to sit here the whole afternoon

listening  to the same thing over and  over  again.

Let us get on with the business of the day.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Unless the Member for Choa Chu Kang

satisfies  me that the Master Plan is  relevant  to

the discussion of the Bill before this House, I  am

afraid  he will have to stop those remarks. Can  he

satisfy me in any way?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I have

mentioned  that  because the Member for  Queenstown

touched  upon our opposition to the Bill.  He  said

that  the  P.A.P. had this as one of their pledges,

and now they have brought up this Bill in order  to

fulfil their pledges made during the election. What

I  have been trying to do is to point out that this

is not so. He also said that the election of the 15

representatives to the Central Parliament would  be

wasting public funds. I would also say that this is

not   so.  I  do  not  know  how  much  the  P.A.P.

Government  has  wasted  on State  banquets,  Prime

Minister's feasts and dinners given to V.I.P.s. All

this  money, came from public funds. If it had been

saved, it could have been used for the election  of

the 15 representatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the incidents today, we can see that ever

since  merger, the P.A.P. have caused  a  sense  of

insecurity  in the minds of the people.  There  are

many things which the P.A.P. have done or are doing

which   go  to  prove  that  our  allegations   and

accusations in the past have been true. Prices have

risen.  For  instance, the prices of coffee,  sugar

and the rest of it have all gone up ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Member for Choa Chu Kang

confine  his  remarks to matters relating  to  this

Bill? Otherwise, we will go on and on.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of

the  Government side. I do wish to  thank  you  for

putting   an  end  to  this  performance   on   the

gramophone  record  manufactured  by  the   Barisan

headquarters. Obviously, Mr Speaker, Sir, this  is

a  debate  on  the  Bill before the  House  whereby

Singapore has to send some representatives  to  the

Federal  Parliament. Without exception, the Barisan

Members claim that the last election in which  they

were  heavily defeated was unfairly conducted, that

the  Government  engaged in all  manner  of  unfair

tactics  and strategy to ensure their defeat.  Sir,

this is a point which has been made so consistently

by  them that I think it calls for a reply  by  the

Government  side,  although  it  is  not   strictly

relevant to the debate itself ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Then will the Minister for Finance

make his speech as short as possible?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I only want

to  quote certain things which they said before the

elections to prove beyond all doubt that they  were

then  satisfied that the elections were fairly  and

correctly conducted. Sir, I quote from the  Straits

Times, polling day, Saturday, 21st September,  when

the Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis said this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Dr Lee Siew Choh, the Barisan Chairman, said,

"We  expect an overwhelming landslide victory.  All

the P.A.P. Ministers will lose their seats and some

will lose their deposits."



<br><br>Obviously, Sir, if the elections had been  unfairly

conducted,  Dr Lee Siew Choh would not  have  said

all these things. When the results came to them  as

a surprise, may I quote what Dr Lee Siew Choh said

on 29th September, the Malayan Times:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`He said that the results came as a complete

surprise to many of his supporters. He described an

incident  in  which  one of the Barisan  supporters

literally  smashed a Rediffusion set  in  order  to

give    vent    to   his   pent-up   feelings    of

dissatisfaction.  And Mr Lee also  disclosed  that

some  of  his supporters had cried and others  even

fainted on learning the results.'



<br><br>Sir, obviously, while the campaign was fought, they

were  quite  satisfied that they were  winning  and

that they were given all the opportunity to canvass

and to hold as many mass meetings as they liked. No

obstruction was placed in their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>



way. Voting was done strictly according to the laws

laid down, There were checks and counter-checks  at

each  stage.  They lost not because there  was  any

monkeying  with  procedures or  unfairness  in  the

conduct  of the elections. They lost because  their

strategy  was incorrect, their political  appraisal

was  inaccurate,  and  the  manner  in  which  they

conducted the campaign was in many aspects  stupid.

They  lost quite simply because they did  not  have

the  support  of  the majority of the  people.  The

sooner  they accept that as a fact, the better  for

them   and  possibly  they  may  put  up  a  better

performance  if they go about their business  in  a

more intelligent way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, as regards the merits of the Bill, this

is absolutely clear and beyond all doubt. We stated

to  the electorate and during the elections that if

we   formed   the  Government  after  the   general

elections  we  did  not  propose  to  have  another

election  for  the Central Parliament because  that

opportunity was offered to all Parties in Singapore

in  July  this year, and the Barisan Sosialis,  for

reasons  best  known to itself, saw fit  to  reject

this  offer of elections to the Central Parliament.

That  being  the  case, we decided that  there  was

absolutely no point in having two general elections

within  a  short space of a few weeks to decide  on

the  membership  of  the Central Parliament  coming

from  Singapore, in fact, that issue was made clear

beyond  doubt, and in this very copy of the Straits

Times  on  polling day, it states here in headlines -

IF P.A.P. WINS NO NEW POSTS FOR CENTRAL PARLIAMENT

MEMBERS. So what is all this fuss about? I honestly

cannot  understand  the song and  dance  which  the

Barisan Members are creating today. If they want to

attack  Government policy and show up  inadequacies

of  the  administration in any field  of  activity,

they  will  have the opportunity in due course.  So

please  be  patient. The time will come when  under

the  rules of debate of the Assembly there will  be

opportunity   for   them   to   debate   on   rural

development,  farmers,  rural  areas,   extravagant

expenditure, this, that and the other. But today

we  are discussing the merits and the demerits

of  this  Bill.  It  is obvious  that  the  Barisan

Members have not quite understood the procedures of

debate.  However,  this is their first  performance

and  we must not judge them too harshly, but  I  do

hope that they will show rapid improvement in their

future endeavours.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for Tampines has spoken.

I  do  not  think he has the privilege of  speaking

again.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the Minister for Finance has  spoken

on  what  our Party Chairman said during  the  last

election. He says that our Chairman stated that the

election  was conducted in a fair and just  manner.

Nobody   will  believe  him,  because  during   the

election we found that the people were on the  side

of  the Barisan Sosialis. So the P.A.P. started all

sorts of stories during the election campaign, such

as  in  the  event of a Barisan victory  Federation

troops  would come to Singapore. All these  threats

and  intimidation  are  the usual  tactics  of  the

P.A.P.  If  it did not feel that a Barisan  victory

was  possible,  then  why did  it  resort  to  such

threats  and intimidation? The Prime Minister  even

went  to the extent of simply making statements  at

random  to the effect that Federation troops  would

come  to Singapore because he himself did not enjoy

the  confidence of the Federation Government.  That

was  the tactic he adopted to intimidate the people

of  Singapore,  but  we must  see  what  the  Prime

Minister of the Federation says with regard to this

matter. The people can see for themselves. There is

no  need  for the Prime Minster to say it.  If  the

Federation  had really intended to send  troops  to

Singapore,   then   the  Prime  Minister   of   the

Federation,  during his visit to  Singapore,  after

the  statement of the Prime Minister of  Singapore,

would have ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> I think the Member for

Thomson is again digressing from this point. We are

now debating this Bill. Sir, I hope he will confine

himself to the Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have allowed the Member for

Thomson to go on and speak in that line because the

Minister  for  Finance  has  just  replied  to  the

speeches made by the Opposition on the question  of

the  elections.  I did ask the Minister  to  be  as

brief  as possible, but seeing that I have  allowed

him  to  speak on the election, I propose to  allow

the  Member for Thomson to at least reply  to  him.

Again I will ask the Member for Thomson to make his

remarks  as brief as possible and to get on quickly

to the matter under debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am much obliged to

you,  Mr  Speaker, Sir. The PAP, always  boast  of

their  skill in open argument but we want  an  open

argument now. When we come to an open argument with

them,  they say that we are irrelevant and that  we

should  not talk. What is this? This line  of  open

argument  is  not reserved for the  Prime  Minister

alone.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, I will  do  my  best  to

explain  things in the shortest possible time.  But

there  are matters which have been referred  to  by

the  Party  in  power in connection with  the  open

argument. So I wish to make my reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was saying just now that if Tunku Abdul Rahman

had really endorsed the views of the Prime Minister

of  Singapore,  then  he would  not  have  come  to

Singapore  on  the eve of the election  and  denied

what the Prime Minister of Singapore had said. This

goes  to show that the calculation of Dr Lee  Siew

Choh was correct. It was because the Prime Minister

was  afraid of a possible Barisan victory  that  he

resorted   to   tactics   such   as   threats   and

intimidation and said that. We wanted to merge with

Indonesia.  We  must  come to  an  open  debate  as

gentlemen, but did the P.A.P. do so? They did  not.

They resorted to cheating, deceit and threats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am opposed to the intention of electing Members

to  the House of Representatives from this Assembly

in  proportion to the representation in this House.

The  reason  put forward by the P.A.P.  Members  is

that  another election would cost some more public

funds. This is again another way of deception.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>



We  all  know  that the last general  election  was

conducted  in a most unusual manner and  I  do  not

have  to repeat the facts relating thereto.  So  we

have the right to demand the Party in power to  put

this  matter of the election of representatives  to

the  Central  Parliament to  the  people  again.  I

remember that soon after the general elections, the

Prime Minister in his victory speech said that  the

people  were for the P.A.P. Since it has been  said

that the people are supporting the P.A.P., then how

is it that the P.A.P. do not have the guts to allow

the people to elect representatives to the House of

Representatives? [Interruption in Mandarin] We have

already  explained  that as far  as  the  money  is

concerned, this is not important because the P.A.P.

is  very good in wasting public money. It makes use

of  the  Work  Brigade for its own ends.  It  talks

about  the rural development plan. Has it done  so?

It  talks about the construction of roads, bridges,

and so on. Has it done so? It sent some members  of

the  Work  Brigade to tear off the posters  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis. This is the  way  in  which  the

P.A.P. has wasted public funds. We do not oppose in

principle the construction of community centres but

the  P.A.P. is making use of these centres as Party

branches. Now is this not a waste of public  funds?

Insofar as the interest of the P.A.P. is concerned,

public  funds can be wasted. Now if such funds  can

be  wasted  in  this  manner, then  the  people  of

Singapore should be given an opportunity  to  elect

directly  Members  to the House of Representatives.

If  the  P.A.P. is prepared to spend a few  hundred

thousand dollars on this election, then there would

not  be  any grumble or complaint from the  people.

The  amount of money involved is not very great and

the  people will not grudge such an amount of money

spent.  [Interruption] I do not, know what you  are

talking  about. I cannot get what you are  talking.

Would you repeat? Have you heard that?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are fewer P.A.P. members going abroad

for a holiday, then public funds could be saved.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> The Member for Thomson

is making this Chamber like a market. Mr Speaker,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  you  have advised the Member for  Thomson  to

make his speech short. As he has gone far away from

the  Bill which we are debating, I hope he will get

down to our real business and not carry on with all

this "gone-case" business in this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I did point out to the Member for

Thomson that he could speak about the past election

provided  he made his remarks as short as possible.

I  ask him to remember that again. But, at the same

time,  I  would ask Members on the Government  side

not to interrupt the Member for Thomson while he is

speaking.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Members of the Party in power have accused  me

of being too long-winded. Had it not been for their

interruptions, I would not have taken so much  time

in  explaining  away  the  points  that  they  have

raised.  Since  they have raised  certain  matters,

certainly I should be given a chance to reply.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob bin Mohamed Al-Haj (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Inche Yaacob bin Mohamed Al-Haj)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker,  I  was not very eager to  speak  on  this

matter at the beginning. Seeing new Members and new

faces in this Assembly, I believe surely they would

give  new  opinions and arguments. But  it  appears

that  their arguments are not different.  They  are

the   same  as  the  arguments  which  the  various

Opposition leaders gave before, Opposition  leaders

who are no longer in this Assembly. They talk about

the   recent  election,  saying  that  it  was  not

democratic  and so on because only nine  days  were

given  to them. I feel, however, that that  was  in

conformity with the election laws which were passed

unanimously in this Assembly, that is, the  minimum

time  is  nine days. Therefore, there is no  ground

for  saying  that the election was not  democratic.

The  old  Members in this Assembly  will  know  how

their  leader,  the ex-Member for  Queenstown,  had

challenged the Government to resign immediately and

to hold a general election in the shortest possible

time.  They  had guaranteed that if elections  were

held  immediately, then the chairs of the Ministers

would become vacant. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>



feel,  Mr  Speaker,  that  we  have  given  enough

opportunity  to them to carry out secret  campaigns

and they had entered the rural areas every week  to

influence  the  people. We  have  also  given  them

sufficient  opportunities without binding  them  in

any  way  and without shutting the mouths of  their

supporters.  We  know  that  the  Rural   Dwellers'

Association and also a large number of trade unions

supported them and we did not interfere with  their

campaign.  We allowed the Barisan to  use  them  so

that they could have the opportunity to contest the

elections.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Parliamentary Secretary get

on  with the matter under discussion and leave  the

election  alone?  Otherwise we are  going  to  have

replies  from  the  other side. He  should  try  to

confine himself to the Bill under discussion.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob bin Mohamed Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob bin Mohamed Al-Haj</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I have said

just  now  that I have no wish to talk  about  this

matter. But three or four Members in the Opposition

have  talked about it. I see that only one of  them

is  an  old Member and the rest are new. Therefore,

it  is necessary for me to offer an explanation  so

that we will know the real situation, that is, what

took  place in this Assembly before they come here.

As a matter of fact, the Member for Hong Lim at one

time  said  that the P.A.P.'s struggle in  politics

would come to an end. But it would appear that only

he  himself managed to come in and the rest of  his

Party  had vanished. Therefore, Mr Speaker,  there

is  a  difference  about this matter.  It  was  the

policy  of  the  last Government that  if  we  were

elected  we  would  not have another  election  for

representatives to the Central Parliament. It means

that  we  have obtained a mandate from the  people.

Arguments  have been put forward but they  have  no

validity.  I  feel  that is  enough.  We  have  now

obtained a mandate from the people not only to  sit

in  this Assembly but also to elect Members of this

Assembly to sit in the Federal Parliament.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, I wish

to   remind  the  Opposition  that  this  House  is

debating  a Bill in respect of the election  of  15

Members



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>



to   the   Federal  Parliament  and  not  a  matter

concerning  the past general election.  That  is  a

matter  of  the  past, and it is  useless  for  the

Opposition  to cry over spilt milk. I  quite  agree

that  a number of Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen here

were  not Members of the last Assembly. However,  I

believe  they were aware of the Bill in respect  of

the  election of Members to the Federal  Parliament

which the former Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Ong

Pang Boon, introduced. For no rhyme or reason,  the

Barisan  Sosialis combined with the U.P.P. and  the

Alliance  to  block  its  passage.  That   was   an

indication  that  these people  did  not  want  the

election.  Now I do not know for what  reason  they

oppose this Bill in respect of the election  of  15

Members  to  the  Central Parliament.  The  Barisan

Sosialis,   instead  of  debating  its  merits   or

demerits,  were pleased to go on talking about  the

general  election.  I  would  like  to  advise  the

Opposition  Members that if they are going  to  win

the  next  general election, they had  better  work

harder  than the P.A.P., but do not work  hard  for

their foreign masters.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr   Speaker,  since  this  morning  the   Barisan

Sosialis  Assemblymen have spoken and their  common

point  is  to stress that the last general election

was undemocratic. The Member for Jurong did not say

why it was not democratic. I would like to ask him

whether  the Assemblymen here were elected  by  the

people directly, if popular elections had been  one

of  the principles of the Barisan Sosialis. I would

like  to  ask them this question. If they say  that

the  election of 15 representatives from this House

is  undemocratic,  then I would like  to  ask  them

this.  Will the wishes of the people change in  the

course of just one month? This only shows that they

are  only  arguing  for the sake of  argument.  The

result  of  the  recent State general  election  is

concrete  proof of the people's wishes. Before  the

general  election the Barisan Sosialis were  saying

that  the  result of the general election would  be

the judgment of the people. But things did not turn

out the way they had hoped



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>



for.  The  P.A.P. did not perish. Instead,  certain

Right-wing  opportunist Parties were  crushed.  Why

did  the  P.A.P. win this general election?  It  is

because  it  has done many things. There  has  been

great  progress in Singapore. There have been  all-round  achievements. The greatest merit is that  we

have secured a merger with Malaya to form Malaysia.

That  is  why the people have wholeheartedly  voted

for  us  and  returned  us to  office.  As  to  the

election of 15 representatives to the Federal House

of  Representatives, we are of the opinion that  by

electing these representatives from this House,  it

will  be  saving  public money. Before  the  recent

general  election, the Prime Minister already  told

the  people of Singapore about our intention to  do

so. At that time, Members of the Opposition Parties

did not say anything against it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little while ago, the Member for Thomson has

said  that the P.A.P. is most clever in squandering

public funds. If that were true, then I would  like

to  ask:  From  where did Singapore  get  the  $400

million surplus in the four and a half years of the

P.A.P.'s  term  of office? It is the  duty  of  the

P.A.P.  Government to call the Barisan's bluff  and

tell the people not to be deceived by them. Had  we

been  deceiving  the  people, we  would  have  been

defeated.  The most important thing is to  let  the

people  know  what we have been doing and  disclose

the  whole truth to the people. This does not  mean

that it is the P.A.P.'s threat to the people ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I ask the Member to be relevant. He

is continuing to be irrelevant. Can he go on to the

Bill  under discussion and forget about the  record

of the P.A.P.?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you for

your direction, Mr Speaker. I will not repeat  any

more of the things done in the past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now to deal with the Bill before us. It is very

correct  for  this  Bill to be introduced  in  this

House today. I fully support it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> In reply, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Any more Members from the Opposition

wishing to speak? Otherwise the Prime Minister will

reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

suspected at the beginning of the debate today that

we  may  once  again go back to the old repetitious

sound-track.  We have had our fill of  it  for  the

last  two and a half years. I had only a faint hope

that  perhaps the lesson of the last two and a half

years  would  have dawned in all its  vividness  on

Members  opposite. However, that is not to be,  and

we  are  resigned to this constant plugging of  the

big  lie. They did not want the 15 seats. Now  they

say they want the 15 seats. We offered them the  15

seats.   They  refused.  Now  they   say   we   are

undemocratic.  But I do not believe the  memory  of

the  people  of  Singapore is that  short  or  that

defective.  Members  on  the  other  side  do   not

recognise that. With that last Assembly which ended

in  July,  it was the end of an era. We meet  today

under different circumstances. I no longer hold the

gun.  The gun is in Kuala Lumpur. I do not have  to

be  a contestant with the gun. The referee has  the

gun.  Therefore, the fight between  us  is  one  on

debate,  peaceful  persuasion  and,  if  they   are

foolish   enough   to  resort  to  unconstitutional

methods, they face the consequences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have called for a copy of the papers this

morning because it is interesting to note that they

now   say  they  will  defend  the  integrity   and

sovereignty of the nation and they have  all  taken

their oath to defend Malaysia which they have sworn

previously  to  destroy. They should realise,  when

they  took that oath, however light-heartedly  they

may  have done so, that it means that the authority

of the State will bear down upon them like a ton of

bricks  if  they  try to destroy  Malaysia.  It  is

treachery  and  treason. In  many  other  Socialist

countries  - 15  Socialist countries  in  the  world

- they line them up against the wall and shoot  them

at  dawn  without any ceremony at all. But in  this

country,  they  are fed and clothed,  all  free  of

charge at public expense. I seriously urge them  to

rethink and reappraise their position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Assembly is no longer the arena for

dogfights. I hope that with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>



end of this debate and in our next session we go on

to the constructive things over which the State has

authority.  Defence,  security,  foreign   affairs,

confrontation,  denouncing, troops  being  sent  to

Borneo  or Sarawak - all that goes to Kuala  Lumpur.

But  we  are  not  running away from  it.  We  look

forward to meeting them and their counterparts from

Penang and from other parts of the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to congratulate them today on

showing more intelligence than the Member for  Hong

Lim  in  wanting  to  redeem  themselves  from   an

untenable position. The Member for Hong  Lim  is  a

little  bit  out  of his depth now.  At  least  the

Barisan  Sosialis realises that if you go  on  just

denouncing Malaysia, you are going down the  drain.

The   Member  for  Hong  Lim  has  not  taken   the

precaution   of  redeeming  himself;  the   Barisan

Sosialis has. But mind you, Sir, the qualifications

on  their loyalty are so enormous and multi-farious

that one doubts whether in fact their intention  is

to   be  loyal  at  all  to  the  country  and  its

institutions  in whose name - the name of  democracy,

democratic privileges - they are seeking to  destroy

the nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we had lost the election, if it were a

free-for-all, that would have been the  last.  That

was  the  reason  why we held the  elections  after

Malaysia  Day, so that even if we had  lost,  there

would  have been further elections. And we  offered

them,  Mr Speaker, Sir, an opportunity which  they

would otherwise never have got. I do not expect  to

receive  gratitude for it. I did not do it  because

it  was  in their interests. But at least  I  would

have thought they would have realised that here was

the  last  chance  to prove this  boast  about  the

masses.  There  were  no  masses  on  the  21st  of

September.  That is the plain, brutal fact  of  the

matter.  Everything thrown in, every communal  pull

sentiment  thrown into the kitty. It could  not  be

done and never will again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, just to wind up for the record; what I

said, what they heard me say over the wireless  and

over  television  on the evening  of  the  11th  of

September.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>



May I quote from my broadcast?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The next reason (for calling for elections

immediately)  is  that the Opposition  Parties  had

blocked our Bill for the election of 15 Members  in

Singapore  to the Federal Parliament. We must  have

the  15  Members  to  represent  Singapore  in  the

Federal  Parliament  in Kuala  Lumpur  as  soon  as

possible.  It is our intention that these elections

for  the 51 seats will also decide the 15 seats for

Parliament  in Kuala Lumpur, for we  shall  pass  a

Bill for the election of the 15 Members from the 51

Members you are now electing in proportion  to  the

Party  representation as shown by  the  results  of

this  election.  Every general election  costs  the

Government  about  three-quarters  of   a   million

dollars, money of the taxpayer which could be  more

usefully spent on constructive projects. Now it  is

up  to  you (meaning the people) to elect the  next

government of Singapore and at the same time decide

who   will  represent  Singapore  in  the   Federal

Parliament in Kuala Lumpur; who will stand  up  and

speak for Singapore.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing can be more simple, nothing can be more

clear,  and nothing could have been more  decisive.

As  my  colleague the Minister for Labour has said,

we  gave  them an opportunity - 15 seats.  For  very

unwise reasons, they ganged up with the opportunist

Right  and  blocked  it. The  Right  had  different

reasons.  The  Right  was planning  their  complete

destruction and extinction before the elections. We

wanted  them  to be destroyed, not  in  a  physical

action,  but in the hearts and minds of the people,

and   that  was  what  happened  on  the  21st   of

September. Never mind the traitors who went to gaol

on  the  1st  of  February;  people  who  by  their

activities brought about confrontation; people  who

encouraged the anti-Malaysia line, that  today  has

brought  about  a  situation in which  we  and  our

neighbours have broken all diplomatic ties.  If  we

had waited till after the 16th of September for the

elections, maybe the Member for Thomson may not  be

here. I do not expect him to thank us, Mr Speaker,

Sir, because I did not do it for him. I did it  for

Singapore.  We can well look after him here  or  in

the Federal Parliament - word for word, argument for

argument,  in any language he chooses; in  Mandarin

if  he  wishes,  in English, in Malay  or  even  in

Tamil.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also for the record, may I just refer to Hansard,

Vol. 21, No. 2, Thursday, 25th July, 1963, when the

vote  was  taken  on the Bill intituled  "Singapore

(Elections to the Federal House of Representatives)

Bill. The final division - 23-23; 4 paired - and all

the  Barisan  lined up, including  the  Member  for

Jalan  Kayu. We welcome him back as one of the  old

ones who knew what happened. Those are halcyon days

gone.  He  voted against it. Now he says  he  wants

another  try. No. If they are prepared  to  put  up

$750,000 and pay for the cost of removing  all  the

wretched  posters  that they put  up  illegally  in

excess of the numbers allowed them and all the mess

they  made of the City in 18 days, running  around,

campaigning  they started their campaign  from  the

day we issued the writ; they know that we knew that

- then  I say we can have another show. Let us  have

another   runaround.  Not  this  defeat;  this   is

finished and closed. There can be other issues. For

instance,  we  could  have a referendum  to  decide

whether  or  not  pro-Communist Parties  should  be

allowed  to  continue  or whether  they  should  be

closed down. Then they could run around. Once more,

we allow their mass meetings. I say that that is an

offer  I make. Let them ponder on these things.  If

they  are  prepared to pay for  it,  we  are  quite

prepared to meet the verdict of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Fair enough!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the Member for Hong Lim

- before  I  close  for the record  - has  said  that

Malaysia   has  brought  about  confrontation   and

unemployment for 20,000 people, is he still against

Malaysia?  He  has  got to make up  his  mind.  The

Barisan  is a more intelligent outfit. It has  more

I.Q.,  more brains. I am not saying that the Member

for  Hong  Lim is not a very intelligent  chap.  He

reads  The Three Kingdoms backwards from  cover  to

cover,  but  he  has to learn how to  analyse.  The

Barisan  have  analysed that if  they  continue  to

oppose  Malaysia, there is only one conclusion  - up

against  the  pillar!  So this  qualified  loyalty.

First they condemn the despatch of troops to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>



Sarawak.   Then  they  say  they  stand   for   the

territorial  integrity  and  sovereignty   of   our

Malaysia. The impudence of it, Mr Speaker, Sir! We

brought it about in spite of their obstruction. Now

they say it is theirs. Where are we going? What  is

all  this  about? Then they go back again - "serving

the  interest  of  imperialists and  colonialists".

This is all gone. Nobody believes all this. Let  me

tell them that we are here to serve the interest of

the people and that we have the great advantage  of

no  longer being the referee with the gun.  We  are

just a contestant. The referee is somebody else. He

has  the gun. Anybody who breaks the rules gets it.

They  wind  up  by  saying,  "Our  loyalty  to  our

country".  I do not know whether they mean  loyalty

includes  loyalty to Sarawak and  Sabah  - also  our

country;  or  whether  they mean,  like  the  other

statement  issued  by  Dr  Lee  Siew  Choh,   only

Malayan. "...does not mean loyalty to the party  in

power."  What  does it mean? It  means  loyalty  to

themselves  - the party not in power? Is  that  what

they mean? Do they suggest that in the Soviet Union

or in all the great socialist countries anybody can

stand  up in the House of Representatives in Moscow

and say, "I am loyal to Russia but not to the party

in  power."?  I would like to see what  happens  to

that gentleman. What are we talking about? "We  are

denied  the  freedom of speech."  All  this  drivel

being  published. Sedition, that  is  what  it  is;

spreading   disaffection,   disloyalty    to    the

Government  and constitutional authority.  However,

there  is time enough for us to meet again in Kuala

Lumpur and we shall pick up the argument from there

- security,    defence,    foreign    affairs    and

confrontation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let them always remember this - that they have

contributed  to  the unemployment of  about  10,000

people  at the moment. It may become 20,000, 25,000

at the end of one year. But they encouraged certain

neighbouring countries into believing that Malaysia

could  be  stopped. They led the  agitation  inside

Singapore  linked up with the S.U.P.P. of  Sarawak.

They are the chaps who agitated all this. They are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>



the  people  who encouraged Azahari, who  lined  up

with  the  Filipinos,  finally  brought  about  the

revolt  - armed  insurrection  - and  landed  up   in

Jakarta. They encouraged others to believe that  it

was  possible  to  stop Malaysia via  fifth  column

elements  in  our midst. The Member  for  Hong  Lim

encouraged    it   - "Down   with   Malaysia!    Neo

colonialism!"  As  a  result, foreign  powers  took

heart and finally found themselves in a position of

confrontation ending up with a break  in  ties.  If

all of us had remained solidly united, whatever our

ideological  and  political  differences,  for  the

survival of the people, the nation and the country,

foreign  elements might have not made this  mistake

of believing that Malaysia could be stopped. It was

because  they  believed that it  could  be  stopped

through the use of traitors in our midst that today

the  situation  has  come about.  I  say  that  the

hardship that has befallen those connected  in  the

entrepot   trade  with  Indonesia  can  be   traced

squarely   back   to  the  Barisan  Sosialis,   the

S.U.P.P.,  the United People's Party of the  Member

for  Hong Lim and even some absent Members in  this

House  like the former Member for Anson.  They  are

the  gentlemen who led themselves into this  facade

of  democratic opposition to Malaysia that made the

Indonesians  and  the Filipinos  believe  that  the

United  Nations  team can go down  to  Sarawak  and

Borneo  and  give a verdict against  Malaysia.  Why

not? They went to the United Nations - the President

of  the Barisan Sosialis and the former Member  for

Anson. They led themselves to this. My last parting

word  of  advice  to them is, "Please  desist  from

further  stupidities." Enough calamity has befallen

them and befallen about 10,000 workers. We have  to

retrieve the position and pay out from our  savings

in  conjunction  with enlightened employers  paying

out one-third, but it cannot go on indefinitely. We

have  to  find  alternatives. If  they  start  more

trouble in the unions and factories close down,  or

they  try to make them close down and try to create

more  unemployment, then I say that this time  they

ought  to rethink the position, read the law  book.

They always say that they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>



like  to  work constitutionally, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

but  they inevitably wind up by calling a political

strike  to  paralyse the country.  I  advise  them,

however  agonising it is, to reappraise  themselves

of the realities of life in and around Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[The Prime Minister].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>3.40 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 3 inclusive ordered to stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4-



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, line 18, to leave out "elected from

the Members of the Legislative Assembly" and insert

"nominated  by  the People's Action Party  and  the

Barisan Sosialis".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The amendment is in order. Please

continue, Mr Chia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

will say this on the amendment. The P.A.P. has said

on  several occasions that representatives  to  the

House  of  Representatives  will  be  nominated  by

political Parties. Mr Speaker, I would like to ask

about  sub-clause (2)  of clause 4 because we intend

to  move  an amendment to that sub-clause. I  would

like your advice as to whether I can move it now.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dispose of this amendment first and

then ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I be of assistance, Mr

Speaker, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> For the purposes of the

debate  - I   may be wrong - but I think I  understand

the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>



Jurong  and  the  way his Party  mind  thinks.  The

intention  is to have nomination by the  Party  and

then the nomination need not be confined to Members

of the Assembly, which is the second sub-clause. It

might  be  of  some advantage in disposing  of  the

matter  on  principle if sub-clause  (1)   and  sub-clause  (2)   were taken together. Am I  right?  The

Member for Jurong could confirm that.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Would the Member prefer to deal

with his proposed amendment to clause 4 (2)  now?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, line 19, to leave out from "(2)" to

the  end of line 22, and insert "Eleven Members  of

the House of Representatives shall be nominated  by

the  People's Action Party and four Members by  the

Barisan Sosialis".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The second amendment is in order.

Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The reason for

this  amendment  is this. On the basis  of  the  37

seats which the P.A.P. have acquired, it is only 72

per  cent out of a total of 51 seats in this House.

If  they  were to elect representatives, then  they

could only he entitled to 10.8 representatives, and

the    Barisan    Sosialis    should    have    3.8

representatives.  This is why we should  have  this

amendment to this effect. It is based on  fair  and

just  principles, and not like the P.A.P.'s  unfair

tactics.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It has been proposed, as the first

amendment to clause 4 (1), in page 2, line  18,  to

leave   out  "elected  from  the  Members  of   the

Legislative Assembly" and insert "nominated by  the

People's Action Party and the Barisan Sosialis".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That the words proposed to be

left out, be left out."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the

problems  which confront hon. Members on the  other

side  of the House is the illogical nature of their

stand,  the  constant contradiction of stand  being

altered on one argument to another, cancelling each

other  out. They were given 15 seats through direct

elections. They said no. They wanted 51. We gave



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>



them  51,  and, at the same time, said that  if  we

won,  15 would be chosen from the Assembly. It  was

clearly stated. I read the excerpt. It is on  radio

tape  and  also on magnetic tape. Even if they  had

protested, by the election results we have a  clear

mandate. That is the first democratic principle, if

they believe in democracy and democratic principles

and  majority  will. But far from protesting,  they

acquiesced  in it in the hope, as my colleague  has

pointed  out,  that  they would  have  a  landslide

victory  and then they would take all the  15.  Now

the  unfortunate event has taken place, and we have

been  generous enough to give them three  seats.  I

have told them just now, Mr Speaker, that in Sabah

and  Sarawak the winners take all. All the 40 seats

go  to  the Alliance. They will miss their  friends

from the S.U.P.P. in Sarawak because they have  not

even found themselves in sufficient numbers to  get

into  the Council Negri, let alone Parliament. Many

of  them have crossed over the border to help those

who  are confronting us. Their friends. Again  they

are responsible for our trials and tribulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must reject this as hypocritical and

deceitful.  First they say we are  not  democratic.

They  want  to go back to the people. Here  are  51

representatives  of the people.  Three  regrettably

are  absent - force majeure. But the other two  have

willingly absented themselves. Now I do not want to

press  this  point. But if we start calculating  on

the abacus, 8 to 37, - five on the Front benches and

three on the Back benches - 8 to 37, we will wind up

by  getting 13 to 2. And again I think it would  be

wrong because it is in the interest of Malaysia -10

million  people - to know that there are such  human

beings amongst us, to hear them and see them in the

flesh in Kuala Lumpur. Mind you, it may not be that

they  can always go there for five years. One never

knows  how  these things develop! But I  will  give

them  this one assurance. I know they have  another

fear,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, that  if  we  elect  them

instead  of nominate them, then we might not  elect

the  most experienced of all their Assemblymen. The

Member for Jalan Kayu is a man of great experience.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>



He  has  been through it all. I can assure  Members

opposite  that  we  have no intention  of  electing

their  three stupidest chaps. In fact, if  we  have

any  say  in  the matter at all, we want  to  elect

their   three  most  intelligent  and  their  three

fiercest revolutionaries to carry the red  flag  to

Kuala Lumpur. But in the name of democracy, we have

decided that we will leave it to them to decide, as

I  have  said at the opening. Whether they want  to

choose the three stupidest fellows, most amiable to

drink brandy and beer with and wine in Kuala Lumpur

at  the  bar and make friends and slowly  insinuate

their  way  among the Alliance friends and  capture

the  Alliance Party, or whether they want  to  send

their  three  fiercest chaps to scare everybody  so

that  power will drop from the Alliance grasp, they

suddenly stricken down with fear, they decide.  But

let  us  have  none of this hypocrisy of  not  only

having  51 to choose from, but also wanting to  get

in  by the back door. By this clause, they now wish

to  nominate somebody who cannot even get a seat in

this Assembly! Just this morning we heard a lecture

on  democracy,  democratic rights,  freedom,  human

liberty and how we terrorise them. And now we  have

the   unholy   spectacle  of  seeing  this   little

amendment being sneaked in whereby the Chairman  of

the  Barisan Sosialis, who is not a Member of  this

Assembly,  can  be  nominated. I  am  not  a  great

supporter of the democratic system in its  absolute

and  prudish form. But this is carrying it too far.

Had  they  only mentioned this to me, I would  have

brought  it  to  the  notice of my  colleagues  and

perhaps   we   might   have  considered   him   for

senatorship and given him a voice in Kuala  Lumpur.

Even now it is not too late. We might mention it to

the  Federal Government. The Yang di-Pertuan  Agong

has powers. He has a few extra senatorships and the

Chairman  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis  can  join  an

honourable  phalanx of men, but  not  through  this

back  door. This Assembly is not the back  door  to

the Federal Parliament.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Prime Minister has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>



talked  about  something very  far  away  from  the

topic.  We  have said that the P.A.P. is trying  to

force  through this Bill to elect 15  Members  from

this  House  to the Central Parliament. The  P.A.P.

and  its  Prime  Minister talk about  fairness  and

justice.  We say it is unjust and unfair, but  they

say we were given a chance and all that. If you  go

according  to  the  simple  arithmetic  learnt   by

primary students, from 51 Members of this Assembly,

if  one is to get 15 Members, then we will get 3.4.

In  other  words, 3.4 persons will be  entitled  to

elect one Central Parliament representative. If you

divide  37  by 3.4. then you will get 10.8  as  the

answer. I think my arithmetic is still quite sound.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, of the 13 Barisan Members, we will say that

if  this  figure of 13 is to be divided  3.8.  then

where  is  the  .5 going to? Is it  to  be  carried

forward  or just to he left out? We ask the  P.A.P.

The  P.A.P. knows full well. The  Assemblymen  are

elected by the people. Now, if the P.A.P. says that

these   elected   Members  are  pro-Communists   or

Communists  or  anti-nationalists, then  why  allow

these  people  to  stand for election?  Why  arrest

these  people after the election? It is because  of

their victory. If they were defeated, then there is

nothing  to  say. Because they are  victorious,  so

they  must put them behind bars. Is that democracy?

If  the three leaders of the unions happened to  be

in  the  P.A.P. and happened to be leading  P.A.P.

unions,  like  our friend, Mr Devan Nair,  leading

the  N.T.U.C., then we say that these three leaders

could  have been appointed representatives  to  the

Central Parliament ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I will try to cut short

what  I  am  going to say  with  respect  to

fairness  and  justice.  The  Prime  Minister  just

cannot  interrupt  me  whenever  I  am  trying   to

explain.  If  I  try to reply to his  interruption,

then his Back-benchers will come out on a point  of

order  and  say that I am irrelevant. He  seems  to

think  that  he  is trying to present  these  three

seats to us as gifts.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>



But  how  is he going to explain to the people?  We

have  not been elected as Members of this House  by

the Party but by the people. If he wants to be fair

and  just  and  wants  to  play  the  game  in  the

constitutional  way, then let these representatives

of  the  people  be given a chance  to  go  to  the

Central  Parliament to express  the  views  of  the

people in their capacity as representatives. If  he

agrees, then we will show by facts in the next five

years.  Let  them show by deeds in  the  next  five

years  that we are wrong and let them prove in  the

next five years whether they have been doing things

in a fair and just manner. But the people have been

given  the impression by the P.A.P. that  they  are

not  so,  because,  in the first place,  the  three

Members of the Barisan Sosialis have been arrested;

the reason is that they were agitating for strikes.

Now,  where  is our autonomy in labour?  They  talk

about  autonomy  in  labour. The anti-P.A.P. trade

unions  have  grievances against the  P.A.P. trade

unions.  That  is  why there were strikes.  But  he

comes to arrest them. Why? How is it that no member

of the P.A.P. has ever stood up to say that we have

labour  autonomy  and it is wrong for  the  Central

Government  to  arrest  the leaders  of  the  trade

unions  belonging to the Opposition? I  am  talking

for  you.  I am not talking for us. We are  talking

about  a  constitutional and peaceful struggle.  If

that is so, then the people can very clearly indeed

see  for themselves that the arrests of these three

leaders  of the Barisan Sosialis were done  by  the

Alliance in order to save the P.A.P. If the  P.A.P.

do not admit this, then they should come out with a

statement that they are no longer interested  in  a

constitutional and peaceful struggle.  They  should

come  out  and  say that under our constitution  we

have  autonomy  in  the field of  labour  and  they

should not arrest these trade unionists. I hope the

Members of the Party in power should know this.  If

they do not know, they should return home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the two Assemblymen, it is said

that  the  police want to contact  them  about  the

investigation of Communist activities. All this  is

humbug. If the purpose is just to arrest them, can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>



the  P.A.P. say that because they are now Left  and

no  longer  here and there are only  eight  of  our

Members  here? We still have 13; no matter  whether

you  say 13 is unlucky. We still have 3.8.  We  are

still  entitled to 3.8 representatives. The  P.A.P.

are  only entitled to 10.8. which can mean  11.  On

our  side  3.8 can also be equal to four.  Then  we

should  be entitled to four representatives and  if

the P.A.P. are sincere, then they should accept our

suggestion - from our side four and from them 11. If

the  P.A.P.,  because of the fact  that  they  have

already  proposed 12, find it difficult to  retract

after wanting to force through the Bill, then  they

have to look after their own business. But, on  the

whole,  I  would say that they should act fair  and

just  according to strict calculations.  Even  when

they  have 11 and we have four, they are  still  in

the    majority.   That   is   according   to   the

constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jek Yuen Thong (In Mandarin): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  did not intend to say anything more  about

it,  but  because of the persistence of the Barisan

Members,  I would like to say a few words on  these

amendments. I am very sympathetic towards  them.  I

sympathise  with  their pains in introducing  these

amendments.  Just look at them! You  can  see  that

there  are  only a few of them. Some of  them  have

been arrested, some have disappeared, some have not

been  elected, and some are not here. That  is  why

they  propose this new figure and that is why  they

strike  a compromise, making a suggestion to enable

certain   of   their  members   who   have   either

disappeared   or   not   elected   to   be    their

representatives  in the Central Parliament.  But  I

will  say  that if these people are not elected  by

the  people of Singapore to be Assemblymen in  this

House,    then    they    cannot    be    appointed

representatives to the House of Representatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point. If they want to elect

anyone outside this House to be a representative of

the  people to the Central Parliament, then  I  ask

whether  he  is a representative of the people  and

can become a Federal representative as well. If  he

has no qualifications and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>



cannot represent Singapore, then he should not be a

representative    in   the   Federal    House    of

Representatives.    As    to    the    number    of

representatives, why should they argue about  this?

They  should  admit their defeat. Why  should  they

haggle  over  these figures? They say we  have  not

been democratic and do not act democratically.  But

I  would ask whether their way is democratic. Those

people have not been elected by the people and  yet

they want them to be representatives in the Federal

House  of  Representatives. This sort of bargaining

is really cheap.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about their arguments of percentage and

decimal points and round figures, perhaps they  are

quite  good in science and mathematics, but I think

perhaps  they  have been calculated for  the  first

time  by  Dr  Tan  Chee Koon who  belongs  to  the

Socialist  Front in the Federation. Is  it  because

the  present  Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis  has

disappeared from this House that they have to  have

Dr  Tan Chee Koon from the Socialist Front in  the

Federation    to    calculate   for    them?    If

representatives who are not Members  of  the  House

can  be  appointed  to be Federal  representatives,

then I cannot understand what democracy means.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  the Member for Queenstown has  said  that

the  Barisan  Assemblymen here no  longer  need  to

follow our Party Chairman. But I would say that the

Member need not worry about it. We are solidly with

the  rank and file of our Party. We will follow Dr

Lee's  leadership  and guidance  according  to  the

party  line  and  policy in  the  interest  of  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past we opposed Malaysia because the terms

of   Malaysia  stipulated  that  the  citizens   of

Singapore could not become Malaysian citizens. This

is  most  unreasonable. The  second  point  of  our

opposition  to Malaysia is that we could  not  have

equal  representation  to  the  Federal  House   of

Representatives. That is why our Party in the  past

opposed  Malaysia. I believe that in the Press  and

in the records of Hansard, it is clearly stated why

we opposed Malaysia. It does not mean



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>



that we are not loyal to Malaysia or to the people.

At  that  time we believed that Malaysia would  not

bring about peace, prosperity and happiness to  the

people  and in their interests, we opposed it.  The

Member has said that the P.A.P. were victorious  in

the  general election, but the people of  Singapore

know  why  they were able to get 37 seats.  At  the

same  time, they are very clear about the  P.A.P.'s

tactics   of   deceit   and   intimidation    which

contributed to their getting 37 seats. The election

was  conducted in an atmosphere of fear.  In  these

circumstances, the P.A.P. were returned  to  power,

securing 37 seats.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I just

draw  your  attention to a section of the  Standing

Orders  relating  to  irrelevance  in  debate?   I

believe  we  have not come here to  listen  to  the

Barisan Sosialis doing their own postmortem on  the

results of the elections.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member for Paya Lebar

confine his remarks to the proposed amendments?  He

seems  to  have  drifted  away  and  is  not   even

discussing  the principle of the Bill. If  he  can,

please  concentrate on the proposed  amendments  to

sub-clauses (1)  and (2)  of clause 4.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I mentioned those things because the P.A.P. thought

that  they  could, by their majority, suppress  our

arguments and speeches. For instance, when  Members

on this side of the House made their speeches, they

were interrupted by the P.A.P. Members. That is why

it  is  necessary to point out that the  people  of

Singapore   should  be  given  a  fair  chance   to

understand what is going on here about this Bill in

a  quiet  and  peaceful atmosphere. As  the  P.A.P.

Members have spoken on certain matters, we have  no

alternative  but to make our replies to  them.  Our

arguments  are based on these reasons. The  general

elections   are   State  elections,   whereas   the

representatives  to the Federal Parliament  are  to

represent  the people of Singapore in  the  Federal

Parliament. According to the proportional



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>



representation in this House, the P.A.P. cannot get

12.  We have been pointing out our reasons to  show

why we should be entitled to four. Whether there is

a  decimal  point  or not or a round  figure,  they

should  he  able  to understand simple  arithmetic.

What  is their basis of calculation which will give

them  12 seats? Is it based on 37 seats or  on  the

total  votes  cast? We just want to understand  the

basis  of their calculation which they claim  would

entitle  them  to  12  seats.  According   to   our

calculation, we should be entitled to  four  seats.

What  we  want to understand is, how  they  can  be

entitled to 12? We insist on having four.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I have to admit that when I was

in  school I was very poor in mathematics. But what

I  really  cannot  understand is  why  the  Barisan

Sosialis do not want to be frank. The beginning and

the  end  of  the story of the Barisan Sosialis  is

that   they   want  more  seats  in   the   Federal

Parliament. So, why not be frank and say so? As the

Prime  Minister  has said, we are even  willing  to

hold another election for 15 Members if the Barisan

Sosialis  are prepared to pay for the cost  of  the

election.  So,  why not he a hero  and  accept  the

challenge instead of touching on irrelevant matters

- "We calculate 3.8 and so on."? I advise them to do

it  this way. Be very sincere and loyal. As I  have

said  just  now,  "Work harder for  the  people  of

Singapore  and  do not work hard  for  the  foreign

masters." If they will not do this, then  the  next

time  they will not even get one and three but they

will get one upon three.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Before I put the Question, in order

to  avoid confusion, the first Question I will  put

is  on the amendment to clause 4 (1)  - as there  are

two amendments to sub-clauses (1)  and (2)  of clause

4.  The Question is, "That the words proposed to be

left out, be left out."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It has also been moved as an

amendment to clause 4 (2):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out all the words in sub-clause (2) and

insert-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eleven Members of the House of Representatives

shall be nominated by the People's Action Party and

four Members by the Barisan Sosialis".



The Question is, "That the words proposed to be

left out, be left out."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 5 to 8 inclusive ordered to stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Preamble ordered to be the Preamble to the
