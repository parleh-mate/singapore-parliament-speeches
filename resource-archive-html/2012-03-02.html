(Mr S Iswaran) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry)</strong>
                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, let me first highlight that the geopolitical tensions
in the Middle East and Iran's decision to halt oil exports to certain
European Union countries have not significantly affected global
oil supply at this point in time. The affected EU countries have
started turning to alternative sources of crude oil supply to meet
their needs. Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer and
exporter, has also made commitments to increase oil production to
compensate for any shortfall in supply due to the Iranian oil curbs. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1726</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7d095a6e-2656-451d-b8af-7c0a405771f1">
                  <a name="id-9d2bdc22-5b1d-40d6-81cb-5e6ee96c77f2__id-7d095a6e-2656-451d-b8af-7c0a405771f1"><!--a--></a>Although the developments in Middle East
are evolving and highly uncertain, they have not had a major impact
on our domestic costs at this juncture. As such, we are maintaining
our 2012 GDP growth forecast at 1% to 3% and the CPI inflation forecast
at 2.5% to 3.5%. The Government will continue to closely monitor
the situation, and take these into account when reviewing its GDP
growth and inflation forecasts. Nevertheless, we recognise the risk
that a deteriorating situation in the Middle East may cause oil prices
to raise. Indeed, UK Brent oil prices have risen from around US$110
per barrel at the end of last year to more than US$120 per barrel
recently, close to the recent peak level registered in April 2011
when the Middle East and North Africa faced significant political
unrest. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-21201d76-d96e-4741-baae-dc5da6426227">
                  <a name="id-9d2bdc22-5b1d-40d6-81cb-5e6ee96c77f2__id-21201d76-d96e-4741-baae-dc5da6426227"><!--a--></a>Should this trend continue,
we, as a small economy almost wholly reliant on imported energy,
will face higher energy prices. Businesses, particularly in energy-intensive
sectors such as transport and chemicals, could face rising costs.
Electricity and gas tariffs may also increase as the price of natural
gas, which is used for electricity and town gas production, is pegged
to oil prices, which is the usual practice in the Asian gas market.
To enhance our resilience against supply and price shocks in uncertain conditions,
diversification of our energy sources is key. Diversification will
help ensure that we continue to have secure and competitively priced
energy supplies to support our growth. We will continue to explore
the development of viable alternative fuel sources. For example,
we are building a Liquefied Natural Gas, or LNG, terminal which
will provide access to the global gas market. Electricity import
is another option that we are considering, which could allow Singapore
to tap into new energy options that may be unavailable or economically
infeasible in Singapore. The Government also works with industry
players to explore alternative feedstock options to increase the
competitiveness of the more energy-intensive industries, such as
refineries and crackers, in Singapore. For example, the Economic
Development Board (EDB) is exploring using Liquefied Petroleum Gas
as a complementary feedstock to naphtha.</p>

the Government also promotes more efficient energy use, and encourages
businesses to play their part in using a scarce and precious resource
wisely. We provide grants for energy efficiency projects, administer programmes
which encourage energy efficient design and technology, and work
closely with companies to uncover opportunities for energy efficiency
through audits and benchmarking studies. Adopting energy efficiency
practices helps companies cope with energy price volatility in the
short term, but also prepares them for a future that will increasingly
be energy constrained.</p>

our economy and the need for companies especially SMEs to improve
productivity was a topic that many of the Members of this House
spoke about over the last few days as we debated the Budget. Singapore
still remains quite a distance behind most developed economies in
terms of productivity. To be able to address the issue, SMEs must
be the focus as they are a significant part of our economy. To achieve
this, businesses have to invest in their people, processes and leverage
on technology to create higher value jobs for Singaporeans and those
who work in Singapore. This will require funding.</p>

Credit (PIC) which was introduced in 2010, together with the enhancements
announced in this year's Budget will be valuable in providing companies
especially SMEs the impetus for investments in innovation and restructuring of
businesses. It will help to address the cashflow required for substantial
upfront expenditure required for restructuring. I was heartened
to hear from Deputy Prime Minister Tharman when he summed up the
Budget that no effort would be spared to help SMEs in this drive
to restructure their businesses. While I did get his assurance that SMEs
will not be required to read all the 66 pages of the PIC Guide to
apply for the scheme, I do, however, want to ask that we still give
some serious thought to simplification of the application process
and the access to PIC. Apart from the complexity of the scheme and
the application process for the PIC, the feedback I received from
the various dialogues with business leaders indicates that the qualification
criteria for PIC are fairly rigid. In the ICPAS Pre-Budget 2012
Survey, although PIC was the top initiative that was utilised by
respondents, there was still a significant difference between widespread
awareness and actual utilisation of the incentive scheme. To encourage
greater adoption of PIC by SMEs, I think that it would be worthwhile
to review the qualification criteria and to simplify the application
process. </p>

the adoption of the scheme is to have an exclusion list on what
would not qualify rather than a qualifying list. Another feedback
is the conditions to qualify require substantive and fairly significant
expenditure and are almost always expenditure-based. As mentioned,
the PIC forms in themselves are not too difficult, the challenge
is in understanding the criteria which companies are required to check, validate
and get the appropriate approvals from relevant agencies against
their other tax criteria. </p>

the Budget debate this week, there has been a lot of discussions
on productivity and the need for companies to innovate, and to improve productivity.
What I would like to ask is: what measures have public agencies
taken to innovate and improve productivity in their operations?
Has there been streamlining of processes to improve the handling
of citizen/business applications and requests? Like the experiences
that the hon. Ms. Indranee Rajah shared in her Budget debate speech, many
of us will have similar scenarios on the ground that we could share,
where there could have been more effective partnerships and approaches
taken by the public agencies to address issues on the ground. While
our agencies are effective and efficient in each of their areas
of responsibilities, cross agency collaboration can be improved.
Is there a coordinated effort across the relevant Government agencies
to drive better collaboration and hence improve productivity and
positive citizen experience?</p>

the procurement process and strong management of projects to achieve
intended outcomes and fiscal accountabilities? What is being done
to ensure a balance between operational efficiency and risk of fraud?
How will fiscal disciplines be maintained while allowing for flexibility in

                  </span>:
Based on the recommendations of the Economic Strategies Committee
(ESC) in 2010, Budget 2012 announced that Temasek has put together
a consortium of reputable financial institutions to establish a
specialised project finance company (PFC). I would like to understand
more specifically how the PFC will benefit our companies.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7a64c9c1-b59c-4508-80e7-16c29916d165">
                  <a name="budget__id-7a64c9c1-b59c-4508-80e7-16c29916d165"><!--a--></a>First, the PFC will aim
to have about 80% of its portfolio comprising cross-border projects
with significant Singapore-based corporate participation. What does
the Government mean by "significant Singapore-based corporate participation"?
Does significant participation means majority ownership? And how
does the Government define
a Singapore-based company for this purpose? Does it have to be headquartered in
Singapore, listed on the SGX or majority owned by Singaporeans?
Is a Singapore subsidiary of a foreign multinational company considered
a Singapore-based company?</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-83cff479-ef97-4957-85b8-39ff241622f3"><!--a--></a>I hope the Government
will have clear guidelines on this. The ESC has made it very clear
what the gap is and that is to facilitate cross-border financing
for our companies that are investing in large-scale projects overseas,
because project finance is significantly less developed in Singapore
than elsewhere and capabilities of our local banks in this area
are relatively limited. These concerns do not exist in the case
of companies that can access project financing outside Singapore's
financial system.</p>

that as foreign export/import banks (EXIMs) remained largely nationalistic,
Singapore companies are currently disadvantaged in this aspect.
In order to help our companies compete on an equal footing, will
the PFC adopt a similar approach to the foreign EXIMs? The Singapore
Government will provide backing to the PCF by guaranteeing it debts.
Will the PCF require some form of participation by Singapore companies
in every project that it finances?</p>

Sir, I would like to raise one point regarding our Sovereign Wealth
Funds (SWFs). The reason we have two SWFs – GIC and Temasek – which
operate separately as private funds with larger risk appetites is
because they are supposed to target different types of investments.
However, in recent times, they are starting to look very similar
and are also investing in almost similar assets. This is not a good
trend as we may be over-investing and lack diversification in our
investments, which could come back and haunt us doubly hard if these
sectors are hit by problems. We have seen this when we were hit
by the number of investments in financial institutions by both entities
in the last few years. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-bfaf89ed-e8e6-4e01-af73-8905170043e1"><!--a--></a>The reason this is happening
is due to a lack of coordination. I think this problem first started
when Temasek first reviewed its charter in 2009 in conjunction with
its 35th Anniversary where it started developing a more fund manager-like
charter and added greater international outlook to its investments. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f8f8ca45-b70f-492e-b0be-a6ac2a41250d">

redefine the charters of both GIC and Temasek and also play a more
active role in coordinating their investment philosophies. This
oversight will allow MOF to ensure that there are no overlaps on
the types of investments that GIC and Temasek make. Sir, the SWFs
have a huge responsibility. Besides helping Singapore in its economic
strategies, they also have to ensure that they do not dilute the
reserves through their investment philosophies. Although their investments
should not be politically influenced, I think MOF should not shy
away from carrying out a coordinating role as it would be beneficial
for Singapore as a whole. </p>

to raise three broad points on tax changes in this year's Budget.
First, I would like commend the Government for introducing the GST
Vouchers on a permanent
basis in this year's Budget. While GST credits paid out in previous
years provided some relief for households, there was, nevertheless,
some apprehension on the part of these Singaporeans. Their main
concern was in anticipating if these credits would come the following
year – so there was a sense of uncertainty at that time. The voucher
system has provided the much needed assurance to these households
in this regard. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-35e1e796-52b3-4a36-a98a-b4467884154a"><!--a--></a>In the past, Sir, I have
argued about the case for removal of GST for basic necessities. A
grassroots leader of mine recently asked me why the Government zero-rated
GST for gold investments, a luxury item, and not for basic necessities.
I would like to seek clarification why the Ministry of Finance opted
for the vouchers instead of removing the GST from the basic items.
I would think that the GST Voucher system is administratively more
cumbersome than the zero-rating of GST of basic necessities. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b1a5aacc-a4dd-4cde-96c7-b1dab6612aad">
                  <a name="budget__id-b1a5aacc-a4dd-4cde-96c7-b1dab6612aad"><!--a--></a>Sir, on corporate taxes,
the tax changes to the Mergers and Acquisitions scheme, where companies
can now claim up to 200% tax allowance on the transaction costs incurred
is a welcome initiative as many companies in the past, particularly
the smaller ones, were put off by the relatively high transaction
costs. This is therefore a step in the right direction but I urge
the Government to review the $100,000 cap, so that it will stimulate
M&amp;A deals of bigger nature. At the present cap, companies would
qualify for up to $34,000 of tax allowance a year based on a 17%
corporate tax rate, and may not be enough to stimulate the very
large deals as the transaction costs associated with those are high
due to a larger pool of professionals working on them.</p>

is already one of the most competitive but I thought that it was
about time that we rationalise the top personal income rate tax
with the corporate tax level so that both are aligned. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-53eea78f-ff78-4a1c-bb7d-37a26ac8e24c"><!--a--></a>Sir, adjustments to the
Earned Income Relief for the older workers is a welcome move to
help them save for their retirement. But I am surprised that there
was nothing done to ensure that this problem was nipped in the bud
this time and does not carry forward to the future generations of
Singaporeans. The Government could have perhaps encouraged additional
tax deduction for voluntary CPF contributions, or reviewed the Supplementary
Retirement Scheme to allow greater tax deductible contributions
so that younger Singaporeans can now already start saving for their
retirement. By not addressing this problem at this time, we will
be revisiting it at every generation and we may have to continue
using more Government top-ups rather than equipping them to be self-sufficient.
That would have been in line with this Budget for the future – about doing
something now that will help them in the future without Government's intervention.</p>

Mr Chairman, I would like to ask for the Ministry's support in recommending
an increase in the Handicapped Child Relief (HCR) and the Working
Mother's Child Relief (WMCR) for handicapped children. Currently,
the difference between the Qualifying Child Relief (QCR) for a normal
child and HCR is only $1,500 – $4,000 versus $5,500. But surely,
the difference in the cost of bringing up a normal child compared
to a handicapped child is significantly more than that. In addition,
the QCR or HCR, together with the WMCR, is currently capped at $50,000
per child regardless of the condition of the child. I hope that
the Ministry will consider a higher relief for the WMCR for the
mother of a handicapped child.</p>

the tax reliefs for supporting a normal spouse and a handicapped

levels are falling most. According to an MCI survey recently, whist
productivity grew in the manufacturing sector by 8.7%, it fell in
the service sector, particularly infocomm's business services and finance
down 3%. So what are we doing to ensure that the PIC scheme reaches
out to these sectors that most needed?</p>

For the PIC to benefit the low-income segments, we may need to be
more flexible. Requiring a staff size of at least three local employees
will exclude a significant proportion of micro enterprises, including
social enterprises, who may not have regular or sufficient cashflow
to support full-time salaries. It may also exclude hawkers or many
of those in the bottom 20% of our income segments, and these are
the people who need the most help. The Government had stated that
the PIC is for all businesses, but instead of staff size criteria,
would the Government consider more targeted ones such as auto qualification
for the scheme if you have been in your second year of business,
for example? Or perhaps, one for one cap on each equipment type
per staff?</p>

Is the Government confident that firms which qualify under the current
scheme are not gaming the system? For instance, is there no reselling of
equipment subsidised by taxpayers? And as foreign companies are
also eligible for the PIC, how can we be sure that the equipment
subsidised by Singapore stays in Singapore?</p>

Mr Chairman, according to figures released in the Budget highlights,
actual headcount in the public sector rose 14% in just four short
years from FY2006 to FY2010, and is poised to increase significantly
more this year. Based on my own estimations, it would probably exceed
20% in the six years from FY2006 to FY2012. And these numbers do
not even include headcount in Government-linked institutions and
companies like the restructured hospitals and the universities.
At the same time, the Government is promoting productivity and innovation
in a very tight labour market. So my question is whether the public
sector is setting the right example for the rest of Singapore.</p>

Second Minister for Finance mentioned that it used its manpower
management framework to allocate manpower resources prudently, and
it allows headcount growth to meet our growing challenges at a rate
no more than Singapore's resident labour force growth rate. According
to MOM figures, the resident labour force grew 9% from 2006 to 2010,
yet the public sector headcount grew 14%. May I ask for an update
on how the manpower management framework is working?</p>

rest of us in the private and non-profit sectors are really suffering
from labour shortage. The lack of human resource is the greatest
challenge in the non-profit sector where I work. And I think Government
is at an unfair advantage because every time it cannot attract enough
staff, it can just raise the pay, and just last month, we saw that.
When my little NPO loses people, many of them go to Government bodies. </p>

staff numbers is something that the non-profit sector can only dream
about. And besides, the Prime Minister is asking the civic society
to do more! </p>

the private and public sectors, there is a lot of inertia and I understand
that it is often difficult to reap productivity savings. You can
only make a quantum leap if you really look at ingrained ways of
doing things and fundamentally change them. This could involve disruptions.
Like Ms Jessica Tan, I urge the Government to cut red tape further,
review all the bureaucracy and regulations that it imposes on the
private and people sector. They are often a huge drag on productivity. But
I do strongly suggest an active involvement of people from the private
and people sector in this, because internal reviews can only bring
you so far before you hit a wall.</p>

Mr Chairman, one of the issues that many companies go through at
some point in their life is that they decide certain functions need
to be outsourced and this applies to both companies and governments.
Now, one of the issues that arises when functions are outsourced
is that quite often, these outsourced functions are put up to competitive
tender. When it goes to competitive tender, quite often, the cheapest
bid will end up winning. Now, one of the side effects of the cheapest
bid winning is that this often puts a downward pressure on the wages
of the workers in those outsourced functions.</p>

Minister of State for Finance recently informed this House that
all public agencies are encouraged to adopt the recommendations
in the Tripartite Advisory on the Responsible Outsourcing, I was
actually quite heartened. I understand the Government is working
with its tripartite partners to update the advisory and to ensure
that the public agencies are aligned with the revised requirements.
The benefit of this proposal is not just for the Government sector
but if the Government sector goes to what may be called best sourcing
rather than going to the cheapest source, that may hopefully have
knock-on effects to the private sector companies as well because
that may drive up wages in the sector altogether. The cleaning sector
is a good example because I understand the Government employs a
large number of cleaners in the cleaning sector. I believe 6,000
out of 46,000 local cleaners. This may be a good way to drive up
the wages of the cleaners.</p>

wanted to check if the Ministry of Finance can update the House and
share what other details of the measures that will be taken, especially
those that will help low-wage workers receive higher wages and better
employment terms. I would also like to ask the Ministry of Finance
if it would be monitoring and assessing the proportion and wages of workers on contract
with the Ministries hired through the Best-sourcing Initiative (BSI).</p>

Sir, I would like to ask the Ministry of Finance whether it would
consider issuing TOLs for State land at the community rate for community
use. This issue first came to my attention when I was attempting
to solve yet another traffic problem in my area. This was the Sikh
temple at Jalan Bukit Merah which is an old temple and, therefore,
there is not an awful lot of parking space there. I noticed that
there was an unused school across the road and suggested that they
might want to consider applying for permission to use that to park
cars. I applied to SLA for them. Approval was initially granted
but, for various reasons, the scheme has now not gone through partly
because of the constraints in terms of time. It is only available
for a short period and it is now required for another use.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c4cd299d-ec1e-4fb3-918f-6f9572800c3b">
                  <a name="budget__id-c4cd299d-ec1e-4fb3-918f-6f9572800c3b"><!--a--></a>In the course of this,
I realise that the TOL for use of that school was actually rather high
and I made inquiries of SLA why that was the case. SLA informed
me that currently the use of State land pursuant to TOL may be permitted
upon payment of a licence fee but under current MOF requirements,
the TOL is charged at a commercial rate depending on the type of
use. And I thought whilst that was appropriate for commercial use,
it may not be so suitable when the intended use is community use.
So I wanted to ask the Ministry of Finance whether it would be prepared
to consider at least for such instances, TOL fee at a community
rate for community use and/or for community uses. So, for example,
churches, temples or community organisations where it is clear that
the use is for a social or a community purpose.</p>

Sir, I am happy to learn that individual and corporate donations
to Singapore charities have grown over the last decade. I also want
to give due credit to the Finance Minister for the extension of
the 250% tax deduction benefit for donations to IPC at the last
year's Budget. This is a positive move which would entice donors
to continue donating generously. However, while philanthropy have
increased in Singapore over time, when compare with many countries,
we are still lagging behind in charitable giving and generosity.
If the World Giving Index 2011 published by Charities Aid Foundation
is any indication, Singapore was ranked No. 91 in the world. In
the whole of ASEAN, Singapore was just ahead of Vietnam but behind
neighbouring countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-47a7133d-e221-47a6-b751-e8501f2ffe77"><!--a--></a>Due to the globalised
nature of our economy, Singapore experienced a wider income gap
than many countries. Based on a report by Boston Consulting Group,
Singapore has the highest concentration of wealthy households in
the world; 15.5% or nearly one in every six households has more
than $1 million in assets. So, there is really no excuse why our
charitable donations are lagging behind countries that are less
affluent than us. I hope the Ministry of Finance would look at further
schemes to encourage philanthropy and to encourage those who have
done well to give back to society.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0ac0adce-aa6a-4acd-92b5-bb082c08d00a">
                  <a name="budget__id-0ac0adce-aa6a-4acd-92b5-bb082c08d00a"><!--a--></a>As only about 21% of the
population in Singapore pay income tax, the reach of the income
tax deduction benefit is quite limited. So, we should look at non-income
tax related avenues as well to encourage Singaporeans and non-residents
to donate more; especially those that may be income poor but rich
in assets. At the end of the day, we would also want these charitable acts
to come from our hearts. I hope that the Government can step up
its messaging on philanthropy and encourage more giving by those
Singaporeans who have done well. By cultivating the virtues of giving
back to society, it is an important way to strengthen cohesiveness
in our society even as the income and wealth gap widens.</p>

Josephine Teo)</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Chairman, first, let me thank
all the Members who have spoken for their comments and suggestions
on a fairly wide range of topics. The questions and cuts that have
been filed centre around three areas: the first is on facilitating
businesses, especially our SMEs; the second is on an efficient and
effective Government; the third is on how we can nurture a caring society.
Sir, I will address each of these themes in turn.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-047899f5-fb4b-47fe-a8f4-dd3b58c10911">
                  <a name="budget__id-047899f5-fb4b-47fe-a8f4-dd3b58c10911"><!--a--></a>Let me start with facilitating
businesses. Ms Jessica Tan and Ms Tan Su Shan suggested simplifying
PIC and making it more accessible to SMEs. I think we have heard throughout
the debate many concerns on how SMEs can be helped to make this transition.
We share these concerns. I would like to emphasise that although
the PIC is available to all enterprises, it is, in fact, designed
very much with small businesses in mind. PIC is available to all
enterprises and they can qualify without having to meet any special
criteria.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-24e1b988-b06b-48f5-8e19-2e7d3ade6706">
                  <a name="budget__id-24e1b988-b06b-48f5-8e19-2e7d3ade6706"><!--a--></a> Now, all businesses,
including small and micro enterprises as well as sole proprietors
can benefit from the PIC. Based on the tax returns filed last year,
one in three or more than 25,000 small companies claimed PIC. This
is a good start since 2011 is the first year of PIC claims. We are
quite confident that with improved awareness, more SMEs will be
able to take advantage of the PIC.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-13f369e7-3613-4148-8290-3dcd2c03e1dc">
                  <a name="budget__id-13f369e7-3613-4148-8290-3dcd2c03e1dc"><!--a--></a>Since the PIC was introduced
two years ago, we have also acted on feedback and improved the scheme
to better benefit small businesses. First, recognising the value
of cash flow to small businesses, we allow them to opt for a cash
payout as an alternative to tax deductions. So, for example, if
a small business incurred $10,000 worth of qualifying expenditure,
it could previously get a cash payout of $3,000. From this year, the
cash payout is doubled to $6,000. Second, the cash payout can now
be claimed at the end of each financial quarter rather than at the
end of each financial year. So for SMEs, this further eases their
cash flow. Third, we have made it easier for businesses to claim
PIC for in-house training and they can now claim up to $10,000 per
year on their in-house training course without the need for certification
by WDA or ITE. This change arose from the feedback we received about
how the scheme can help to benefit SMEs in particular.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e7decc25-985f-4e24-868f-930b68508b22">
                  <a name="budget__id-e7decc25-985f-4e24-868f-930b68508b22"><!--a--></a> Some businesses may have
the impression that it is difficult to make PIC claims. In fact,
the process is fairly straightforward - the claims are made as part
of the annual tax filing process. Quite a number of people do not
realise it. You have to file your tax returns anyway and whilst
you are filing your tax returns, you can make your PIC claims and
a taxpayer needs only to provide a few additional lines of information.
I have checked it out myself. It is really just a few additional
lines specifying what their productivity investments were. The PIC
does not require an "ocean of paperwork" which was a phrase used
by the hon Member Mdm Foo Mee Har yesterday, as feared by SMEs. No
ocean of paperwork. In fact, there is no need to produce any additional
supporting documents as this was discovered by Ms Yoong Chwee Hwa,
Director of Creative Edge Consultants
Pte Ltd. They are a small business in design and project management,
less than $2 million in turnover with fewer than five employees.
Like many of the other SMEs who have actually claimed PIC, Ms Yoong
told us that she thought it was a lot simpler than she originally
imagined. Now, if the earlier cash payout is preferred, a business
just needs to complete an additional simple form. That is only if
they want the cash payout. Otherwise, if they want to claim it against
their taxable income, they do not need to put in any additional
form.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-aafbb3eb-6fb4-4161-847a-4f9a1bdee313"><!--a--></a> As the PIC is a relatively
new scheme, we fully recognise the importance of communications
efforts which many MPs have emphasised, especially to SMEs. More proactive
outreach is needed. Since the PIC was announced in Budget 2010,
IRAS has, in fact, held nearly 150 seminars or more than one seminar
per week reaching out to more than 20,000 people. IRAS will keep

it will also step up its outreach in three ways.</p>

new series of PIC clinics which offer one-to-one consultations to businesses
in partnership with the five major business chambers and associations.
The clinics will be held weekly over the next six months and will
be free of charge. Businesses do not have to pay to get this one-to-one

to continue, please be assured we will do so.</p>

on small and micro enterprises operating in HDB neighbourhoods,
which is where many of our SMEs are. This will be through a new programme
organised jointly with the Community Development Councils, the CDCs. The
first such seminar will, in fact, be held this month at Kembangan/Chai

service providers like IT vendors, software providers and trainers

on whether the three-employee condition can be removed, I would
like to clarify that this condition is only applicable to the cash
payout feature of the PIC. No such requirement is needed for claiming
the tax deduction itself. Now the three-employee condition is to
ensure that cash is dispersed only to businesses with substantive
operations. This helps to prevent a potential gaming which Ms Tan
also expressed concern over, by individuals who set up businesses
to get a cash subsidy for essentially personal purchases. So, if
they buy an iPad and set up a company, without this condition of
three-employee, they can also get this cash payout. That is the
purpose for introducing this three-employee condition – only for
the cash payout, but not for the cash deduction. </p>

Mr Seng Han Thong for suggesting that taxi companies be allowed
to claim PIC on the training of taxi drivers. We have considered
the suggestion and will indeed implement it from Year of Assessment
2012. We will align the treatment for taxi driver training with
the training of insurance agents, real estate agents and financial
advisers, who will also qualify for the PIC. We will make every
effort to simplify the
PIC so that more businesses especially the SMEs can get easy access.
Mr Chairman, if you would allow, I would like to summarise it in

Innovation Credit (PIC) was introduced only two years ago, some
businesses may still be unfamiliar with the scheme. Nonetheless,
one in three small companies have benefitted from PIC. To help SMEs
raise productivity, the Government will further simplify PIC to
make it more accessible to them.</p>

that the PIC claim process is simple and straightforward. PIC does
not require additional application procedures – claims are made
as part of the annual tax filing process.</p>

that cash flow is important to SMEs. Thus, small businesses can
opt for the cash payout option as an alternative to tax deductions.
We have also doubled the cash payout conversion rate from 30% to
60% or up to $100,000 of qualifying expenditures. For example, an
SME that invested $10,000 in new equipment or training for its workers
is now eligible for a $6,000 cash payout. In the past, a company
could only receive the cash grant after filing its annual tax return.
Starting this year, we have also allowed cash payout claims to be
made at the end of every financial quarter.</p>

feedback from various sources, the Government will enhance our efforts
to raise awareness of the PIC amongst businesses. This includes
providing one-to-one consultations to businesses that are conducted
free-of-charge; holding seminars targeted at small and micro enterprises
operating in HDB heartlands; and engaging service providers so that
they can help their customers benefit from PIC. </p>

                  <span class="ph hcInline hcLang">(<em class="ph i">In English</em>): </span>Mr Ong Teng
Koon's request for an update on Singapore's progress towards full
convergence of the Singapore's Financial Reporting Standards (SFRS)
with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). As
an international business and financial centre, it is in Singapore's
interest for the SFRS to converge with the IFRS. Using a single
set of high-quality globally-accepted financial reporting standards
will help to minimise reporting costs for our listed companies that
operate in multiple jurisdictions and also make it easier for companies
to participate in the international capital market. The SFRS is
closely modelled after the IFRS. In 2009, the Accounting Standards
Council (ASC) announced that it would work towards full IFRS convergence for
Singapore-incorporated companies listed on the Singapore Exchange
by 2012.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2a2bb99f-dfa9-4c05-9fed-b1f80dd85727">
                  <a name="budget__id-2a2bb99f-dfa9-4c05-9fed-b1f80dd85727"><!--a--></a>Since then, it has proactively
engaged the International Accounting Standards Board on Singapore's
convergence initiative, commissioned in-depth research and undertaken extensive
consultations with our local stakeholders on the implementation
plans. Internationally, there have been some delays to the broad
convergence initiative. Standards
under review by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)
such as the revenue recognition and financial instruments have attracted
extensive comments and differing views internationally and are unlikely
to take effect before 1 January 2015. The Accounting Standards Council
has thus reviewed Singapore's convergence plans and concluded that
we should not rush into convergence until these key standards are
finalised so as to avoid additional transition costs for our listed companies.
Therefore, our full IFRS convergence will not take place by 2012
as originally envisaged. The timeline for convergence will be adjusted
in tandem with international developments. The revised timeline
will be announced at an appropriate juncture, and we would like
to assure the affected companies that we will give them adequate
time to prepare for it. Convergence is not expected to be unduly
demanding because our standards are already very much aligned, nor
is convergence expected to result in significant costs for listed
companies. </p>

to further support internationalisation efforts, a Project Finance Company
(PFC) will be operational from the second half of this year. Mr
Chen Show Mao sought to understand how the PFC will benefit local
companies. The PFC addresses a market gap in long tenure, cross-border
project financing. The PFC, which is a commercial venture led by
Temasek Holdings, will address this gap and catalyse the supply
of such project financing. Local companies will benefit in the following
ways: first, access to financing gives them added confidence and
ability to bid for major projects on an equal footing with their
competitors, who typically have funding support from their respective
national Export Import (EXIM) banks. The PFC removes a constraint
on our companies where Singapore companies have had to partner foreign contractors
to tap financing facilities overseas. And, as Mr Chen pointed out,
we have put our companies at a slight disadvantage. So this opens
up opportunities for our own SMEs to participate in these projects. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-826d58a6-936d-45b8-8d6c-cc21f7750e44">
                  <a name="budget__id-826d58a6-936d-45b8-8d6c-cc21f7750e44"><!--a--></a>Mr Chen has a specific
question on the definition of Singapore-based companies. We have
defined a Singapore-based company as one that is listed or incorporated
in Singapore and have at least three global or regional strategic
decision-making functions located in Singapore. This is the definition
that is commonly used in incentive schemes of our enterprise development
agencies. While this definition does include foreign companies based
here, these companies will have substantial presence anchored in Singapore.
And there are significant spin-offs to the economy such as value-add
and jobs created because they use Singapore as a base for internationalising
and undertaking major projects overseas. This will strengthen our
position as a global Asia hub. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a60ba999-4f85-4823-8d58-899bced83344">
                  <a name="budget__id-a60ba999-4f85-4823-8d58-899bced83344"><!--a--></a>Mr Chen also asked whether
the involvement of Singapore's companies will be a requirement in
every project. Let me reiterate that the PFC will aim to have 80%
of its long-term portfolio comprise projects with significant participation
from Singapore-based companies. This already assures us of significant
benefits because the Singapore-based company must have at least
three global or regional strategic decision-making functions located
in Singapore, which I have explained earlier. The additional condition of
local partnership, if we were to put it in, will unduly constrain
the borrower and make it less attractive for the deal to be financed
out of Singapore. So if we make that as a requirement, you might
not even get it. Notwithstanding this, our economic agencies will
continue to facilitate meaningful partnerships between our local
SMEs and international companies for infrastructure opportunities
in the region.</p>

related to an effective and efficient Government, beginning with
the management of our reserves, which Mr Inderjit Singh raised.
He had suggested that Government plays a coordinating role between
GIC and Temasek to ensure that there are no overlaps. His key concern
is that even as GIC and Temasek manage their own portfolios on a
diversified basis, taking them together, there could still be concentration
risks in the overall Government portfolio. Mr Inderjit Singh's question
is a valid one and I should assure him that the Government does,
in fact, systematically review the risks in its overall portfolio.
We do this by considering the Government's whole portfolio of assets
invested by the three entities – MAS, GIC and Temasek. We monitor
for concentration risks in the whole portfolio, and whether there is
appropriate diversification in terms of asset classes, sectors and
geographies. We also assess the impact on the whole portfolio of
various adverse global scenarios across medium to long-term timeframes,
to ensure that the risks to the whole portfolio are not excessive.
MAS, GIC and Temasek, in fact, operate at different parts of the
investment risks spectrum, even if there is some overlap. They engage
in different investment strategies and take different degrees of
risks. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-df5e5f3f-b22d-4bb5-ab8f-0450825dda09">
                  <a name="budget__id-df5e5f3f-b22d-4bb5-ab8f-0450825dda09"><!--a--></a>MAS, as a central bank,
is the most conservative of the three. A significant majority of
its diversified portfolio is in low risk and liquid investments.
GIC's mandate is to preserve and enhance the real value of Singapore's
foreign reserves over time. GIC's portfolio is well-diversified
across asset classes including equities, bonds, real estate, natural
resources and some other asset classes. It is also highly diversified internationally.
Temasek's mandate is to create and deliver sustainable returns for
its shareholders over the long run. This has remained Temasek's
mandate even after its Charter was revised in 2009. Temasek is an
equity-only value investor. It takes concentrated stakes from time
to time but its portfolio remains diversified and it is also invested
across sectors and geographies. I should add that Temasek's strategy
of actively investing internationally begun much earlier than 2009
– it made the shift in 2002 and has since achieved more diversification
by reducing its previously heavy concentration in Singapore assets.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9b60b11a-7bc4-48c2-8863-bb8e335f7b27">
                  <a name="budget__id-9b60b11a-7bc4-48c2-8863-bb8e335f7b27"><!--a--></a>The Government does not
decide on how each investment entity should manage its own portfolio.
Their respective boards and professional management teams are responsible
for those decisions. The Government's role is therefore two-fold:
first, and foremost, we ensure that these investment entities have
competent boards to oversee how their respective management teams
execute their investment mandates. We also ensure that these entities
have proper mandates and objectives. Second, based on the overall
risk profile of the Government's whole portfolio, we decide how
Government capital should be allocated among the three entities.
Further, we ensure that GIC, Temasek and MAS are sensitised to Government's
considerations with regard to these overall risks. It is therefore
not an auto-pilot system. We have a governance structure for looking
at our Whole-of-Government assets within the system and for monitoring
the overall risks and returns. It is a structure that has worked
well and that we will keep improving. </p>

Mr Laurence Lien's question on the public sector promoting productivity
and being efficient in the use of manpower resources. The growth
of the public sector headcount in recent years reflects the greater
manpower needs on the public sector in essential areas such as education,
public security and healthcare. The 14% cited by Mr Lien was largely contributed
by major increases in teachers and allied educators − in fact, the
allied educators scheme is a completely new scheme − and also of
security personnel. Teachers, allied educators and security personnel
accounted for nearly two-thirds of the overall increase. So, a very
large portion of that 14% was really due to teachers, allied educators
and security personnel.</p>

the teaching force as well as allied educators is well-known because
they have improved pupil-teacher ratios and supported more customised
learning in schools.</p>

2004, the Ministry of Finance has introduced the manpower management
framework or MMF to promote discipline in public sector hiring.
This also attends to Ms Jessica Tan's earlier question on fiscal
prudence and how do we manage our resources. The MMF constraints
the overall growth of the public sector manpower to keep it in line
with Singapore's resident labour force growth in the long run. Since
the introduction of the MMF in 2004 to 2011 – if you look at the
whole period, since MMF was introduced, public sector headcounts,
in fact, increased 8%, compared to the resident labour force growth
of 19% over the same period. So, that is the update that Mr Lien
was looking for. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f7c600c9-7e6e-472b-ad08-8a4a952b1ad9">

fact, introduced initiatives to improve productivity and efficiency
by leveraging on technology, for example. The Immigration and Checkpoint Authority
(ICA) introduced the enhanced Immigration Automated Clearance system
in 2006. This has helped to relief the manpower pressures on ICA
despite the large increases in cross-border travel in recent years
and also improved security at our checkpoints. We acknowledge Mr
Lien's point that manpower issues are a key challenge faced by the
social services sector. Mr Lien mentioned salary increases in the
public sector as one of the factors contributing to these challenges. </p>

sector, the public sector cannot and does not depend only on salaries
to attract and retain good staff. Salary adjustments are made only
when benchmarking studies indicate a need to keep pace with the
market. Last month's review, which Mr Lien mentioned, was in fact
for a group of civil servants whose salaries were last reviewed
five years ago in 2007. So it is not all that frequent − it was
quite some time ago. We support more being done to enable the social
services sector to groom a larger pool of social workers and professionals.
It is very important for the ongoing development of our social sector
and this would involve providing not just better rewards but also
fulfilling careers. MCYS will implement a comprehensive social sector manpower
development plan and ensure that adequate resources are provided
to support it. MCYS will elaborate on this at their COS. The Government
will continue to seek ways to increase productivity and efficiency
in manpower use while ensuring sufficient resources to meet emerging
needs and priorities.</p>

about procurement compliance in public agencies and fraud risks.
MOF regularly reviews our financial rules and guidelines. A comprehensive review
in 2010 led to the clarification of key procurement roles and further
segregation of duties to strengthen checks and balances in the procurement
process. Public agencies were also reminded to adopt good practices
such as periodic rotation of officers with procurement responsibilities.
We are also developing a business intelligence system that will help identify
procurement irregularities, point them out, flag them out and show instances
of non-compliance. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-611be68d-ee3e-4c80-906b-7a39f02cdb92"><!--a--></a>To minimise opportunities
for fraud, we must complement sound rules, systems and processes
with effective management, supervision and robust audits. Since
June 2009, public procurement officers have been required to complete
a mandatory training programme. MOF also organises discussion forums
and workshops for procurement officers to share and learn good practices.
And to ensure the prudent use of public funds, the Accountant General's
Department conducts regular Value-For-Money audits on expenditures
of public agencies. Learning points on these audits are shared with
senior management of the public agencies and also tabled at various
Government platforms. All said, the professionalism and the integrity
of public procurement officers is what really matters for a well-functioning
system of public sector procurement. We will continue to emphasise
this to our officers that they need to be responsible for upholding these
values.</p>

other theme of nurturing a caring society which Mr Liang spoke about
and also Mr Vikram Nair. We recognise that MOF can help to nurture
a caring society. Let me just highlight two areas. First, on uplifting
low-wage workers and a tax regime that encourages giving. Mr Vikram
Nair requested for more details on the Government Best Sourcing
Initiative. In consultation with tripartite partners, the Ministry
of Manpower is working closely with the National Environment Agency
and the Ministry of Home Affairs to enhance their respective cleaning
accreditation and security grading schemes. The enhanced schemes
aim to raise the productivity and professionalism of low-wage jobs
as well as help workers earn higher wages and enjoy better employment
terms. MOM will be announcing further details at its COS. What I would
like to give assurance of is that MOF will give full support to
the enhanced accreditation schemes. We will make it mandatory for
all Government agencies, which include Ministries and statutory
boards to procure only from accredited contractors.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-72001129-7d9b-4ebe-aefe-b6c16fa5f4c3">
                  <a name="budget__id-72001129-7d9b-4ebe-aefe-b6c16fa5f4c3"><!--a--></a>This means that any contractor
wishing to bid for Government cleaning contracts must be accredited
under the enhanced schemes. In the case of security contracts, the contractors
must obtain at least an A or B grade. Tripartite partners are working
together to finalise the criteria for enhanced accreditation. This
work is in progress. Once the criteria is finalised, sufficient
time will be given for contractors to be accredited. The Government
will consult the industry and set an effective date from which only accredited
contractors can bid for Government contracts. We expect that within
two years of the effective date, the vast majority of Government
cleaning and security contracts will be serviced by accredited contractors.
Let me assure Mr Nair and other Members that the Government recognises
that Ministries and statutory boards as significant buyers of services,
have an important role to play in providing momentum to the Best
Sourcing Initiative.</p>

alone cannot transform the cleaning and security sectors. Government
contracts cover just about 10% of the cleaning workforce. In this
regard, we are heartened that autonomous agencies such as the restructured
hospitals and universities have already indicated their support
for the Best Sourcing Initiative (BSI). We share Mr Nair's desire
to see many more companies come on board to support the BSI. The
Government hopes that by taking the lead, we will provide a strong
signal to the entire
private sector to embrace the Best Sourcing Initiative and help
in this very meaningful national effort to uplift low-wage workers. </p>

important topic that many Members have spoken about during the debate.
It has to do with how we, as Singaporeans, look out for one another
and contribute to worthy causes as we build an inclusive society
together. Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked if our ranking on the World Giving
Index of 2011, showed that Singaporeans were less charitable than
in other countries and if more could be done to encourage philanthropy
amongst higher income individuals. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-68fe4899-a76a-49dc-90a5-7a327f67b97b">
                  <a name="budget__id-68fe4899-a76a-49dc-90a5-7a327f67b97b"><!--a--></a>Sir, I would like to clarify
that the methodology used in the construction of the World Giving
Index, or WGI, actually understates the level of charitable giving
in Singapore. The WGI measures the percentage of people who donated
and volunteered a month before the survey was conducted. An alternative
study was done by the NVPC, which tracks individual giving over
a full year. And in 2010, the survey found that 85% of the Singapore
population contributed money whilst 23% volunteered time in 2010.
This is significantly higher than the 41% and the 11% recorded under
the WGI. Nonetheless, we agree with Mr Liang that those who are
better off should be encouraged to contribute more and that is why
we increased the tax benefit from 200% to 250% for donations to approved
recipients in Budget 2009 and also provided matching grants for
donations to Institutes of Higher Learning through the $2 billion
Singapore Universities Trust and to the long-term care sector through
the $1 billion Community Silver Trust. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-36840597-e96f-4125-b0af-93b62caf45d8">
                  <a name="budget__id-36840597-e96f-4125-b0af-93b62caf45d8"><!--a--></a>Of course, we also have
non-tax measures to increase giving. The Charity Council and MCYS
have been working to enhance public confidence in our charities.
The NVPC has rolled out initiatives such as the Community Foundation
of Singapore and the Singapore Gives online portal to encourage
giving as well. To Mr Liang's question on whether there is support
to encourage the setting up of charitable vehicles, let me highlight
two specific ways. First, we exempt all our charities from income
tax. Second, in Budget 2007, we introduced the qualifying grant
making philanthropic organisation scheme. What this scheme allows
is tax deductions for donations to grant makers, such as family
foundations, community foundations and business giving programmes.
Since inception, 10 charitable vehicles, such as the Anglo-Chinese
Schools Foundation have registered to benefit from the scheme. We
are very encouraged that charitable giving has, in fact, been growing
steadily in Singapore. We know that many Singaporeans want to do
their part to give to the community. And with them doing so, Singapore
can become a more caring and inclusive society. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-37120b24-80c7-4c20-a275-348004af8e17">
                  <a name="budget__id-37120b24-80c7-4c20-a275-348004af8e17"><!--a--></a>Let me now address several
specific questions raised by Ms Indranee Rajah, Dr Chia Shi-Lu and
Mr Inderjit Singh. Ms Indranee Rajah asked whether MOF would be
prepared to consider charging a community rate for state land use
for community purposes and/or use by community users. The Government's
policy is to charge market rates for the rental of temporarily unused
State land to recognise the true value of the land. I understand
where Ms Indranee Rajah is coming from. She will be pleased to know
that if there are grounds to subsidise the operations of an organisation,
the relevant Ministry will consider doing so, for example, MCYS
currently provides rental subsidies to some VWOs, operating day
care centres and senior citizen homes.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a947fc9c-f497-44cb-85b9-2c8b63a9bfa0">
                  <a name="budget__id-a947fc9c-f497-44cb-85b9-2c8b63a9bfa0"><!--a--></a>This approach of charging
State land use at the market rate and the Ministry providing subsidies
in a directed manner is a more transparent and targeted approach. Dr
Chia Shi-Lu asked if MOF could consider increasing the income tax
relief for handicapped family members. We share his concern for
such families. In 2008, we increase
the Handicapped Child Relief from $3,500 to $5,500. In 2010, we
allowed tax reliefs for the handicapped to be claimed regardless
of the dependent's earned income. However, we are mindful that about
40% of individual income tax payers already do not pay taxes after
reliefs and rebates. So, higher reliefs are less meaningful to them.
That is why we have introduced other support measures to help persons
with disabilities, at all stages of life. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1744</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-066460f8-e1f3-4026-a244-f1b6b231c044"><!--a--></a>In Budget 2012, we have
made significant enhancements including increasing places in centres
for children who need intensive early intervention; and also extending
the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme, as well as the Special Employment
Credit to lower-income Singaporeans with disabilities. Nonetheless,
let me assure Dr Chia that we will continue to review the relief
quantum and adjust them from time to time. Mr Inderjit Singh gave
several tax-related suggestions on the M&amp;A Allowance Scheme.
It has just been liberalised to cover transaction costs. The scheme
targets SMEs which tend to have smaller deal sizes and the $100,000
cap on transaction cost is sufficient for most. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e143e6e5-3f9f-4113-9540-b391bf914692">
                  <a name="budget__id-e143e6e5-3f9f-4113-9540-b391bf914692"><!--a--></a>On aligning top Personal
Income Tax (PIT) rate with the corporate income tax rate, there
is currently no compelling reason to do so because these are different
tax types and our PIT rate remains competitive. On tax deduction
for voluntary CPF contributions, Mr Inderjit Singh's broader point
is how we can use fiscal policy to better support retirement adequacy.
Retirement adequacy is a very important subject and will be comprehensively
addressed in the Ministry of Manpower's COS.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1391e22f-3d9d-4e70-91df-114a0bafd328">
                  <a name="budget__id-1391e22f-3d9d-4e70-91df-114a0bafd328"><!--a--></a>Sir, let me once again
thank all Members for their comments and suggestions. To summarise,
MOF has taken a comprehensive approach towards facilitating businesses, ensuring
an effective and efficient Government and playing our part in nurturing
a caring society. First, we will continue to facilitate businesses,
particularly SMEs. Ensuring that the PIC claims process is straightforward;
doubling the PIC cash payout option from 30% to 60% of qualifying
expenditure up to $100,000 and allowing claims to be made quarterly
rather than annually; relaxing the criteria to allow PIC claims
on in-house training without WDA/ITE certification. Those are some
of the moves that have been made. We will also introduce more channels
to help businesses learn more about PIC and get help. MOF will continue
to play our role in reinforcing the efficient and effective use
of manpower resources. Let me just close by saying that on the Best Sourcing
Initiative, we will do everything that is within our means to make
it an important tool to uplift our low-wage workers' wages and working
conditions. Through our tax regime and matching grants, we will
encourage philanthropy and support the less fortunate.</p>

Mr Chairman, thank you very much. I refer to some of the cuts that
were made on tax issues and I would like to come back to some of
the charts that the Minister for Finance used yesterday in his speech
and, particularly, one that caught my attention was on car ownership.
If you have a car, there are certain savings, if you do not have
car, actually, you will have more tax savings now. I am not sure whether the variables
and the assumptions behind those figures are available in the public.
I checked the Budget 2012 website. I could not find them there.
It could be there, but I just could not find them, but can I get
an assurance from the Minister that those assumptions and variables
will be made public and will be made known?</p>

Thank you, Sir. I would like to follow up on the statements made
by the Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister yesterday. Deputy
Prime Minister Tharman talked about an inclusive society, uplifting
people who are less privileged. I think that is a very laudable
objective. I want to remind him that there is one group of people
– polytechnic students – who are not enjoying equal public transport
concession fares as their peers in JCs and ITEs. This is a subject
that has been discussed many times. Now that we have breached the
Rubicon, with the Government prepared to fund directly our public
transport companies, we should look into assisting this group directly.
I estimated that it is about $30 million to $40 million a year.
So, say, if it is a permanent feature, then it will be $200 million
for five years. Would the Minister consider raising the $1.1 billion
by about $200 million or so, so as to correct this inequality?</p>

Mr Chairman, Sir, my second question is for the Minister of State.
I am a member of the Public Accounts Committee. We listen to the Auditor-General
regularly. We study his report. We have also called up the Chief Accounting
Officers (who are the Permanent Secretaries) of MHA and MOF, for
dialogue and discussion. It seems that some of the feedback we got
was that there are many different Ministries – some large, some
small, there are many different statutory boards – some large, some
small. A particularly disturbing feedback was for that of smaller Ministries
and statutory boards, they do not have, say, a DSTA-equivalent in
the Ministry of Defence. And, for good reasons, many of the officers
have to be rotated and sometimes, they are rotated out in the middle
of a procurement project. There is no opportunity for deep, institutional
knowledge and skills-set to set in especially for smaller Ministries
and statutory boards. Would the Ministry consider setting up a central procurement
unit for the Government so that smaller Ministries and statutory
boards can opt in and avail themselves to such expertise?</p>

                  </span>: Mr Chairman, I thank Mr Foo for his
observations. Indeed, it is a challenge, especially for the smaller
agencies. And it is not just in procurement. It is in a variety
of functions that they have to perform, whether it is HR, administration,
finance, audit. They do not have a very large pool of people to
be able to support these functions. In order to standardise and
ensure compliance and also keep up high standards, the Government
set up Vital.org to consolidate some of these activities so that
there can be greater economies of scale. There can be more specialised
expertise being built up. Central procurement currently is not one
of them right now, but I take his feedback and we will certainly
look at it.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Ms Indranee Rajah</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Chairman,
I thank the Minister of State's clarification and her response on
community use. I just have two comments. One is that, whilst I appreciate that
certain Ministries will subsidise certain types of use, it would
seem odd to do so, for example, when you are having a church or
a temple that needs to use the space as a car park. It just seems
odd to be subsidising such an organisation for car parking, and
I would have thought that a better approach would actually be to
have a discounted rate.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-bc9e73f4-b36a-4bbf-a6e4-32487ad75dbf">
                  <a name="budget__id-bc9e73f4-b36a-4bbf-a6e4-32487ad75dbf"><!--a--></a>And the second point is
that the alternative is that you do not use the land at all, in which
case, the land does not earn any money. So, I do not expect a definitive
response today, because I do not expect that I will get one, but
I would hope that the Ministry of Finance would look into it and
consider it. We have another year before the next Budget, so there
is plenty of time to consider the matter.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-03403c69-86fb-4e6a-badc-9f61a3455dae">
                  <a name="budget__id-03403c69-86fb-4e6a-badc-9f61a3455dae"><!--a--></a>The second point, if I
may, Mr Chairman, and I would try to wrap it up within a minute, is
that the Minister of State spoke about the use of technology for
productivity for Government services. I acknowledge that. But I
think that it is sometimes more than just a case of technology,
it is a question of taking ownership of the issue, it is a question having
initiative and making sure something gets done. Two illustrations
– very quickly – my favourite topics: Kim Yam Road – Seventh Moon
– always very crowded, always complaints from residents because
of the festival and activities at the temple there. It has been
going on for many years, and every time the residents have to call,
it takes time for the LTA officer to come down. By that time, the
offenders have moved off. I therefore have to suggest to LTA that
it might be a good idea to actually be there at the peak hours before
it starts and take care of the problem, and that did a great deal
to resolve the issue. You do not need technology to know that you
should come down. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-2230a677-df5c-4cb7-bc79-7663b3459797"><!--a--></a>The second point – Robertson
Quay. Because, after a certain time, you want the noise to die down,
so I suggested, perhaps, having much brighter lights after a certain
time to say that the party is over. The response from LTA was: we
cannot raise ambient lighting because it would destroy the ambience
of the place. My response was that I am not asking for an increase
in ambient lighting but for floodlighting after a particular time. LTA
said they would look into it. They did. What they did was they increased
the ambient lighting. I waited, of course, because that is not going
to work. So, after several months, they said that increasing the
ambient lighting would not work. I said, yes, I know, could they
please consider floodlights? The answer that has come back is, well,
we now have to consider the loading on the bridge to see whether
the floodlights can be put on the bridge. I have suggested that,
you know, we do not have to put floodlights on the bridge, you can
put it on the land next to bridge, on <em class="ph i">terra firma</em>, and that
would take care of the issue. They are considering this now.</p>

sharing of the very innovative approaches that she has taken in
the community. I can attest to the fact that technology is not the
only way in which we are trying to improve efficiency and promote innovation.
And I do agree that, sometimes, a fresh perspective offered by colleagues
– and that attest to Ms Jessica Tan's earlier point about whether
agencies do work in partnership and leverage on one another's expertise,
knowledge, best practices – those are also very important. So that
point is very well taken. </p>

on the part of TOL land for community use, the purpose of charging
at market rate is not to earn money. The objective is to find a
way that is equitable, and so that all players can have a fair way
of accessing that land. Also, I think, from the point of view for
community uses, how the scheme has been set up is to say that you
do not have to confine yourself to these kinds of land, and there
are other types of facilities and lands that you can also access.
So, it is not to turn them in the direction of such unused State
lands. I just wanted to clarify that.</p>

Sourcing Initiative, I understand that one of the things that will
be looked at is the employment terms given by the accredited contractors.
Now, in the process of working out these criteria, I would just
like to make two points on what those employment terms probably
should take into account. One is where, say, language and literacy
are not that important, perhaps that should not be emphasised too much
because, for many people, for example, they can do cleaning jobs
but may be concerned about keeping their job if the criterion goes
up. So that is one tension. </p>

it would also be good if we can look at the salary requirements
and so on, to make sure that at least the income is protected. Both
of these are for Singaporeans.</p>

I would like to thank Mr Nair for his very useful suggestions. Indeed,
I think when MOM reviews the criteria, it is doing so together with NEA
and MHA, who are the users of these services but, at the same time,
they are getting very valuable inputs from the Labour Movement,
NTUC. Specific units are participating in it and looking at it from
the workers' standpoint and asking how this is really useful to us.
So I think it is an effort that needs the inputs of the relevant
stakeholders and I can assure Mr Nair that the items that he has
talked about, including salaries, they are also being looked at. </p>

two questions regarding the PFC. It seems that the criteria allow
Singapore incorporated foreign companies with zero Singapore ownership
to take part. The first question is that can the evaluation criteria
be bias in such a way that it will favour companies with local ownership
so that we can help grow locally-owned companies? The second question
is that by having only 80% of the projects required to be Singapore-based
companies involved and not 100%, is it because we are not confident
that there will be enough projects that will involve at least some
of our local companies?</p>

                  </span>: Mr Chairman,
I will try to be brief. On his second question first: why 80% and
not 100%? Actually, with the requirement to have 80% of the portfolio comprised
projects with significant participation from Singapore-based companies,
the mandate of the PFC is very clear. However, as with any investment
portfolio, the PFC needs
to diversify its project portfolio and also the risks. Other countries
and their EXIMs are far larger than Singapore's and able to achieve
sufficient risks diversity within their own country's industries
and companies. So, it is a practical concern there. With us, there
is a reason why we have decided to allow the PFC some flexibility
to provide financing for projects not involving Singapore-based
companies. It is to our benefit that the PFC is able to diversify
and manage it risks to enhance the commercial viability. So, that
is to the second question.</p>

I have every confidence that Singapore companies are up to it and,

you keep your head afloat?" And he shared with me that the ability
for him to concentrate on what he and his partners are able to do
best in terms of the knowledge they brought to their business area
was critical, while the programme that they were in provided the
ecosystem of support in terms of the right financing, which he said
actually was not the most critical, although very important for
start-ups. It was really the ability to address new markets, the
ability to be able to tap those new markets. These were the factors
as well as the ability to mingle and get to know people within that
industry and pick on the brains and the best practices. And yesterday,
the industry event I was at was actually a platform for these start-ups

                  </span>: Sir, Singapore's
successful economic growth was largely predicated on export-oriented
focus. This has worked for us for many years. However, as of today,
many of our overseas trading and export markets are struggling and
in certain cases deeply mired in recession. The US is still struggling
to recover from the 2008 global financial crisis despite the recent
uptick in economic data. Europe is in the middle of a deep crisis
with dismal projections for growth. Tensions in the Middle East are
threatening a spike in oil prices and even China is showing signs
of an economic slowdown. The OECD reported a bleak forecast for
the global economy for the next three years. The International Monetary
Fund is sticking to its forecast robust growth for Asia despite
looming economic problems across the world, but has recently said
that growth has tilted towards the downside. So, taking all these
considerations on board, what is MTI's strategy for growth for Singapore
going forward? And, in particular, what are the sectors and industries
that MTI thinks will be our new engines for growth?</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Dr Chia Shi-Lu</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Chairman,
much has been said about the imperative to raise productivity in
all sectors of the economy. The Economic Strategies Committee has recommended
annual productivity gains of 2% to 3%, if we are to achieve our
economic and wage growth targets. I just want to ask how this is
to be achieved given that Singapore has managed to grow productivity
by only 1% per annum in the last 10 years, with some sectors actually
undergoing negative productivity growth. I hope that MTI can provide
an update on proposed strategies to achieve these productivity growth
targets, and in particular, if there are new initiatives given the
changing complexion of the global economy. And how will MTI continue
to support companies in investing in productivity measures beyond
the PIC scheme given the uncertain economic outlook? </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8bdb579f-4eaa-43a2-a1df-4cb0bff20e82">
                  <a name="budget__id-8bdb579f-4eaa-43a2-a1df-4cb0bff20e82"><!--a--></a>More importantly, how
can MTI ensure that productivity and economic growth is shared among
Singaporeans, in terms of concrete benefits such as real wage growth?
If we were to observe general trends worldwide, much of the gains
from productivity growth and innovation are accrued to the owners
and shareholders of companies. And the concern is this: If our local
companies and SMEs should become more productive, how can we ensure
that the increase in revenue and profits are distributed and shared with
the workers? </p>

Wall Street Journal</em> found that as companies produced more with fewer
workers or improved the output of existing workers, the lion's share
of that gain in the form of record profits went to the CEOs, shareholders
and highly paid professionals, rather than to workers in the lower
rung in the form of pay raises. The global human resource consulting
firm, Mercer, also found that companies are increasingly segmenting
their workforce to concentrate rewards on key and top employees.
They are less concerned about the lower level employees since it
is far easier to hire their replacements. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-cdd7f560-bb7c-4996-8daa-6e6edd1420e7">
                  <a name="budget__id-cdd7f560-bb7c-4996-8daa-6e6edd1420e7"><!--a--></a>Another concern is that
if wages represent a significant portion of production costs, then
the best way to improve productivity is simply to reduce the workforce.
Studies at Wharton's Center for Human Resources have found that
and I quote, "a generation ago, when a company laid people off,
employees who remained saw little change in their work. Now that's
not true. When there are layoffs, the people who survive find they
have a lot more work to do. Pressures from shareholders and the
owners can drive cutbacks even if the company is doing well and
productivity is up." While the workers who remain employed may at
least benefit from higher wages, what about the workers who have been
made redundant? These I do admit are difficult questions to answer
and I look forward to the Ministry's views and proposed strategies
to deal with them.</p>

Mr Chairman, with the services sector playing an increasingly important
role in our economy, business leaders have highlighted that this sector
offers potential for Singapore's growth. However, we have been having challenges
really looking at improving the productivity of the sector. Suggestions
have been made to look for ways to accelerate the transformation
of the services sector in Singapore. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7ad5b9ec-84f2-4811-a18b-394254a0e74f">

companies in this sector will need to look at re-designing their
operations. Apart from improvement in operations, there will also
be a need to review
the pay structure to attract the right talent to this sector to
increase value-add and improve productivity. To encourage a change
in perception of service jobs in sectors like cleaning, retail,
F&amp;B, there will be a need to look beyond pay, to encourage a
culture of respect for these jobs. There must be investments made
to provide better work conditions as well as good career advancement
opportunities for these jobs.</p>

also explore is the injection of fresh talent to the services sector.
An idea – I would not say it is not a new idea – but it is an idea
that I thought about is attracting students to take up these jobs
on a part-time basis or as part of an internship. I remember during
my younger days, which seems like a long time ago, it was common
to see students take up these jobs during school holidays or on
weekends. While it does help with the pocket money and the extra
funds, what is important is it provides an injection of an understanding
of what it takes to do the job and also a little bit of respect
for the service culture. And I think we really need to look back
and say why did that stop, because it has kind of stopped and when
students do take up these jobs these days, it is just for extra
funds.</p>

productivity is that it is determined not by quantity but by quality.
So, we must somehow look at how we can accelerate the transformation
of the services sector to drive greater productivity and I think
we need to get fresh perspectives. We need to get a new injection
of talent in that space in order to rejuvenate it so I think we
need to look for new avenues of especially local talent.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Ms Tan Su Shan</strong>
                  </span>: Thank you,
Chairman. Given that productivity growth is a core focus for the
Budget, for us to know that we are on the right track, we need accurate measures
of our productivity and growth. However, getting the right method
to measure productivity is not easy in Singapore. Most take a very
rudimentary approach which is you divide your total output by total
labour force. But output in Singapore is highly cyclical and susceptible
to volatilities in business cycles. As a result, productivity growth in
Singapore becomes very cyclical. If you look at the 2009 to 2011
numbers, they were very volatile and that was due to the cyclical
impact of business cycles. These co-mingle our real productivity
gains. So, the question is: would MTI agree that a better measure to
reflect in improvement in productivity would be the average or even
the median real income growth for Singaporeans? After all, productivity
growth is really a means to an end and if the end gain is a real
growth of 30% accumulative real income for Singaporeans in the next
10 years, then let us not forget that productivity growth is just one
way of getting to our end goal.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a1f26505-88cd-430d-b4f7-036dada8f9b5">
                  <a name="budget__id-a1f26505-88cd-430d-b4f7-036dada8f9b5"><!--a--></a>And according to an MTI
study, productivity gains do drive real wage growth. For such gains
to translate fully into higher income, then one needs to limit inflation
to help the economy restructure. My question is: what are the moves
to limit inflation, particularly domestic inflation and are there
any qualitative aspects that can help this productivity.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-caeb42de-3e55-4483-9e6e-c38ae0472939">
                  <a name="budget__id-caeb42de-3e55-4483-9e6e-c38ae0472939"><!--a--></a>Sir, moves to limit inflation.
In my speech yesterday, I stressed that whilst a strong Sing dollar
policy does help mitigate imported inflation, one of the key issues
is domestic inflation. Does MTI have a target to reduce this? And
would the Government consider other kinds of monetary policy focuses
like interest rates or supply side measures to temper these inflationary
pressures that is wiping out real wage growth?</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1752</p>

productivity. So far, the Government's focus is to improve and measure
productivity and the focus has been very much on technology, innovation
and skills training. Perhaps, we can also focus on more qualitative
aspects. And this could be very simple things like better team work,
better collaboration, better sharing of resources both in the public
and the private sectors because this means we save time, we save
money and if we save time and we save money, then the same amount
of work can be done by fewer workers and this also raises productivity.
But how does one measure this? It is probably a lot more difficult.
So, does the Government have plans for a more distilled and accurate
measure of productivity? </p>

Sir, it will be hard to wean off over-reliance on cheap foreign
labour due to outdated strategic decisions made on our economic
model. Here, I would propose changes to specific policy items regarding foreign
workers. </p>

S Pass holders have increased steadily over the last decade. There
are easily over one million foreign workers in Singapore. More than
20% of the entire population are made up of foreign workers. Easily
more than 40 to 50% of the workforce in Singapore will be made up
of foreign workers. This is not healthy. This should also be seen
in the context of the Government's apparent aim to have a population
of 6.5 million some time between 2020 and 2030. Which other nations,
or even city-states, depend so heavily on foreign workers?</p>

of all sorts in the chemicals and marine industries in particular.
According to figures obtained from the Ministry of Manpower through
this House, these specific industries have had a dependency ratio
of about one to five or one to seven over the last decade. This
means that for every local employed, they are employing five to
seven foreign workers. I understand the need for foreign workers
in the construction industry, but if the Ministry's reply is that
no Singaporeans want jobs in the chemicals and marine industries,
then why does the Government continue to pursue these industries?
Perhaps, it is time to conduct an economic review and introduce
restructuring measures. The entire economic growth model should
be recalibrated to creating jobs for Singaporeans, not just to creating
jobs in Singapore. Secondly, I would like to revisit levies as a
tool for controlling the foreign worker population. Levies push
up the cost of business and the eventual victims are consumers in
Singapore. As such, I propose the following mechanisms. </p>

of the construction and marine dependency ratio to one to three.
By 2015, firms in these sectors should be completely compliant.
Before 2015, firms in these sectors who comply with a one to three
ratio can receive tax incentives. Remove levies: levies only increase
the cost of doing businesses, and this cost is passed on to the end-consumer,
means that we should rely on minimum dependency ratios to control

Sir, many Members of this House have spoken about escalating business
costs in Singapore being a worrying trend. I, too, am concerned
that this may impact our global competitiveness. The combination
of a strong Singapore dollar, higher wages and levies, rising rent,
as well as general inflation are pushing up the costs of doing business
in Singapore. The issue of rising labour costs is repeatedly cited
as the top challenge amidst a tight labour market. A survey of the financial
returns of the top Singapore companies showed that profit margins
are being "squeezed" and still have not returned to pre-crisis levels.
We are now ranked one of the most expensive cities to live in the
world − higher than New York, London and Hong Kong. This could make
Singapore less attractive when compared to our regional peers. I
would like to understand the impact of the strong Singapore dollar
on our competitiveness, both in terms of export competitiveness
as well as a location for business operations? How have our cost
structures evolved over time? What could the Government do to help
moderate rising costs? And at what point does the Government intervene
with measures to stay competitive? </p>

                  </span>: Sir,
as I mentioned in my Budget debate speech, our SMEs are badly affected
by the double whammy of rapid costs increases and a tight labour
market due to the Government's restructuring efforts. The strategy
to create a productivity-led growth, and simultaneously cut reliance
on foreign labour, is not wrong but let us be realistic and not
expect everyone to make progress overnight. </p>

for us to restructure our economy. But, as in the past, the model
for restructuring seems to be based on what works for multinationals
and big companies and the Government is assuming that what works
for big companies will also work for smaller companies and this
is completely a wrong assumption. Unfortunately, many of our economic
policies, along with it the incentives and support schemes, are based
on this same principle and were designed with big companies in mind.
The successes of these schemes are also measured by KPIs which favour
helping bigger companies and do not motivate our civil servants
to help smaller companies. So, we see many small companies not benefiting
from them, including the productivity incentive schemes, thus the
Government has had to retune the scheme yet again this year. I have said
a few times in this House that the approach taken by the Government
should be turned the other way round, upside down. Start with your
economic re-modelling by looking at SMEs first and it will follow
that bigger companies will also benefit and not the other way round.
Design incentives schemes with SMEs in mind and the big companies
will also have no problems benefiting from these. Sad to say, in
all my years here, I have seen that the Government has not been
whole-hearted when it comes to helping SMEs. </p>

I am disappointed that the Government has ignored the cost issues
faced by businesses, as many Members have brought up. This years'
Budget assumes that cost is not a problem. Many of the incentives
assume that companies will make profits and therefore will get something
back from the Government. When costs are too high, there is no or
little profit, so who gains from all these schemes? I feel that it
is a grave mistake on the Government's part of still ignoring cost
as a problem. </p>

I spoke about the problems created by JTC as also many Members in
this House have brought up, with the change of this policy some
years ago. As a result, our SMEs are hurt by the escalating land
costs and rental costs, which not only impede on their operational
cost structure, but also deter them from expanding here in Singapore,
and this is forcing them to expand overseas. This is a critical
factor going forward and I would like to seek clarification from
MTI if this policy would be reviewed. What needs to be done is to
adopt, as I mentioned, a differentiated land policy. Do not let
market prices drive the rent. Let us compare ourselves against other economies
in the world of similar industries.</p>

and SPRING Singapore, I feel that the Government can do more to
help start-ups in the later stages, particularly with overseas expansion.
Currently, SPRING and IE Singapore are two agencies with a focus
to assist locally-based enterprises, with the former emphasising
capability development and the latter, internationalisation. Whilst
the intent is to have specialised expertise to assist and support
companies, this has also resulted in gaps to provide comprehensive
and integrated assistance to foster globally competitive companies
as a seamless approach to nurture them from young. Potential locally-based
companies which have the wherewithal to become Globally Competitive
Companies (GCCs) but have reached a certain size may also not be within the
ambit of either agencies and, hence, are not well served. Other
agencies with domain expertise, like A*STAR, IDA, MDA, and so on,
may not have a clear enterprise development role, nor are their
KPIs directed in this focus.</p>

that not all of the 165,000 SMEs can internationalise. But the Government
can do more to help new firms go overseas, especially with issues
such as cross-border financing, credit guarantees and many other
support structures. One way to do this is to give SPRING "an additional
charter" of helping local companies and entrepreneurs link to overseas
markets. There is a scope for IE and SPRING to merge – in fact,
I mentioned this many times in this House before − to create a bigger
and stronger agency supporting start-up and the growth of companies
here in Singapore. This may perhaps also help the Government understand
our SMEs better and devise better economic policies to support them.
We have some distance to go still in this area. I have spoken about
the need for an agency focused on developing more Singapore global
companies before and I hope that we make this a reality soon. If
we had provided for such an agency, we would have sent a clearer
and stronger signal to our local enterprises that we are committed
to focusing on their development. </p>

on R&amp;D, while we have done a good job in input factors like
the amount the Government has spent in R&amp;D, the equivalent outcome
of this R&amp;D is far from desirable. The substantial investments
in R&amp;D in the recent past have failed to yield commensurate
commercialisation and tangible start-up spin-offs. Singapore's diversification
into higher value added economic activities now needs to become
much more entrepreneurial and self-sustaining. We need to move away
from providing incentives to attract foreign companies and foreign
researchers because this distorts the playing field for local enterprises.
In fact, many of the big names that we got here, by giving them
research incentives and funding, have also left Singapore, after
the funding was used up. I am not saying do away with attracting
MNCs altogether, but we should also place an equal emphasis on encouraging
local enterprises to do more in this area.</p>

However, we need to signal to SMEs that we understand that this

transition. And I hope that we will not ignore the plight of our
SMEs because they are really struggling, and I am afraid that if
we do not take the concrete actions now, before long we will see
many of them folding up and we will lose that big support base that
we have that creates our job opportunities for Singaporeans. </p>

the restriction on foreign worker quotas, as everyone in this House
acknowledges, is probably going to hit SMEs and micro-enterprises
the hardest. And industries such as construction and manufacturing
have been mentioned but also much smaller enterprises including
hawkers and small-shop operators. There is also tension because
in some industries such as construction, we expect a lot more construction
work coming up in the pipeline. Some of these industries may need
to hire more, going forward. And I understand the need to reduce
the dependence on foreigners as well as to get more Singaporeans
into these businesses. One of the things that will follow through
from that is that the cost on wages is likely to go up as well because
Singaporeans will expect to be paid more. The question I have is
really a broad one, and echoes many of the sentiments that Mr Inderjit
Singh raised earlier. Will there be any further measures to be implemented
to help SMEs cushion the blows in this transition and is it also
possible to provide targeted help to these local enterprises in transition
to hire more Singaporeans and help them to manage their businesses
in transition?</p>

Lim Hng Kiang)</strong>
                  </span>: Sir, I would like to thank Members
for their comments and suggestions. Let me first outline Singapore's economic
challenges and explain why we need to restructure for growth. Minister
of State Lee Yi Shyan and Minister of State Teo Ser Luck will then
elaborate on our programmes for increasing productivity, securing
new markets and assisting our SMEs.</p>

noted, we are facing a protracted slowdown in our traditional markets
in the G3 economies. The rise of Asia, however, provides opportunities
for growth, but that opportunities also mean more competition from major
Asian cities. Beyond our traditional competitors like Hong Kong
and Tokyo, as China and India grow rapidly, we will face new competitors
from the major cities there. Going forward, therefore, Singapore
competes not just with countries, but with cities as well, especially
in the services sectors.</p>

has a city GDP that is larger than ours; 75% of its GDP is in services;
it is growing at more than 8% per year and it has been moving into
higher value-added activities. Its Zhongguancun (中关村) is
commonly referred to as "China's Silicon Valley". Beijing hosts many headquarters
of Chinese companies as well as research centres of top MNCs like
Microsoft and Intel. It is a formidable competitor for RHQs and
OHQs as well as a city for conventions and meetings. So although
Singapore is still ranked amongst the top five global cities in
the 2011 Mori Global Power City Index, Beijing is quickly closing
the gap, leaping 10 spots from 28th position to 18th position in a
short span of four years. Beijing is not the only city. In January,
Shanghai's municipal government unveiled a plan to develop the city
into an international financial centre by 2020. And as you all know,
Shanghai has already overtaken us as the number one container port.
Other cities like Mumbai and Delhi will also have the potential
to become credible competitors on the back of their fast-growing
domestic markets. </p>

we will face more resource constraints, especially with the slower
foreign labour inflows. Our companies also need to manage rising
business costs. Taking all these together, we are indeed facing
a different phase in our growth and these factors underscore why
we need to restructure our economy and rely on productivity in order
to achieve sustained growth over the long term. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0a4827a2-13f5-4eeb-8a9b-1e891e8ebadb">
                  <a name="budget__id-0a4827a2-13f5-4eeb-8a9b-1e891e8ebadb"><!--a--></a>Ms Jessica Tan and Mr
Ong Teng Koon asked about our growth strategy to address the tougher
competition as well as domestic constraints that we are facing.
To restructure our economy and raise productivity, we need to do
so at four levels. First, for the economy as a whole, we need to
expand promising clusters, and grow new ones that will take our
economy to the next stage. Second, at the sectoral level, we must
continue to move up the value chain to higher value-added activities.
Third, at the firm level, companies must innovate and improve their
work processes. And at the fourth level, finally, workers must also
continually upgrade and undergo retraining so that they can take
on the better jobs that our investments and that our companies create.
This is very important because restructuring will inevitably involve
phasing out activities that Singapore has become less competitive
in.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1f550bd7-930d-468b-858e-913a6c43ed6e">
                  <a name="budget__id-1f550bd7-930d-468b-858e-913a6c43ed6e"><!--a--></a>We have a good pipeline
of new investments to develop the new clusters as well as to upgrade
existing clusters. In 2011, we had a record investment commitment
of S$13.7 billion despite global uncertainties in the second half
of the year. For 2012, EDB is optimistic that we can sustain such
a strong level of investment.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-72ebf6e4-e6fd-4cf3-ba9b-92b64f414ade">
                  <a name="budget__id-72ebf6e4-e6fd-4cf3-ba9b-92b64f414ade"><!--a--></a>To support these investments,
as Ms Jessica Tan pointed out, we need the correct environment and
the skills so that these promising sectors can grow. If we have
the time to build this pipeline of people as we have done in the
aerospace industry, we can train Singaporeans for the job. But,
in some areas, we need to jumpstart the sector. Take, for example,
our plan to grow data analytics. This is a promising new area that
builds on our infocomm capabilities. We need to create the right
environment and build up the talent. EDB has attracted global companies
such as IBM and Deloitte to establish analytics research centres
in Singapore. These centres are staffed with top talent that will
drive Singapore's thought leadership in this area. EDB is also working
with our local tertiary institutions such as SMU to prepare a pipeline
of Singaporeans to take up these good jobs. But Singapore must remain
open so that we continue to use foreign talent to complement the
Singaporean core.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-927d9dcd-cba5-4f64-9c5a-cd81608a4278">
                  <a name="budget__id-927d9dcd-cba5-4f64-9c5a-cd81608a4278"><!--a--></a>Sir, our sectoral strategies
are also gaining traction. Each sector has its unique set of challenges.
Therefore, the extent of restructuring will vary with each sector.
Our manufacturing sectors, for example, are largely export-driven
and have restructured continuously over the years, moving up the
value chain and building new competencies to remain competitive.
They must continue to do so. Take the example of the marine and offshore cluster.
Mrs Lina Chiam mentioned that we have been allowing our marine and offshore
centre a huge quota of foreign workers. But this is how they were
able to build a strong competitive sector, reinforcing our Singaporean
core with the foreign workers. And today, Singapore is a global
leader in this sector – our home-grown champions Keppel Offshore
and Marine as well as Sembcorp Marine have 70% of the global market share
in offshore drilling rigs and production vessels. However, offshore
activities are increasingly operating in deeper waters and harsher
operating environments. This means we need more advanced solutions
to satisfy the stringent operating requirements. We will therefore
allocate $150 million to help companies in this cluster conduct
R&amp;D so as to develop capabilities in deep water offshore engineering
and seize the opportunities in this new segment.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1758</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-43c1fecb-8702-4f42-b67b-381c247c4cd8">
                  <a name="budget__id-43c1fecb-8702-4f42-b67b-381c247c4cd8"><!--a--></a>As Ms Jessica Tan mentioned,
our bigger challenge lies in the services sectors. We do have externally-oriented
services activities that are globally competitive. For example,
the financial services and business services sectors are globally
competitive. The trading of commodities is also competitive. Due
to our excellent connectivity and our trade links, Singapore has
become Asia's oil trading hub and is home to many of the world's
largest players in agri-commodities as well as in metals and minerals
trading. Some of our local trading companies have also successfully
upgraded from being merely local wholesalers to competing on the
global arena. We need more models like these companies. We can do
more to enhance our status as an international trading hub by anchoring
new, high value-added trading clusters. For example, with the rise
of Asia, there is now strong demand for investment-grade gold. IE
Singapore will seize this window of opportunity and work with other
agencies to grow a new precious metals trading cluster. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-88f49140-72a2-4bc9-9fa6-7ef186446041">
                  <a name="budget__id-88f49140-72a2-4bc9-9fa6-7ef186446041"><!--a--></a>However, at the other
end of the services spectrum, we have some domestically-oriented
activities in logistics, in retail and food services that may not
be as globally competitive. There is tremendous scope to raise productivity
in these sectors and restructuring to improve this productivity
is, therefore, very critical. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-64232b49-26d7-4c17-982a-cf10fa364a29">
                  <a name="budget__id-64232b49-26d7-4c17-982a-cf10fa364a29"><!--a--></a>Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked for
an update on our productivity efforts. As you know, we have been
working closely with companies and business associations to develop
detailed productivity roadmaps in each of the 16 priority sectors
identified by the National Productivity and Continuing Education
Council (NPCEC). The NPCEC has already endorsed roadmaps for 11
of these sectors. Many of these plans were just announced last year,
and are in the process of being rolled out. This year, we will commit
$42 million to drive productivity improvements in the logistics
and transportation sector. Increasing productivity in the logistics
sector will generate positive spillovers to other sectors because
many companies depend on logistics to remain competitive. Minister
of State Lee Yi Shyan, later, will elaborate on our productivity
efforts across the economy as well as in the logistics sector. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a001d229-736d-4def-b343-662da446b2a4">
                  <a name="budget__id-a001d229-736d-4def-b343-662da446b2a4"><!--a--></a>Ms Tan Su Shan asked how
we can measure productivity gains more accurately. The metric we
use, as you know, is value-added per worker. This is used internationally;
it allows us to make international comparisons but we recognise
that it can be affected by cyclical swings of the economy.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-bb89c3ce-e890-47dd-84d8-2a395a03d0e2">
                  <a name="budget__id-bb89c3ce-e890-47dd-84d8-2a395a03d0e2"><!--a--></a>We therefore complement
the macro-level measurements with sector-specific indicators because
we know that this is the best metric at the sectoral level to allow
us to measure and
detect the changes in each sector. For example, for the Retail and
Food Services sectors, the suitable productivity indicators would
include sales per employee and sales per square foot. These are
more directed sector-specific indicators. They will then give us
the relevant data to evaluate our progress in restructuring each
sector and will allow the companies to benchmark themselves across
other companies and also across international comparisons. But we
all do recognise that structural changes in productivity will take
time and therefore we will continue to monitor our productivity levels
over a longer time horizon, especially over economic cycles and
not take it just over individual years.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-5cd6af95-397d-4eae-b7d8-98dd6c801d34"><!--a--></a>Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked about
how Singaporeans will benefit from our productivity efforts. As
you know, we pursue economic growth in an inclusive manner, by generating a
spectrum of jobs, not just top jobs, but also good jobs at all income
levels. Broad-based wage increases can only be sustained if we are
able to achieve productivity at all levels. Therefore our focus
is on retraining and upskilling our workers so that they can take
on these better jobs that the economy is creating.</p>

issue of how we can support our companies in this productivity drive.
Mdm Foo Mee Har asked how we can help our companies cope with rising
business costs. I think Deputy Prime Minister Tharman answered that
yesterday. Our main thrust is through economic growth and through
productivity improvements. We recognise that Singapore cannot be
a low-cost location and we have to accept pricing costs because
of our limitation in space and, more importantly, our shortage of labour.
Our best approach is really productivity. More specifically, Mr
Inderjit Singh and Mr Yee Jenn Jong asked how we can help our SMEs
manage rental increases and also how JTC can play a more appropriate
role.</p>

to explain the role of JTC. The industrial property market comprises
four main sectors – land, specialised facilities, standard factories,
and generic multi-storey multiple-user factory space. In the first
segment, JTC allocates industrial land to companies to build their
special purpose facilities, provided these companies meet our criteria
in terms of value-add, linkages to other sectors of our economy
as well as jobs creation. In the second segment, JTC provides innovative
industrial facilities such as the Jurong Rock Caverns, the Very
Large Floating Structures (VLFS), Offshore Marine Centre, Seletar
Aerospace Park, Clean Tech Park, Med Tech Hub, etc. This is to meet
the specialised needs of these key clusters. The third segment is
standard factories where the investors need a quick start-up and
can fit their operations in JTC's standard factories. In all these
three segments, JTC has a very important role to play and will continue
to do so. For such premises, JTC will price the industrial land
judiciously. We cannot price industrial land cheaply in Singapore
because land is at a premium. But at the same time, we cannot price
ourselves out of the competition. We do benchmark our industrial
land price against regional alternatives. By and large, I think
JTC's industrial land prices are set at a fair and competitive level
for these three segments. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-032f1fe0-b0b3-466a-a947-7074d7c0495c">
                  <a name="budget__id-032f1fe0-b0b3-466a-a947-7074d7c0495c"><!--a--></a>For the fourth segment,
the generic multi-storey multiple-user factory space, or what is
commonly known as flatted factories, the Government decided in 2005
that JTC should exit this segment. There is already a competitive
market for flatted factory space in the private sector. JTC's market
share was only 18% at that time. JTC's tenants were enjoying lower
rentals than the others. This was inequitable. JTC should be concentrating on the
first three segments which are more challenging rather than undercutting
the flatted factory private sector players with JTC's lower rentals.
That is why JTC divested their flatted factories in order to ensure
a level playing field in this segment. It is also in line with the
"Yellow Pages" rule where Government would exit from market segments
where there are already active private sector players.</p>

Members' concerned, especially Mr Yee Jenn Jong's concern, about
the impact of the Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) on rentals.
Today, the seven industrial REITs compete with the other property
developers and landlords. Like any other landlord, they have to
compete in the rental market to attract tenants. REITs are part
of the competitive rental market where no single player should have
the market power to influence rentals significantly. I would like
to assure Members that we will not hesitate to intervene if we see
evidence of collusion or abuse of market dominance by the REITs. </p>

from the flatted factory market segment, we continue to monitor
it vigilantly. Rentals have indeed gone up, in tandem with our economic recovery
in 2010. To keep industrial space affordable, we have increased
the supply of industrial land to meet the demand. In 2010 and 2011,
under the Industrial Government Land Sales (IGLS) programme, about
20 hectares of land was released for every half of the year. This
is about 30% higher than in 2008 and 2009. To ensure a more timely
supply of space, we have also shortened the project completion period
for the IGLS sites from eight years to between five and seven years.</p>

that restructuring is a difficult exercise, particularly for our
SMEs, but we are serious about helping them to overcome these difficulties.
The Minister for Finance has announced a slew of Budget measures:
a one-off cash grant of up to $5,000 to offset higher business costs,
enhancements to the Productivity and Innovation Credit, and so on.
Beyond these short-term measures, SPRING and IE Singapore have a
comprehensive suite of schemes to help our companies build capabilities,
improve their competitiveness and expand abroad. We have distributed
the brochure summarising the numerous schemes that are available
to support our SMEs.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2f8897ac-929a-4f79-8c98-adbb28cd4e15">
                  <a name="budget__id-2f8897ac-929a-4f79-8c98-adbb28cd4e15"><!--a--></a>How do we reach out to
the SMEs? First, we have the Enterprise Development Centre (EDC),
a one-stop-centre for SMEs. An officer will be assigned to each
company to understand their needs, and to give them customised advice
on which of our schemes can best assist them. We are also working
with 30 industry associations under the Local Enterprise and Association
Development, or LEAD programme, to upgrade each sector. This programme
reaches out to more than 20,000 SMEs. In addition, SPRING and IE Singapore
have a range of programmes to help SMEs upgrade their capabilities
as well as to internationalise. Last year, SPRING assisted some
3,900 companies, while IE Singapore supported some 5,500 SMEs, largely
on a one-to-one basis. This shows that between SPRING and IE Singapore
working together, they are reaching out to some 20% of our SMEs.
This is not a small number and we will continue to do more. In addition, we
will commit $200 million over the next three years to increase the
support levels for the companies under the SPRING and IE Singapore's
capability development schemes. On an annual basis, this is about
40% more than our expenditures in previous years. </p>

years ahead, we face a slower global economy – more uncertainties
and stiffer competition from Asian cities. We also face domestic
resource constraints.
So, in this context, we must urgently restructure our economy so
that growth is anchored in productivity and innovation. We are serious
about helping our companies to cope with rising business costs and
to restructure for growth. The Government is not expecting instant
results but we are restructuring for sustained growth over the long
term. We will put in place the right measures and incentives to encourage
our businesses to upgrade. We are working with our companies to
adjust over this transition period, but it is important that our
companies also do their part and restructure for a better future. </p>

quietly confident. There are growth opportunities in Asia and we

continue to see us as a Global-Asia hub to manage and drive pan-Asian
business growth. If I may borrow a terminology used in the durian
trade, the growth opportunities are there, but this is not "<em class="ph i">bao

these opportunities but we are confident that we can do so because
we have the resources to help our companies and our workers to restructure
and to upgrade. Our secret weapon, as Mr Lim Swee Say kept mentioning
to us, is our tripartite cooperation. We are in this together, we
have overcome previous challenges by working together and I am confident
that we can do it again.</p>

Council (NPCEC), to many individualised programmes, we reach out
to SMEs in different industries, of different sizes and at different
stages of growth. My colleague, Minister of State Mr Teo Ser Luck
will elaborate on the various forms of support available to SMEs.</p>

made a number of excellent suggestions pertaining to boosting productivity
in the services sectors. Out of the 16 sectors that the NPCEC is spearheading,
10 of them are services sectors. We recognise that there is no one-size-fits-all
solution for all industries, so we develop sector-specific productivity
roadmaps. We also benchmark them against the best-in-class in the
world we can find and we want them to meet, or even exceed, the
other standards. </p>

Services and Retail sectors. One peculiar aspect of these sectors
is that manpower demand is concentrated at meal times and over the
weekends. Working with the industry, SPRING, WDA and NTUC are piloting
a "Part-time Pool" programme to create a ready and trained pool
of part-timers, including housewives and students that Ms Jessica
Tan mentioned, for deployment during peak service hours. This programme
will alleviate these industries' manpower shortage somewhat. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-49a5b5fd-397e-4595-9802-d6faa0b95ec3"><!--a--></a>As Minister Lim shared,
and as Members can see from the circulated brochure, there are many
Government assistance programmes for productivity improvement. Ultimately,
however, our enterprises will have to take the first step. Consider
the example of the
Timbre Group. It runs popular live-music bars such as Timbre@The Substation.
With SPRING's support, the Group implemented an electronic system
for song requests and dedicated messages to be sent via SMS. This
saves the staff waiting time from shuttling between dining areas
and the stage, but the larger benefit was the new capability of
customer profiling and engagement. With their customers' contact information,
the Timbre Group can now engage customers with even announcements of
future events and loyalty programmes. There are greater prospects
for customer feedback, raising customer satisfaction and increasing
sales. Indeed, the Timbre Group has observed higher productivity
of 20% and they were also able to increase wages for all their workers
by 5%. </p>

earlier, we are investing $42 million to roll out the productivity
roadmap for the Logistics and Transportation sector. This is a significant sector,
for it accounts for 8% of the GDP and 6% of our workforce. The roadmap
focuses on two areas. First, we will help the industry to deepen
expertise and specialisation in the Supply Chain Management (SCM).
By learning from global best practices, our SCM professionals will
acquire the latest skills to run world-class SCM operations. Second, we
will officially launch a Centre of Innovation for Supply Chain Management
(COI-SCM) later this year to demonstrate to SMEs how others have
embraced technology and knowledge tools. Located in Republic Polytechnic,
the Centre will provide SMEs with tailored consultancy services
and it aims to help 1,000 SMEs in the next three years. As logistics
is a horizontal enabler for other industries, raising the productivity
of this sector will also improve the competitiveness of other industries.
Much has been said about the challenges we face in productivity
across all sectors.</p>

assist them in three broad areas: First, they can visit the Productivity@Work
website, this is a one-stop online portal to productivity information and
resources. It includes an online Assessment Tool for SMEs to diagnose
their productivity performance. This is the best place to start.
Productivity@Work has attracted over 162,000 unique visitors since
it was launched in 2010. Second, companies can train their own employees
to drive innovation and productivity in-house. This is why SPRING,
WDA and the industry have collaborated to develop a programme called Productivity
Manager Programme for the Retail and Food Services sectors. Upon graduation,
participants returning to their companies will be able to champion productivity
efforts and drive changes from within. Third, companies can visit
the six Centres of Innovation to see real examples of companies
with improved productivity. Seeing is believing. We hope to convince
SMEs that productivity improvement is not an abstract concept but
an attainable reality. </p>

and services grew annually by 9% to12% respectively over the past
decade. By the end of 2010, our companies had invested nearly S$400
billion overseas. The DP Information Group has also found that having international
operations was the key to fast growth for Singapore companies. The overseas
exposure potentially catalysed development of their products and
services too. Our proximity to, and familiarity with regional markets
in Southeast Asia, China and India, remains a key advantage for
Singaporean firms seeking growth in the region. </p>

advantage of regional demands is Eu Yan Sang. Starting out as a
Traditional Chinese Medicine retailer, the company today is an integrated
global healthcare company. After the company's IPO in year 2000,

and retail operations in the regional markets, but also increased
its product distribution networks to 12 overseas markets. The group's revenue
has since grown more than five-fold. While regional markets remain

Founded in 1980, Kheng Keng Auto traded in used car parts. For many
years, it remained a small company with sales not exceeding $10 million.
In 2004, the fortune of Kheng Keng Auto changed. Mr Cher then discovered
that Africa actually had a strong need for used cars and used spare
parts. But in the markets he studied, there were no reliable and
efficient suppliers. </p>

For a small company with no track record of overseas operations,
it was a huge risk both financially and psychologically for Mr Cher
to start something in Africa. Still, Mr Cher was undaunted. After
five years of hard work, Mr Cher finally established himself in
Africa's used car industry. Today, Kheng Keng Auto has a presence
in eight African countries, including flagship centres in South
Africa, Kenya and Namibia. Kheng Keng Auto's sales increased ten-fold
(+900%). It was an incredible story of adventure. </p>

34,000 companies through its broad-based channels and provided 5,500
companies with financial support. IE will increase its level of
funding for selected capability development programmes from 50%
to 70% of qualifying costs. This means companies would pay only
30% share for the selected programmes in Design, Intellectual Property,
Branding, Mergers and Acquisitions. This year, IE Singapore will also
expand its suite of financing schemes to increase support for companies,
especially SMEs that are exploring new or less familiar markets.
We will improve their access to trade financing as well as political
risk insurance for overseas investments and projects. For example,
a Singapore company may find it risky to trade with overseas buyers
that it does not have an established working relationship with.
To mitigate such non-payment risks and help our companies better
manage uncertainties when exploring new markets, IE will work with

must restructure to stay ahead. The road to restructuring may be
arduous and even painful. For many businesses, I am afraid it is.
But we must not be daunted. The fact that many economies have succeeded

if we apply ourselves to it. We need to think out of the box, innovate
in-house and revamp our business models. </p>

due to encroachment of digital media. Our businesses cannot ignore
such trends, whether technological, market or social in origin. The

(Mr Teo Ser Luck)</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Chairman, our business sector
is undergoing restructuring with a slower economic growth being forecasted
and tightening of labour. As we know, from the speeches in this
House, there is a need, and everyone is aware and agrees, for our
SMEs to restructure for growth. And some have expressed concern about how
our SMEs will cope with the constraints. Many raised the issues
about labour and manpower. Members who raised those issues, including
Mr Vikram Nair, asked if there are measures to help SMEs to cope
with the recent changes in the DRCs and foreign worker levies, and
whether the Government can help SMEs to hire more Singaporeans.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-42a13b24-3f15-4431-acb7-0c3a6adf65af"><!--a--></a>The Ministry of Manpower
is providing a two-year transition period to help companies to adjust
to the tighter DRCs. The foreign worker levy increases are also being
implemented gradually in stages from July 2010 till July 2013. In
the long run, however, companies must find business models that
will optimise limited manpower resources, and explore more innovative
ways to attract Singaporeans. Minister of State Lee Yi Shyan shared
how the "Part-Time Pool" Programme will help SMEs in the retail and
food services sectors optimise their deployment of manpower. Let
me add that the sectoral productivity roadmaps also include industry-level
initiatives, such as job redesign, to make jobs more attractive. </p>

foreign workers are linked to our economic strategy. Foreigners
complement our local workforce. In our workforce, our Singaporeans
remain the core. In the new and promising sectors like data analytics,
foreign talent supplements our local talent and they can provide
new skills, impart those capabilities and skills to us and that
will help us grow new clusters and also move existing ones up the
value chain. The objective is to develop our individual workers'
skills, talents, and also help the businesses to move up the value
chain.</p>

of the system, having worked for US and European companies. I remember
the times when I just entered the logistics market. That was more
than 15 years ago. Those days, Singapore called it the warehouse
industry, nobody knew about the supply chain management – those
buzzwords. Nobody really knows. And I had the privilege to work
with one of these people − well, we call him the foreign skilled
labour or foreign skilled engineer. He was trained in industrial engineering.
Industrial engineering was not very popular at that time nor was
it widely offered at that time. He taught me about process flow
within operations, within warehouses. That sort of skilled me up.
I am an accountant by training and actually without his generosity
or graciousness to impart those skills and knowledge, I would not know,
I would not be able to develop a skill sets within the logistics
industry and to be able to carve out a career and, finally, be able
to manage a company like DHL.</p>

attractive not just for our home-grown talent, but also be able
to be more appealing and attractive to talents from overseas. But,
meanwhile, other foreign workers take up jobs which some Singaporeans
may not be very keen on, but are necessary for the economy as a
whole. They must complement in order to make sure our sectors grow,
especially those emerging industries and new economy sectors.</p>

and other business costs are very real. But this cannot be their
only concern. Short-term measures and assistance can help them today,
tomorrow and maybe next month. But it cannot help them for longer
into the future. Building new capabilities is a necessary step that
SMEs must take. Only then can they sustain profitable businesses
in the longer term. However, the Government understands that SMEs
may be apprehensive to invest in the future, especially given the uncertain
global economic outlook. Therefore, we have put in place assistance
schemes to support SMEs in their journey of restructuring. They
are not alone. We work together with the trade associations as well
as the SME sectors to get them through this journey, providing various
schemes and programmes for their needs. </p>

assisted more than 3,900 SMEs in their upgrading projects under
the Capability Development Scheme (CDS) and other programmes. Another
5,100 loans amounting to $1.4 billion under various Government loan
schemes were also extended to SMEs to finance their business expansion.
SMEs have used these schemes to upgrade, automate, cut costs, tap
new markets, expand capacities and increase their revenues. </p>

Koufu is one of Singapore's largest food court operators with 53
outlets island-wide. It firmly believes in process improvement and
has undertaken several capability development projects and the company
recently integrated its supply chain management system and implemented
an inventory management portal that helps its outlets to procure
faster, reduce paper work and increase sales per man hour by 10%. </p>

to upgrade, SPRING will enhance its support for Capability Development
Scheme (CDS) and Innovation Voucher Scheme (IVS) for the next three years.
And support under the Capability Development Scheme will increase
from 50% to 70% of qualifying costs. The scope of this scheme will
also be expanded to include automation and business transformation
projects. I also like to mention about the Innovation Voucher Scheme.
Based on feedback from SMEs, they are also interested to strengthen
capabilities in the areas of productivity, HR development and financial management.
We have decided to extend the Innovation Voucher Scheme (IVS) to
cover three areas – productivity, HR development and financial management.
These enhancements will benefit the smaller SMEs in particular because
these are the areas we have to focus on as they survive and are
also very concerned about the cash flow issues of the day-to-day.
They have to develop these functions to keep them sustainable and
also for their ongoing concern.</p>

scope and purpose of these schemes, it will be renamed as the Innovation
&amp; Capability Voucher (ICV). The ICV can be used for diagnostics, feasibility
studies, process upgrading, customised training, product or services development,
and the adoption of quality and standards. Many of our SMEs understand the
benefits of upgrading, and have also tapped on the Government's
support to lower their cost of upgrading. And we would like to create
greater awareness for the SME sectors to understand that and to
educate them, to know how to tap on those schemes to help themselves.
Using the analogy provided by Mr Liang Eng Hwa who mentioned "paddling
faster", encouraging the business sector to "paddle" faster like
in a bicycle. Now, the road is a little bit rough. If we continue
to paddle based on the same tyres, you might just have a deflation
of tyres and have to pump in air every single time. As you paddle, you will not
be able to keep the speed or go faster. Maybe it is time to think whether
you need a new bicycle or even to change just the spare parts of
the bicycles or new tyres for all-season weather in order to paddle
faster, go through the rough roads and go faster. I think it is
an important aspect for business sectors to consider; to relook at
their business model, look at all the functions, look at the products
and services, retention of talents, people and how they operate
on a day-to-day basis. I urge our SMEs, even the micro-enterprises,
to do the same to review all the schemes and see what they can do,
so that we can help them.</p>

we will continue to reach out to SMEs through various channels,

very closely because they play a vital role in helping the industry

understand the needs and aspirations of the industries and SME sectors,
and they also help SMEs to understand the various upgrading programmes
and schemes available, and how to tap on them. They are the "bridge".</p>

one good example. The Singapore Business Federation, in working
with the Government, set up the SME Committee (SMEC). This SME Committee actually
provided, before the Budget Statement was announced, 17 recommendations of
what Government could do, or through the Budget, to help the SME

Trade Associations also to be the bridge of the Government to the

have also mentioned that seeding and nurturing start-ups is an important
aspect and this is also one of the main objectives of the Government in
developing our local economy and the business sector. Because we
believe that would generate a pipeline of promising enterprises
which can support our economy and create good jobs for Singaporeans.
Besides co-funding programmes such as the SPRING Start-up Enterprise
Development Scheme (SEEDS), SPRING also administers the Incubators
Development Programme (IDP) to provide innovative start-ups with critical
resources, such as mentorship and shared business services. SEEDS
and IDP schemes support entrepreneurs of all ages. </p>

that it is important to build an eco-system for all entrepreneurs
and start-ups, and that is exactly what we think. Today, we want
to make sure that the start-ups, all entrepreneurs "wanna-bes",
do not just come to Government to look at the grant. They have to
think beyond the grant. And we believe that to build an eco-system
to help them achieve the first order of business is a lot more important than
just giving them seed funding. How do we help them achieve the first
order of business? It is to build that eco-system, the network of
contacts, opening paths, if possible, for them, but they have to
bite it, carry the baton and go for it. And that is exactly why,
under the Action Community for Entrepreneurship (ACE), we have set
up an overseas chapter. Hopefully, this overseas chapter will be
able to broaden the network, not just in Singapore but to link Singapore
to the overseas market for entrepreneurs. So if you are an entrepreneur
start-up and you would like to venture overseas and to know more,
there is this network that you can tap on. And Singaporeans and
successful overseas entrepreneurs will come together to help the
start-up. This is very much like the Silicon Valley model. We want
to be able to develop that, not just in Singapore but overseas,
in the key markets as well. I believe that was what Mr Inderjit Singh has brought
up − that we will continue to help the start-ups, not only in Singapore but
cross-border, go beyond Singapore's shores and we will help to nurture
them. This is at the beginning stage and we need to continue to
develop this process to groom them. Time is needed but I am sure
we will get there, to be able to develop this Silicon Valley model,
both here and overseas. </p>

let me reiterate that it is vital to restructure our economy in
order for Singapore to grow and remain competitive because it is
a rising Asia now and the competitive landscape for businesses continues
to be very intense and very dynamic. We need to do so urgently,
so that we can effectively tap on all these opportunities in the
growth of Asia. The Government is committed to support our SMEs to
restructure for this growth and to bring them through the journey
and the process. We hope that with our support, SMEs can better
grasp opportunities for growth, and in turn create better jobs for
Singaporeans. </p>

                  </span>: Sir, total
R&amp;D expenditure has increased tenfold since 1991. For 2011 to
2015, the Government has set aside $16.1 billion to support research
innovation and enterprise. Hence it is timely that we examine how
our R&amp;D strategy has translated into actual benefits for our
economy. Have we been a leader in the area of innovation and research?
And has R&amp;D helped to diversify our economy and strengthen our competitiveness?
How is the Government helping our SMEs to also benefit from the R&amp;D
drive in today's challenging environment of escalating business
costs and tight labour resources? It is more important than ever
that our SMEs can partake in the fruits of our R&amp;D investment
to stay ahead of the curve. </p>

not just benefit our economy and our companies but also our people.
We have succeeded in attracting top international talent to jumpstart
our R&amp;D efforts. Twenty years into our drive, we need to put
more thought into how we can nurture our local talents to take up
the good jobs in R&amp;D. And this is a win-win strategy, providing
a pool of local R&amp;D talents will also ensure that we can sustainably
continue our transformation into a knowledge economy.</p>

                  </span>: Mr Chairman,
allow me to declare my interest as a researcher in the biomedical
sector. Mr Chairman, I support most of the sentiments brought up
by the hon Member Mr Liang just awhile ago. The Government has invested
a lot of resources to support research and development, innovation
and enterprise over the past few years and this trend looks set
to continue. And I, for one, welcome this move as right and forward-looking.
I would like to request that MTI provide an update of how R&amp;D
has benefited our economy to justify this expenditure? Much has
been said about how biomedical sciences, as the fourth pillar of
our manufacturing industry, alongside electronics, chemicals and
engineering, have diversified our economy. So, I would also like
to request that MTI perhaps share with this House the details of
its contribution in recent years and its role in our recovery. In
addition, as also mentioned by the Member Mr Liang, how have our
local businesses and SMEs benefited from these R&amp;D investments?
What are the new investments in the pipeline that will have a major
impact on our economy and businesses over the next few years? And
what is the likelihood of these new investments proceeding in view
of the global uncertainties?</p>

to ensure that Singaporeans continue to find employment in the plum
jobs generated in the R&amp;D sector and so reduce our dependence
on foreign R&amp;D skilled manpower? According to reports, between
1990 and 2009, the number of people employed in the R&amp;D sector,
such as researchers, scientists and engineers, has doubled from
close to 21,000 in 1999 to over 41,000 in 2009. I have met a number
of Singaporeans who have taken up research-related scholarships
or have taken up research-related courses of study but they have
returned to find that there were no research jobs available for
them, making them look for jobs in other areas. On the other hand,
we do note that many of the researchers in our labs are foreigners.
R&amp;D has created a number of good quality jobs, but we have to
continue to attract the best talents and at the same time, we should
also have assurances that Singaporeans are given due priority for
training and employment in this sector.</p>

albeit attract higher tourism spending. And I would like to ask
how MTI intends to achieve this. How does this support the economic restructuring
we are currently pursuing? While F1 has been successful in adding
to Singapore's tourism appeal, there have been concerns raised by
the public on the inconvenience caused to motorists due to the road
closures. This is a common concern amongst Singaporeans, especially
those who work near the street circuit. Weighing the benefits and
costs, has F1 benefited Singapore and, based on this assessment,
do we intend to extend the F1 race in Singapore?</p>

Mr Chairman, Sir, I wish to declare my interest at the outset. The
Government has been making various changes to the manpower policies.
They intend to improve employability of local workforce and reduce the
dependency on foreign workers. Some of the recent effects include
progressive and continued interest in the levy on foreign workers.
The recent Budget also talks about reducing the DRC for all sectors
by dropping another five persons from the existing levels. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1770</p>

and the investments in automation would lead to better productivity
and reduce the dependence on cheaper foreign labour. I wish to point
out that while the efforts and the intents seemed to be genuine,
they completely ignore two main facts. We are today operating at
near full employment levels, which leave limited choice for the
employer to select from local talent. The policies have chosen to
generalise all businesses alike without considering the labour dependency needs
of different businesses. Services like hospitality, F&amp;B, retail,
etc, are dependent on labour at the front end with barely any scope
of automation at point of service. Moreover, every business needs
a certain aptitude and the attitude amongst its staff to make it
successful. Today, jobs that require standing for long hours beyond
normal working office hours, working on weekends and public holidays,
are shunned by our local workers. It is just not retail, but services
like healthcare as well, that there are simply not enough locals
to choose from, given the demand being the nature of the work and the
skills. I request a detailed understanding and review so that we
have a more realistic approach on quotas and levies taken, keeping
in view every type of business, talent requirements, scope for automation
and productivity increases, besides the statistics of local talent
available for each profession rather than painting all issues with
one brush. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-cbb822db-f59c-4fa0-b7eb-484790420252">
                  <a name="budget__id-cbb822db-f59c-4fa0-b7eb-484790420252"><!--a--></a>Another note: it is heartening
to see tourism business growing in Singapore with more arrivals
than before. The Government's efforts in enlisting $950 million
to bring in high-spending visitors are laudable. I would like to
highlight some of the facts which are relevant in boosting tourism.
Tourists today see Singapore as a vibrant destination with several
attractions that appeal to the tastes of different people. Among
the things that make the stay comfortable and enjoyable for tourists
are: entertainment, hospitality, retail, and F&amp;B businesses.
These industries form an integral part in enhancing the tourist
experience while they are in Singapore. Today, these allied businesses,
which can play a strong role to support tourism initiatives, have
serious issues affecting their business operations. These include
a very rapid rise in business costs and acute shortage of right
talent locally. With significant assistance, these allied sectors
will struggle and may be unable to live up to the raised demands
of additional tourists, especially higher spending tourists who
expect more personalised services. I request the Government to include
these allied sectors for assistance in their endeavours to boost
tourism. By leaving out these sectors, the quality of experience
for tourists would suffer and may, ultimately, risk our status as
one of the top tourist destinations.</p>

Mr Chairman, the rising cost of energy is becoming an increasing
concern for households especially in the lower and middle-income
families who have seen their utility bills increased with the increase
in tariffs. Our lifestyles and industries in Singapore are very
energy intensive. The way we live, work and play really drives our
reliance on energy and the reliance is pretty high. I would like
the Ministry to share with us what are the measures taken to diversify
our energy sources and to meet the increasing demand for energy
and to ensure resilience and a progressive energy landscape to support
sustainable growth. What is our strategy to ensure that Singapore's
energy supply is resilient and secure as well? Are we investing
in innovations for alternative energy sources and sustainability?
Both in the short term and longer term, what measures are being
taken to address the cost of energy and the impact on households
and companies that operate out of Singapore?</p>

Sir, tensions in the Middle East have caused oil prices to rise
sharply. Brent crude prices hit US$125 per barrel. In addition,
there is also increasing energy demand, especially from Asia, to
support its rapid economic growth. Singapore does not have indigenous
energy sources. Currently, about 80% of our electricity is generated
using piped natural gas imported from Malaysia and Indonesia. We
also do not have large tracts of lands for solar or for wind farms.
As a country, we need to ensure our energy security. The Government
recently announced plans such as electricity import, which could
potentially be from our neighbours. How would this fit with our
strategies to enhance energy security and resilience? </p>

Mr Chairman, Sir, the monthly electricity bill is a financial burden
for many households. Although this Budget has introduced a permanent
component – U Save – under the GST Voucher, this is not enough to
relieve them of this financial burden. The cost of electricity not
only affects households but also industries, especially SMEs. A
cheaper electricity tariff will enable our industries to stay competitive.
It is, therefore, important that the Government continues to look
for more efficient and sustainable energy sources that will translate
to cheaper electricity tariff for consumers. I would like to know
what is the status of the full retail contestability in the electricity
market. Would domestic consumers be able to benefit from this? </p>

I share many of the views expressed by the preceding three speakers.
Energy supply and cost have a critical impact on economic growth
and development. Rising energy prices have led to increased expenditure
on oil imports and also to higher inflation, and put pressure on
our foreign exchange reserves. In addition, there are downstream
impacts on other commodity prices and this will have a lagged and
coupling effect on our CPI inflation. As an international hub, our
transportation sector is vulnerable to high energy prices, as is
our manufacturing sector. We are certainly at the mercy of fluctuations
in the global energy markets. The cost of renewable energy sources,
although often touted, is also not insignificant. I have two questions. The
first is: how do we ensure that energy issues do not become a constraint
on our economic activities, competitiveness and growth? And, number
two: what are MTI's plans for encouraging better energy management
and promoting greater energy efficiency by businesses and industry?</p>

Sir, allow me to declare my interest as the Vice President of Consumers
Association of Singapore (CASE). For the past few years, CASE has
been pushing for a timeshare legislation to protect consumers. The
timeshare industry is still occupying the third place in CASE's
complaints chart with 1,458 complaints last year. This means that
there are many consumers who have lost thousands of dollars to glib
sales persons who have persuaded them to sign for contracts which
are not protected under the current Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act
(CPFTA) regime. CASE is thus concerned about the lack of regulation
in this industry.</p>

several complaints that rogue timeshare operators have modified
their <em class="ph i">modus operandi</em>. Instead of selling timeshare contracts,
some companies are now calling themselves investment companies so
that they are not caught under the definition of regulated contract
under the CPFTA. Some are also collecting deposits via a third party
such that the deposits need not be refunded. And some companies
have also sold discounted travel and accommodation services and,
hence, the five days cooling-off period required under the CPFTA
does not apply. </p>

the definition of timeshare contracts in the Consumer Protection
(Fair Trading) Act. We should include any contract that requires
a sum to be paid upfront for a tour or travel-related rights which
gives rise to more attractive prices on air fares, car hire charges
and hotel room rates. There is also a need to impose mandatory disclosure
requirements for such contracts. And any breach of the contractual
terms should offer some form of contractual relief to the consumer, including
the right to terminate the contract. I would also urge the Government
to prohibit the collection of any monies during the cooling-off
period, and introduce fines for any supplier who breaches such regulations.</p>

Singapore's economy for growth. For example, R&amp;D in biomedical
sciences has catalysed a new biologics cluster and played a critical
role in attracting investments that will create about 1,500 new
jobs. Biomedical manufacturing output quadrupled, from $6 billion

First, we will enhance our enterprise ecosystem in nascent sectors.
For example, SPRING has embarked on a new Biomedical Sciences Accelerator
Programme to invest in start-ups and facilitate access to knowledge
capital, markets and networks. We are also expanding A*STAR's GET-Up
Scheme, the Growing Enterprises with Technology Upgrade Scheme,
to help Biomedical Sciences SMEs develop new products and services.
Second, we will devote more efforts to bridge the gap to market.
The new IP Intermediary, or Intellectual Property Intermediary Singapore,
will proactively reach out to SMEs to assess and source for IP to
meet their technology and business needs. Lastly, we will develop platform
technologies for key policy outcomes, such as productivity. One
model is A*STAR's Manufacturing Productivity Technology Centre (MPTC),
which helped companies like Tru-Marine and Maha Chemicals to improve
productivity and reduce costs. These are some examples of how we

− a sector which has grown well and has further potential. Mr Yee
Jenn Jong asked how we spent the $2 billion in the Tourism Development
Fund (TDF). The fund was launched in 2005 with a five-year funding
commitment period. And the reason you have a five-year commitment
period is because many of these projects have a gestation period.
You invest early in order to let the infrastructure kick in, then contribute
to your tourism spend. The long-term target is $30 billion of tourism
receipts and visitor arrivals of 17 million by 2015. The fund has
supported many major projects − Formula One, Gardens by the Bay
as well as the International Cruise Terminal and River Safari, the
latter two are scheduled to open later this year. It has also brought
in numerous events and helped our tourism companies build capabilities.
These, together with private sector investments such as the Integrated
Resorts, have transformed our tourism sector and kept us on track
to achieving our long-term targets. In 2011, Singapore had 13.2
million international visitors and tourism receipts of $22.2 billion. This
is a 13% increase in visitor arrivals and 17% increase in the tourism
receipts. To respond to Mr Yee, tourism receipts include spend on
accommodation, spend on shopping, spend on entertainment, so it
is a collection and not segmented into particular parts alone. STB's
strategies cannot segment the spending activity of tourists in Singapore
to the degree that he has asked. </p>

has also created more and diverse job opportunities for Singaporeans.
Let me give Members a couple of examples. Catherine Ho is a former Warrant
Officer with 26 years of service in the SAF. Now, she is a Theme
Park Manager in charge of park operations in Universal Studios Singapore,
assuming there are some relevant skills there. She is now helping
to set up operations at the upcoming Marine Life Park. Another example
is Gwern Khoo, a chef in the Celebrity Chef Restaurant Waku Ghin
in Marina Bay Sands, who has been identified by Chef Tetsuya as
a promising local talent with plans to send him to Sydney for further
training. He has come a long way from his days at SHATEC and from helping
out at his father's duck rice stall. And these are some examples
of how the growth in our sector has created interesting and diverse opportunities
for Singaporeans. </p>

has also been good for our tourism sector. Besides generating economic
benefits and creating a good platform for business networking, F1 has
helped to brand Singapore as a global city with a vibrant lifestyle
and this has other collateral benefits for us as an economy and
as a country. In response to Mr Liang's question, I would say that
on the whole, the benefits of F1, both tangible and intangible, have
outweighed the costs. Yes, there are certain disruptions like the
road closures, and this is something between the Government agencies
and the race promoter. There has been significant effort to reduce
that by more than half to about six days now, compared to where
we were at the start, but we need to continue to work on this. Overall,
the benefits have been significant and they outweigh the costs and
any decision on an extension will have to be premised on the value
that we can continue to derive from such an event. The Government
will make this decision only after carefully weighing all factors. </p>

these significant tourism inroads that we have already made by seeding
the sector's next stage of growth. We must especially focus on quality or
yield-driven growth by attracting tourists to visit more often,
to stay longer and to spend more. That means enhancing the tourism
experience through creativity and innovation, higher capabilities
and productivity, and superior service standards. For this, we are
injecting $905 million over the next five years as the second tranche
of the Tourism Development Fund. </p>

asked what strategies this second tranche will support. First, we
will invest $300 million to build on Singapore's positioning as
an international Lifestyle and Business Events Hub through the Tourism
Events Development Scheme (TEDS). It will seed and anchor best-in-class
events, whilst bringing in international conferences and exhibitions
as well as leisure and lifestyle events. Second, we will co-create
new tourism products with the industry, and rejuvenate existing
products, through the Tourism Product Development Scheme (TPDS).
A sum of $340 million will be set aside to drive new concepts and
ideas for tourism products. Third, we will invest $265 million to
enhance capabilities in our tourism-related enterprises as a part
of our key drive for higher tourism yield. Mr Dhinakaran raised
the issues of manpower and the challenges faced by some of the companies
in the sector. Substantively, the points on DRCs and levies have
been dealt with in the Finance Minister's discussion earlier on
the debate, and also earlier in the COS discussion. Let me complement
that by talking about what we are doing specifically in one or two
areas. STB drives a productivity roadmap for the sector, and what
it seeks to do is increase the attractiveness of jobs through redesign
and reengineering of business processes. This will attract more
Singaporeans to come and work in this space. We are open to more
ideas from the industry on how else we can increase local labour
force participation rate. </p>

of tourism-related training we support under the Tourism Capability
Development Scheme (TCDS) to include specialised skills that can further
increase productivity and enhance service delivery. So, to address
Mr Dhinakaran's concern about the lack of right talent, this scheme
will also support local leadership and talent development in order
to continue to build the pool of Singaporeans who can actively contribute
in this space. We expect this range of initiatives and investments to sustain
our yield-driven strategy for tourism as we work together with the
companies in this space. </p>

energy. As we restructure our economy for sustained growth, we must
also pay heed to the potential sources of external shock and cost
pressures. One such area is energy, a point that many Members have
made. Singapore relies heavily on imported energy. This exposes
us to supply risks and price volatility. This is a reality, not
just for us but many countries around the world. Furthermore, we
lack the geographic and climatic conditions for large-scale adoption
of alternative energy, a point raised by several Members. In other
words, whilst we can try and promote alternative energy sources
in Singapore, it cannot be, at least at this stage given the state of
technology, the source of our baseload energy requirements. Therefore,
as Mr Liang, Dr Chia and Mr Low Thia Khiang have highlighted, we
need to strengthen our energy security to ensure that we have reliable
and competitively priced energy supply. Hence, we are exploring
new energy options from diverse sources and fuel types. </p>

a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal. It will commence operations
in the second quarter of next year, 2013. This terminal will give us
access to the global gas market, in other words, going beyond the
region to tap on opportunities around the world and the advantage
of that, especially in the current environment when the world is
discovering new vast quantities of gas from unconventional sources,
such as the shale gas. </p>

imports could also allow us to tap on energy options which might
not currently be available in Singapore. We are studying how it
can be implemented without compromising the stability and the security
of our system. And at the same time, we also want to see how some
of the benefits of doing so can be passed on to our consumers, whether
it is households or businesses alike. This will take some time in
order for us to understand the possibilities and also scope out
what the industry is able to do. This effort, if it bears fruit,
can also be part of a regional or wider effort to develop an ASEAN
Power Grid in the longer term. But that will take a lot longer because it
requires different countries, different jurisdictions agreeing to
interconnect their grids, so I think we will need a lot more time
for that. Singapore can start looking at options for our own needs,
which is what we are doing through this electricity import initiative.</p>

feasibility study is ongoing. And I want to stress again that this
has been said many times, even with the completion of the study,
we will still be a long way from making a decision on nuclear energy.
Our objective is to gain a better understanding of the technological
developments in this space because there are significant movements,
and understand better the issues such as the safety, security and economics
of nuclear energy, especially in the context of a country like Singapore,
given our constraints. </p>

and Mr Low have asked about managing rising energy prices. As we
import almost all our energy, I think we are well aware we are price
takers exposed to the global trends. One strategy we have adopted
is to continue to promote competitive supply, in other words, competition
in our energy market. Over the next few years, our net generation
capacity will increase by more than 2,000 MW or about 20% of our
installed capacity. And the chart shows the increase, but it also
shows that we have significant increase. In fact, all the increase
is going to come from the Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGTs) plant, which is the
most efficient power generating plant. So we will have more supply,
and that supply is also going to be more efficient, and that should exert
downward pressure on electricity prices. </p>

at demand side measures as we can also manage energy costs better
by using energy efficiently. In fact, many described energy efficiency
as another source of energy. Therefore, we will introduce fresh
initiatives and funding to help households and businesses in this
area. First, we will allocate about $100 million for the Economic
Development Board to extend the grant for Energy Efficient Technologies (GREET)
and to work with private players to pilot repayable financing schemes.
These initiatives will help more businesses overcome market barriers
to energy efficiency, such as high upfront costs of putting in some
of the energy efficiency measures.</p>

the Intelligent Energy System trials to selected households in Punggol
and selected businesses. This pertains to the point raised by Mr
Low on full retail contestability. To have full retail contestability
first, consumers must be able to get meaningful information, which
is what we seek to do through devices such as smart meters, in-home
display units, and related applications. With such applications, consumers
can monitor electricity consumption in real-time to optimise usage
and save costs. But that is not enough in and of itself. Beyond
that, we also need the backward integration with payment systems
which is a separate exercise altogether. So, this is a work in progress.
We will be in the cutting edge of this because very few countries
in the world have gone this far. There are some efforts in some
parts of the world, but they are all learning through implementation.</p>

it in total, rising energy prices may pose difficulties for some households,
a point that Mr Low Thia Khiang has highlighted and, indeed, I think
all Members of this House will well appreciate. As a policy, we
have not subsidised energy consumption, as we believe that this
would lead to inefficient use of a scarce resource. And I think
this is a point well hoisted in when we look at the experience around
the world. Rather, we have chosen to provide targeted assistance
to those in need through permanent Utility-Save rebates. On average,
these rebates, for example, if you take a 3- or 4-room household,
these rebates amount to about two to three months of their electricity
bill. This is an important form of assistance, because it means
up to a quarter of their electricity bill a year can be met through
the Utility-Save rebates.</p>

must also take charge. We need to look at more energy efficient
ways of doing things in the home, and this is where the efforts
through MEWR to educate our consumers on how they can go about buying
more energy efficient equipment, eg, their household appliances.
This is an important step that we should continue to follow through. </p>

sector is to ensure the continued availability of skilled technical
personnel. Our power sector must be supported by experienced professionals like
Deputy Manager, Mr Jamal Bin Jamali, who joined Tuas Power 15 years
ago. Our challenge is that 15 years from now, many veterans like
him will retire, and they will reduce the power sector technical
workforce by about 40%. Scholarships have helped to attract and
retain fresh talent like Ms Chu Xiao En, a Singaporean overseas
graduate, who is now working in Sing Power, but we need to do more.
And to this end, the Energy Market
Authority has formed an industry-led Power Sector Manpower Taskforce.
It will recommend strategies to attract, retain, and develop manpower,
and identify the skills required for the longer term. </p>

it is by harnessing R&amp;D to help our SMEs, whether it is by boosting

(CPFTA).</p>

feedback from CASE, MTI strengthened the timeshare-specific provisions
in the CPFTA. We extended the mandatory cooling-off period from
three to five days, introduced a 60-day refund period for contracts
cancelled within the cooling-off period, and extended these provisions
to timeshare resellers, in view of the rising complaints against
resellers.</p>

operators filed with CASE have since fallen significantly from 571

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Yee Jenn Jong</strong>
                  </span>: Sir, I
have two categories of questions relating to the two cuts that I
have made. The first is regarding the strategy of using land sales
to manage the cost of industrial space which the Minister for Finance
and also the Minister for Trade and Industry mentioned today. I
like to seek clarity on how the Government prices the land sales.
Last year, there was this Paya Lebar industrial site that was not
awarded because it went below the price. So there is some perception
that during economic boom, developers would bid very high prices
and we award to the highest bidder, but when the market is down
then we will not award. So, will this be artificially keeping prices
up so that it is quite impossible to have rent rates going down?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-29b41477-64f8-4124-8cf8-66cc03890ecb">
                  <a name="budget__id-29b41477-64f8-4124-8cf8-66cc03890ecb"><!--a--></a> I am also concerned that
there is the effect that REITs being a dominant force in the market
now, they are actually price maker in the rental market. So, if
we take the rent benchmark to price land, then we will have a cycle
that it can only go up, it can hardly come down. So, I need clarity
on this.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-45b5ac3a-2e4f-446d-bb90-7aa83ff27d33">
                  <a name="budget__id-45b5ac3a-2e4f-446d-bb90-7aa83ff27d33"><!--a--></a>The second question that
I have relates to the Tourism Development Fund. I am not sure if
I missed out something, I just want to understand. On the committed
amount to the Tourism Development Fund since 2005, is it $2 billion
plus an additional $905 million? Is the KPI still being set unchanged
to 17 million for tourist arrivals and $30 billion in tourism revenue?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a1b28d2f-c3d3-4368-931b-40d68f7602a4">
                  <a name="budget__id-a1b28d2f-c3d3-4368-931b-40d68f7602a4"><!--a--></a>I also just want to clarify
the question that I made regarding gaming receipts. I notice, for
example, that tourism receipts jumped 49.6% in 2010 and that coincided
with the opening of the two IRs in January and April respectively.
I also notice that gaming revenue is classified under "Sightseeing
and Entertainment". So, my question – for the original $30 billion
receipt target in 2005, did it actually factor in gaming as revenue?</p>

                  </span>: Sir, let
me take the first question and Mr Iswaran can take the second question.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b9787bb5-4520-47e1-9df7-2837071ab154">
                  <a name="budget__id-b9787bb5-4520-47e1-9df7-2837071ab154"><!--a--></a>The Government land sales
procedure is very well documented. It is the same procedure whether
it is industrial land sales, commercial land sales or residential
land sales. Basically, land is protected. It is considered part
of the old reserves. Therefore, the way we sell land in Singapore
has to go through the same processes which are agreed to with the
President. Essentially, we must sell land at a competitive market
rate; otherwise, we are not preserving old reserves. To do so, we
need evidence that there is competition. And if there is competition,
then we go at the going market rate of the highest tender. If there
is not enough competition, then of course we have to satisfy the Chief
Valuer, who is.an appointment made by the Elected President, to
make sure that we are selling land at the right price and not under
pricing it. So, that is the procedure for the sales. So we can have
sales that come in with very few tenderers and still being awarded,
because the Chief Valuer certifies that this is reflective of the
market price.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr
S Iswaran</strong>
                  </span>: Sir, I thank the Member for his question.
Let me take the second point first. I am not sure why he is so fixated
on this gaming revenue element but let me elaborate.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-de0d8a97-1937-4282-9aaa-7cd2ed44471f">
                  <a name="budget__id-de0d8a97-1937-4282-9aaa-7cd2ed44471f"><!--a--></a>Firstly, when we do a
tourism revenue forecast, we take into account all dollars spent by
the tourists. I do not think we split them up, and whether expenditure
on shopping should be under another body and so on. We look at the
total amount tourists spend. This is how STB did its forecasting
when it launched its programme for the Tourism Development Fund.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-bb333afc-07b8-4606-b3bf-3cfbe60e4dcc">
                  <a name="budget__id-bb333afc-07b8-4606-b3bf-3cfbe60e4dcc"><!--a--></a>Importantly, and I think
this is important to register, this is a purely private sector investment.
There was no Government money used on the Tourism Development Fund or
any other source to support this project. So, essentially, these
are projects that were conceived in order to enhance the tourism
environment as part of a larger ecosystem in Singapore. And it is
difficult really to start splitting out what is the tourists' spending because
of the IRs, what is the tourists' spending because of other new
entertainment and other new products we have in Singapore. So, we
look at it collectively as part of the overall wallet and the share
of the wallet that we are able to draw into Singapore.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1f259103-7ef2-445c-945c-ed2c6c05948a">
                  <a name="budget__id-1f259103-7ef2-445c-945c-ed2c6c05948a"><!--a--></a>The second question, which
is his first, on the Tourism Development Fund, yes, it means that
there was $2 billion in the first instance as a first tranche, and
there is now $905 in the second tranche. So, the question is: why
are we having a second tranche? Let me explain again because I think
it may not have been clear for the Member. We put in the first tranche
in 2005 and we said that there was a commitment period of five years, because
these investments would need to be incurred early in the period
in order to generate the returns over the longer term, and that
is what we are seeing now. Many of the investments we made in the
first five years are now beginning to yield results for us, and
some are still coming on-stream, such as the International Cruise
Terminal and the River Safari. And secondly, this new tranche is
not just about achieving these numbers that we talked about. It
is to go beyond that and drive our yield driven tourism strategy and
also to raise productivity and create more job opportunities in
Singapore.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Low Thia Khiang: </strong>
                  </span>Sir,
my first clarification is on electricity tariff. I understand that
there is a $100 million fund to help industry to use energy efficiently.
Besides the new initiative in Punggol monitoring the use of electricity
of households, would the Government also extend the same help or
assistance to households to educate them how to use energy or electricity
efficiently and thereby save some electricity costs?</p>

is on the EDB. I am not clear about the Minister of State's answer.
I would like to know whether there is a need now for EDB to continue
to seek consultation from PSD on the changes with regard to staff,
as the Minister of State referred to having an Executive Chairman
at EDB and all that. Secondly, if there is still a need to consult
PSD, what procedure has the MTI or EDB worked out for this consultation
process? And how did the lapse happen in the first place? Did they
forget to consult or they did not know at all?</p>

                  </span>: Sir, I thank
the Member for his question. I am glad that he agrees with us. This
is an important effort to educate our households, because whilst
we are doing what we can to mitigate the impact of higher energy
prices, much of which is because of global developments, through specific
initiatives like U-Save and what we are doing in our industry.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1781</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1bdd543e-8aaa-485a-8d16-d0b73cdaaf4f">
                  <a name="budget__id-1bdd543e-8aaa-485a-8d16-d0b73cdaaf4f"><!--a--></a> Our households have a
lot that is within their control, in terms of how they go about undertaking
more energy efficient ways of running a household. And that is why
we have significant investments already being made through the Ministry
of the Environment and Water Resources' efforts. If we look at the
ticks that are on electrical appliances and also to educate household
members by looking at their bills and seeing which are the parts
which they can perhaps trim, maybe because there is an air-conditioner
in the home that they can use more efficiently and so on. This is
something we are totally committed to. An important part of that
effort − and I want to stress this because sometimes this comes
up and, in fact, some Members of Mr Low's Party have raised this
− is indeed the pricing of electricity. Because if we subsidise
electricity, then we are dulling the instincts of the average consumer
in appreciating what is the true cost of this very scarce and precious
resource. So, our pricing strategy is an important part of this
whole mix of education, targeted subsidies and industry developments
on the supply side and demand side, in order to try and manage our
energy constraints and ensure we have sustainable and competitive
energy supplies.</p>

to clarify. The EDB will have to consult PSD before making the changes
from now onwards. As to why it happened in the first place, there
was a lapse which means that EDB did not consult PSD when it made
the changes previously. That was the finding and it was published.
The procedure is that whenever EDB is going to make changes, especially
for the human resource aspects, they will have to consult and seek
the views of PSD before making those changes. </p>

like to clarify. I thank Minister of State Mr Teo Ser Luck for his
answer to my speech just now. I would like to clarify that I am
not against foreign workers coming to work in Singapore. I do agree
with Finance Minister Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam. We do need them
but they must be for certain specific jobs when they come to work
in Singapore, and they are really giving us good quality things
to do in Singapore. I am sorry I do not know how to put it into
words. They do give quality work to Singapore. I want to ask why
there are so many foreign workers working in the marine, engineering
and chemical sectors. That is the reason why I highlighted the point about
foreign workers. The ratios are one to five and one to seven.</p>

                  </span>: Sir, let
me deal with that question first and maybe Mr Teo Ser Luck can follow
up. As I mentioned in my reply, the marine sector as well as the processing
sector are very important sectors of the economy. With the foreign
workers participating in the marine sector, in fact, we are able
to capture 70% market share of the oil rig and production vessel
sector. Without the foreign workers, we cannot be in that very strong
commanding position. And it is complementary. At the workers' level,
the estimate is maybe 80% foreign workers and 20% Singaporeans.
But for the engineering and the naval architecture design sector,
it is 80% Singaporeans and maybe 20% foreigners. So, this is how
the Singaporean core is complemented by the foreign workers to make
our industry competitive. If we follow what she has suggested and
cut it down to one third, then I think we are putting a lot of strain
on the industry, and the industry will not be able to compete.</p>

is obviously a laudable target. I would like to ask the Minister
whether we have the space as well as the tourism related capacity

                  </span>: Sir, I thank
Mr Liang for his question. Allow me to respond to that in two ways.
The first is the rate of increase that we have seen is contributed
by different factors, not least of which is what has been happening
in Singapore itself in terms of developments, but also the rising
demand from Asia for leisure products and tourism travel.</p>

for us, if we look at, for example, a key piece of infrastructure
which is our hotel stock. And if we look at what has been happening
in that space over the last three years, there have been significant
additions. With the advent of the IRs alone, we have added something
in the order of magnitude of about 6,000-8,000 rooms, if I remember
correctly, in the last few years, and there are some more to come. And
then we have other new hotels coming on stream, not just at the
premium end, but also in some of the budget and mid-tier levels
as well.</p>

and the Government continues to have land available, land sales
programmes for this sort of projects. And we really leave it, to
some extent, to the private sector to make the judgment call, and
they will draw their inferences from hotel occupancy rates and the
average room rates to get some measure of how things are going.
Last year, we were averaging something around the high 80s, which
suggests that we are not quite bursting at the seams, but we are
operating at a fairly healthy level if we look at hotel utilisation
rate.</p>

say that, in general, we do want to manage our growth in this area
in a clever way, because it is not just about quantity but it is
also about the quality of the tourism growth that we have. And that
is why I made the point about high yield tourism. In other words,
it is not just about having more people come here, but it is also about
looking at how we can get the right type of people to come here
more often and to stay longer and to spend more. We need to look
at that. It does not mean that we migrate to just one end of the
tourism market, but we need to constantly work at the mix of tourists
that arrive in Singapore.</p>

                  </span>: Sir, I thank
the Minister for the replies to my cut on R&amp;D. One of the stated
goals is for R&amp;D spending to reach 3.5% of GDP by 2015, and
this will include both public and private sector spending. I have
two questions. One, is there a target ratio in terms of what the
public and private R&amp;D spending would be? And, two, given the uncertain
economic outlook over the next few years, are there any measures
in the pipeline to encourage the private sector to continue spending
on R&amp;D? </p>

                  </span>: Sir, on the
ratio between public and private spending, typically, what we have
seen is about one is to two, or thereabouts. But I do not think
we want to be terribly formulaic about it because it really depends
on the contexts of the type of industry and what they are doing.
But that seems to be the general pattern. We seek, of course, to
ensure that every dollar of Government investment in R&amp;D gets
its bang for the buck from private sector investment of an equal
level at least, but typically we look at higher multiples than that.</p>

uncertainty will affect R&amp;D spending − the Government component
clearly is a well-defined one, and that creates certainty in the
market, not just for our research institutes and researchers, but
also, in general, as a signal to the market that this is the commitment
the Government has made over a five-year period. In fact, if we
looked back, in the previous five-year cycle, even at the depths of
the recession or the downturn, we maintained our R&amp;D spending.
This was noticed around the world as a clear commitment. We will
continue to do that. Then businesses, of course, will have to make
their calculations and adjust according to the circumstances.</p>

the Minister, in his reply, gave the reason why the marine industry
is given such a high dependency ratio ceiling. He said that as a
result, the industry becomes competitive and we will be able to
generate growth and it is an important industry in Singapore. So,
on the same wavelength, is he also saying that those industries
which have been given a lower dependency ratio, they need not be
so competitive internationally and that they are not important to
Singapore?</p>

taken a very pragmatic approach in developing the various sectors

away from these jobs and therefore the dependency ratio or the quotas

this is historical. The Member will know the history of our marine

just now, the $150 million funding of R&amp;D is to help them make
this change, to restructure because they will also realise that
they cannot have the same access to foreign workers in the long

Sir, I would like to direct the question regarding what the Minister
mentioned about the nuclear sector. It is heartening to note that
the nuclear study has been completed but we are still a long way
from making a decision. I am trying to understand. Given the fact
that in the region, a few countries in South East Asia are going
great guns with their nuclear programmes, are there any plans for
us to at least begin developing some kind of knowledge capability,
so that we can be part of the conversation as the rest of the region
moves towards nuclear capability, working with our universities
to start offering some courses, so that as a ramp up to our own
plans, at least, we are a step ahead and that we can still bring
something to the table as the rest of South East Asia, in particular,
start looking at nuclear energy?</p>

to restate because it should not be misconstrued. I said the nuclear
pre-feasibility study is ongoing. But I said that even if it were
completed, we would be a long way away from making a decision on
nuclear energy for Singapore, because the technology is moving significantly
and there are significant other considerations we will have to factor
in.</p>

whether the regional developments have a bearing on us. Clearly,
they do. And the question then is, should we be developing our own
capabilities in order to better understand? This study in and of
itself will already give us some insight into what the scope of
the sector is, and what are the kinds of issues that we should be thinking about. And
beyond that and what we are hoping that this study will yield is
also some clear ideas on how we should take this forward, perhaps
specifically in areas such as if we want to understand some areas
better, what are the capabilities that we would need in order to
do so. And that would have to be a later consideration once the
study is completed.</p>

revenue. Maybe I should rephrase it. I am not so fixated about it
and I also understand that it is private investment. TDF will not
spend on it. Maybe I will rephrase my question this way. When we
set the $30 billion tourism receipt target revenue in 2005, did
we envisage gaming revenue to be part of it, because gaming revenue
is now a significant part of the tourism receipts by the statistics
that we capture? Should we not look at the KPI of our tourism investment
to be based on the $30 billion without the gaming revenue? </p>

I thank the Member for clarifying his fixation − sorry, lack of
fixation − on the matter. When the target is set, we are talking
about tourism spending as a whole. In other words, when a tourist
comes to Singapore, what is he spending his dollar on? We do not
preclude future innovations or new developments in the market which
might encourage the tourists to spend more. Let me use an alternative example.
We are now going to have an International Cruise terminal, which
presumably will boost our cruise industry in Singapore and bring
more tourists to Singapore who will buy cruises. Should that be
excluded from tourism spending forecasting or calculations? So,
the way I put it is at the time this target was drawn up and the
Tourism Development Fund was set up, there was a clear goal that
these are the resources, this the mission that the Government gave
the STB. This is the goal, this is funding available, now go forth
and seek ways to make it happen, and that is what they have done. </p>

used to talk about Generation X or Generation Y. This is all rather <em class="ph i">passé</em>.
We are now in Generation "I" and the concept is best illustrated
by the iPhone, iPod, ITunes, IMac, Internet, it is all about "I",
the individual and the rise of individualism. There is nothing wrong
with individualism <em class="ph i">per se</em> and, indeed, we do want people
to be themselves, to realise their individual potential and to appreciate
the special and unique talents of each person. At the same time,
however, what makes Singapore different, and which is our special
hallmark, is that being Singaporean is also to be a nation and to
think of ourselves as a community. And the sense of community is important
because it helps us to think beyond ourselves and for the wider
society at large. So, we have these tensions: an increasing focus
on individualism but, at the same time, how do we strengthen our
societal and communal bonds. And here, I think that the arts and
heritage have a big part to play as these are the ties that bind. </p>

heritage is that we see in them things that we can identify with.
They move us emotionally − we laugh, we cry, we empathise with them
or they trigger memories and a sense of a shared identity. Sir,
I would like to ask the Minister what plans MICA has to develop
the arts and heritage in the community. I think it is particularly
important in terms of giving local talent a platform to develop
artistic and creative abilities. We do not always have to focus
on the traditional arts, and this is especially in the area of funding,
because I think that Singaporeans are actually very creative. To
see an example of that, you just need to go on the Internet − there
are extremes, there are some things which are not particularly polite,
but there are some things which are genuinely creative and funny,
and where a lot of thought and creativity has gone into it. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-40430c16-4e00-426f-b666-a2ba7fecde77"><!--a--></a>A day or two ago, Ms Janice
Koh, the NMP, spoke about my meeting with Daniel Sassoon and what
had come of that. Let me just explain to the Chamber a little bit
more in detail what happened. Daniel Sassoon plays with an independent
band. It is called In Each Hand a Cutlass. I met with him and he
was decrying the lack of opportunity in Singapore for local independent
music. And I think one of the difficulties is that whenever something
is being organised, the organisers traditionally, if it has a commercial
element or if there is a funding element, they want to be sure that
they can recoup the investment that they put in. So, there will
be a tendency to go with more established bands or bands with greater
brand-name recognition. And, of course, this means that the local
independent bands do not get the chance to display their talent.
So, I thought about that and I said, "Well, you know one area which
has not been explored is why do you not showcase it in the community,
work with me – my constituency – and we will give you a platform."
Because, obviously, we have the People's Association, we have got
access to the residents, so we will try it out. And what we did
was we organised an evening in Tiong Bahru park. They came up with
the name, again, very creative – the Malay phrase "<em class="ph i">lepak</em>",
which is to basically relax, so you <em class="ph i">lepak</em> in the park, right?
And it was a success because it had good attendance. There is only
one portion where one band was not as good as the others so that
the NPC got 11 complaints about noise during that particular band. But, apart
from that, it went well, so well, in fact, that we are thinking
of doing another one this year called "<em class="ph i">lepak lagi</em>". And this
one we hope to do either at Botanics at Bay or some other area a
little further away from the HDB flats so that we will not get as
many complaints.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-f1f19099-ab10-4802-ac41-727bbf79bad2"><!--a--></a>But the point about this
is to give the local arts community a platform. Just think about
it. Most of us would have heard of Lady Gaga, Linkin Park, Black
Eyed Peas, Coldplay. All right, some Members in the Chamber may
not have heard of these either, but trust me, they are well-known
international bands. On the other hand, how many have heard of Cheating
Sons, Great Spy Experiment, Weave a Thousand and the Obedient Wives
Club – not the one in Malaysia – but the musical version? These
are all local independent bands who are trying to find their feet,
if you like, on the local music scene, and I have heard some of
them, they are extremely good and they deserve recognition. So,
we should give them the opportunity to have their creative talents
seen and heard.</p>

place where we can build in arts and heritage. Newton hawker centre
– when that went for upgrading – and they first showed me the plans
for the upgraded hawker centre, it looked just like any other hawker
centre. I asked them to redraw it because I felt that given its
location, given the fact that it is an important part of our tourist
industry, Newton hawker centre should have a definable identity
of its own. And since the area was surrounded by black and white
bungalows, I asked them to incorporate into the design for Newton
hawker centre the elements of black and white bungalows. So, if
you go there, you will actually see that the beams are black, the
rest of it is white and in the columns there are plaster mouldings
which reflect the kind of design that you would see in the colonial
bungalows. NParks was kind enough to source, at my request, pepper
plants because Newton and Cairnhill used to have pepper plantations.
It also used to have gambier plantations but NParks did not have
gambier trees in stock. They told me I had to go to the Malaysian
jungles to find those. I thought it would be too much trouble, and
I said look for the pepper plants. </p>

just announced the upgrading for the market and hawker centre there.
And for this, I have made a special request to the National Heritage
Board to help us research historical elements of the area that we
can incorporate into the design of the hawker centre, because it
is a historical place, and we should not just let that history slide
into oblivion. We should actually make it part of the hawker centre
so that when people come for their everyday food, when they go there
for marketing, it serves as a reminder of what this area used to
be, what happened here, what our roots are, and then we start to
think of ourselves in terms of a community. </p>

to make available platforms for local talent, for local culture to
be displayed. I did notice that MICA and the People's Association
have now worked to have an officer posted in each community centre
(CC) to encourage the development of the arts. The officer rejoices
in the name of the Arts − I think the "Cultural Officer". I have
asked MICA to reconsider the naming of the officer because "Cultural
Officer" in the days of the Cold War used to be somebody whom after
you had met, you were taken away and never heard of again. So, perhaps
we could have a slightly more creative and imaginative name for
the officer who is posted to the CC so that it would help to foster a
greater sense of creativity, a greater sense of fun and a greater
sense of outreach to the community. </p>

Sir, when National Education was introduced back in 1997, its main
objective then was to imbue in our children and Singaporeans a sense
of national identity and knowledge of our history. However, in recent
years, we have seen an increased influx of new immigrants, many
who have taken citizenship. At the same time, while income levels
have grown across the board, there is inevitably a growing income
disparity between the rich and the poor. This is partly a result
of globalisation and partly a result of our economic strategies. </p>

last General Election, how there have been great differences in
opinions about national policies, a more vocal electorate and a
creation of a "new norm". Even more recently, we are experiencing
tremendous stresses on our existing infrastructure, due to the sudden
increase in residential population. This is especially worrying
for me. While difference in opinions contributes to a more vibrant
society, we seem to have lost our sense of a common identity, especially
when we see Singaporeans expressing unhappiness over many hot-button
issues. The recent uproar over religious insensitivities by a Christian
student group is also a case in point. In view of these changes,
what can the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts do
to help reinforce our society's sense of national identity and cohesion,
to value and share what we have in common than to accentuate the
differences that divide? How can we make Singaporeans feel confident
about our future and be rooted to the country as we head towards
half a century of nationhood? </p>

engagement with the wider public. That seems to be something that
is missing in our existing programmes.
Let us bring back such radio plays and more informative and intellectual discussions
on our radio.</p>

a quick word about heritage in terms of preserving cemeteries, such
as Bukit Brown. Sir, I am not advocating that we preserve everything
that some people may clamour for. But I would urge MICA and its
bodies like the National Heritage Board to play an active role in
deciding what is "heritage", what deserves priority over urban development,
and whether it is worth arguing for in terms of preservation for future
generations. Buildings and cemeteries that are demolished in the
name of development and urban renewal can never be recovered. Even
if Singaporeans today may not appreciate it, they may not visit
the cemeteries, they may not go down to the Green Corridor, 100
years down the road, 200 years down the road, at least they will
still be there and there may be new generations of Singaporeans
who would appreciate it and find that this is something that links
them back to the past. So, I would urge MICA to work with MND to
work out an arrangement where MICA and NHB will play the role as
the lead agencies in charge of our heritage and identify what are
the principles that guide our decisions on deciding what to preserve
and what not. </p>

us and inside us. Simple joys. He agreed. Some of my grassroots

hoity-toity and elitist, but they went along. </p>

Thumboo came down to our butterfly garden and he spoke to some of

touring the garden and speaking to them. For the grassroots volunteers
there who were setting up a butterfly interest group, it was a new
experience, talking to a gentle poet who gave them some beautiful
lines to think over and to ponder on. One of them, a very conservative
housewife, took a sudden interest in poetry. At the launch of the
butterfly garden later, he recited his lovely poem to a motley crowd,
most of whom have never heard Singapore poetry performed before. </p>

to comment on the Arts and Culture Strategic Review report launched
in February this year. The report suggests taking a more bottom-up
approach to developing the arts and culture scene. I think this
is a great idea, if it means that Government will be more flexible
and responsive with financial and infrastructural support when good
ideas are initiated from the ground.</p>

for arts development requires some top-down leadership, especially
when it comes to providing a vision and framework, for art-makers
and stakeholders to work collectively towards. The strategies put
forth should also be backed by quantitative and qualitative research
that studies the impact of previous arts policy recommendations.
In this way, we build on previous successes and identify gaps where
policy has failed. We never start from ground zero.</p>

did not include an objective assessment of the collective recommendations
made under MICA's Renaissance City Plans (RCP) I, II and III over
the last 10 years. In fact, some of the broad aims and proposals
in the ACSR report had already been identified and echoed in RCP
III in 2008. These include the need to strengthen professional capabilities,
enrich arts education in schools, strengthen community bonding through
the arts, promote advocacy through research, and provide more incentives
to increase arts sponsorship. Sir, my question is, has MICA conducted any
detailed evaluation on the impact and outcomes of these recommendations
made under RCP III, as a lead-up to and backdrop for the ACSR report?</p>

that cash and in-kind sponsorships to the arts have fallen since
2008, has MICA set up an independent body to broker arts partnerships
between business and arts communities? Have we successfully co-located
more arts groups within schools, libraries and CCs to ease the arts
housing crunch while strengthening ties with the community? Has
MICA partnered with HDB to integrate arts and culture in town planning
design as a way of transforming our urban landscape?</p>

been collating comparative data that evaluates the contributions

the Singapore Symphony Orchestra (SSO) and the Singapore Chinese Orchestra
(SCO) that would provide the basis of a more targeted approach in
their funding policy? If so, would MICA consider making such information
public? Detailed impact studies are regularly undertaken by arts
councils in Canada, Scotland, Australia and the UK, as a way of
providing a good overview of the health of the funded arts sector,
and are usually made publicly available.</p>

the power of arts and culture cannot be underestimated. It not only
helps to preserve our heritage but also engages our people to create
and build a stronger sense of national identity, rootedness and
social cohesion. An investment in the arts and culture is, in a
sense, an investment in our future. To achieve this, however, arts
and culture must reach out to the larger community and not remain
as a leisure activity for those who can afford it or those who have
an inclination for the arts.</p>

and Culture Strategic Review for this purpose. The review stated
that "in the area of heritage, the 2008 Heritage Awareness Survey conducted
by the National Heritage Board showed that although three in four Singaporeans
agree that participating in heritage activities and visiting museums
will help them develop a greater sense of belonging to Singapore,
only one in two Singaporeans actually visited historic districts
to appreciate our heritage, and only one in four Singaporeans actually
visited museums and heritage galleries". </p>

percentage of Singaporeans attending an arts event has increased
since 1996 to 40% in 2009, it is still less than half of our total
population. I would like to know what is MICA's response to the
report of the Arts and Culture Strategic Review Committee. How can
MICA reach out to the community to participate in the arts and also
encourage more Singaporeans to visit our historic sites to better understand

                  </span>: Sir, in light
of the ACSR report's proposal to review and restructure some of
MICA's cultural agencies, namely, the National Arts Council (NAC),
National Heritage Board (NHB) and the National Library Board (NLB),
would MICA consider devolving some of the major festivals under
NAC to be run independently and autonomously, but with the necessary
financial support? These will include the Singapore Arts Festival,
the Biennale and the Singapore Writers Festival. Similarly, would
MICA consider letting major venues like the new Victoria Theatre
and The Drama Centre be managed as independent entities that receive
Government subsidy?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c5e9538c-350d-46f6-ac01-5857ec29ebfb">
                  <a name="budget__id-c5e9538c-350d-46f6-ac01-5857ec29ebfb"><!--a--></a>If these major arts events
and venues have their own independent boards and managements and
artistic missions, it would generate greater vibrancy and diversity
on the ground, while giving the arts community a chance to develop
expertise in this area of management. In fact, the concept of running
major arts organisations as independent and autonomous entities
is really not a new one. In the United Kingdom, the Royal Shakespeare
Company, the Royal Court Theatre and the National Theatre are major venues
that also programme and commission new work. Government grants hover between
30%-50% of total income and in New York, the Brooklyn Academy of
Music (BAM) receives more than 50% of its income from government
and private sources. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-52bdf1fa-b045-4873-aa6e-75bbe0c93c24"><!--a--></a>Sir, letting go some of
these entities will provide NAC with some objectivity and distance
when it comes to looking at cultural policies and development. Any
conflict of interest, or perceived conflict of interest, is eradicated
because NAC would no longer be in competition with arts groups for
event sponsorship, and would be able to play their role as an objective
and independent broker of arts and business partnerships. Similarly, NAC
would also no longer be in the incongruous position of being both
the grant-provider and a collector of theatre rental from arts groups.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Ms Indranee Rajah</strong>
                  </span>: Sir,
I would like to ask MICA if it would consider advocating or securing
land for the purpose of an Arts Hub. The closest that we have to
an Arts Hub currently is the old school at Mount Sophia, which is
used by various arts organisations and entities as artelier and
to showcase their work. However, the lease of the old school is
coming to an end and it will not be renewed as the land is slated
for redevelopment. Whilst one understands the need for development,
there is also a place in our society for the arts. One meets physical
and basic needs, the other feeds the soul. We need to have a place
where artists of different genres can come together, showcase their
talents and just have a place where there are artistic buzz and
vibe. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1aaf5950-cac8-490d-a6c2-7c05be54f4d4">
                  <a name="budget__id-1aaf5950-cac8-490d-a6c2-7c05be54f4d4"><!--a--></a>Having an Arts Hub would
add vibrancy and an indefinable character to Singapore. This is
so in many other great cities in the world, eg, New York has Soho
and Tribeca; Paris has the left bank or Rive Gauche. Typically,
you will find that these places start off as little-known offbeat
places, but after the arts community moves in, the artistic activities
attract eateries, bistro, coffee joints and, after a while, the
area takes on a whole new life and character of its own. Haji Lane
in Singapore is one such example. </p>

whether it can secure land for this purpose. The land does not have
to be in the hub of the CBD. Artistes thrive in quirky off-the-beaten-track type
of places. They just need to be sufficient space which is reasonably
accessible. We should not attempt to contrive artificial cultural
villages. The better approach would be to set aside the space, work
out an equitable rate for the use of the land and then let the artistic
talent flow.</p>

                  </span>: The arts
make up the stock of our nation's cultural capital which enables
us to build a stronger sense of national identity, rootedness and
social cohesion. To grow this stock, we need generous angel funding.
In fact, one of the recent Arts and Culture Strategic Review Committee's
recommendations was to "invest more in the experimentation, creation
and incubation of new content". Much like innovators in many other
industries, perhaps, even more so, artists need access to funding
during the very early stages of their work. This is why the Review
Committee has suggested that more funds could be channelled towards
the National Arts Council's existing Arts Creation Fund. The fund focuses
on the creation stage of the artistic process. It does not cover
the distribution and the full production costs associated with the
completed work. There are separate NAC schemes for this. </p>

               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1cda1ecb-2125-4e19-bd69-de52673fd0ac">
                  <a name="budget__id-1cda1ecb-2125-4e19-bd69-de52673fd0ac"><!--a--></a>Sir, I would like to make
a point on this role of the Arts Creation Fund. I hope we take great
care to ensure that the Arts Creation Fund's funding process does
not unduly influence an artist's creative work in the early developmental
stage, even if we would hold the artists accountable for the public
funding they receive. Currently, applicants for developmental funding
are required to submit their plans for future distribution of the completed
work. One of the stated aims of the Arts Creation Fund for literary
arts is the creation of work that has "broad readership appeal".
Drafts of manuscripts are required to be submitted for assessment
on, among other things, the market potential of the work. Currently,
the fund strongly encourages attaching mentors, consultants and editors
into the early stages of the creative process. For example, it is
strongly recommended that recipients appoint an editor, either identified
by the National Arts Council or with a choice of editor subject
to the Council's approval, who will play, among other things, a
developmental role. All these can represent additional time and
cost and, more importantly, the commercial considerations, editors
and the funding process could end up directing the work too much.
As the Committee notes, a balance needs to be struck between accountability
to the public and giving the artists the time and space they need.
Sir, time and space are even more important during the developmental stages
of an artist's creative work, and angel funding should reflect this.</p>

                  </span>: Sir, "if
art is to nourish the roots of our culture, society must set the artist
free to follow his vision wherever it takes him". These are not
my words. They are the words of John F Kennedy and they take us
back to the core, fundamental principles of art making – that is,
in order to create work that is relevant, authentic and truthful, artists
need the artistic freedom to hold up a mirror to society; to examine
and raise questions about who we are; and bring to the fore the
issues of the day, which may sometimes make their work challenging
and provocative.</p>

address how censorship and regulation procedures may also negatively
impact the development of a vibrant arts scene in the longer term.
It does, however, suggest the creation of a No-Censorship Zone,
like a Speaker's Corner, for the arts. Many artists I have spoken
to feel that this is a regressive move. Instead of opening up channels
for dialogue, such zoning marginalises art and the role that it
plays. It also sends a signal to the public that any art, no matter
how good, which raises a topic deemed as sensitive, should be ring-fenced
and protected from the public, lest it offends them. Typically,
all it takes is for one member of the public to be so-called offended.
A letter of complaint is sent. Alarm bells ring and suddenly the
whole work, which took months to create, and its funding, are in
jeopardy. It does not take into consideration the majority of the
audiences who value and had no problem with the work.</p>

is easily available on the Internet, and where dialogue and debate
on issues have become increasingly borderless, it seems almost backward to
think that this sort of ring-fencing will (a) stop sensitive issues
from coming out into the open; (b) stop members of the public who
did not participate in the event from being offended; and (c) satisfy
an artists' right to expression and their need to communicate with
an audience simply by giving them a little corner of their own.
If MICA were to adopt this proposal, it should consult closely with
art makers and producers.</p>

of content regulation from censorship towards classification and
co-regulation over the years. It is true that it is rare for a film or
arts event to be disallowed under current guidelines. But artists
are still finding it difficult to make work, because not only is
the Government involved in regulation, it is also extensively involved
in the administration, funding, housing, presentation and promotion
of the arts. Therefore, the scope of interference, both direct and
indirect, in the creation of this work continues to be wide.</p>

and away from censorship, we should instead promote responsibility
on the part of art makers and greater transparency and accountability
on the part of the regulator, and any disagreements should be resolved
through an open and transparent appeals procedure. Guidelines and
timelines should be clear, readily available and followed, and there
should be a consistent approach in the treatment of local and foreign
work. At the same time, the arts community, together with the media, should
find ways of developing platforms to dialogue our differences, so
that we gradually develop greater tolerance and understanding in
our society. In this regard, mainstream and online media play an
important role in raising the level of arts discourse. </p>

something we cannot do without and is omnipresent. I agree with
the Committee's suggestion to widen the coverage of arts as it should
not only be confined
to high-brow arts but also include common culture, such as handicrafts,
busking, popular entertainment and local culture, such as <em class="ph i">getai</em>.</p>

                  <em class="ph i">Getai</em> is a uniquely
Singapore activity which has decades of history. It is not only popular
in the past but has become even better received in recent years.
As <em class="ph i">getai</em> can reach a wide range of audiences, some Government
agencies, such as Central Provident Fund Board and National Problem
Gambling Council, actually spread messages to the public through <em class="ph i">getai</em>.
I heard the response was very good. I spoke to a <em class="ph i">getai</em> organiser about
the kind of help they need from the Government. He said they are
commercial entities and dare not hope for any form of grants, but
they hope to get some form of recognition from the Government. Despite
what he said, the <em class="ph i">getai</em> organiser also revealed that the
$180 per night copyright fees for songs sung during the performance is
a heavy burden. I gathered that the organiser actually only makes
a profit of several hundred dollars for every <em class="ph i">getai</em> performance.
As we can see, it is actually passion for the industry that keeps
them going. The Getai Star Awards Presentation organised by <em class="ph i">Shin Min
Daily News</em> and the <em class="ph i">STOMP</em> Getai Awards are great encouragements.
But this recognition is from the media. What about the Government? </p>

                  <em class="ph i">Getai</em> uses a lot
of dialects and I would like to speak on the dialect restrictions
in the media. Young Taiwanese singer Lala Hsu won the "A Million
Stars" singing competition with her song <em class="ph i">Shen Qi Bai Ma</em> (which
means Prince Charming on a white horse). This song was also nominated
for Song of the Year, Best Composition, Best Arrangement and Best
Single Producer in the 21st Golden Melody Awards. It is a popular
song in the Mandarin pop industry. The most interesting part about
this song is that it is an adaptation of a Taiwanese opera and the
chorus is sung in <em class="ph i">Hokkien</em>. I understand that based on the
Government's regulation, as long as a song has more than four consecutive
lines sung in dialect, it cannot be played on local radio, otherwise
the station would be fined. Therefore, local audience cannot hear <em class="ph i">Shen
Qi Bai Ma</em> on local radio, whereas on TV, we know that the Government
has relaxed the restriction on dialects. The theme song <em class="ph i">Wo Wen
Tian</em> (which means I Ask Heavens) of Taiwanese drama serial Love
is very popular in Singapore. In fact, it is one of the top karaoke
hits. If the <em class="ph i">Hokkien</em> theme song of Love can be played on
national TV every night, why is a song with only the chorus sung
in <em class="ph i">Hokkien</em> banned on radio?</p>

Korean and Japanese songs on radio, and TV viewers can listen to
the original Korean and Japanese dialogues using dual sound channels.
Why such a strict restriction on Chinese dialects? If we are worried
that more exposure to dialects would affect Singaporean's learning
of Mandarin, then with many people learning Korean now, do we ban
this, too?</p>

behind Singapore's language policies and we do not need to lift
the ban completely. I would like to appeal for <em class="ph i">Channel 8</em> and <em class="ph i">Channel
U</em> to offer dual sound channel options for not more than two
hours of dialect programmes a day. In addition, can every radio
station be allowed to play up to eight dialect songs a day too?</p>

Ms Irene Ng, appealed to MICA to be actively involved in the development
of Bukit Brown as part of its national heritage blueprint. Singapore
has very few historical resources of such significance as Bukit
Brown. Even if it is not possible to develop the entire area into
a heritage park, we should try to preserve certain segments with
some significant graves and fully document the rest of the graves. </p>

graves, Bukit Brown is the largest Chinese cemetery in the world
outside China. According to Associate Professor of History at Columbia University
New York, Adam McKeown, a world renowned expert on Chinese migration, I
quote, "Over half of the 20 million migrants who left China from
1840 to1940 passed through Singapore. Many of them chose to live
and work in Singapore. Singapore is thus a critical site in understanding
all aspects of the history of the Chinese diaspora. This, in turn,
will help us to understand the important role of Singapore in the
history of Asia over the last two hundred years." What is destroyed
will be lost forever. Many of us may not realise how the process
of grave exhumation is done. It is literally bulldozed without any
proper search for artefacts. So, I hope that some of these artefacts
would be preserved and be valued assets for the Asian Civilizations
Museum. Too often, we look afar for cultural fulfilment and overlook
the gems underneath our noses. I hope MICA could invest more effort
and resources into our own culture and heritage.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Ms Janice Koh</strong>
                  </span>: Sir, I was
heartened by the initiative taken in the ACSR report to provide
more support to the Singapore popular music scene. However, the
proposals put forward by the report seem to prioritise infrastructural
and business needs over the longer term development and promotion
of individual musicians and bands.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c03f99b3-19c9-4f70-9837-648e52aaec8b">
                  <a name="budget__id-c03f99b3-19c9-4f70-9837-648e52aaec8b"><!--a--></a>Some of the concerns voiced
by many practising musicians in the industry are fairly basic. The
local contemporary sector has been suffering from a lack of opportunities
to showcase upcoming artists as well as experienced, export-ready
talent. There is also an insufficient pool of professional expertise
on the ground, from sound engineers to tour managers, to groom new
music talent and support the career development of more experienced ones.
But the biggest obstacle to developing an audience for home-grown music
is not having sufficient airtime on radio. How do you nurture an
interest in local music or build a thriving ecosystem for the music
scene, if it is not even readily available on mainstream, popular
radio stations or heard during peak airtime hours?</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1797</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2e1ed0ed-4c5f-4f01-b974-d378bba45dec">
                  <a name="budget__id-2e1ed0ed-4c5f-4f01-b974-d378bba45dec"><!--a--></a>Of course, some local
programmers play local music on their stations but a few hours,
once or twice a week, is not enough exposure. Similarly, it is not
enough to relegate local music to one specialist radio station like <em class="ph i">Lush
99.5</em> – the audience for such channels are just too small to
help local musicians make any significant impact on the market.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-dd7c3fad-74f2-44f7-a320-52abea52a0b8">
                  <a name="budget__id-dd7c3fad-74f2-44f7-a320-52abea52a0b8"><!--a--></a>Many developed and developing
countries, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, France and
Ireland, have established quotas for the broadcast of local music, where
legislation or regulations require some minimum percentage of time
devoted to the broadcast of local music, or a minimum number of
tracks per hour. The quota requirements average between 25% and
30%, with some countries like France going up to 40%. Such quotas
help to support the development of a unique local music culture and
the forging of a common cultural identity. But, more importantly,
quotas ensure that the public has regular access to local music.
And once a demand for the music is created, the benefits and positive
spillovers are real and tangible. Increased airtime play contributes
to improved record sales. This leads to more bookings for the bands, increased
music production output, a jump in the quality of music, greater
coverage in the media, and eventually a demand from international
audiences.</p>

there may not even be enough high quality content to broadcast in
the beginning. But in the case of New Zealand and Canada, the music content
improved and started to double within five years.</p>

Would MICA seriously consider establishing a broadcast quota system

building a self-sustainable and vibrant contemporary music scene?</p>

and funding support is MICA planning to roll out for this sector?

provide the scaffolding to build up our national identity. Memories
of the sacrifices and achievements of earlier generations help give
tangible form to our sense of nationhood. More recent memories,
like how we fought SARS together in 2003, also strengthen our collective
identity. These memories help to shape our collective outlook and

of people into nations, with a shared sense of the past and a common

offer us a wealth of interactive technologies with which all of

"Wonder Woman" on TV, or the "The Man from U.N.C.L.E" which I used
to view with my family, missing that primary school that was no
longer around. I lost my primary school, too. Over time, these memories
get weaved into richer narratives offering multiple perspectives
to the many experiences that we share as a people. More importantly,
Sir, these narratives strengthen our bonds on what it really means
to be Singaporeans, and it becomes a gift of memories to a future

arts and culture is about enriching lives. Economic progress provides
for our lifestyle, but quality of life cannot be achieved by economic progress
alone. Our Prime Minister said in his speech at the signing ceremony
between LASALLE and Goldsmiths College just this week, "The arts
and culture give us fulfillment; they uplift our emotions, stir
our souls. They are essential aspects of our identity, of our sense
of worth and humanity." Indeed, arts and culture give meaning and connections
to our daily lives, and they fulfill a profound human need and enriches
us. It is this power of arts and culture that draws amateur groups
like the Raffles Winds together. Its members rehearse two to three
times a week, to put on performances year after year, all while
juggling work and family commitments. They are mainly professionals.
Why do they do it? For their love of music, for their friendships,
and, more importantly, to contribute to society.</p>

this value of arts and culture that the Government embarked on our
earlier cultural masterplans – the report of the Advisory Council
on Culture and the Arts (ACCA), and the Renaissance City Plans (RCPs).
Ms Janice Koh has asked about the impact of the RCPs. Since their
launch from 2000 onwards, the number of arts activities in Singapore
has tripled, to around 35,000 in 2011. NHB's museum visitorship
has increased by five times to 2.9 million, compared to 1999. The
National Arts Companies – the Singapore Symphony Orchestra (SSO)
and the Singapore Chinese Orchestra (SCO) – have achieved critical
acclaim. Several of the groups funded by NAC have toured the world
and received international accolades. These groups include The Singapore Repertory
Theatre, Theatreworks, The Necessary Stage and the T'ang Quartet.</p>

the RCPs have laid a solid foundation for our arts and culture scene,
which the Arts and Culture Strategic Review (ACSR) is building upon. Driven
by practitioners, the private and the people sectors, the ACSR recently
submitted its final report to the Government. As noted by Ms Janice
Koh, the ACSR builds further on some of the RCPs' proposals, such
as strengthening community engagement, arts education and arts capabilities.
Not only does this leverage on our existing strengths, it brings
us closer to a goal that we have been moving towards collectively
all along. Ms Irene Ng and Mr Low Thia Khiang have asked for the
Government's response to the ACSR's recommendations. The Government
agrees in-principle with the ACSR's report. The ACSR urges all to
embrace activities, such as <em class="ph i">getai</em>, community singing and
hip-hop as arts and culture. Mr Baey Yam Keng calls these "living
cultures", and rightly so. It is timely for the Government – and
Singaporeans as a whole – to recognise the contributions of these
lively activities to our national culture. Embracing them will help bond
the community together.</p>

more resources to implement the ACSR's recommendations. As some
of the recommendations are longer-term in nature, the Government
will first focus on raising the awareness and interest of the community,
to provide the demand to sustain our arts and culture sector. At
the same time, we will provide opportunities for our practitioners
to strengthen their capabilities, to create the arts offerings to
meet this demand. And this, we believe, will sustain the ecosystem
in the long run.</p>

start with three key masterplans: the Community Engagement Masterplan,
the Arts and Culture Education Masterplan, and the Capability Development
Roadmap. More than $270 million has been set aside from FY12 – FY16. And
this is on top of the $24 million and $23 million committed to the
National Literary Arts Plan and the National Traditional Arts Plan
announced in 2010.</p>

of the major projects under these three masterplans. My Ministry
will provide more details separately. For a start, the Government
will invest up to $210 million from FY12 – FY16 in the Community
Engagement Masterplan. This will promote appreciation among new
audiences, and proliferate touchpoints for arts and culture. It
will provide more grants for community interest groups, and showcase opportunities
for enthusiasts. It will also upgrade cultural facilities in the
heartlands. Through these, Sir, we hope that arts and culture can
become a living experience for all Singaporeans.</p>

of the Masterplan's projects. To help us know the basics of arts
and culture, NLB will roll out Arts and Culture 101 programmes.
Over the next five years, NLB will conduct more than 6,800 sessions
that will reach more than 340,000 people. Sir, the Government will
implement targeted programmes to raise interest among specific groups.
For the elderly, NAC will implement a Silver Arts Programme, to conduct
activities, such as community drumming, community singing, and arts
and crafts. For the youths, NAC will put in place youth engagement
programmes, such as the Pocket Rocket programme, which will fund
arts projects proposed by youths for causes they care about. For
the needy and the disadvantaged, NAC will continue to support ground-up
arts initiatives that benefit the under-privileged.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b5754edb-3056-456b-9161-9032294e2c34">

the Government will establish multiple arts and culture touchpoints.
This will include cultural concierges in every library to point
people to activities, groups and resources, community arts and culture
clubs in every constituency to connect grassroots groups together,
and a one-stop portal for arts and culture, called ArtsCultureSG.
As to whether we can change the designation from "Cultural Officer"
to something more appealing, I shall leave it to the creative community to
think about.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1ab2c1d6-9ebc-41db-a470-89f48d6fa9f1">
                  <a name="budget__id-1ab2c1d6-9ebc-41db-a470-89f48d6fa9f1"><!--a--></a>Sir, the NAC, NHB and
PA will provide more funding for arts and culture community interest
groups. The target is to grow 50 groups or more over the next five
years, to catalyse a nationwide movement. To provide more opportunities
for the community to showcase their talent, PA will be piloting
a Community Arts and Culture Month, featuring performances by residents
at various community spaces.</p>

upgrade community facilities to support the community and practitioners'
needs. Siglap South Community Club (CC) and Kallang CC have been passionate
in bringing the arts to their residents. We must help them do more.
For a start, NAC will upgrade the two CCs' cultural facilities.
Between FY12 – FY16, up to 25 community spaces will be upgraded
altogether.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1801</p>

with the community to explore establishing Regional Cultural Centres
in town hubs, where larger-scale facilities could be built to serve
a wider catchment. What you see, Sir, on the slide is an artist's
impression, not something that we can promise all the time. Through
these initiatives, we hope to see more participants like Mdm Padma
Krishnan. Despite being a full-time teacher for special needs children,
Mdm Padma has performed annually at Marine Parade CC, and in touring
skits. She is now working on a production with a youth theatre group.
Mdm Padma's passion is remarkable, as she is just 61 years young.</p>

can set the foundation for lifelong love. The Government will do
more to improve arts education in schools. From FY12 – FY16, we
will invest up to $40 million in an Arts and Culture Education Masterplan.
This will upgrade cultural facilities in schools, raise support
for arts and culture curricula and co-curricular activities (CCAs),
and enhance teaching methods and resources.</p>

MICA hopes to work with MOE to identify cultural facilities in selected
schools for upgrading. This will provide students with a better
learning environment, and boost their confidence as young artists.
In addition, more funding will be made available for arts and culture
CCAs, research on art and music teaching methods, and education
materials infused with cultural elements.</p>

in arts and culture, the artworks must resonate with the audiences.
To raise the quality of our arts and culture creations, NAC will
invest up to $24 million in a Capability Development Roadmap from
FY12 – FY16, for a start. Artists and would-be artists will benefit
from better training and development. The current shortage in arts
supporting manpower will also be addressed. Under this roadmap,
NAC will support up to 140 scholarships in the next five years.
This is three times the number of scholarships awarded in the last
five years, and will include scholarships for young artists, cultural
policy-makers, arts managers and arts educators.</p>

arts instruction, a Specialist Diploma in Arts Education has been
introduced. NAC is also working with existing companies to ramp
up or introduce new CET programmes. This will provide more opportunities
for practitioners to upgrade their skills, and address the shortage
of arts supporting professionals in areas such as technical theatre
and arts management. NAC will invest up to $4 million in CET programmes,
to train around 900 supporting professionals from FY12 – FY16.</p>

a mentorship and apprenticeship framework, to facilitate coaching
of students, hobbyists and new professionals by more experienced practitioners.
Over the next five years, the NAC will invest up to $3 million to
put some 200 people through mentorship training.</p>

arts and culture can bring us together, learning can move us forward.
The world is changing and rising in complexity, but if we learn together,
no one will be left behind. NLB has been promoting the love of reading
to all groups across all ages and socio-economic segments. It will
do more. Firstly, NLB will engage all ages in learning. For pre-schoolers
up to six years old, the National Early Literacy Programme for Pre-schoolers
will provide educators and parents with best practices in developing
early childhood literacy. For older children up to 19 years of age, NLB
will expand its Whole School Reading Programme, to encourage reading
outside of the school curriculum. 14 schools are involved in the
pilot phase, and this will be expanded to many more schools.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1802</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-09b1eeba-2685-4550-8fa6-e33b45a5574a">
                  <a name="budget__id-09b1eeba-2685-4550-8fa6-e33b45a5574a"><!--a--></a>Learning is as crucial to the elderly
as it is to the young. NLB will provide senior-centric programmes
and content, including large-print and audio books, and dedicated spaces
for our seniors. NLB will also extend its reading programmes outside
of the libraries, to senior centres. The Government will invest
an additional $30 million from FY12 – FY16, in NLB's initiatives
for the young and the old.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2487bff7-15e1-41c1-9ca7-67b14a6391db">
                  <a name="budget__id-2487bff7-15e1-41c1-9ca7-67b14a6391db"><!--a--></a>Secondly, Sir, the NLB
will reach out more to the underprivileged groups, who need the
library's services and social-levelling the most. NLB's kidsREAD
programme promotes reading among young Singaporeans aged four to
eight, especially those from low-income families. The children,
for example, at Concord Primary School know the impact that kidsREAD
makes. In 2006, Emperor Akihito of Japan visited the National Library,
and the kidsREAD children were chosen to put up a skit. This was,
indeed, a rare opportunity for these kids. The performance, I heard,
went well, but the real impact came after. The children grew more
confident, and, more importantly, improved in their studies. KidsREAD
is a powerful and meaningful programme. Moving forward, NLB will lengthen
the kidsREAD programme from one year to five years, to provide sustained assistance.
The target is to double the number of participants to around 22,400
for this five-year phase.</p>

the other concerns that Members have raised. Ms Indranee Rajah has
suggested developing an arts hub. NAC's Goodman Arts Centre has
the potential to become such a hub. Today, the Goodman Arts Centre
houses 42 arts tenants, comprising a wide diversity of artists and
arts companies. Shared facilities, such as music, dance and project
studios, meeting rooms, an exhibition gallery and a black box provide
synergy and economies of scale. So, it is really up to the groups
today in the Goodman Arts Centre to make use of the facilities and
build this into a very vibrant place.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-d2665c22-7715-48d3-a82b-42b5d92a4c18"><!--a--></a>Mr Chen Show Mao has suggested
reviewing the NAC's arts incubation funding framework. The NAC has
an Arts Creation Fund, as pointed out by the Member, which funds
incubating ideas to fruition. To-date, the Arts Creation Fund has
supported 57 projects, of which 16 have since become full-fledged
plays, productions and publications. I take his point. They have
to find the right balance between how we manage the fund and how
to manage the creative process. </p>

Scheme has also provided rental assistance to newly established
arts companies at the Goodman Arts Centre. In addition, NAC's Seed
Grant has helped promising traditional arts companies to professionalise.</p>

considering extending the Seed Grant to promising companies across
all genres. Artists have also suggested extending support beyond
the work's first performance, and involving intermediaries, such
as producers, publishers and presenters at suitable stages. NAC
will be reviewing its incubation funding framework with this feedback
in mind, and in response to the ACSR's recommendations.</p>

asked about the initiatives that MICA is rolling out for the music
sector, in response to the ACSR. The Government is still considering
the specific music-related proposals, as the ACSR's recommendations
are very comprehensive. MDA also recognises that broadcast access
is important for the promotion of local music, and is reviewing
the Member's suggestion for a local music broadcast quota.</p>

festivals has brought vibrancy to our city, and provided many platforms
for our arts groups to showcase their works. Ms Irene Ng has suggested
taking a more strategic approach to these festivals. Indeed, NAC
has been coordinating festivals and events with close synergies.
For example, the 2011 Singapore Arts Festival and the Esplanade's
Flipside festival were timed to coincide with one another, as were
the recent Art Stage and the soft launch of Gillman Barracks.</p>

for these festivals to be run independently of NAC. Sir, the majority
of these festivals are already privately organised, such as the
M1 Fringe Festival, the Man Theatre Festival and the Laneway Music
Festival. As our arts scene and audiences evolve, NAC will continue
to review the arrangements that best allow our pinnacle festivals,
such as the Singapore Arts Festival, to meet their objectives. In
the same way, NAC has been gradually relinquishing direct management
of arts venues. NAC outsourced its management of the Drama Centre
to The Esplanade Company Ltd in 2010. As more arts venues develop
in Singapore, including the re-opening of Victoria Theatre and Concert
Hall, NAC will continue to partner relevant industry players to manage
these facilities.</p>

advised caution on the ACSR's proposal on "no censorship" zones.
We recognise that the "no censorship" zones have the potential to
incubate more experimental work. However, as Ms Koh has noted, this
could also marginalise such works. In addition, other issues, such
as the use of public spaces and public order, would need to be considered.
As such, MICA will need to study this proposal in greater depth with
the relevant agencies.</p>

also raised the issue of Bukit Brown. Let me just state the position
at this point in time, Sir. At the moment, there is an advisory
committee on Bukit Brown chaired by the CEO of URA, and this comprised
representatives from key stakeholders as well as representatives
from key Government agencies, such as the URA, LTA, NLB and NHB.
We will continue to support the working committee in its documentary
work by sharing NHB's expertise on oral history methodology, and
this will facilitate the collection of the oral history recordings
from the descendents of those buried in Bukit Brown. Similarly,
Sir, the National Archives, as the custodian of the burial register
of the Bukit Brown cemetery, has been supporting members of the
public in their search for ancestors buried in the cemetery. At
this point in time, we will continue to work with the advisory committee
chaired by the CEO of URA, and I understand that MND will reply

points raised by Ms Janice Koh and Mr Chen Show Mao about striking
the right balance. I agree with both Members that it is something
that we have tread very carefully but if you have looked at the
statistics over the years, I think the Government has done pretty
well in developing the arts and culture scene over the years. With
growing numbers of attendances in all of our performances and growing number
of visitorship in our museums, and a growing number of people visiting
our libraries, so
I think we are on the right track, but we will continue to evolve
and learn as we go along. </p>

arts and culture, reading and learning are a continuum of experiences

is our spirit of coming together in diversity that makes us a nation.
Whether it is the elderly re-enacting their teenage crushes to Polytechnic

our desire to come together is a strength for Singapore. So, let
us continue to build up our national identity as we celebrate our

Communications and the Arts (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien)</strong>
                  </span>:
Thank you, Mr Chairman. I agree with Mr Baey Yam Keng and Mr Zainal
Sapari on the importance of traditional arts. Our traditional arts
anchor our identity as a young multi-racial nation, tracing our
roots to an immigrant society. We would not be complete without
our cultural roots. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f1bb05b4-761c-4501-9dc5-164c64eccff2">
                  <a name="budget__id-f1bb05b4-761c-4501-9dc5-164c64eccff2"><!--a--></a>The Chinese, Malay and
Indian traditional arts have evolved over the centuries, through
adaptation, localisation and interaction with the populace. Traditional
Chinese music, for example, has shifted from the formal court music
played in the Tang dynasty, to the less formal Jiang Nan Silk and
Bamboo genre of the masses. More recently, traditional Chinese music
has incorporated the use of western instruments to improve harmonisation
and the richness of the music. Closer to home, the Singapore Chinese Orchestra
has developed its own unique style of music – the Nanyang style,
a Chinese repertoire with Southeast Asian influences. The evolution
of traditional art forms is therefore not unusual. As long as they
stay true to their artistic core, the evolution of traditional arts
could be embraced as a positive contribution to their richness. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1dc01024-adf5-4e8b-95da-a2af068db798">
                  <a name="budget__id-1dc01024-adf5-4e8b-95da-a2af068db798"><!--a--></a>Singapore contributes
to the richness of our traditional arts. As the confluence of many
cultures and a modern, open society welcoming of ideas and talent,
Singapore provides a conducive environment for cultures to influence
one another. The Siong Leng Musical Association is one such group.
Siong Leng promotes Nanyin music, one of the oldest forms of Chinese
music. The group has experimented with Indian instruments like the
tablah. The result is a remarkable blend of old Chinese and old
Indian sounds, and a new sound that breathes new life into an ancient
art. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-6479ba70-b3fa-45c2-8bb7-9449be504ec9"><!--a--></a>Innovation can take place
in two ways. First, in presentation techniques, such as revolving
stage platforms, digital projections and creative moveable sets.
Bhaskar's Arts Academy, for example, has made good use of theatrical
lighting and multimedia projections to enhance its Indian traditional
dance. Second, in the adoption of alternative cultural elements.
Our arts groups can infuse our traditional art forms with modern
or cross-cultural influences, or even elements from other art forms
altogether. Era Dance Theatre, for example, has incorporated other
Malay art forms like the Angklung, Kulintang and Wayang Kulit into
its traditional Malay dances. Their creativity has been well received
by critics and audiences alike. </p>

agrees with Mr Baey Yam Keng and Mr Zainal Sapari that the Government
should support the traditional arts groups. Under the $23 million National
Traditional Arts plan announced in 2010, a seed grant helps promising organisations professionalise
and attract more practitioners. The presentation and promotion grant
has also been expanded to raise the funding support level from 30%
to 50%. This grant can be tapped on to make productions more appealing.

ACSR's recommendations will also help traditional arts groups overcome
their challenges. For example, traditional arts groups will be able
to use the cultural facilities to be built in the heartlands, to
lower production costs and bring their artforms to new audiences.
Arts interest groups, including traditional arts interest groups,
will receive more funding and support. The community arts and culture
clubs will connect enthusiasts to professional traditional arts
groups, to raise their standards. Through these initiatives, we
hope to build greater awareness of traditional arts, grow new audiences,
and attract new practitioners.</p>

providing more Continuing Education and Training (CET) opportunities
for arts practitioners. We encourage traditional arts groups to
take up the CET programmes in technical theatre and stage management.
With the latest skills in sound and lighting equipment, these groups
can inject greater innovation into their performances. Traditional
arts practitioners can also join CET programmes on inter-cultural
art forms, and tap on NAC's mentorship and apprenticeship framework
to learn from experienced practitioners. The cross-fertilisation
of ideas will help them integrate modern or cross-cultural elements
into their works, and bring them to greater heights.</p>

a facilitating role by providing the necessary resources and programmes.
The traditional arts groups, on their part, should take the initiative,
reach out to more audiences, and make the traditional arts more
relevant to Singaporeans. </p>

The Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan's Arts and Cultural Troupe (ACT)
has a junior drama troupe, a youth drama troupe, a traditional Chinese
dance troupe and an adult choir. Each year, the ACT enrols 2,000
people, and puts up annual public performances. Many of its performers
go on to participate in other local arts performances. The Huay
Kuan is now enrolling a "second generation" of members' children.
This shows that there is a growing passion for traditional arts among
the young.</p>

Association is also exemplary in its initiative to preserve culture.
In 2004, it carried out major renovations to the historic Hong San
See Temple. To raise funds for the $3 million restoration, the Association
carried out innovative activities, such as partnering the Singapore
Chinese Orchestra for a concert. In 2010, after years of painstaking
works, the temple was conferred a UNESCO Award of Excellence for
cultural heritage conservation. This was no mean feat, given the competition
from 33 contenders from 14 countries. This ground-up, community-based restoration
effort won special commendation from the UNESCO panel.</p>

may be small, but together, the collective effort of many could
make a difference. We hope that other traditional arts groups will
galvanise the ground, and create innovative works that resonate
with Singaporeans. The infusion of traditional arts with a distinctive
Singaporean flavour will enrich our culture, and ensure its continuation.</p>

move on to public service broadcast (PSB) programming. PSB is very
much related to some important issues raised by our Members. Ms
Irene Ng asked how MICA could help to reinforce our sense of national
identity and cohesiveness, and if PSB programmes could profile our
early pioneers and founding leaders. Our PSB programming, indeed,
aims to celebrate our culture and heritage, and to promote our Singapore
identity, racial harmony and social cohesion as well as social values.</p>

about featuring our founding leaders, I am pleased to say that last

genres of PSB programmes entertaining and appealing as they present
local themes and issues that resonate well with them. Examples of popular
PSB programmes are <em class="ph i">Channel 8</em> and <em class="ph i">Suria</em>'s drama series 行医(The
Oath) and "Embun Di Tengah Hari" (Dewdrops in the Afternoon) respectively;
local talent show "Vasantham Star", and <em class="ph i">Channel 5</em>'s reality

has pointed out, times are changing. With media convergence driven
by the Internet, the TV set in the living room is losing its lustre, especially
among our young. The Internet has opened up a new and exciting world
of information and entertainment. With so many alternatives, the
challenge is for our PSB programmes to remain competitive and appealing.
Hence, the Government embarked on a review of our PSB framework,
including the formation of the PSB Review Panel in October 2010
to study and recommend ways to enhance the delivery and reach of
our PSB programmes. The panel comprises members from the community,
media industry and academia.</p>

after taking over from Senior Parliamentary Secretary Sam Tan, identified
two key challenges to our current model of PSB delivery. The first challenge
is to keep PSB programmes attractive amidst the increasingly intense competition
for viewers. The second is the declining reach of our free-to-air
TV channels.</p>

Our technologically-savvy population is well hooked up to the Internet
and we are the heaviest Internet users in Southeast Asia, averaging

fewer Singaporeans are watching free-to-air TV channels. Daily reach

has completed and submitted its recommendations to MICA. Broadly,
the Panel has made two key recommendations: one, to enhance the
quality and appeal of PSB content and, two, to extend the reach
of PSB content beyond traditional free-to-air TV channels. To enhance
the quality and appeal of PSB programmes, the Panel has recommended
ensuring that adequate resources are channelled to improve PSB. It has also recommended
channelling resources to develop talent in the media industry. The
Panel recommends putting in place a sustained talent-development
and talent-matching programme to help nurture our local creative
talent. This has been requested by many Members here when they spoke
of the need to nurture local talent and the Panel has the same recommendations.</p>

that the media landscape and Singaporeans' consumption habits have
changed. Hence, it has recommended that PSB content be carried beyond free-to-air
TV channels and on other platforms like the Internet. Here, I would
like to commend MediaCorp for having started to put their PSB programmes
online since March 2010. MICA is now studying the Panel's recommendations
and we expect to complete the study by June this year. Details on
the Panel and its recommendations have been released to the media.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank my Panel members

the quality of our PSB programmes and make them available to a wider
audience.</p>

                  </span>:
Mr Chairman, moving on from the right brain, the arts and culture
side, to the left brain, the more logical side. According to a <em class="ph i">Straits
Times</em> report on cyber-bullying, Singapore has one of the highest
incidences of cyber bullying in the world after the US. In view
of this trend, will MICA consider implementing data privacy laws,
similar to those in developed countries, such as the US and the
UK, to update the relevance of existing laws to better protect Internet
users in Singapore against personal threats, and particularly cyber-bullying
among young users? </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-727bf393-dadc-4d21-af17-62b0f3840f07">
                  <a name="budget__id-727bf393-dadc-4d21-af17-62b0f3840f07"><!--a--></a>Data privacy laws will
enable individuals to better protect themselves, especially in increase
in cyber-bullying despite education measures in school, individuals
to protect themselves from intrusion and unauthorised or illegal
release of personal details online to better enable authorities
to help online users better.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0386b070-c498-4e37-b71b-a8017755da95">
                  <a name="budget__id-0386b070-c498-4e37-b71b-a8017755da95"><!--a--></a>MICA's proposal to enact
an Internet code of conduct is a good measure, especially with the
ground-up involvement of the online community. But self-regulation
can help the regular conduct. Today's laws are only effective for
those who can afford legal action and, based on cases I have come
across, there is very little authorities can enforce unless one
is willing to go far with civil litigation. But there is only that
much legal action can help. Not many can also afford to take the
legal route as legal costs are high. So aside from legal avenues,
it may also be useful to take a more holistic approach to tackle
the problem. We need to create a national culture to reject cyber-bullying
and, as such, we should enlist the support and assistance of all
relevant sectors of our society – especially parents, schools, the
youths and children themselves − against cyber-bullying. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3c7dee1b-f97c-4aaa-984e-d15d28bdb0cf">
                  <a name="budget__id-3c7dee1b-f97c-4aaa-984e-d15d28bdb0cf"><!--a--></a>National anti-cyber bullying
awareness campaigns can be a good option. We understand that talks
on bullying awareness are currently not mandatory in schools – and
disciplinary measures, anecdotally from parents, for cyber-bullying
cases, are not as strict or tough compared to physical bullying.
So, can the Government, especially with the help of MOE, do more
to stop the surge of cyber-bullying? Can we engage teachers, parents
as well as other segments of society, such as IT and social media organisations,
global tech and social media brand names and other community organisations,
as key partners to help in our anti-cyber bullying efforts? To eliminate cyber-bullying, it
would help if the culprits also know that the law in Singapore does
not tolerate cyber-bullying and that our society rejects cyber bullies
and their actions. </p>

Mr Chairman, the Inter-Ministry Cyber-wellness Steering Committee
aims to encourage and support cyber-wellness. I would like to suggest
that the Committee, as well as the MCYS and MOE, strongly consider educating
preschoolers and their parents on cyber-wellness. As we know, the
influence of the mass media, Internet and the use of mobile devices
is increasingly pervasive, reaching toddlers, even babies, before
they go to preschool. It is now certainly a common sight to see
toddlers playing iPhones, babies fixated on iPads and pre-schoolers
look to YouTube.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-c70000ab-2570-4a09-8c35-7169a02b32e1"><!--a--></a>According to a very recent
Nielson Digital Consumer Report that surveyed over 1,000 people
last year, nearly one in four of them said they have a tablet computer
in the household. The survey also showed that 70% of the respondents
use smartphones. Today, many of our little ones are unwittingly
being exposed to the unparalleled influence coming through the mass
media and the Internet. Parents and their pre-schoolers can benefit
from education and advice on how to manage the use of smart devices
and Internet exposure. I, for one, know of parents whose toddlers
cannot go to sleep without playing with the iPhone. </p>

education right from a very young age. May I suggest that the Government
also consider conducting a survey to find out the extent and the impact
of Internet exposure and the use of mobile devices by babies, toddlers
and pre-schoolers? As we know, the learning environment has become
increasingly complex now. A plethora of information comes through
multiple channels in cyberspace and from traditional and digital
media. It certainly takes greater vigilance and training to discern
sources of misinformation. What can MICA do to address these challenges?
Can organisations like the National Library play a role in cyber-wellness
education? And how can stakeholders like parents, community leaders
and schools contribute to this effort?</p>

Sir, let me respond to one comment that was raised by Mr Baey Yam
Keng on the dialect policy. Sir, as with all policies, our dialect policy
is not cast in stone, and the Government will review it regularly
to ensure that it continues to remain relevant. At present, Sir,
there are sufficient concessions made for dialect content, taking
into account our need to support the Speak Mandarin Campaign. </p>

Senior Minister of State Ms Grace Fu spoke about our people watching
less TV as they increasingly turn to the Internet. Sir, the impact
of the Internet on our lives goes far beyond this, as we commonly
use the Internet to source for information and to interact with
others. The rise of social media has also intensified online interactions.
Overall, while the Internet and social media bring a host of benefits, they
also bring some challenges that can pull society apart. The Internet
can Build and Bond, but it can also Divide and Disturb. Let me elaborate.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-df78a0fb-e4d9-4f08-ab79-8758f04be3ba">
                  <a name="budget__id-df78a0fb-e4d9-4f08-ab79-8758f04be3ba"><!--a--></a>Sir, the Internet has
the power to Build and Bond communities as it enables families and
friends to keep in touch easily – anytime, anywhere. Social media
has made it easy for people to share stories, experiences, photos
and videos readily. Through such sharing and interaction, generations connect
and communities bond. Social networking sites have also enabled
old friends who had lost contact for years to reconnect and rebuild
ties. I have just been invited to a Facebook group about my old <em class="ph i">kampong</em> in Bedok. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-490e2906-9d6a-4980-95a4-4e6a2e90287f"><!--a--></a>Sir, Singaporeans of all
ages and from all walks of life have taken to popular social networking
sites, such as Facebook and Twitter. There are more than 2.5 million Facebook
users in Singapore – this is almost half our resident population.
Thirty-six per cent of our resident population say they use Facebook
or Twitter at least once a day, sometimes within the Chambers. The
Internet is also a powerful tool that can bring like-minded people
together for a good cause online. Online donation portals are one example.
Since GIVE.sg was set up in 2010 by a group of six final year students
in the National University of Singapore, the site has attracted
more than 10,000 members. It has helped to rally Singaporeans and
raise more than $1.4 million for various charitable causes. MICA's
portal, give2arts.sg, links volunteers and donors to arts and culture organisations.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-db568c1e-ac85-489e-9632-c8c560999816">
                  <a name="budget__id-db568c1e-ac85-489e-9632-c8c560999816"><!--a--></a>Unfortunately, Sir, the
Internet can also Divide and Disturb. Why is this so? The Internet
and social media have enabled greater interactivity among people
by expanding our social space into cyberspace. This has led to more
intense engagement, as people share their views readily and spontaneously,
as well as debate issues through blog and online forum postings.
Many of these exchanges are conducted responsibly and constructively.
However, there are instances of insensitive racial or religious remarks
that can threaten our racial harmony and social cohesion. Besides
racist and hate postings, there are other divisive and disturbing
aspects of online behaviour. Extremists are using the Internet to
reach out to the bigger world, and self-radicalisation can occur
from the comfort of the home half the world away. Other forms of
negative online behaviour include cyber-bullying, flaming, cyber-stalking
and sexual preying on the young, and such behaviour can certainly
cause great harm to the victims.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-ebcb724a-bbac-425d-8438-68d749c38ffc"><!--a--></a>Elsewhere, Sir, we have
also seen how social media can be abused for destructive purposes.
In the riots in the United Kingdom last August, agitators made use
of social media networks to mobilise crowds to wreak havoc in several
cities in the UK. Using Twitter and text messaging, rioters alerted
one another to easy targets for looters. But not all is bad. At
the same time, social media was also put to good use. For instance, there
were people who used social media to organise citizen clean-up campaigns
to help clean up after the riots.</p>

Ms Low Yen Ling have expressed concern about how the Internet can
negatively influence our lives. Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked how we can
protect Singaporeans from cyber-bullying. Ms Low Yen Ling highlighted
the pervasive influence of the mass media and the Internet, even
on our pre-schoolers. Sir, I share your concerns about the undesirable
and harmful impact of the Internet on our people. Be it cyber-bullying,
online scams or gaming addiction, these are serious problems that
afflict societies all over the world. There are no easy solutions
to these problems. Let me share with you how governments in different
countries have taken various steps to tackle these challenges. Some
measures are regulatory and others involve public education.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b357efff-468e-4884-82e9-1ad92835565e">
                  <a name="budget__id-b357efff-468e-4884-82e9-1ad92835565e"><!--a--></a>On the regulatory side,
there are various measures that authorities in different countries
have taken. One is the mandatory requirement that Internet companies
and social media websites pre-screen and take down offensive content.
Another measure, Sir, is the blocking of certain social media sites
altogether. There was also experimentation
with mandatory real-time verification in the user registration process for
online forums.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1810</p>

side, I observe that there is often close partnership between governments
and the members of the community in driving public outreach initiatives. Down
under, the Australian Communications and Media Authority work closely
with community organisations on digital media literacy. In the United
Kingdom, the Council for Child Internet Safety brings together more
than 170 organisations and individuals from different sectors of
society, including government, industry, academia and charity groups.</p>

adopted a two-pronged approach of having legislative measures and
public education. There are laws which can deal with those who cause harm
or exploit others. Earlier, the Minister for Home Affairs has mentioned
that we are reviewing our legal instruments to better deal with
inappropriate or wrongful Internet behaviour. </p>

the introduction of laws to prevent the unauthorised release of
personal details so as to protect individuals against personal threats,
particularly cyber-bullying. MICA, Sir, has proposed the introduction
of a general personal data protection law to protect personal data
and provide greater consumer trust in the private sector, including
on the Internet. Sir, I will give an update on the data protection
law later when I address the cuts on consumer data protection.</p>

alone is not enough, as Mr Zaqy Mohamad has pointed out. There must
also be public awareness and understanding of the potential dangers
in cyberspace. Importantly, we must learn how to deal with them.
So, for instance, in the European Union and other countries across
the world, "Think Before You Post" was the campaign theme for Safer
Internet Day 2010. In the United States, a similar campaign warned
teenage girls about the potential dangers of posting and sharing
information online, as this could be used by sexual predators to
entrap them.</p>

Development Authority (MDA) advises Internet users on how they can
protect their personal information from unauthorised use. For example, users
should set their privacy settings of their online accounts to the
strictest level. They should also limit the sharing of personal
information on social networking sites. To ensure a safe online
environment, we will focus our efforts on two key areas. First,
Sir, we will encourage the online community to foster a culture
of netiquette. </p>

supporting a community-driven Internet code of conduct as he believes
self-regulation is the way to go. I share Mr Zaqy's view that the
community plays an important role in fostering a culture of netiquette,
or good etiquette on the Internet.
The Internet is very much a public space, and the community is best
placed to determine whether online behaviour is acceptable and what
is not. Moderators, website owners and the broader Internet community
can help to set the tone and guidelines for online interaction and
behaviour.</p>

is not something new. Most websites and blogs have guidelines. For
example, Yahoo's forum guidelines advocate netizens to be considerate and
respectful of fellow posters; not to use profanity, vulgarity, obscenities
or inappropriate language; not to harass, abuse, or threaten another's
personal safety or property; not to make false statements, defame,
or impersonate someone else.</p>

different views on what constitutes good netiquette. But I think there
is common ground on some fundamental principles, such as respect
for differing views, not abusing fellow netizens, not making false
statements, and being considerate to one another. Just as we have
social norms to guide our interaction in the physical world, there
should also be similar norms to guide our online behaviour and interaction.</p>

Sir, Minister Yaacob has spoken about how we need to be mindful of
the potential dangers of the Internet, and how the community can
foster a culture of netiquette. I will talk about how we need to
strengthen our "information quotient" as we navigate this new information
environment. By "information quotient", I mean using information
effectively. This requires us to have the skills to access, analyse
and evaluate the information that we consume responsibly. These
skills allow us to harness the power of the vast amount of information
that we have at our fingertips. Upon which, we can then develop
our own new ideas and insights. </p>

our access to information like never before. The Internet has permeated
every aspect of our lives. We have access to more TV channels than
we can ever watch. And the Internet and TV are now converging to
present yet more opportunities for broadcast and narrowcast to reach
out to an even larger audience than before. </p>

abundance, if not overload, our society, like every other society,
faces three challenges. First, making sense of our new environment; second,
finding strength in the diversity of ideas, yet finding sufficient

our unique Singaporean identity amidst the avalanche of competing
ideas and identities. </p>

navigate this new terrain include the ability to research and verify
the sources of information, to distinguish facts from opinions,

We also need to adopt a disciplined approach to check our "confirmation
bias", or the psychological tendency to only access and accept information
that supports our pre-existing suppositions, and to evaluate the diversity
of ideas and information out there to see how things can and should
be understood in context. These are life skills that we must continually

together to enhance these skills in students. MOE has incorporated
the teaching of these skills in various subjects like English and
the humanities. The National Library Board (NLB) will support MOE
by developing additional resources and programmes on research skills
that cater to Primary 3, Primary 5 and Secondary 1 students. The
Media Development Authority (MDA) will also work with MOE on programmes
for students in upper secondary and tertiary institutions, such as
talks, forum theatres and other means that will appeal to them.
NLB and MDA will also work through the Infocomm Development Authority's

But we need more. We will also encourage other like-minded private

the Internet brings us, it also poses challenges because aspects of
it can divide and disturb our people and society. Research by Norton
found that 71% of our children have had negative experiences on
the Internet, such as receiving inappropriate pictures from strangers
or being bullied. The figure is higher for those who are active
on social media, standing at 79%. </p>

                  </span>: As a result
of MICA's good work in promoting the infocomm industry, the spin-off
is the mushrooming in the broadband and mobile penetration rates
amongst local consumers and households in Singapore. This has fuelled
a growing utilisation of infocomm and media services on a daily
basis for study, work and play. The functions and choices for utilisation
are multi-faceted. While Singaporeans have benefitted from the increased
connectivity and mobility, a downside is the emergence of consumer-related
issues. One such issue is unintended expenses, including very high
mobile charges for data downloading amounting to thousands of dollars
when they are overseas. Other forms of complaint may be related
to inadequate quality of services. What is MICA doing to ensure
that consumers' interests are being safeguarded?</p>

Businesses are buying and selling customer databases for marketing purposes,
others are mining personal data from lucky draw forms, surveys,

                  </span>:
Sir, Singaporeans are increasingly getting frustrated at the number
of calls from telemarketers offering packages, services and products.
Some of these calls are not only unwanted and untimely, they also
come during ungodly hours when one is overseas. Many have politely
declined the offers to join this or that, or buy this or that, from
one caller only to receive the same proposition by another person
representing the same company days or weeks down the road. How many
times does one need to tell the same company representative or call
centre that we are not interested? </p>

companies to mine customers for personal data, as the hon Member
Mr David Ong has mentioned. There are also alleged incidents of
companies who may, through legitimate means, obtain clients' personal
data and then sell them commercially. This, I think, is the crux
of the problem. The public is totally helpless and there should
be a law to address this, or for the authorities to regulate. I
hope the Government can address this increasingly pervasive activity
or, rather, invasive activity. No means no, stop calling means stop
calling.</p>

to be looked at are the breaches of confidential data by companies'
websites. There was a recent case where personal information of
other passengers was displayed instead of the details of the person
who had signed on. This caused questions on the integrity of the
data management and protection of the company. There should be regulatory
consequences to such breaches, to protect personal data provided

                     <strong class="ph b">Mrs Lina Chiam</strong>
                  </span>: I raise
the issue of data protection in view of MICA's public consultation
to seek feedback on the proposed Consumer Data Protection regime
for Singapore which was issued last year. In Singapore, companies
and organisations tend to collect too much data from consumers,
much of which is unnecessary and irrelevant. Extraneous data, including
sensitive personal information, such as NRIC numbers, addresses
and telephone numbers, are collected through lucky draw coupons, membership
card applications and the like. So the proposed changes to our Data Protection
Law are much needed but the regime is still too light-touch. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1815</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-463838bd-5230-4a97-bca6-63dfec585191">
                  <a name="budget__id-463838bd-5230-4a97-bca6-63dfec585191"><!--a--></a>Some academics and experts in this field
are of the opinion that it will not make a substantial difference.
We need to make the security of consumers the fundamental principle
here. On one end, this may lead to unsolicited calls by telemarketers;
on a more serious note, the NRIC numbers can fall into the wrong
hands and could be used to impersonate or represent someone else,
thus compromising the security of the unfortunate individual. Yet
the proposed regime has no specific provision on the collection
of NRIC numbers which are so important in the daily lives of Singaporeans. There
also does not seem to be any requirement that personal data collected
by a company is kept confidential or to limit access to the collected
data.</p>

the interest of consumers with that of businesses as it does not
want to affect Singapore's reputation as a place to do business,
especially for ICT service providers and for the development of
cloud computing? As the data protection regimes in other advanced
economies in the European Union or in Canada and Australia are much
more stringent than ours, so I do not think we would lose out. Eventually,
we will be forced to harmonise our regime with theirs when we need
to meet their requirements in return for a market as theirs, such
as during negotiations for trade agreements.</p>

The execution of the works leaves much to be desired. Many households
are unhappy that they had to incur additional costs for this installation
of what is supposed to have been done free. Sir, what does the Government
intend to do about this situation? Will the Government withhold
the grant of $750 million if OpenNet fails to meet the universal
service obligation? Would the Government insist that OpenNet repeat

SMEs today not only have to cope with a tight labour market, they
are also under pressure to reduce their reliance on foreign labour.
There is also the need to manage costs more efficiently. To meet
these demands, SMEs have to increase their productivity and competitive
edge. One of the ways they can do so is to harness technology and
design more effectively. With the use of ICT means, SMEs can do
more with less. Some SMEs have successfully utilised ICT to improve
their work processes. Restaurants that integrate their point-of-sales
systems and kitchen management system with portable devices have
reduced manpower needs considerably. </p>

greater use of ICT. However, are there enough trained professionals
in this area? How will MICA develop our pool of specialised expertise

can indeed help our SMEs in a competitive edge is in the area of
design innovation. In 2010, the Economics Strategies Committee highlighted design
as a key business capability to enhance the productivity of our
enterprises. MICA has since sought to increase our companies' design
thinking and capabilities. SMEs that successfully exploit design
innovation to build their bottomline can stand to gain in the long
term. They not only improve the quality of their services and products,
their image, their brands, will also be enhanced. For example, SMEs
can move up the value chain of production from being an OEM or what
we call Original Equipment Manufacturer to being an OBM, Original
Brand Manufacturer. To this end, can MICA provide an update on the
design-related initiatives and programmes for our Singapore companies?
How can MICA help enterprises to adopt design thinking and adoption?
What is the SMEs' participation rate for such programmes? And lastly,
how are SMEs leveraging this programme to increase their competitive
edge and intellectual property?</p>

Chairman, let me now update on MICA's economic portfolio. In spite
of the uncertain global outlook for 2012, governments around the
world have continued to look to the infocomm, media and design sectors, collectively
known as the ICMD sectors, to drive innovation and growth.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b55e7e1b-af8f-4c2e-ac4e-c295ecae46f6">
                  <a name="budget__id-b55e7e1b-af8f-4c2e-ac4e-c295ecae46f6"><!--a--></a>Worldwide IT spending
this year is forecasted at US$3.8 trillion, a 3.7% increase from 2011.
Media revenue in 2011 reached US$1.2 trillion, up 3.6% from 2010.
As for Design, the European Union has launched a design innovation
policy to fund design projects which raise SME performances; China
is also shifting from a "Made-in-China" to a "Designed-in-China"
strategy to create economic value.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-cfd795c9-ea4c-4b26-ba93-f0e7dd8dc2bb">
                  <a name="budget__id-cfd795c9-ea4c-4b26-ba93-f0e7dd8dc2bb"><!--a--></a>Singapore's investments
in ICMD have yielded positive outcomes. We have achieved exceptional
results in international rankings. For two years in a row, Singapore
ranked second in the World Economic Forum's Global IT Report; and
the 2nd Annual Global Innovation Barometer ranked Singapore 14th
for our global reputation in innovation.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-99b185cc-5f2a-4d97-b38a-0ad3f4967119">
                  <a name="budget__id-99b185cc-5f2a-4d97-b38a-0ad3f4967119"><!--a--></a>The ICMD sectors have
lent a strong push to the economy, both in terms of value-add and
employment opportunities. Preliminary statistics show that in 2011,
the media sector grew strongly at 10.6%, infocomm at 9.5%, and design
at 8.9%. All three sectors exceeded the GDP growth of 4.9%. The
ICMD sectors as a whole registered an increasing employment trend
from 2006 to 2010, with growth rates ranging from 4.6% to 7.0%.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-201122c7-6e81-4c9f-9355-783292ce3147">
                  <a name="budget__id-201122c7-6e81-4c9f-9355-783292ce3147"><!--a--></a>ICMD also plays a key
role in our daily lives. Singapore is one of the world's most connected
nations. Household broadband penetration reached 85% last year,
while mobile penetration increased to 149.6%. As for the pay-TV
sector, six in 10 resident households are now subscribers of at
least one pay-TV service. With strong investments globally in the
ICMD sectors and increasing consumption of related products and services, our goals
remain clear: first, to enhance consumer experiences and, second,
to improve business competitiveness.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1817</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c0d74c27-eecc-4c60-9f68-2034d088ee35">
                  <a name="budget__id-c0d74c27-eecc-4c60-9f68-2034d088ee35"><!--a--></a>Sir, let me start with
our consumers. Mr David Ong pointed out that while Singaporeans
have benefited from increased connectivity and mobility, a downside
is the emergence of consumer-related issues. Indeed, our infocomm
and media ecosystem must be one which consumers can trust, especially
when Singaporeans increasingly view them as necessities. Whether
for education, entertainment, work or play, Singaporeans are increasingly
turning to digital solutions for the latest, fastest and "coolest".
Steps have been taken to resolve these consumer issues.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-72abeccb-29f4-4f80-af46-97c91a22cea4">
                  <a name="budget__id-72abeccb-29f4-4f80-af46-97c91a22cea4"><!--a--></a>One key set of concerns
pertains to the high charges incurred by consumers, oftentimes without
knowing. Consumers now can block unsolicited chargeable SMS messages,
otherwise known as premium rate services, through a barring service
which is free. Consumers' minds can also be at ease when managing
their overseas data roaming usage. To minimise data roaming "bill
shocks", consumers can opt-in to a free service which automatically
suspends data roaming service once charges hit S$100 in a single
month. These measures have been made mandatory for local operators
since 1 February this year.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5e895d7b-0862-4afe-982b-8d099a5fc101">
                  <a name="budget__id-5e895d7b-0862-4afe-982b-8d099a5fc101"><!--a--></a>Finally, Sir, subscribers
of pay TV services are now protected against excessive early termination
charges as retailers are required to graduate the charges on a monthly
basis when consumers terminate their contracts early. Residential
pay TV contracts have also been capped at two years to ensure that
consumers are not tied to excessively long contracts.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b729141a-40ac-4520-9d20-f7914edbb897">
                  <a name="budget__id-b729141a-40ac-4520-9d20-f7914edbb897"><!--a--></a>Sir, the second set of
concerns pertains to consumer expectations on quality of service.
I am pleased to note that 3G mobile coverage within buildings, on
the streets, and in our MRT tunnels will be enhanced. Internet Service
Providers will also be required to publish information on typical
download speeds, in addition to theoretical maximum speeds currently
advertised. These measures will come into effect progressively from
1 April this year.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-99c44678-cb6f-48a9-b763-ee7256984002">
                  <a name="budget__id-99c44678-cb6f-48a9-b763-ee7256984002"><!--a--></a>Mr David Ong, Mr Arthur
Fong and Mrs Lina Chiam raised concerns over insufficient protection
of consumer personal data, which could be misused or sold for marketing purposes.
Sir, MICA is formulating a Data Protection Law to prohibit the unnecessary collection
of personal data, as well as the unauthorised use and disclosure
of such data by organisations. MICA has also proposed to create
a National Do-Not-Call Registry. This will allow consumers to opt
out of unsolicited marketing messages received through phone, SMS,
MMS or fax. Consumers can expect the Data Protection Bill to be introduced
in Parliament the third quarter of this year, and for the Registry
to be set up by end 2013.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-bd502f4d-c6cf-42a5-8426-543aa07e5c61">
                  <a name="budget__id-bd502f4d-c6cf-42a5-8426-543aa07e5c61"><!--a--></a>MICA has also put in place
a National Authentication Framework to assure consumers of greater
security when performing transactions online. This has become more
important as Singaporeans increasingly engage in online transactions
which involve sensitive information. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-fafff046-6120-459c-8c10-e3b5b4c396b7">
                  <a name="budget__id-fafff046-6120-459c-8c10-e3b5b4c396b7"><!--a--></a>Since 12 December 2011,
Assurity Trusted Solutions, a subsidiary of the IDA, has started
offering authentication services to interested service providers.
Service providers enjoy cost savings as they do not have to invest
in their own online security systems. At the same time, end-users,
such as you and me, can enjoy the convenience of using a single authentication device
to access multiple online services. As you can see, this particular
person has nine tokens compared to the single token that we hope
to develop and proliferate in Singapore. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1818</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-73fa5a8f-553e-4e7e-9a6b-9e5e6c185d85">
                  <a name="budget__id-73fa5a8f-553e-4e7e-9a6b-9e5e6c185d85"><!--a--></a>Trusted services can only
be efficiently delivered with the support of quality infrastructure.
To prepare Singaporeans for an infocomm-enabled future, we have
laid out plans to build the Next Generation Nationwide Broadband
Network as the core backbone of our digital communication infrastructure.
As of January 2012, the deployment of the Next Gen NBN has reached
86%, and we are on track to cover 95% of all homes and offices by
the middle of this year.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0b2ebb47-f781-42c6-ba79-52c14bb2c4a2">
                  <a name="budget__id-0b2ebb47-f781-42c6-ba79-52c14bb2c4a2"><!--a--></a>Sir, as the Next Gen NBN
roll-out is a massive island-wide exercise, we must expect some
operational challenges. Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked for a review of
the manner in which OpenNet informs homeowners of the free installation,
noting that some did not understand and missed out on the offer.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-739336d4-3d09-4708-8303-c09bc58057ef">
                  <a name="budget__id-739336d4-3d09-4708-8303-c09bc58057ef"><!--a--></a>IDA and OpenNet worked
with multiple stakeholders and leveraged various platforms to publicise
the free installation offer widely. Besides notification letters
and information brochures, a media campaign was launched on TV,
press, online and public platforms. IDA also worked closely with
grassroots organisations to brief grassroots leaders and showcase
the Next Gen NBN at community events.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-fc6f3756-c23c-47cb-a771-60b8a9861ab9">
                  <a name="budget__id-fc6f3756-c23c-47cb-a771-60b8a9861ab9"><!--a--></a>In spite of these efforts,
there remain some homeowners who did not respond to OpenNet's free
fibre installation. Since additional costs for subsequent installations have
to be incurred by OpenNet, it is not a simple matter to require
OpenNet to re-offer free installations. I understand that IDA has
been facilitating appeals from these homeowners, and that OpenNet
has acceded to as many as nine out of 10 appeals. This applies mostly
to homeowners who can show proof of their absence. In addition,
some service providers are also now offering waiver of installation
fees for certain service plans.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8cc35f02-5ded-4d28-8eee-82d7654d2ac0">
                  <a name="budget__id-8cc35f02-5ded-4d28-8eee-82d7654d2ac0"><!--a--></a>Sir, I am pleased to inform
the House that consumers and businesses are already enjoying the
benefits of the Next Gen NBN. Many new Internet service providers
have entered the market. There are currently 12 service providers,
offering over 40 competitively-priced fibre-based broadband plans.
Several of these plans are also packaged with value-added services,
such as interactive TV applications, video conferencing and online
learning resources. Over 100,000 households have signed up for fibre-based
broadband plans as of January 2012.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-40275d73-3b76-4eb8-96e1-9d43f0cc8dad">
                  <a name="budget__id-40275d73-3b76-4eb8-96e1-9d43f0cc8dad"><!--a--></a>Sir, as infocomm becomes
increasingly embedded within the day-to-day lives of our society,
we are also concerned that some could be left behind. To build a
digitally inclusive society and avail its opportunities to all,
MICA has rolled-out an extensive digital inclusion programme to
help all Singaporeans stay abreast. First, MICA recognises that
infocomm is increasingly essential for education. Needy households with
students must not be left behind. Since 1999, IDA has helped low-income households
with school-going children acquire new computers. And these computers come
bundled with free software and broadband access. As of January 2012,
the NEU PC Plus Programme has benefited more than 32,000 households.
Currently, 97% of households with school-going children are able
to access a computer at home.</p>

Adeline, a Secondary 2 student from Holy Innocents' High School,
is one such beneficiary of the NEU PC Plus Programme. Previously,
she spent long hours at the school library to complete her assignments.
This has changed since she received her laptop under the NEU PC
Plus Programme. She now completes her school work at home, and is
able to enhance her school projects through productivity tools offered
as part of the PC Bundle.</p>

also help our senior citizens log on to the digital world and acquire
relevant IT skills. One hundred Silver Infocomm Hotpots will be
set up island-wide by March 2013 in public areas where senior citizens
commonly congregate. They will get free access to computers and
Internet services. As of February 2012, 49 Silver Infocomm Hotspots
are already operating in various Community Clubs, Residents' Committees
and Senior Citizen Activity Centres.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-b9cfa078-6bff-4922-a1a9-f363a89683d1"><!--a--></a>Senior citizens also get
affordable IT training at 12 conveniently-located IT learning hubs,
known as Silver Infocomm Junctions. Over four years, more than 57,000
senior citizens have attended training workshops on topics such
as social-networking, e-transactions and online health management.
Seventy-two-year-old Victor Sim is a beneficiary of IDA's Silver
Infocomm initiatives. After three decades in the film processing
business, Mr Sim then attended courses at IDA's Silver Infocomm
Junction and learnt about digital photograph management. I understand
that Mr Sim has now set up an IT laboratory and is conducting IT
lessons for other senior citizens − a second career at the age of
72!</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-cc91dee6-a3f2-4594-acd9-ab4f519b36da">
                  <a name="budget__id-cc91dee6-a3f2-4594-acd9-ab4f519b36da"><!--a--></a>Third, MICA recognises
that most jobs in the workplace today require infocomm skills. To
help persons with disabilities, the Infocomm Accessibility Centre
has provided industry-relevant infocomm training and structured
certification pathways. As of January 2012, over 4,800 trainees
− including 19-year-old David Ng Hui Quan who suffers from hemiparesis
or weakness on one side of the body − have attended customised IT
programmes at the centre.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1c34f592-bcdb-4b0b-8ff0-78d4afb09e57">
                  <a name="budget__id-1c34f592-bcdb-4b0b-8ff0-78d4afb09e57"><!--a--></a>Sir, let me now address
business competitiveness within the ICMD sectors and beyond. MICA's
key strategy is to sharpen capabilities so that our talents are
valued both locally and internationally. We have studied the manpower
needs of the various sectors, and will put in place customised strategies
to help workers raise professionalism and stay relevant. IDA launched
the Infocomm Manpower Development Roadmap 2.0 last year. This Roadmap
develops infocomm talents and creates higher value-added jobs. This
is in response to the industry's needs for sophisticated infocomm
skills, as a result of the industry's shift towards more knowledge-intensive
business models.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-aa34d59e-ec2f-4288-8987-27dbf6004ace">
                  <a name="budget__id-aa34d59e-ec2f-4288-8987-27dbf6004ace"><!--a--></a>IDA's Company-Led Training
programme will help fast-track fresh professionals to specialist-level
jobs through on-the-job training by leading companies. IDA will
also build a pipeline of infocomm experts in high-end, strategic
growth areas through local and overseas attachments under the Infocomm
Leadership and Development programme. These programmes will be complemented
by the expanded Critical Infocomm Technology Resource Programme,
which seeks to equip infocomm professionals with critical, new and
emerging infocomm skills. Sixteen thousand trainees are expected
to undertake the training courses over the next four years.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-2c931218-ef4f-4adf-9f07-c05397cc86d7"><!--a--></a>The creativity-driven nature of the media
sector requires a continual focus on manpower development. However,
upgrading opportunities are not easily available for some. For example,
freelancers face opportunity costs when pursuing skills-upgrading. Many
media companies also lack the scale in terms of financial resources
to invest in training.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ea61c468-f254-4c72-909d-309f0b43335b">

allowances for media freelancers to upgrade their capabilities at
various courses recognised by the Workforce Development Authority. MDA
will also enhance apprenticeship programmes to provide opportunities
for media practitioners to learn from international experts. In
all, MDA has committed $15 million over five years to up-skill 2,000
media professionals.</p>

touch on the Design Singapore Council. The Design Singapore Council
has implemented capability building initiatives catering to upgrading
needs at various levels. Individual designers can tap on capability
development programmes to upgrade their skills, while the Industry
Association Development Scheme helps design industry associations
roll out industry-wide training. Last year, around 3,000 individuals had
benefited from these programmes.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-80d5a5dd-8bd9-4588-9e11-c1b8785da1b4">
                  <a name="budget__id-80d5a5dd-8bd9-4588-9e11-c1b8785da1b4"><!--a--></a>By 2013, a Design Accreditation
framework will be established to recognise quality practice and
raise the professionalism of our local designers. A Singapore Good
Design Mark and Award will also be launched to recognise well-designed
products and services. This would further motivate our designers
to develop professional capabilities and enhance design excellence.
To be launched in October 2012, the Singapore Good Design Mark and
Award will be administered annually from 2013 onwards.</p>

about how SMEs can be further encouraged to adopt ICT and design
for productivity gains. MICA will continue to encourage the adoption
of infocomm by SMEs through the $85.5 million iSPRINT scheme, supported
by the National Productivity Fund. Launched in collaboration with
SPRING and IRAS, the iSPRINT scheme offers SMEs with ready-to-use
infocomm solutions that bring immediate productivity gains. To date,
more than 2,800 SMEs have benefited from the scheme, generating
more than $20 million in ICT expenditure and a projected $650 million
in value-add. We can see that these are small businesses which we
are flashing on the screen, from a simple grocery shop to a company
dealing with bank scanning system.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-57d8a043-977b-4ec3-84cd-eb75190f9cb7">
                  <a name="budget__id-57d8a043-977b-4ec3-84cd-eb75190f9cb7"><!--a--></a>IDA will also spur the
adoption of emerging technologies, such as business analytics and
cloud computing. IDA will develop at least three sector-wide shared
business analytics platforms in identified sectors. Tax deductions
will also be available for businesses who take up cloud computing
services through the Productivity and Innovation Credit Scheme.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0f3bd2a5-2f8b-4fed-ac0b-bd63d641f099">
                  <a name="budget__id-0f3bd2a5-2f8b-4fed-ac0b-bd63d641f099"><!--a--></a>Even as businesses increase
their productivity through ICT, it is important for them to move
up the value chain by constantly creating compelling products, services
and experiences that engage the users. This is where design comes
in as a strategic differentiator to help businesses innovate and
stay ahead of the curve. The Design Thinking and Innovation Academy
(DTIA) was set up by the DesignSingapore Council to infuse Design
Thinking across all levels.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1821</p>

programme helps cultivate a design thinking mindset. A few weeks
ago, I saw students from Victoria School learning how design can
be used to reinterpret everyday objects under the guidance of Ms
Masayo, a professional Japanese designer. For businesses, the DTIA
has in place a Design Thinking Workshop Series to help realise design
thinking capabilities for competitiveness and growth. This has reached
out to companies in sectors, such as healthcare, manufacturing,
retail and services. DTIA's design thinking workshops have also benefited
participants from the people sector organisations, including hospitals, foundations
and community groups. I understand that the Central Singapore Community
Development Council attended one such workshop, and is now using design
thinking to implement more resident-centric programmes. Sir, to

of design thinking, assistance schemes are also in place to help
businesses capture the economic potential of design. For example, companies
can tap on the Productivity and Innovation Credit for Design, a
tax incentive scheme that provides significant tax deductions for
businesses that invest in product and industrial design. Companies
can also apply for the Design for Business Innovation Grant, or
DBIG, a co-funding grant which seeks to incentivise first-time adoption
of design.</p>

Many local companies have, in fact, benefitted from the DBIG scheme.
Univonna, one of Singapore's largest sofa suppliers, transformed
from manufacturing for other companies to designing its own brand
of furniture. Boncafe, a European coffee roaster based in Singapore,
is using design to diversify from solely selling products to offering
a holistic retail experience for its consumers.</p>

Committee Report in 2010 identified the growing economic might of
Asian consumers as a new growth opportunity. As a microcosm of Asian
diversity and culture, Singapore is well-positioned to design products
and services for the region. Global enterprises have profited from
the expansion of personal consumption in Asia by targeting the unique
taste of Asian consumers. For example, the global company Kraft
Foods observed a growing market in Indonesia for the biscuit business.
Instead of merely marketing existing products, Kraft Foods focused
on designing products based on an understanding of local food culture.
The result was the launch of the Oreo Softcake, as inspired by the
"bolu" cake. This has helped the company capture 10.6% of the market
share within two and a half years. So, they moved from something
hard and crunchy to something soft and juicy for the Indonesian
market, and they have captured 10.6% of the market share in Indonesia
within two and a half years.</p>

the Member of Parliament for taking time to attend the event organised
by the Chinese community. All along, civic organisations within
the Chinese community have been actively working to promote Chinese
tradition and culture, including greater knowledge of the contributions
of our forefathers. Just as Mr Baey Yam Keng mentioned a while ago,
the Government supports these activities. The contributions of Nanyang
Volunteers during the Sino-Japanese War is noteworthy and deserve
praise. Their fearless self-sacrifice, in particular, is worth emulating.
During this process, the National Heritage Board has also done much.
For example, we have documented oral archival history from the surviving
Nanyang Volunteers; we have also organised some of the artefacts,
including reorganising and exhibiting historical records and photographs
of the Nanyang Volunteers. As mentioned by Mr Baey, some of these have
been exhibited during certain activities. Looking forward, if representatives
and senior members of the Chinese community feel that it is necessary
to further affirm the contributions of these Nanyang Volunteers,
we will support civic organisations to initiate these efforts. </p>

the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI) have
mentioned to us that they may play a leading role on this issue.
In fact, in the course of history, the SCCCI has played a leading
role in the story of Nanyang Volunteers. For example, they played
a big part in recruiting the Nanyang Volunteers. They also played
a major role so that the story of Nanyang Volunteers will be reflected in
history. The Government will try its best to work with the Chinese
community, to re-affirm and commemorate the contributions of our
forefathers.</p>

like to thank Minister Yaacob for his responses to my questions.
I just have four clarifications. The first is regarding the process
of regulation. If most of the Censorship Review Committee's (CRC)
recommendations have been implemented, I hope MICA can list the
groups which have been given term licensing on their website, so
that it is transparent. Does MICA agree that we do need a more transparent
and accountable approach to regulating our arts and film industry
so that guidelines are published and followed? In this way, both
artists and Government officials do not need to second guess what
is permissible. Second, it is regarding the collation of data to
study the impact of arts policies. I understand that there has been general
statistics collated with regard to arts attendance and the number
of activities – that has been ongoing for many years now. However,
would MICA collate very detailed information about the funded arts
groups so that we know what their impact on our arts scene is? Not just
general arts attendance but looking at subsidy per head, for example, looking
at ticket pricing, at the way their expenditures are broken down,
so that we can help these arts groups develop further and remain
relevant to Singaporeans, and not just to an elite audience.</p>

is regarding what the Minister of State Mr Chan Chun Sing mentioned.
He said that forum theatre has been a very good initiative as a
way of reaching out to the community, and I totally agree with him.
Forum theatre is a very important platform to discuss social issues
that are relevant to the community, and it requires audience participation
as part of the dramatic process. However, at this point, I believe
on NAC's website, forum theatre is still considered an art form
that is not funded by the Council. In light of the fact that this
has become such an important platform to reach out to the community,
would MICA consider funding this art form so that the arts is really,
truly, available to all?</p>

is in response to the traditional arts that was highlighted by the Senior
Minister of State Ms Grace Fu. I am glad that we are promoting the
traditional arts. However, some really serious issues still remain,
and it is regarding how our Cultural Medallion winners at the very
forefront of the traditional arts, including Mr and Mrs Bhaskar,
who are founders of Bhaskar's Arts Academy, are finding problems
in their succession planning. It is the same with the Chinese Theatre
Circle, which is led by Mrs Joanna Wong and Mr Leslie Wong. I believe
that they are also slowing down, and this is becoming an obstacle
to the way they can run their company. I would like to know whether
or not MICA or NAC is slowly "hand-holding" them through this process
of change and transition, so that they can really remain relevant
to future audiences.</p>

transparent, at the moment, if you go to the website of NAC or NHB

is very clear. I have been in MICA for less than a year, but I have
been able to assess some of this information where companies have
responded to the guidelines that we placed and they have modified
some of the script in order to meet those guidelines. But I will
agree with her that as we endeavour to bring more people and groups

we need to be more refined in the way we understand how funding

we have collected. But, going forward,
these are the things which we are studying in greater detail, and
how best we can collect. It is easy to collect, but whether we can
analyse it for the kind of granularity that she mentioned about,
may be a bit difficult. But I understand where she is coming from
because these are public funds and we want to make sure that we
get the returns that we so desire from our funding. </p>

by the Minister of State Mr Chan, this has been used by some practitioners.
In terms of the overall funding scheme, we look at the total package
as to what exactly is being delivered by the artistic community.
Some groups have used it within their overall presentation rather
than as a presentation itself. So, we should give the flexibility
to NAC to assess as to whether or not this deserves funding or not.
But I agree with her that, going forward, as the art forms continue
to evolve and become relevant to the kind of goals that we want
to achieve, we will have to review our funding framework.</p>

spoke about succession planning. Really, I am not sure whether it
is the business of the Government to go and intervene into the various groups.
But I agree with her that there is a need and that is why we hope,
through the funding of the ACSR recommendations that I mentioned
earlier, that we can actually develop a younger group of people
through the pipeline from the schools into the community and, hopefully,
into some of these groups. I visited some of them. I was at Bhaskar's
Academy a few weeks ago. They do great work and are very talented
people. But she is right that in order to get young people in, they
would probably need to see a clear path. Some of them who were present
there were not Singaporeans, but the more important point is that
we want to grow this sector and bring in younger people so that they
can take on the leadership of some of these organisations. But this
will take a long time and, really, not something which the Government
can compel. The best that we can do is to create a platform, facilitate
it with the proper funding and infrastructure so that more can come
forward. In fact, at the signing ceremony between the LASALLE and Goldsmiths
College just this Wednesday, where the Prime Minister was the guest-of-honour
− it was my first visit to LASALLE, embarrassed as it may be as
the Arts Minister − I was touched by the vibrancy of the place,
the enthusiasm and the comments by the foreigners who were present
from Goldsmiths College, about the quality of our students and our
capability. This is, in fact, a testament of the efforts of our
Government to put more resources into the arts and culture sectors
so that we can produce arts professionals for Singapore. </p>

Sir, on Arts Festivals, I think we need to take a more strategic
approach to the various Arts Festivals in our calendar and promote
Singapore as a unique global city of the arts to the world. I have
asked MICA for a list of all the Arts Festivals and it gave me a
list of 52 festivals. I am not sure if all of them really qualify
as Arts Festivals but they do give a sense of the vibrancy of our
arts scene. Can I ask the Minister to consider setting up an umbrella
discussion body to look at the strategic development of all the
major Arts Festivals and the overarching areas of mutual interests?
In this way, while the events may themselves be run by different organisations,
there can be better coordination in marketing and planning, and
also a louder voice to shout out to the world of the feast of festivals
that is available here.</p>

Well, actually, the umbrella body exists. It is called the NAC.
The National Arts Council is the umbrella body to manage the arts
scene in Singapore.
But I do agree with the Member that we can do better in terms of coordinating
because a large number of the festivals are run by the private sector
groups and organisations, which is basically a very good development
for us here in Singapore. To be able to manage a very, very, crowded
and well-packed calendar, right down to the last details of timing
and non-overlapping places, I think it would be very difficult.
I agree with her. In fact, we are looking into this very seriously.
As to whether or not we need to create another body, I think that
would be redundant. How can NAC play a better role? In fact, as
I mentioned in my earlier reply to Ms Janice Koh, we did, for example, coordinate
some of the events at the Esplanade, and some events staged during
the Singapore Arts Festival, which is run by NAC, and those run
by the private sector organisations. But I agree that we need to
do more so that we can have this fantastic calendar that not only
can show Singaporeans but also can display internationally. </p>

                  </span>: I thank
the Minister for his clarification and his speech earlier. I have
a clarification. In terms of the arts performers and professionals,
in this year's Budget, we notice that there is a lot of focus on
increasing wages and incomes. As part of arts policy and strategic
plans, what are the Ministry's plans for arts? For professionals,
we have training skills; for practitioners, perhaps there is something
that we need to work on. I know some do not receive CPF if they
are working on a project basis. So, how can we help them improve
their livelihoods in the long term? </p>

Next Generation Network (NGN) – I have heard the Ministry's reply
on the deployment of NGN and OpenNet, but that is more for consumer households.
How about the commercial aspects, ie, commercial buildings and corporates?
Are we also on track? I am heartened to see the level of competition.
Is the Ministry happy with the level of competitiveness in terms
of the rates and also the number of diversity of services, because
I think one concern that we initially had of NGN was that we had
a very big pipeline. What types of services are we delivering and
is there some diversity?</p>

Sir, I did mention in my reply that it is part of the three-pronged
approach that we will take in response to the ACSR. One of them
is the Capability Development Roadmap, and this is where we will
work with art practitioners and enthusiasts out there to help them.
NAC is also working with WDA to roll out CET programmes to help
the practitioners upgrade their skills. I do not think the Government can
guarantee that everyone of them will have a fantastic livelihood
but what we can do, as I responded to Ms Janice Koh, is that we
create an eco-system or platform and, hopefully, practitioners in
the field can take advantage of that. And we support not only in
terms of training but also in terms of honing their craft. There
are a lot of efforts by MDA and NAC to help some of the practitioners
improve their skills. By doing so, we hope that, over time, they
can deliver better performances and therefore garner better audiences.
So, I agree with him that this is something which we have to pay
attention to but, at the end of the day, as I mentioned also in
my reply, some of the practitioners have to weigh this against the
opportunity cost because if you take time away from producing and
training, you will lose some time. </p>

commercial sector is concerned, we do not have much of a problem
other than some of the earlier teething problems that we had with
building owners opening up access to OpenNet, to be able to bring
in the fibre. We have since resolved that problem. IDA, in fact,
stepped in to work together with OpenNet and the building owners
to ensure that we can have free access.</p>

is difficult for us to say whether we have reached the optimal level,
but we can see that prices for fibre are coming down tremendously.
I have signed up one recently with my own provider, not the cheapest
but, nonetheless, it offers a diversity of programmes. In terms
of the diversity of services – there were 14 to 16-odd kind of services.
There are many more other providers out there offering a whole range
of services. So, MICA's assessment is that the NGN is slowly but
surely developing an eco-system to allow new creative ideas to come
onboard. The pipeline is big, and he is right that we want to try
and push a lot through the pipeline. We cannot mandate it again
but we have to work with the private sector. There is a lot of effort
by MDA to reach out to a lot of groups to encourage them and to
produce new products and services for the consumers. I would like
to assure the Member that this is something which we pay close attention
to because the investment is huge and we have to make sure that
the money is well spent. </p>

Sorry, Mr Low, I have forgotten your question. There are, in fact,
existing plans. Maybe I can send a brochure to Mr Low on the various schemes
that we have put in place by NHB. But, seriously, I agree with him
that this is an important part of our work as heritage is an important
part of our identity. In fact, the NHB has rolled out many, many
programmes for various groups, including our school children, to
visit our museums. Just recently, to celebrate the 70th Anniversary
of the Second World War, we started a couple of heritage trails,
and I joined one group of students from Woodgrove Secondary School
to walk from Fort Canning all the way down to the memorial at the
park opposite Padang – what we used to call Elizabeth Walk. The
point is that there are efforts by NHB to create information to
enthuse schools and special interest groups to come forward and
take advantage of all the offerings that we have through our heritage
trails. </p>

exhibitions going on at the museums and some of the museum offerings
are free on certain days. In fact, they are free for students, for
senior citizens and NSmen. So we have lowered the bar for a lot
more Singaporeans to come forward. The numbers are encouraging.
We have seen a lot more schools coming forward. Even the schools
in my constituency have started organising heritage trails every
year with the help of NHB. It is really about whether people want
to come forward. I would be happy to work with any groups out there
to encourage them to make use of the heritage trails that we have
developed and, increasingly, we will develop new heritage markers
and therefore we need to advertise this further so that people can
take advantage of them. </p>

Sir, this is a very big project and we want all Singaporeans to
take advantage of it. But there is a cost to OpenNet. The reason
IDA initially obligated OpenNet to send all these letters to inform
the residents is because when you roll out programmes, you have
to mobilise resources. And once you miss a certain estate, to roll
it back again, it will incur costs [<em class="ph i">Interruption</em>]. But we
have to inform you so that you will be at home when we come so that
we can roll out either to your gate or whatever the case may be.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-75d9fe50-e004-4f11-adf0-8f04067f51b1"><!--a--></a>We have done it twice,
through two letters. First one may be thrown out, but not the second
one. But the point is, as I have mentioned in my reply, there were
a lot of efforts by IDA to mobilise grassroots, various organisations.
The picture I showed Members was an exhibition in Geylang Serai
where IDA worked very closely with local grassroots to advertise
about the roll out. But having said that, we will concede that there
will be some instances where people were away, or whatever the case
may be. As I mentioned in my reply, we looked at every appeal and
nine out of 10 appeals have already been acceded to by OpenNet.
We have to understand it from that perspective. All of us received
the first letter and then we got feedback according to IDA that
people did not understand the first letter. That is why, maybe,
it was thrown away. We changed and the second letter had a big text
that says "OpenNet Free Installation", and so on. We have tried
our very best. To do so now, I think it is not fair to OpenNet.
Having said that, we have also worked with some of the Retail Service
Providers (RSPs) to see whether they could bundle and, in fact,
they have been offering plans, to waive the installation fee if you
sign up for a service plan. Because all of us, after we get connected,
must have a service plan. What is the point of having a fibre network
at home when you have no service plan? This is again another opportunity
to work together with some of the RSPs that are already servicing
you or new RSPs to try and get fibre into your homes.</p>

it is not always the most inspiring especially for the youths whose

of our history and our roots, knowing where we come from, warts

seen widespread cheer among the arts community and the championing
of arts and culture by my fellow NMP Janice Koh. She has already
been christened the Arts NMP. My concern is that this is praise
and discernment from the converted. Recent comments on the REACH

and culture is for the elite or perhaps hoity-toity, as Ms Irene

Sir, actually if the hon Member is interested, I can invite him
to the National Museum of Singapore where the exhibition goes way
before 1965. We do value our history before 1965 and in fact, the
NHB has on several occasions held exhibitions to show different
eras of our history. And I do agree with him that we need to broaden
that. In fact, it is being done by NHB. As I replied to Mr Low,
there are many opportunities available and it is really up to Singaporeans
and the various groups to take advantage of that. </p>

I agree entirely with him and that is why we are going to have cultural
offices at the various community centres (CCs) to bring arts to
the masses and bring the masses to the arts. Really, this is an
effort by the ACSR to bring arts everywhere, everyday to everyone.
And this is the response by the Government. We hope that the various
constituencies will take advantage of the resources that we are deploying
at the ground. I think, more importantly, for Singaporeans also
to widen our definition of arts and culture. When I see my senior
citizen ladies doing line dancing, week in, week out − large groups,
I mean they are having fun. But it is an art form. They go through
classes. There are moves which I cannot emulate. They do it very,
very well. And they are good at it. So, I think widening the definition
on our part is also very important. And that is why in response
to Mr Baey Yam Keng, Senior Minister of State Grace Fu mentioned
that <em class="ph i">g</em>
                  <em class="ph i">etai </em>which is a local popular culture is going
to be embraced as part of our arts and culture heritage. Finally,
the use of technology − the answer is yes. We are looking at every
opportunity to use whatever that is available to promote our arts and
culture vision.</p>

home lays the groundwork for a healthy and stable family. Through
the provision of affordable homes and humane housing policies, the
Ministry of National Development can play a significant role in
helping the people to achieve this. The recent policies and measures
that were put in place, such as the construction of more Build-To-Order
(BTO) flats and the increase of income ceilings, have clearly taken effect,
as fewer first-time flat applicants are coming to see me in my Meet-the-People Sessions.
I commend the Minister for executing bold measures in such a short

Minister is looking into ways to help more people. First group who
came to my mind are the divorcees with children in tow. Just last
week, I saw a resident and she is a divorcee who has the custody
of three children and she wanted to buy a flat from HDB. She received
a letter from HDB asking her to get a letter from her ex-husband
to confirm that he will not buy a flat in the next five years with
any of his children. My first response was, “真的吗?” Why
make her life so difficult in order to buy a flat from HDB. And
these are the not so fortunate people who are trying to make the
most out of life in spite of their disadvantages. By extending a
roof over them will give them a lot of warmth and love, as in the
Chinese saying, 雪中送炭, that is, help them when
they are most in need of help. In this case, a HDB flat. Let us
provide housing with compassion. </p>

They should be made

one of the fundamentals of morality and a safety net to the ageing
population problem. We need to get this message across to the young
that they have a responsibility to take care of their aged parents.
It is imperative for us to make a stand on how we as a society value filial

opportunities where the children can build an emotional affinity
with their parents. On its part, the Government should help to make
it easier and more affordable for the children to care for their
parents. One of the ways to do this is to allow singles to purchase
BTO flats if they are caring for their elderly parents. I came across
residents who, after caring for their parents for so many years
and when their parents passed away, they have no place to stay.
Another would be to increase the possibilities for children to live
near their parents, by building more flats in mature estates and
give them priority to these flats. I would also like to suggest
to let those elderly who choose to downgrade under the newly introduced
Silver Housing Bonus be given the priority to choose a flat near
their children. This will make the scheme more attractive. They
can help to look after each other, for example, grandparents can
help to look after grandchildren when the parents are at work. And
this will help in the procreation that we have been talking about. </p>

look less positive this year, the percentage of the population struggling
to juggle homeownership and other necessary expenditures is likely
to increase. Downsizing a flat or downgrading from private property
to an HDB flat seems like obvious solutions. Yet HDB has a policy
that debars ex-private property owners to own an HDB flat within
30 months from the date of sale of his private property. In addition,
the owners of subsidised HDB flats also face a similar debarment.</p>

their homes because they have trouble paying off the housing loan
for one reason or other. Some do not derive profit from a sale after
paying off the loans because they had bought the property at a high.
The fact that banks refuse loans to some of these people proves
that they need help. I urge our compassionate Minister to help everyone
who wants to downgrade, give them another HDB concessionary loan,
give them an existing smaller flat instead of waiting for a few
years, take away the 30-month debarment period for those who downgrade
from private properties, especially those who have never bought
any HDB flat.</p>

residents who have to pay thousands of dollars a month in renting
a flat as they are not allowed to buy directly from HDB, as HDB's
evaluation is that they cannot afford to buy a flat. The fact that
they have to pay several thousand dollars in renting a flat, this
money can be used to pay the mortgage if they are allowed to buy
a flat and, eventually, they own the flat. I would like to see more
compassion and hope that HDB can relax some restrictions to let
more Singaporeans buy rather than spend big chunk of their salary
to rent the flats from the open market.</p>

building blocks of a nation. This can especially be said of our
HDB flats. Back in 1964, public housing had been designated as more
than just a roof over our heads. The Home Ownership for the People
Scheme had been initiated to give citizens a tangible asset and
a concrete stake in the country, promoting rootedness and a sense
of belonging as well as security. This had proven effective, and
we quickly achieved the stability and prosperity for our country
to grow. I am sure providing housing
with compassion to those groups which I mentioned will warm many
more hearts. </p>

                  </span>: Sir, the
Government has been encouraging more Singaporeans to procreate and
raise the fertility levels of Singaporeans. One of the biggest hurdles
facing younger people today is that sense of security that HDB flats
will always be available or affordable for them while retaining
their current lifestyle. Also, one reason for the decline in Total
Fertility Rate (TFR) is because our young couples are getting married
and having children later in life and therefore having less children.
Many I speak to cite the affordability and readiness to own a home
as a reason why they hold back marriage plans or having children.
This is where Member Er Dr Lee Bee Wah's “真的吗?” comes
to mind.</p>

about having two bites of the cherry in terms of buying subsidy
flats from the HDB. In light of seemingly high property prices in
Singapore, can we give our young couples a better headstart, a bigger
cherry upfront for the first-timers? Perhaps, the Ministry can consider
giving first-time couples increased grants or subsidies in return
for longer minimum stay. For example, increasing the subsidy amount
but with a 10-year stay period, instead of five. In addition, by
having longer minimum stay periods in their HDB flats, we can also

Mr Chairman, I would like to propose that we provide a special housing
grant for HDB applicants for every child they have subject to a
minimum of two children to ease their financial burden and to encourage
fertility. We may start with $10,000 for each child which they can
use to offset against the payment of the flat. The unfortunate reality
is that many of our Singaporean couples today have only one or two
children during the initial years of their marriage as they are deterred
from having more children due to the high costs of living. Later,
when they are more stable financially, and would like to have more
children, they may be too old to conceive naturally. This is a problem
as more of our couples are getting married and starting their families
late.</p>

lower income families have more than three children. The costs of
raising more children are high and the more children there are,
the less likely it is for the mother to be working, resulting in
a lower household income. We should consider increasing the Special
CPF Housing Grant (SHG) for such families to buy their own flat
of three rooms or less. Doing so will enable more families who are
tenants renting flats under the Public Rental Scheme to become owners.
For those who have to continue renting, I appeal to HDB to consider
lowering the rental to ease their financial burden. </p>

our HDB blocks have at most two room types, for example, 3-room
and 4-room types of flats within one block. At my Meet-the-People
Session (MPS), I have received a number of requests by families
where the children and parents would like to stay near one another,
preferably within the same block. They would like to stay in different
units so that they can enjoy some privacy and independence. The requirements
of the couple with children are usually different from those of
their elderly parents, who may even be taking care of an old elderly
family member such as a grandparent. To facilitate the building
of stronger family bonds and cater to the different budgets and
requirements of these families, would HDB consider building blocks
with a combination of studio, 2-room, 3-room, 4-room and 5-room
flats?</p>

consider extending the Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS) to 4-room HDB
flat owners? To minimise uncertainty accompanying the probability
of occupants outliving the 30-year lease, I suggest that the minimum
age of the LBS household be set at 58 years, considering the life
expectancy of Singapore females is 84 years and males, 79 years.
I am sure this arrangement would be helpful to many elderly couples
in the sandwich class.</p>

Sir, the rationale for the HDB resale levy is stated as achieving
a fairer allocation of subsidies between first and second timer
purchasers of HDB flats. Thus, a flat owner who purchases a flat
directly from HDB, or purchases a resale flat with CPF housing grant,
will have to pay back a portion of the sales proceeds to HDB after
the flat is sold. The levy may be paid at the point of resale, or
deferred to the point of purchase of a second subsidised flat, which
will attract interest of 5% per annum. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-dd4e23ef-f16d-4a0b-bfba-e7b03c5ac914"><!--a--></a>It seems to be quite a
blunt instrument, which may need review in some cases. One group
is those who sold their "first" flats some years ago. I have come
across residents who had sold their first flats as long ago as in
1999. They had to sell their flats then due to indebtedness. Now
they wish to purchase a new flat. The applicable resale levy policy requires
them to repay HDB a certain percentage of the flat's resale price
or valuation, and interest at 5% per annum for 13 years, which could
easily work out to more than $100,000. This is a prohibitive sum,
which has made further purchases from HDB unaffordable for them. </p>

are ineligible for HDB rental flats because they may not meet all the

after the divorce, one parent would usually be granted care and

or friends. Sir, I have visited a 3-room flat where there are six
persons sharing the two bedrooms because the existing three-member
family has to share the flat with a divorcee who has another two
children. Sir, this is quite unhealthy for all the parties concerned,
having six of them squeezed into two bedrooms, and certainly not
conducive for the children involved. </p>

policy of asking the divorcee to wait out the debarment period of
30 months, can HDB allow divorcees with children to rent a flat
quickly? Alternatively, can they be allowed to buy a flat directly

to support, it would be financially difficult for them to buy a
resale flat. Sir, I think we can do more to help divorced persons
adjust to their situation. And I also agree with Er Dr Lee Bee Wah
for HDB to ask applicants to get a letter of no objection from a
divorced spouse is not very sensitive. I mean, the acrimony is still

Sir, the number of divorces and annulments has been inching up since
2005. In 2010 alone, there were over 7,000 divorces recorded under
the Women's Charter and Administration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA).
Most divorces end up with the sale of matrimonial homes. I have
come across cases where spouses given custody of children were left
staring at the prospect of becoming homeless in the process. While
young divorcees may find it a little easier to pick up their lives
again, older divorcees, especially those with children, may need
some help to do so.</p>

in 2010 was aged 35 to 44 years. Some of these divorcees may have
no option but to sell their matrimonial homes. If their homes were bought
directly from HDB, they face a debarment period of 30 months for
a rental flat and a five-year wait period if they want to buy another
flat direct from HDB or be listed as an occupier. For older divorcees
with custody of children, time is something they do not have on
their side. Take the case of a 35-year-old resident, a divorcee
with custody of three children and no alimony from her ex-husband.
She earned less than $900 a month.
The sales proceeds from the disposal of matrimonial home, if any,
would be gone in 30 months if her family is forced to rent from
the open market. And by the time she is eligible to buy another
HDB flat, age would have caught up with her, the loan eligibility
would have diminished and job security would be an issue.</p>

society means everyone will not be left alone. That would include
singles, divorcees, bankrupts and those who may have been overlooked
in our society. Sir, I do understand that HDB will review applications
for rental or purchase of new flats for divorcees on a case-by-case
basis. The Government may want society to take a pro-family stand.
There is nothing wrong with that. We are Asians, we are pro-family,
but how we look after the less fortunate, needy and vulnerable section
of our society will set us apart from the rest of the pack. Sir,
I urge the Ministry to look into releasing or to do away with the
debarment period for rental flats for divorcees with children as
a start in our resolve to build a truly inclusive society.</p>

(Nee Soon)</strong>
                  </span>: Sir, during my engagements with my residents,
I have met a few residents who have shared with me their difficulties
in sustaining their home ownership due to circumstances, such as
the loss of jobs, divorce
as well as miscalculation on their ability to pay for their mortgages. For
some, the family ties were weakened due to the inability of their
husbands to pay the mortgages. For those who have just gone through
a divorce and sold their matrimonial homes, they shared their fears
and uncertainty of starting their lives as divorcees. Their worry
heightens when they start thinking of getting a new home to settle
down with the children under their custody. Few shared with me that
their children's education were affected, as with no proper homes,
the children are unable to have a good environment to study. Just
last week, I had two cases where both the ex-husband and ex-wife
came to meet me to appeal for housing with the respective children
under their custody. </p>

where one creates and builds one's family. It is a place where people
can feel safe and relaxed. It is also a place which would provide
Singaporeans with a sense of belonging and rootedness to Singapore.
In addition, a home represents opportunities and aspirations for
the people. Without a home, one would be like a building with the
foundation and/or few columns significantly weakened and missing respectively.
The building will be weak and fragile and may eventually collapse
and disintegrate. </p>

the Minister, with his admirable vision and passion, together with

how his Ministry has been helping Singaporeans who are at risk, as
defined above, in getting a place to live. Currently, are there
any constraints that the Ministry is facing in assisting these groups
of Singaporeans in getting a new home? How is the Ministry planning
to address this issue?</p>

Build-To-Order (BTO) flats for singles. I understand that our housing
policy promotes the formation of family nucleus as part of the development
of Singapore. However, like many developed nations, the proportion

I could sense this from interactions with my residents as well as

that it is important that our policies are relevant to the current

singles are not allowed to purchase BTO flats. They are only allowed
to purchase a resale flat, where they must be at least 35 years

parents when their parents are alive. However, upon the death of
their parents, they may end up not having a home, as the estate
of the parents may have to be distributed among their siblings.
A few have shared with me that as they grow older, they would like
to have a flat of their own and take care of their parents at their
home. Although they are able to buy resale flats, being single,
they are often limited by the much higher price of resale flats
and the additional costs attached to resale flats. In addition,
for some who are staying and taking care of their aged parents,
they may have to incur higher cost of life. </p>

I am sympathetic towards this group of Singaporeans. Therefore,
I would like to urge the Minister to have the compassion for this

                  </span>:
Sir, HDB's priority is to provide homes for Singapore families.
Lower income Singaporeans with foreign spouses who are not PRs cannot purchase
BTO or balance flats from HDB. As a result, some of them face serious
housing problems. Currently, their options are: (a) buy a resale
flat on the Non-citizen Spouse Scheme with CPF housing grant for
singles; (b) rent a room or a flat from the private rental market;
or (c) put up with friends or relatives. In many of these cases,
these options are either unaffordable and out of reach, or sub-optimal.
I would like to ask if the Minister will at some stage consider
allowing Singaporeans with non-PR foreign spouses to buy BTO or
balance flats. As a safeguard, do not allow their spouses to be joint
owners or have succession rights to these flats unless they attain
more permanent residency status. This might even be an extension
of the Long-Term Visit Pass Plus scheme that was announced yesterday.</p>

upgrading programmes. HDB's upgrading schemes have raised the quality
of our public housing and given old flats a fresh lease of life.
These programmes are very highly subsidised for Singapore citizens,
and rightly so. This is a benefit of citizenship. PRs who own flats
are not entitled to subsidies unless they are granted citizenship
within a year of billing. If they opt to pay for upgrading by instalments,
they have to pay HDB's market interest rate rather than the concessionary interest
rate that Singaporeans pay. This may cause hardship for PR flat
owners with children who are Singapore citizens, particularly those
PRs who are widowed or divorced spouses of Singapore citizens. There
will also be a direct financial impact on their Singaporean children.
Some PRs, especially housewives, may take quite some time before
they qualify for citizenship, if at all. Will the Minister therefore
consider extending some subsidy or concessionary instalment programme
for such families?</p>

                  </span>: Sir, we
often hear the saying, "A man's home is his castle." This is particularly
true in Asia, where home ownership is an entrenched life goal for
many. Public housing in Singapore has made this dream a reality
for millions of Singaporeans. The HDB flat has become a significant
asset to many Singaporeans. </p>

work with my constituents, I noticed a sizable number of residents
monetising their HDB flats prematurely, and subsequently have difficulty
in providing housing for their family. The reasons they give for
selling range from problems with monthly repayments, raising funds
to meet expenses, settling their debts, starting a business or simply spending
beyond their means. I even know of one couple who actually sold
their flat to fund their son's wedding of $50,000!</p>

end up "homeless", constantly on the move, taking shelter with family

suffer greatly as such temporary housing may not be near their schools,

shared accommodations. </p>

families to write appeal letters for rental flats. Unfortunately, there
are so many others like them, and the supply cannot keep up with
demand. I understand that the average waiting time for rental flats
is now six months with 1,600 families in the queue. I also know
that HDB has already committed to build more rental flats and more
supply is in the pipeline. But, Sir, this situation is not sustainable.
We must take active interventions to help Singaporeans better understand
financial planning and the value of their homes, particularly with
the vulnerable groups. </p>

discipline that we have already instituted in Singapore to protect
consumers. There are systematic steps that banks are obliged to
take to ensure that their customers understand their investment
decisions and the associated risks, before such transactions can
be executed. Furthermore, there is a recent regulatory directive
enforced for complex products, requiring a "Customer Knowledge Assessment"
to be conducted, with all prospective investors before they can
transact. For those who lack the relevant knowledge, banks must
adopt due diligence measures. This discipline required of banks
demonstrates the importance of taking proactive measures in order
to protect the interests of consumers.</p>

that a flat is a home for their family, beyond just an asset to
be monetised, to meet their short-term needs. More effort should
be made to help owners understand the risks they are taking by selling
their homes. Attention should be drawn to the debarment period and
the difficulties in obtaining a rental flat, and also the challenges
that come with living in temporary housing. We should help families understand
the range of other options available other than a sale, for example, downgrading
to a smaller flat. We should also explore collaboration with other
agencies, such as the Family Service Centre, to work out alternatives
to solving financial problems. And owners who have sold their homes
need to understand how to protect the proceeds of the sale from
short-term spending. Sir, most families in such difficulties have
poor financial planning skills. A proactive measure or proactive
approach would go a long way to help prevent families, especially
those at risk, from becoming homeless.</p>

this wish is that I alone, my own hut, is destroyed in the storm,
and I freeze to death, so be it." What a great vow! Du Fu's compassion
and deep sense of self-sacrifice left a deep imprint in me, and
I am sure in many Chinese scholars. He died a pauper but this, and
many of his other poems immortalised him. And I am glad that despite
many changes in HDB leadership over the years, Pan Shou's calligraphy
still hangs in HDB's
lobby, as it should. I recall this part of MND's history, not out
of nostalgia, but because I want to draw on the wisdom of these
pioneers. Their ideas and the values underpinning their thinking
process remain equally relevant today and in the future. Let me
distil them into three learning points: (i) focus on the longer
term greater good of many; (ii) put community interest above self
interest; and (iii) dare to try. It was with this spirit that they
turned rural Toa Payoh into a thriving modern township of today and
Singapore a world-renowned Garden City. We owe them a lot.</p>

a hot housing problem. A severe mismatch in supply and demand, coupled
with global liquidity and low interest rates, caused a sharp spike
in housing prices. The situation reminded me of a speech that the
late Dr Goh Keng Swee made in 1980 on the plight of pig farmers.
I was then a very young civil servant and I remembered that particular
speech. He spoke on what the economists referred to as the pig cycle.
I think the economists in this House will know the cobweb theorem.
When the price of pork is high, pig farmers rear more pigs in the
hope that they will make more money. However, when the piglets grow
up and reach the market, there is, of course, a glut and prices
drop. Farmers then cut the number of piglets they are going to raise
the next time, and thereby ensuring that when these piglets mature,
there will be a shortage and prices go up again. The pig cycle.</p>

to many economic activities: vegetables, rice, even container shipping.
As I read last week, container shippers are now in deep trouble.
All follow the pig cycle. Dr Goh used the pig cycle to explain the
difficulty of matching the supply of hotel rooms to actual tourist
arrivals resulting in a critical shortage of hotel rooms at that time.
With more sophisticated projection, Dr Goh hoped that planners and
hoteliers might perform better than pig farmers. But being a very
wise man, wisely he added a caveat that in real life, events seldom
move in accordance with projections. Adding a poetic touch to his
speech, Dr Goh referred to Scottish poet Robert Burns' poem "To
a mouse". Let me recite the key stanza:</p>

was made into a movie. And such is the occupational hazard of planners.
The best laid scheme can often go askew. This is particularly so
for Singapore where the larger global environment, over which we
have little control, can easily derail our projections. And that
was how MND's housing projection and recent rebuilding programmes
went askew, when our population shot past projections, mortgage
interest rates plunged and our economy made a surprisingly quick
and strong rebound in 2010. And bear in mind how difficult it is
for the construction industry to ramp up and slow down. There is
a long lead time.</p>

they have already softened. How exactly property prices move in

These comprise upgraders, downgraders and divorcees with children.
Each recent BTO launch attracted about 4,600 such applicants. With

launch, so resulting in very high application rates. Starting with
the next BTO launch this month, we will triple the second-timer

as highlighted by some Members, including Dr Faishal Ibrahim. We
made some progress last year but I know that more still needs to
be done. The rental flat building programme is in progress. As completed
units come on stream, more families will benefit. Last year, we
successfully placed 3,300 families in HDB rental flats. The waiting
time for HDB rental flats has come down to five months. We will
continue to work on this problem. But let us remember the larger
social factors which cause this problem, as Mdm Foo Mee Har reminded
us, including, for example, teenage marriages, divorces and problem
gambling. While MND addresses the downstream problems, our society
at large collectively needs to tackle the upstream causes and focus
on prevention. Simply building more and more rental units is not
a sustainable strategy. We have to help prevent the problem.</p>

Dr Maliki is piloting a scheme in his constituency in which he mobilised
local resources, and that include the Community Development Council
(CDC) and Family Service Centre (FSC) to help vulnerable families

and better jobs for themselves, or simply undergoing marriage counselling.
It is hard work, it is uphill but immensely satisfying when families
get rescued and are put onto a recovery path.</p>

upstream problem – families selling their flats to pay their debts
or short-term expenses, and some under the duress of loan sharks.
These illegal moneylenders take the debtor's cash proceeds and leave
the seller homeless. And they end up in HDB office asking for a
rental unit. Last month, <em class="ph i">The </em>
                  <em class="ph i">Straits Times</em> and <em class="ph i">Berita Harian</em> highlighted
this problem. It is both sad and disturbing. As a society, how can
we prevent such a tragedy?</p>

implement Mdm Foo's suggestion: tighten financial counselling, step
up the checks on prospective sellers, make sure the families understood
and have viable housing alternatives before selling their flats.
Where we suspect that the sale would do more harm for the family,
we will try to actively discourage the sale. We will work with the
local FSCs, as suggested by Mdm Foo. And I hope Singaporeans will
accept this paternalistic approach for the good of the families involved.
Separately, the Council for Estate Agencies (CEA), who look after
registered estate agents, will also watch out for any unscrupulous
estate agents who partner loan sharks. We will flush them out. We
welcome whistle-blowers and honest feedback. I do not know if these
measures are enough to minimise the problem. But if need be, we should
be prepared to consider tougher measures. For example, we must try
to find a way to prevent the loan sharks from getting the cash proceeds.
I welcome suggestions from Members.</p>

is to get families into home ownership. Public rental should only
be an interim, not a permanent arrangement. Last year, we were happy
to help 340 households transit from public rental into home ownership.
Mr Azhari was one example. He was allocated a rental flat in 2006.
Subsequently, he found a steady job and his income increased to
$1,400. He applied successfully for a 3-room BTO flat in Punggol, with
the help of an Additional Housing Grant of $40,000. He has just
collected the keys to his new home. He is able to service his HDB
loan using just his CPF funds, without paying cash out-of-pocket.
We are happy for him and his family.</p>

for such a unit in a recent launch – I have been launching this

entitled to a total housing subsidy of $60,000 from the Additional
CPF Housing Grant and the Special CPF Housing Grant, which we introduced
not too long ago. The net selling price to him is, therefore, about $40,000.
The monthly mortgage payment on such an HDB loan can be fully covered
from his CPF contributions, without any cash payment out-of-pocket.
In practice, most 2-room BTO applicants earn above this level of
$1,000. The median income of 2-room applicants in recent BTO launch

about those who are not eligible for rental units because their
salaries exceed $1,500. Currently, the threshold is $1,500. What
we have done is this. We look at the individual cases, on a case-by-case
basis, and we have been allowing some who exceed $1,500, if there
are good reasons. Not everyone who applies will get it, but where
we have good reasons to be compassionate, we do exercise that flexibility. So,
we have families with salaries above $1,500 now living in HDB rental
flats. As for the exact number, I do not carry that in my head.
The rental, as we discussed with Mr Giam in this House last time,
quite rightly and he supported it too, has to be higher than those who
are below $1,500, but it would still be significantly below market
rate.</p>

have provided for their retirement and are comfortable physically,
socially and financially. But some are finding the cost of living
a challenge. If they are living in a larger HDB flat with their
mortgages largely paid up, they will have options. Renting out a
room brings some income, besides useful company. For some, right-sizing
to a smaller unit makes a lot of sense. That is why we build Studio Apartments,
and they are popular. HDB will launch 2,000 Studio Apartments this
year. Many will be in the mature estates. To further facilitate
right-sizing, as you heard in the Budget Speech, we are introducing
the Silver Housing Bonus and we are also enhancing the Lease Buyback
Scheme. Many Members have commented on these two initiatives and
offered useful suggestions, both during the last few days as well
as today. We will study them. In particular, we will review the
CPF Retirement Account top-up criteria with MOF. We hope to complete
the review and announce the details in a few months' time.</p>

who prefer to remain in their neighbourhood, we will introduce a
new Ageing-in-Place Priority Scheme. This is the idea that Er Dr
Lee Bee Wah talked about earlier. It was also an idea that the Senior
Parliamentary Secretary Ms Sim Ann gave to me a few weeks ago, which
is to give elderly applicants of a Studio Apartment higher ballot
chances if the Studio Apartment is in the same town or estate within
2 km of their existing property, so that they do not have to move
too far away and their children can also be with them. We will implement
this idea from the next BTO launch this month.</p>

Sylvia Lim asked that we relook at the resale levy for elderly and
genuine cases seeking to downgrade. There is no resale levy if they
buy a Studio Apartment
or a resale flat. But for those who want to buy a new flat, the
levy, as Ms Sylvia Lim reiterated, is to ensure that those who have
never benefited from any housing subsidy gets more subsidy than
those who have already benefited once before. But I know, on the
ground, in many cases, it can cause difficulties. On a case-by-case basis,
I have been looking at them, and we will try to assist where we
can, and we have been trying. On the case that Ms Sylvia Lim mentioned,
if she can directly send it to me, I will take a look.</p>

families want to live together, or at least near to one another.
This forges strong families besides making a lot of practical sense. Grandparents
help to look after their grandchildren; grandparents remain active,
healthy and engaged, and parents set good examples of filial piety.
These are strong values which we must inculcate. Er Dr Lee Bee Wah
made a strong call for this, and I totally agree.</p>

flats in mature estates, wherever feasible, if there are huge pieces
of land available. This year, there will be BTO launches in Bedok,
Kallang, Whampoa and Geylang. Indeed, 30% of BTO flats to be launched
this year will be in mature estates. This will allow many more young
families to benefit from the Married Child Priority Scheme. And
to provide further support for these families, we would increase
the ballot chances for those applying to stay with their married
children or parents, starting from the next BTO this month.</p>

that we build more integrated flats to encourage family bonding.
I agree, and I support. We will introduce a new scheme – Multi-Generation Priority
Scheme (MGPS) – to give more options for families to stay together.
In the Sky Terrace@Dawson BTO project, HDB experimented with pairing
a larger flat with an adjoining Studio Apartment. These units allow
extended families to live next to each other. It makes a lot of
sense. MGPS will build on this and enhance it by allowing joint selection
of a BTO unit by the married child with either a Studio Apartment
or a 2-room flat by the parents. So, they both apply together. We
plan to launch 250 pairs of MGPS units in various estates this year,
starting with the Bedok BTO project this month. We will offer more
MGPS pairs if they prove to be popular.</p>

that we encourage children, either single or married, to take care
of their parents in their old age. I agree. For singles, we provide
a higher tier CPF housing grant of $20,000 for them to buy a resale
flat to stay with their parents. We have also raised the income
ceiling for the grant from $8,000 to $10,000, to enable more singles
to qualify for the grant. Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim
and Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked that we allow singles to buy BTO flats
directly. Actually if they are above 21 years old, they can already
do so. They can form a family nucleus with their parents to buy
a new flat together because, as Er Dr Lee put it, the motivation
is that he or she can look after their parents; so they should be
staying together. So long as they are above 21 years old, they can
already do so. But if they just want to be alone and stay by themselves,
I am still mulling over how to help them as well as other groups
faced with special circumstances, eg, foreign spouses, as mentioned
by Mr Desmond Lee earlier. I have not forgotten these groups. They
are very much on the top of my head. Last year, my priority was
first-timers; this year, various groups of second-timers. I think after
I bite into this and address the problem in a substantial way, I
will try to find some solutions for some of these singles as well
as other special groups. The key point is that we must not unwittingly
compromise on the promotion of marriage and mutual family support
that we have long held. </p>

attention to are Singaporeans who are in distress due to circumstances
beyond their control: sudden death of a breadwinner, major illness of
a family member, severe disabilities. These are victims of misfortune
and sometimes our policies and rules do leave them cold on the wrong
side. Let me give one example. Last December, which was not too
long ago, the local media reported – if you remember – of a freak
accident off Pasir Panjang Terminal in which a Singaporean lorry
driver was killed. The deceased had earlier successfully selected
a 4-room BTO flat in Chua Chu Kang. But he never got to enjoy this
new flat. He left behind a widow and four children. Media report
highlighted his widow's plight that she was at risk of losing the
BTO flat and becoming homeless, because she is a foreigner. The
rule is clear – the flat is for Singaporeans. We design policies
to cater to the vast majority of population, with clear rules laid
out, to promote self-reliance and prevent abuse or gaming. But when
we come across deserving cases, we must exercise compassion and
treat them as special cases. For victims of misfortune, I have always
impressed on my MND colleagues that our default position is to try
to say "yes", to help give such victims a leg-up at a time of need. So,
for the Pasir Panjang accident case, HDB is helping the family to
keep their 4-room flat in Chua Chu Kang, which I think will be completed
next year. Fortunately, while the widow is a foreigner, the children
are Singaporeans. So, that gives me a leverage, a reason to allow
this family to retain this flat.</p>

Muhamad Faisal Manap and Mr Lim Biow Chuan spoke about the plight
of divorcees. We are sympathetic with divorcees, especially when
they have young children to support, face financial hardship and
have no family support. We will always try to help them. As we free
up, loosen the balloting for second-timers, many of them should
be able to benefit from this initiative. Last year, we allocated
670 public rental flats to divorcees with children. This is more
than 20% of the rental flats allocated last year. Nevertheless,
we must be mindful that divorcees do not form a homogenous group.
In the West, many sympathetic rules designed to help divorcees get
abused, with couples claiming such benefits even though their marriages
are intact. We have to be discerning when claiming a case to be
special. It must really be special. And that is why we have to deal
with this on a case-by-case basis. I pay some attention to the comments written
by the Members when they write in. So, I am counting on Members
to do some due diligence. Do not just take their word for it. We
need to do some probing.</p>

for a compassionate housing policy. We do. We strive to govern with
compassion. The Pasir Panjang accident case is one example, but
there are many such examples in our files. Governance with compassion
requires a good heart, but it also requires a strong head. Much
of the problem of the Western welfare model is that there are too
many good hearts and too few strong heads. Solutions become unsustainable.
Greece is now a classic case. Let us always be aware of this hazard.</p>

I have always stuck to basic values when formulating public policies,
in eight simple words: "老者安之; 少者怀之" − Try to help
the seniors so that they can age with peace of mind. And shower
the junior with love and care. This ancient Confucian ethos underpins
strong families, the marriage institution and filial piety. This
is how a strong society is built. With growing individualism, like
Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, I worry that these values are getting diluted. </p>

There are worrying signs: rising divorce rates, abandonment of parents.

beyond public housing and HDB. Through AVA, BCA, CEA, NParks and
URA, our work affects Singaporeans' larger quality of life, current
and in the future. Through the good work of our pioneers, we can
now enjoy today's high standard of living. Our duty is to ensure
that our children and grandchildren will be similarly blessed. While
attending to immediate needs are important, we must never forget
to plan and build for the future.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-178be315-6c76-46f9-b3ff-c856388fd9cd"><!--a--></a>As this is my first MND
COS, let me briefly highlight three key challenges that will shape
our workplan over the next few years. First, how do we go beyond
building homes to building communities? We used to live in <em class="ph i">kampongs</em> where
everyone knows everyone. There is a general consensus on how we
can live together. We take care of one another – <em class="ph i">gotong royong</em> –
as well as our little <em class="ph i">kampong</em>.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-687ba45b-2895-4e9e-920e-98b0c072d20c">
                  <a name="budget__id-687ba45b-2895-4e9e-920e-98b0c072d20c"><!--a--></a>As we moved into city
living, many things improved. But, yet, we became more isolated
from one another even when we lived more closely together. And that
is the irony of it. Much of the <em class="ph i">kampong</em> spirit is lost. Many
do not even know their neighbours. We lost some of the basic courtesy
we used to have for one another. We care less about our neighbours
and the community spaces that we share.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0d9c9830-81cd-4444-8e48-7e84e1845e57">
                  <a name="budget__id-0d9c9830-81cd-4444-8e48-7e84e1845e57"><!--a--></a>There are many reasons
for the loss of the <em class="ph i">kampong</em> spirit. But we need to find ways to
encourage residents to own their community and to care for one another
again. To be sure, there are areas in Singapore where the <em class="ph i">kampong</em> spirit
remains strong. I am most proud and happy that the <em class="ph i">kampong </em>spirit
in my constituency is very strong. Yishun South as well, so said
Er Dr Lee Bee Wah. We need to find out how such spirit can be replicated
in many more places.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c6d20bb7-8261-4e16-a533-ef2b211565f6">
                  <a name="budget__id-c6d20bb7-8261-4e16-a533-ef2b211565f6"><!--a--></a>Second, how do we prepare
for the silver tsunami? In 20 years' time, one in five Singaporeans
will be over 65 years old; one in 20 over 80. If I am still alive,
I will be one of the one in 20. Many will be living alone because
many Singaporeans have chosen not to get married. The whole texture
of society will change. The built environment will need to evolve
to accommodate the needs and aspirations of older Singaporeans.
Certainly, we will need more nursing homes, more day care centres,
more day rehabilitation centres, better wheelchair access, etc.
But there is much more that is needed. There is no one size that
will fit all. We do not know exactly which will work more effectively.
We just need to try many models to see which one works best for
us.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5ec06370-1874-431d-8055-e9c1abd44402">

our city world-class? There are many islands along and around the
Malacca Straits and South China Sea. That Singapore is a prosperous
First World city,
while other islands remain undeveloped is perhaps due to our good
fortune in history but also to the foresight and diligence of our
pioneers. But nothing stays forever. Just look at history. Many
of the older cities in the United States have shrunk. The economy
that drove the growth of these cities withered. Businesses and jobs
went away. Similar history played out in UK and many European cities.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1846</p>

the top of the competition of cities because this is our only city.
And it is not just about the economy. Our children are now well-educated.
Many are much sought after by other countries and cities for their
talent. To keep them here, Singapore must remain the best place
for them to live, work and play. Beyond a vibrant physical landscape,
we must aspire to cultivate a graciousness of life in Singapore, founded
on the ethos of inclusiveness, compassion and kindness − kindness
for all living things, kindness for our environment.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-ae4986cf-7ffb-40e1-88c4-5bfbef5e0e9b"><!--a--></a>In short, MND's strategic
challenge is to prepare for a very different world, physically and
socially. Like everything else, where we were and where we are now
will not matter much 20 years from now. Singapore can only be a
great city for us to live, work and play tomorrow, if we make the
right choices and do the right things now.</p>
