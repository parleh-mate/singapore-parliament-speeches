<div align="center"><b>MESSAGES FROM THE GOVERNOR</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Governor's Assent to Bills Passed)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have received two messages from His

Excellency  the  Governor in connection  with  Bills

which  have  been passed by the Assembly.  Both  are

addressed to me.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first message, dated 8th November, 1955:



<br><br>"Sir,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the honour to inform you that the Secretary

of  State's approval having thereunto been obtained

in  accordance  with Section  62  (2)  (b)  of  the

Singapore Colony Order in Council 1955, I  have  on

the  3rd November, 1955, in accordance with Section

62  of  the Order in Council, assented to the  Bill intituled: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An Ordinance to declare and define certain powers,

privileges   and  immunities  of  the   Legislative

Assembly  established  under the  Singapore  Colony

Order in Council, 1955, and of the members of  such

Legislative  Assembly, to regulate the  conduct  of

members  and other persons in connection  with  the

proceedings  thereof,  to give  protection  to  the

persons  employed in the publication of the reports

and  other  papers of the Legislative Assembly  and

for  purposes incidental to or connected  with  the

<br><br>"Sir,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the honour to inform you that in accordance

<div align="center"><b>STATEMENTS BY THE CHIEF MINISTER</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Committee on Minimum Standards of Livelihood)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr D. S. Marshall):</b> If it

please you, Mr Speaker, Sir, I have to announce that

the Government has set up a Committee to enquire into

the  field of possible government action to establish

minimum standards of livelihood among the people. The

full terms of reference are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To examine and report upon the desirability and

feasibility  of  Government  action  to  promote  the

establishment of minimum standards of livelihood  for

the people of Singapore, including the institution of

unemployment  insurance, the prescribing  of  minimum

wages,  either  generally or in selected  industries,

and  the  extension  of existing measures  of  social

security  through  pensions,  provident  schemes   or

otherwise."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee, Sir, will be presided over by the

Economic Adviser, Sir Sydney Caine, and the following

have agreed to serve on it:

<pre>

   Mr Cheong Hock Hai.

   Dr. Kai-Loo Huang.

   Dr. Lim Tay Boh.

   Mr S. Rajaratnam.

   Miss J. M. Robertson.

</pre>

<br><br>The  Secretary,  Sir, will be the  Assistant  to  the

Economic Adviser, Mr P. A. Wilson. In addition,  the

Committee  will  be  assisted  by  the  International

Labour  Office  expert,  Mr  Brocklehurst,  who   is

already working with the Ministry of Labour,  and  it

is  our  hope,  Sir, by an expert from  Australia  on

minimum wage legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal organisations of employees and

employers, as well as all interested members  of  the

public,    will   be   invited   to   submit    their

representations to this Committee.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>Economic Advisory Unit</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have furthermore to inform hon. Members that

Government has set up an Economic Advisory Unit which

will  consist  of  the Economic Adviser,  Sir  Sydney

Caine,  and two full-time assistants. The purpose  of

this  Unit  is  that  it should give  advice  to  the

Government  on  general  economic  policy,   on   the

programme  of  capital investment, and on  the  broad

economic aspects of social policy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now, Sir, as you are aware, the normal

practice, both amongst our immediate neighbours  and

in  other countries of the world, for advisory  work

of  this  nature to be entrusted to a unit  entirely

independent  of the ordinary executive  departments,

and it is that precedent which we seek to follow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Advisory Unit is to be attached for

the  present to my office, but it is my hope, as our

constitution  develops, that some other  arrangement

will  be  found preferable, and I have in  mind  its

attachment to the future Minister for Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Economic Advisory Unit will be

advisers  of  all Ministers concerned with  economic

policy,  and  it is proposed that this  Unit  should

work  to  a Ministerial sub-committee of the Council

of  Ministers on economic matters. To assist in  the

preparation  of subject for discussion and  decision

by  Ministers,  a  Committee of officials  from  the

principal  interested  departments  is  also   being

formed. The Economic Advisory Unit itself will  have

no  powers of executive authority or control, but it

will   work   in   closest  contact  with   existing

departments, and it is the intention that it  should

be kept small in size and should make maximum use of

the  statistical and other technical  facilities  of

existing departments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the matters which we expect the Economic

Advisory Unit to examine in the immediate future are

the  various  recommendations of  the  International

Bank Mission, including the details of the proposals

for  the  Central Bank, whose establishment  we  are

very anxious to expedite, Sir; the establishment  of

an Industrial Development Corporation; the formation

of  a  long-term  development programme;  the  broad

nature of future budgetary policy, and measures  for

the   establishment   of   minimum   standards    of

livelihood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our intention that the Unit should keep in

close  touch  with  those  concerned  with  economic

policy in the Federation.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>Standing Order on Press</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, to come to more domestic matters: I have

to inform hon. Members, who probably are aware of it

from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>



the newspapers, that I have received a telegram from

the Commonwealth Press Association, when it held its

conference in Canberra, which reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I AM ASKED TO INFORM YOU OF FOLLOWING RESOLUTION

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was signed, Sir, by "H. E. Turner, Secretary",

to which I replied:

MEANWHILE I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>



<br>REGRET YOU SHOULD HAVE ATTACKED SINGAPORE WITHOUT CHECKING EASILY ASCERTAINABLE FACTS".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have since then received representations

from the Singapore Union of Journalists, and with

your permission, Sir, since this affects the

House, I shall read the memorandum they submitted:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have called upon you on behalf of the

Journalists  of Singapore to ask your good  offices

in  seeking  the repeal of the order  that  confers

upon the Speaker the arbitrary right to issue cards

for  admittance  to the Assembly  hearings  and  to

withdraw  them from individual working  journalists

for  what  he  judges to be an  unfair  report.  In

return  we offer the co-operation of this Union  in

drawing  up any clause replacing it to ensure  fair

reporting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Union is non-political. We certainly do not

intend to make party capital out of this issue.  We

are  always ready and willing to co-operate  freely

to  our  best  ability in maintaining the  friendly

relations  between  Press and Parliament  that  are

essential  in a free Democracy. We would point  out

that  this  Union raised the matter in August  last

when  the  order was first published and asked  Mr

Speaker to receive a delegation which he could  not

see his way to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We ask for the repeal of this clause for three reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I. No such powers exist in the Imperial Parliament

at  Westminster where the Speaker is an elected

Member,  equivalent  to  those  conferred  upon  the

Speaker here who is not elected by the Assembly.  We

would  point  out that the Assemblymen are  elected,

that  the Speaker is their servant but has not  been

elected.  Thus an official who cannot  claim  to  be

representative is given arbitrary powers to bar  the

Press from the democratic assembly. This seems to us

worthy of Alice in Wonderland.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II. As framed the clause is in our eyes

utterly  unfair. The reporter is a  servant  of  his

newspaper.  What  he  writes may  be  and  often  is

altered and presented in a way he cannot control. We

strongly urge that if anyone be penalised it  should

be  the editor or publisher and that their remedy is

against  the  reporter  as in  cases  of  libel  and

slander. It might be interpreted in fact as fear  to

attack the powerful and victimise the weak."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, he meant remedy is against the proprietor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"III. We find no precedent for such powers of

judging  what is fair and unfair vested in  one  man

anywhere  in  the  Commonwealth  save  in  its  most

politically  backward  dependencies,  in   fact   in

territories  where  there  is  no  Trade  Union   of

Journalists  to  fight the cause of Freedom  of  the

Press.  As  to Ceylon we believe that you have  been

misinformed, Mr Chief Minister. Even were  you  not

we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>



would point out that Ceylon is a country where  the

working Journalist is deprived of the protection of

a  Trade  Union  so that we are the most  surprised

that   it  should  precisely  have  been  a  Ceylon

publicist  who  raised at Melbourne  the  Issue  of

Press  Freedom  on information derived  solely  and

entirely  from  the  organ  of  a  Trade  Union  of Journalists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally Mr Chief Minister we feel that a joint

statement  on  future intentions from yourself  and

from  this Union be issued to the world and to  the

local Press to calm the apprehension that has  been

aroused.   We   would  urge  upon   you   sir   the

desirability  of handling the whole matter  through

this Union representative of all the newspapers  in

every language group in Singapore...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the suggestion that I was

misinformed as to the Standing Orders of Ceylon,  I

sought  the assistance of the Clerk of the Assembly

and  have obtained, through him, from the Clerk  of

the  Ceylon  Parliament a telegram indicating  that

Standing  Order 19 (3) of Ceylon is still operative

and  has  been  in  force  for  many,  many  years.

Standing Order 19 (3) of Ceylon reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Speaker may grant a general permission to the

representative or representatives of  any  journal

to attend the sitting of the House. Such permission

may  be revoked it the journal publish a report  of

the   proceedings   which  Mr  Speaker   considers

unfair".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Sir, is very similar to the provisions we

have.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, in fairness, Sir, we should give a little

publicity to the actual facts. These Standing Orders

of  ours  were  adapted by a Clerk of the  House  of

Commons  from  a model constitution evolved  by  the

House  of Common authorities, and they were  brought

into  force  on the 14th of April by His  Excellency

the  Governor  under  his powers  conferred  by  the

Singapore  Colony Order in Council. The  Council  of

Ministers   themselves  were  consulted.   We   were

naturally  in a great hurry at that time. We  wished

to hold an early sitting of this Assembly and, apart

from  making a few alterations, the Standing  Orders

were  accepted. But, I think the House will remember

that  on the 29th of June this year, I informed  the

House  that  the  Standing Orders  were  not  wholly

adequate,  and  on my motion the House  appointed  a

Select  Committee to make a comprehensive review  of

all  Standing Orders. In fairness to this  Assembly,

Sir,  it  has not had an opportunity yet to  examine

the Standing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>



Orders,  or to take any decisions upon them, because

the  Select  Committee which  it  has  appointed  to

investigate the matter has not yet made a report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You, Sir, as in duty bound, if I may respectfully

say so, in pursuance of the requirements of Standing

Order  75, made Rule 12 about the admission  of  the

Press, and this is a matter which has passed without

comment  for many decades now, not only in Singapore

but in other parts of the world; and it is more than

a  little  unreasonable that there should have  been

that attack, both upon Singapore and on you, Sir, as

a  result  of  Rule  12 which  seems  to  have  been

misconstrued.  But  in view of  the  nature  of  the

representations received, particularly those of  the

Singapore Union of Journalists, I have sent them  to

the Select Committee, and I trust that they will  be

considered  against  the  background  of   our   own

inherent  powers to refuse admission  to  strangers,

and   also  our  powers  and  privileges  under  the

Ordinance which has now become law in this  country,

It  may  well be found by the Select Committee  that

Standing Order 75 is really tautologous, but that is

a  matter which must be left to the Select Committee

to report to this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One final matter on this, Sir. There was an

unfortunate  attack  on you in  a  local  newspaper,

issue  of  the  11th of November. After consultation

with the leaders of all Parties in this Assembly,  I

spoke  to the editor and I am happy to report,  Sir,

that  he  saw the point immediately and wrote  me  a

letter which I should like to read out to you.  This

paper is the Singapore Tiger Standard, dated 17th of

November:



<br><br>"Dear Mr Marshall,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learnt with regret from you this morning that

the  Speaker  of  the Assembly was perturbed  by  an

article  appearing  in  my  paper  of  the  11th  of

November  under the heading "The News As It  Strikes

Me".  I  have perused this article in the  light  of

your  comments, and I would like to assure you  that

there  was  no  intention whatsoever of  malevolence

against the Speaker or your Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like you to express to the Speaker and to

the Assembly my sincere regrets and that of my paper

if the said article has caused any distress."

<div align="center"><b>APPROPRIATION BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned debate - [9th November]:



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I had hoped that the secondary armament  would

be  fired at a later date, but with all this rushing

to  speak, I might as well get started. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  should like to state that, in view  of  the

increasing   heterogeneity   of   Parties   on   the

Opposition side, such opinions as I would voice  now

are  free of the influence of any party politics and

I am expressing no views but my own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a banker, I have made it my business in

the   past   to  try  to  understand  something   of

government  finance, and I found little to  surprise

me   in   the  speech  of  the  Hon. the  Financial

Secretary,  which  though  it  emphasised  that  the

Colony's   financial   position   was   sound,   was

nevertheless something of a jeremiad.  This  is,  of

course,   in   the  best  tradition   of   Financial

Secretaries, and the present incumbent is as jealous

a  watchdog  of government finance as  any  we  have

seen.  His predecessor uttered grave warnings  about

the  necessity  for cutting down on  expenditure  in

Government  departments, and  I  trust  the  present

Government will make every effort to live within its

means. Certainly from the number of amendments  that

appear  in the Estimates, it would appear  that  the

Opposition   is  going  to  try  to   persuade   the

Government into this way of thinking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the figures given on pages 10 and 11 of the

Sessional  Paper  No. Cmd. 28 of 1955  of  "Personal

Emoluments"  and "Other Charges Annually  Recurrent"

for  Education, Medical and Social Welfare, the rise

is steep enough in all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>



consciousness. Yet the Sessional Paper  states  that

during  the  next  five years expenditure  on  those

services  is expected to increase with even  greater

rapidity.  This point was given further  elucidation

by  the  Hon. the Financial Secretary in his speech,

and  it  appears  that even after allowing  for  the

streamlining of the Government machine as  a  whole,

we  shall be faced, on the present basis of revenue,

with  an annual deficit in the region of $40 million

in  five  years' time. Now this is indeed a sobering

thought and however unpalatable it may be, it  seems

obvious  that  increased taxation is both  necessary

and   inevitable.  I  do  sincerely  hope  that  the

attitude  of all right-thinking citizens will  be  a

sympathetic one towards Government in its problem - a

difficult  problem  indeed - with  the  gulf   between

revenue  and expenditure already wide and likely  to

widen  further as the years pass. The problem indeed

seems  almost  to  be  insoluble.  That  more  money

annually  must  be spent on education,  health,  and

social welfare goes without saying, and someone must

foot  the  bill. Nevertheless, care must  surely  be

taken  to see that we do not interfere with business

as a whole, and that capital is not scared away from

the Colony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I trust the House will take heed of the Financial

Secretary's warning that the greatest care  must  be

taken not to let the Colony's reserves run too  low,

and  note his observation that the market for  local

loans  is not unlimited in capacity. The market  for

local  loans is indeed the very reverse of unlimited

in capacity. There have been occasions recently when

the  City Council have tried to raise money in local

loans,  and had it not been for a substantial demand

by  the  Central  Provident Fund of  the  Federation

Government, the loans would have met with very  poor

success  indeed. Now, one of the reasons  for  this,

Sir - I  could give many - is that there just is  not  a

great  deal  of money around seeking this particular

type of investment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 970</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, one of the most interesting things about

the  Hon. the Financial Secretary's speech  was  the

uninhibited  way in which he told us of the  various

proposals  for  increased  taxation  that  had  been

considered and rejected. We also know, at  least  to

some  extent, what we may expect in the future.  One

would  expect a Government, Socialist in background,

to  introduce increased taxation on the upper income

group.  I  do  not  quarrel with  the  principle  of

placing  the burden of taxation on the shoulders  of

those  who  are best able to bear it, but no  effort

should  be spared to increase the efficiency of  the

Income  Tax  Department to make certain  that  those

people who are capable of paying it do pay it.  That

there  is tax evasion on a large scale seems  highly

probable.  I  certainly have heard  plenty  of  talk

about it in Singapore over the last five years.  The

curious  thing,  Mr Speaker, is how people's  moral

standards  change when it comes to paying Government

its  just  dues. I know quite decent people - you  can

call  them  businessmen - who  would  shudder  at  the

thought  of  dishonouring a  business  contract  but

would  do  almost anything and go to any lengths  to

evade  paying  their tax. All is fair apparently  in

love,  war and dodging income tax! And we all  know,

Sir,  the type of person, usually female, who boasts

of  having diddled the Customs! While it is good  to

learn  that  proposals  for  joint  action  by   the

Governments  of  Singapore and the Federation  "were

discussed  with  cordiality  and  understanding" - the

phrase  used - at Kuala Lumpur, it is noteworthy  that

the   Federation  Government  effectively  threw   a

spanner  in the works. In this way, we may  see  the

shape  of things to come. I accept unreservedly  the

Financial  Secretary's  explanation  of  why  common

action  in  respect  of income tax  is  regarded  as

essential, but I trust that we are not going  to  be

ruled from Kuala Lumpur.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, it is only natural that one should feel

relieved  that  the  Budget  proposals  contain   no

provision  for increase of income tax, but  that  is

merely a brief respite, as the Financial Se-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>



cretary  has been at pains to make clear. I have  no

complaints about the indirect taxes that  have  been

imposed, but I must confess to being astonished that

tobacco  has  escaped. To pass  up  $19  million  of

revenue,   or   potential  revenue,  when   one   is

scratching  around  for means  of  meeting  a  hefty

deficit  is,  to  my  mind, quite  incomprehensible.

There is, to me, something distinctly humorous about

the   pomposity  of  the  phrase  "the  Council   of

Ministers had in mind that intoxicating liquor  was,

in  fact, a luxury. It could not, by any stretch  of

the imagination, be called a necessity." Well, there

are  some  who  would disagree with the  Council  of

Ministers!  Now, Sir, I have all the  vices - I  drink

whisky,  I smoke cigarettes and - I sing in  my  bath!

But I am as firmly of the opinion as the Council  of

Ministers is about liquor (why gin escaped, I do not

know!) that cigarettes can, in no circumstances,  be

called  a  necessity. In the United Kingdom  smokers

have to pay heavily for the habit, and I do not  see

why  the  man-in-the-street in Singapore should  not

pay a little and help to shoulder the burden by this

simple method of indirect taxation. I do not seek an

elaboration of Government's brief statement - "It  has

been  decided  that it would be undesirable  at  the

present  time  to increase the tax on cigarettes  by

even  a small amount." I can guess what is in  their

minds, and I can only regard their attitude in  this

respect as timorous.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Hon. the Financial Secretary has informed us  in

his Budget speech that the expenditure for 1956 will

exceed the revenue and that the deficit next year is

going  to  be real. This kind of warning from  those

who  prepared previous Budgets has always  been  too

often  repeated, and naturally enough we would  like

to  give the warning the discount it deserves.  Even

then, no matter whichever way our belief is going to

be,  the  fact  that we have to  face  now  is  that

indirect  taxation  in a number of  commodities  has

increased. We will have to work from the angle  that

we have just a limited income and how best to spend



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>



it  in  the interests of the majority of the people.

To  achieve this aim, we must remember that although

there  are  many claims for development  in  various

directions and from many parts of Singapore, we must

sort  out  what is the most important and what  will

give  benefit  to  most  people,  in  preference  to

schemes  that  will  serve an  exclusive  number  of

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, if we were to decide whether there

should  be lighting for a place like Goodwood  Hill,

where  the  people  travel in  large  and  beautiful

cars - they  do  not,  most  of  them,  walk  late  at

night - or  lighting for Serangoon Gardens, where  the

population is denser and more people travel on  foot

and   bicycles,  then  I  think  we  will  have   no

hesitation  in  saying that the latter  category  is

more  deserving. Of course, money in that  direction

would  have to be voted to the Rural Board. This  is

just like making a decision with a limited amount of

money, whether we should buy cosmetics for our  girl

or  buy  a pair of specs for the shortsighted  one!

You  will always come to the right decision, and not

throw  your money on luxuries. Now, I always believe

that  schemes like lighting of Goodwood Hill is  one

that can wait and must wait, and that any money that

we can make use of must be diverted to other schemes

that are more important and urgent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again it will not be out of place here to mention

that,  in  an  austerity  programme,  those  in  the

Government should set a good example in the need for

economy.  From  the  Budget you will  see  that  the

Ministers amongst themselves have appropriated  sums

ranging  from  $2,000  to $10,000  as  entertainment

allowances.  Drinking  champagne  and  having  satay

parties  are  part  of  the necessary  functions  of

Ministers, but at a time when there is going to be a

deficit  in the Budget and the whole city is fraught

with  strikes and unemployment, the cutting down  of

such parties to a minimum would not be a bad idea. I

would  rather  say  that  a few  Aspros,  which  are

cheaper, might be more helpful in bringing  about  a

more prosperous and peaceful Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a Labour Front Coalition Government, and we

are  constantly reminded that it will carry  out  its

Socialist  programme.  It  has  promised  the  people

interest-free loans for those who want to build their

own  houses. As one who might like to take  advantage

of  such  an  offer, I looked diligently through  the

pages  of the Budget, but, alas, the long hoped-for

Government  interest-free loan was not there.  I  was

disappointed.  That  hope,  raised  so  high  by  the

Government, crashed. However, this is not only a  bad

omission,  but  there are other events which  smashed

that  crashed  hope  to  smithereens.  The  Hon. the

Financial  Secretary has had a word of congratulation

for the Rural Board for raising more revenue. Let  me

acquaint  the House of one method of achieving  this.

Recently  I  have received many representations  from

clerks  working in the Government, the  City  Council

and  the  Services,  who  happen  to  own  houses  in

Serangoon  Garden Estate. They do not  get  interest-free  loans,  but they have to pay interest,  and  it

will  take them about 15 years to repay the loans  by

monthly  instalments, and yet  the  Rural  Board  has

deemed  fit  to  exact  a higher  tax  from  them  by

increasing  the  annual value of  their  houses.  The

ground  for  such increases seems to be  that  a  few

houses  were let out to Service personnel  at  higher

rentals. Owner residents protested to the Board,  but

their pleas were ignored. It seems to me that in that

locality the innocent must be punished together  with

the  guilty. It is important that wage earners should

be  encouraged to own land and houses,  but  if  they

reckon  that they have to pay more in the way of  tax

when  living in their own houses than the rents which

they  paid  for their old pre-war houses, then  where

does the encouragement come from? Your slums will  be

harder  to  clear up, and, of course, there  will  be

more  savings  for the Public Works Department.  That

probably   will  suit  the  Government  in  providing

excuses for holding up further development plans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tune that is being played now is "no money", and

playing that tune you might as well go the whole  hog

and examine how this tallies with the Budget.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>



If  you  refer to the Head: Minister of  Health,  you

will  discover that large sums of money are  allotted

for  the  purposes  of alterations of  hospitals.  We

would  like  to ask just one question on  this.  Will

such  alterations mean a gain in the  number  of  bed

space  in the hospitals? As far as I am aware  today,

there have been no such increases in the past, and  I

do  not  expect any increase in the future.  Instead,

you  will probably find that the ward is just changed

into another shape, and air-conditioning included  in

certain parts of the ward -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Wholly erroneous.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I say here that the people of

Singapore  are not fastidious. The masses  here  have

endured the heat from time immemorial and they prefer

such  heat to artificial cooling. In all probability,

they  would suffer from the discomfort of cold,  just

as  I  often  do  in  this Assembly,  which  is  air-conditioned! The first essential of a hospital is  to

cure,  and it is highly preferable that the money  to

be  used for alterations should be utilised to  build

new  district hospitals. The sum involved in this instance is in the region of about $2 million, with  no

increase in bed space. That money, I should  say,  is

just  wasted. Talking about district hospitals, you

will  have  one going to be built next  year  with  a

token of $10. Nothing concrete in that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now talking again of savings on expenditure,

Government  should always make it their business  to

see  that whenever appointments are made, they should

be absolutely necessary. I quote you another instance

under  the Head: Ministry of Health. It would appear,

I think, that seven Radiologists are to be appointed.

At  present you have two. But that hospital has  only

one General Duty Medical Officer. The other posts are

still  not  filled and you are voting money  for  new

posts. Why is that necessary? I always think that in

any  set-up - take the case of the Police - if  you  have

six  constables, then you have one corporal.  If  you

have  so many corporals, then you have one inspector,

but  you cannot have seven inspectors and one  lance-corporal.  They  do  not need so many  inspectors  to

control one lance-corporal.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me now turn to the Ministry of Education. As

a  school-master  I am drowned daily  by  pleas  from

parents  wanting  to  get their  children  places  in

schools, primary as well as secondary. It is  obvious

that Singapore wants more schools - primary as well  as

secondary.  They  want more vernacular  schools,  and

they   want  more  trade  schools.  Now  it  is   the

Government's  responsibility,  in  drawing   up   the

Budget, to see that this important aspect of work  is

tackled. The general level of education of the masses

in this country must be raised, and I should say that

the  greatest  treasure that a  nation  can  possess,

especially one like us that is striving towards self-government and independence, must be to create a very

high percentage of well-educated people. Secondary as

well as higher education is what we must have if  our

dreams for early Malayanisation of the services is to

be  realised.  More schools, more technical  schools,

schemes and assistance for training within industries

are  lines  which  should  be  adopted  as  insurance

schemes against future unemployment. But what  do  we

find  in  the  Budget?  No  provision  for  secondary

schools in 1956. That is a very grave omission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the direction of social services, what do we

find after all the shouting by Government at the  top

of  the roof? Do they do a little more for the under-privileged?   We   find  that  the  present   elected

Government  is even worse than the previous  colonial

Government. Whereas a colonial Government had between

1954 and 1955 increased its social service assistance

by  50  per cent to youth organisations - and, in  this

instance,  it  means  the  boys'  and  girls'   clubs

catering   for  the  under-privileged   children   of

Singapore - the  present Government is happy  with  the

figure  for 1955, ignoring completely the  fact  that

the  number of clubs catering for such youth is about

treble.  It is very well to sit in an air-conditioned

room  and  claim yourself to be a Socialist  fighting

for  the uplift of the under-privileged and the down-trodden,  but I would rather invite you to  come  out

and  work  amongst  them. I am the President  of  the

Federation of Boys Clubs, and I voice the dis-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>



satisfaction of 40 times 400 youths of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On community centres, we are promised another three

at  a  cost  of  a  token $10. I know what  community

centres are. I work in them, take a very active  part

in   them,  but  I  believe  that  it  will  be  more

beneficial to support communities, to help them build

their  own centres,- assisting them with sums  ranging

probably  from  $10,000 to $20,000,  rather  than  to

build one that will cost $150,000, if it were built.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if care had been exercised in the matter of

expenditure, I believe that there would not have been

the  necessity of additional taxation. At present the

Government is not only imposing new taxes on  liquor,

petrol  and  estate duty, but it is also holding  the

threat  of  further taxation over the  heads  of  the

citizens of Singapore. I do not know what tactic this

is.  Is  it  to  give  a boost to traders  in  luxury

commodities by telling them what items will  probably

be  taxed in the middle of next year or somewhere  in

between?  If  it  is, then it has produced  excellent

results.  I  am  personally  aware  of  many   sudden

decisions to acquire new cars, new radios and so  on.

If  this  information is to assist the  gathering  of

more  revenue later on, then I must say, from what  I

have  already mentioned before, that it has  received

its  first  setback.  However, coming  back  to  this

uncertain  tax problem, it will definitely  create  a

rather unstable state of affairs in the local market,

and probably it will lead to hoarding and placing  of

unnecessary orders on luxury lines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of taxation on petrol, I must point

out  to  the Government that this commodity  is  used

directly  by  the  owners of cars  and  lorries,  and

indirectly  paid  for  by the public  who  travel  in

vehicles  using petrol, or farmers hiring lorries  to

cart their feedstuffs back to their farms. Now if the

fare and the cost of hire of lorries are going to  be

increased  because of the increase of tax on  petrol,

then this form of taxation will not he placed on  the

shoulders  of those who can best bear it.  Well,  you

have initiated this move. I would welcome assurances -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please, Mr Lim Choon Mong. I

have  not initiated the move. You are addressing your

remarks to me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> The Government have. May I

correct that? I welcome assurances that steps will be

taken  to  protect the common masses  from  increased

fares and cost of hire. After all, if the fare is  to

be  increased by five cents, it may mean very  little

to  you.  It  may mean very little to me.  But  to  a

person  who  is  earning $100 a month,  it  may  mean

either  cake money or no cake money to his child  for

that  day.  Whichever way you look  at  it,  indirect

taxation  will affect the poor man to  a  greater  or

lesser  extent. I do not say that there  must  be  no

taxation,  but  I  would  rather  advocate  increased

personal  income tax - and do it as fast  as  you  can.

That will be the best method.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, after speaking along these lines and looking

through the Budget carefully, I think that it needs a

lot of improvement - a great deal more.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> What?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Pruning of expenditure!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> What?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> More money for development

schemes that will be beneficial to the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Sir, to me the most

disconcerting  fact  emerging  from  the   Hon. the

Financial  Secretary's disclosure  of  the  estimated

Assets  and Liabilities is that we are faced  with  a

possibility of a capital loss to the extent of  $10.6

millions in the event of our realising the investment

representing  the  Special  Reserve  Fund  of  $106.6

millions. The depreciation in the value of the  long-term  securities  in which the moneys  are  invested,

amount to more than ten per cent of the actual  cost,

and  Sessional  Paper No. Cmd. 28 of  1955  does  not

indicate   the   extent  to  which  other   long-term

securities have fallen in value. I am sure, Sir, that

we  have learnt a costly lesson in allowing our hard-earned and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>



much needed surpluses to be invested abroad while  we

suffer the reputation of a capital-hungry country  in

other  parts  of  the  world. I  believe,  Sir,  that

Government  should set an example in  the  future  by

allowing its surpluses, temporary or otherwise, to be

invested in this, and this country only. Government's

need  in  this connection is of paramount importance.

It  is a matter for regret and deep concern that more

than 45 per cent of the assets of the banks operating

locally  are  invested abroad - I am quoting  from  the

report  of the International Bank Mission - and a  good

number  of institutional investors, such as insurance

companies,  still  continue to invest  a  substantial

proportion of their assets in foreign countries.  The

outward  look  approach of the Government  should  be

changed   to  one  of  inward  look  in  matters   of

disposition of investible funds. Only then  could  we

place  ourselves  in  a position  to  appeal  to  the

private  sector of our economy to act in the national

interests in these matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, considering the future prospects of surpluses

in our budgetary operations, it seems to me that they

are  unlikely to be of such a magnitude as to  create

inflationary tendencies if they are invested  locally

by  means of short-term deposits in our local banking

institutions. No doubt the management of Government's

monetary affairs will be greatly facilitated  by  the

proposed  Central Bank when it comes into  operation,

but  until  this happens, wiser management  would  be

necessary.  The  time  has  come,  Sir,  to  consider

realising some of our external investments for social

development,  such  as housing,  and  for  Government

partnership in local industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I deplore the inordinate delay in presenting

the  accounts  of the Colony for the  year  1954  for

scrutiny  by  the Public Accounts Committee.  Members

are  therefore  precluded  from  making  constructive

comments on the Budget before the House, and they are

unable to say whether value has been obtained for the

money  voted  in  the  past  for  expenditure.  I  am

wondering,  Sir, if the Hon. the Financial  Secretary

could  say  when  these  audited  accounts  will   be

presented  to  the  Public  Accounts  Committee   for

scrutiny.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, again it is a matter of great concern that

there  was a significant fall in the amount of  yield

from direct taxation in 1954. There is no doubt that,

in  the  absence of supporting data, the  fall  could

have  been attributed wholly to diminution in company

profits.  It  would be enlightening if the  Hon. the

Financial   Secretary   could   produce,   for    the

information  of  this House, the numbers  of  various

classes  of tax-payers - individuals, partnerships  and

companies - who  paid tax in 1954 and 1955,  so  as  to

indicate the rate of growth in the different  classes

of  tax-payers, and variations in the size  of  their

incomes. The question of formulating a common  policy

with  the  Federation is indeed very welcome.  It  is

hoped  that the two Governments will be able to reach

a  final agreement favourable to the mutual interests

of both territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also very much concerned about the

question of housing our population. Time and again we

have  been told that the Singapore Improvement  Trust

will  offer  houses at a low rental rate.  These  low

rentals  happen to be about $25 to $30 a  month,  and

this,  together  with the lighting, water  and  other

services,  would  go up to such an  extent  that  the

ordinary man, who receives a salary of $100 to $150 a

month,  could  hardly pay such rates.  We  have  been

assured,  Sir,  very recently that  the  question  of

lowering  housing  rentals is  receiving  the  active

consideration of the Government. But I see  there  is

little that the Government could do with its existing

fiscal  policy. Rents are still not within the paying

capacity of the working class.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would commend the following suggestions for

the  Government's consideration, as I  feel  that  no

other  method  could bring down the  rents  of  those

houses built by the Singapore Improvement Trust.  The

first  is  interest-free loans, and  I  am  sure,  as

Government has promised it, money will be forthcoming

interest-free  for  building  accommodation  for  the

working class.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, apart from this, I would also suggest a direct

subsidy   from  Government  sources  to  the  housing

authority. The City Council of Singapore have so far



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>



said  or implied that they have no obligation at  all

towards the housing of Singapore's citizens. This  is

very  obvious indeed, and even the other day the Hon.

the  Minister for Housing turned down the  suggestion

that  the  assessment rates on S.I.T. buildings  and

land  should  be waived by the City Council.  Sir,  I

think we are all aware of the fact that outside  this

territory,  in  places like the  United  Kingdom  and

elsewhere,  the  housing authority grants  loans  for

building houses and also gives a separate subsidy  on

houses  built  by  the  local  authorities.  I  would

suggest, Sir, that either the City Council waive  the

assessment  rates on S.I.T. land and houses,  or  get

them  to  pay as contribution towards the housing  of

the citizens an amount equal to the assessment rates,

or even more if they are in a position to pay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, having known a little bit of difficulty

in  the  S.I.T.,  I  realise that  if  some  external

assistance were to be given in the matter of housing,

such as the loan of bulldozers and other earth-moving

machines, we could considerably lower the rentals  of

these  houses. I have heard the other  day  that  the

Government  of  the  Federation  have  received  some

bulldozers   and  other  earth-moving  machines   for

agricultural  purposes  from outside  sources.  I  am

wondering,  Sir, whether our Government  cannot  seek

the   assistance  of  the  United  Kingdom  or  other

countries  for  a donation of that kind  towards  the

relieving of our housing problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other matter on which I would like to

touch  in  regard to housing, Sir, and that  is  slum

clearance. I would not like to dwell too much on this

because  I believe that the Government will undertake

slum  clearance at the earliest possible date. I  can

see  that some start has been made and I do hope they

will go on very vigorously with this project.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last grouse that I have about housing is in

regard  to  the  standard of accommodation  of  these

S.I.T. houses.  Sir, all countries usually  adopt  a

standard  accommodation, it  is  sometimes  called  a

national standard. Well, in Singapore today we have a

standard accommodation provided by the S.I.T. and  I

think it is a very bad standard.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>



These  S.I.T. houses are not very well  constructed

and   the   facilities  to  tenants  are  far   from

satisfactory.  There is very little room  for  baths

and  lavatories  and  there are  no  facilities  for

dining purposes. This was confirmed by the Hon. the

Minister  for  Housing  the other  day.  Sir,  these

houses are built to last from 20 to 60 years. No one

can  deny that. The standard of living of the people

of  Singapore during the coming five to eight  years

would  be  so high that, after that period,  tenants

who  live in those houses which have no dining rooms

would  feel  rather out of place. Also  during  that

period,   private   development  will   take   place

resulting in an increased number of houses, and I am

sure the consequence will be that these tenants will

try  to  vacate these S.I.T. houses at the  earliest

possible date -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Let us hope so!



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> - and that is the time the Government will

regret  that  they  have made a very  bad  start  on

housing accommodation. Sir, I suggest that we cannot

sacrifice  quality for quantity. Whatever  we  have,

give it! Let the people live satisfactorily!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I would like to dwell on is rural

development.  Sir,  ever since  I  got  on  to  this

Council in 1952, I have been stressing this question

of rural development very hard indeed. At one time I

was told that there was no need for any development.

There was no need for any particular person or  body

to look into this matter, because there was one body

called  the  Rural Board which should undertake  all

rural development. And what is the result today? The

Rural Board has been unable to provide the amenities

which  the  rural people should get.  There  are  no

playing  fields  in the rural areas.  There  are  no

libraries in the rural areas. There is not even  the

barest  minimum  requirement in the rural  areas  as

compared  to  the  city. Unemployment  is  mounting.

Normally,  unemployment is not a big grouse  in  the

rural  areas, because even those who have employment

are under-employed. They have no gainful employment,

and I have not seen so far any Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>



measure  being  adopted to relieve  under-employment

and unemployment in the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education in rural areas: Sir, the reason for my

pointing out all these things is because I feel that

development  in  the rural areas should  be  treated

quite   separately  from  development  within   city

limits,  because in rural areas the  conditions  are

quite  different. I suggest, Sir, that in regard  to

education in rural areas there is no need  to  spend

much  money  on schools. We should devise  a  scheme

whereby  we  build  village  schools - which  are  the

cheapest  schools to build - and that,  too,  in  good

number  to satisfy the requirements of the locality.

The costs that have been shown in the Estimates,  in

my view, are very high indeed. I do not think that a

primary  school which can accommodate  400  children

should cost $50,000. Village schools can be built at

much less cost than that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, adult education in Singapore to a certain

extent  has been decentralised. I should think  that

more  energy  should be put into  this  question  of

setting  up more adult education centres to  satisfy

the requirements of the rural community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was the day before yesterday, I think,

that  I read in one of the newspapers, the Singapore

Standard, an article to the effect that Singapore is

going  to  have  a new library, and that  is  to  be

located at Stamford Road. Sir, I have often wondered

why  the  Government is so keen on centralising  all

these amenities in the centre of the city. Cannot we

have  some  libraries in areas  like  Katong,  Pasir

Panjang  or  any other places? Should we concentrate

all  the learning and knowledge of this Colony  into

this  one part of the city? I should think  this  is

very  wrong.  We should as far as possible  give  an

opportunity  to people to make use of  this  library

nearer  to  their  homes.  If  the  answer  to  this

question  is  that  Government  are  having  a   few

travelling libraries, I do not think, Sir,  that  it

is  a  very  good  suggestion at all.  A  travelling

library is most unsatisfactory.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>



Government  may say that something  is  better

than  nothing. But let us not treat a  library

in  this way. Let us have it established where

it  is  desirable and necessary.  Let  us  not

concentrate it in one part of the city.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roads in the rural areas today are a

most unsatisfactory form of communication  and

mode of travelling. In very many parts of  the

rural  areas you have only one main road,  and

the  farmers and the agriculturists, who  have

to  make use of lorries and other vehicles for

the  purpose  of  conveying their  fodder  and

other   things,  are  undergoing  considerable

difficulty.  I am not unmindful  of  the  fact

that  this costs a big sum of money, but I  do

suggest   that  in  order  to  overcome   this

difficulty, consideration should be  given  to

setting  up a road authority, or some kind  of

authority, to speed up road work in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, land and housing is another important

problem in the rural areas. I can only say for

certain  in  regard to conditions  in  my  own

constituency. 90 per cent of the population in

my  constituency are living on other  people's

land. This does not mean that all people  have

land   in  other  areas,  but  the  need   for

stressing  this point is because of  the  fact

that,  due to gradual development in the rural

areas,  many  of  these attap-hut  owners  are

receiving notices to quit their places and  go

to  other areas. If that comes about, it means

that  they will be deprived not only of  their

huts but the piece of land which was given  to

them on payment of monthly rents. They are put

in a position where they can obtain no land in

the  vicinity.  The only alternative  is  that

they  will  have  to shift  to  various  other

places  which will in turn inconvenience  them

in very many ways.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to housing, particularly in the

rural  areas, I can see no evidence  that  the

Singapore Improvement Trust has taken it as  a

matter   of  urgency.  It  may  be  that   the

Government might have thought that, since most

commercial firms are in the heart of the  city

and the whole economy is connected to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>



Collyer  Quay,  there  is  little  benefit  in

building  houses in the rural areas. I  should

think  a  separate scheme for  rural  housing,

more  or  less on a semi-permanent  basis,  be

instituted    and   satellite   semi-permanent

structure    buildings    in    villages    be

constructed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all the points that I have dealt with

in  regard  to the rural areas have been  with

one  purpose,  and  that is  because,  at  the

present moment, development in the rural areas

is   slow  and  being  done  piecemeal.   Each

department  thinks of its own requirements  in

each   village  and  there  is   very   little

co-ordination that I can see in these  matters.

The only way, the quickest way, and the surest

way  of getting things done on a planned basis

in  the  rural areas is to establish  a  Rural

Development  Council where all the departments

interested  are represented, with  an  elected

Minister  as  its chairman, and  this  Council

assessing the requirements of the rural areas,

planning  their development and seeing  to  it

that  those  plans  are  implemented.  At  the

moment,  Sir,  due to a lack of  co-ordination

and  due  to the fact that all departments  do

not  think  alike in the rural  areas,  things

have  gone  very unsatisfactorily,  and,  from

experience,  I feel that the only  way  for  a

planned rural development is the creation of a

Rural    Development    Council    and     the

implementation  of  those  schemes   by   that

authority. I am sure that the Commission which

has  been appointed by the Chief Minister will

consider my proposal and see whether it  could

be implemented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have nothing much to say on other

matters, because I feel it is only a matter of

detail.  Many  of  the  items  of  expenditure

inserted  in this Budget are mere figures.  If

the  Ministers are careful enough, and if  the

department heads are careful enough, there  is

always  room  for  curtailing expenditure  and

exercising the utmost economy. I have only one

comment, though, and that is the entertainment

expenses  of the Ministers. Sir, I  feel  that

the  Government has no explanation to give  to

the people of Singapore on this item -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Why?



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> However they may argue and however they

may justify this, the public are unable to understand

this  huge  item put on the Estimates. I  do  believe

that the Ministers themselves will be able to find  a

different  way of asking for entertainment  expenses.

Let   us  have  a  policy  that  the  Ministers  will

entertain guests, and let us also have a policy  that

all  this entertainment will be limited to a  certain

amount  in one month, so that there will be  complete

control of this item of expenditure by the Council of

Ministers.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, listening

to  the  Budget  speech  of the  Hon. the  Financial

Secretary  nearly  a  fortnight ago,  it  was  almost

impossible  not  to  share the gloom  with  which  he

presented his case, not the gloom which he shed  over

the country's financial situation, which is, in fact,

much brighter than he chose to represent it, but  the

growing  gloom  at the missed opportunities  and  the

broken  promises revealed in the Government's  fiscal

policy and in the Estimates of Expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has, of course, been fashionable for many years

for Financial Secretaries to prepare us for the worst

in  one  Budget speech, and in the following year  to

present  a  much brighter picture of that past  year.

But  we  on  this  side had hoped  that  the  elected

Members  of  this new Government would  have  brought

pressure to bear to put an end to this little pastime

and  that  we would have been presented with  a  more

candid   and   realistic  account   of   Government's

intentions. Far from it. My hon. Friend has added  to

the  uncertainties  which have shrouded  the  country

since the Government opposite took office, and in the

most hesitant manner plodded over the whole field  of

possible  taxation undecided where to cast  his  net.

Like   a  butterfly - one  of  those  strange  Scottish

varieties  with hobnailed boots - he flitted  from  one

source of revenue to another, finally coming to  rest

to sip at liquor, petrol and estate duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having stated that he estimated a deficit of $22

millions in 1956 at the old taxation levels, he  then

introduced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>



measures  likely  to  yield  only  $7�  millions   and

commented, "The balance, when its size becomes clear,

will have to be met from reserves or else covered  by

increased  taxation." Sir, the words "when  its  size

becomes  clear"  are  a  dire  confession  that   the

Government's  vision  of  the  financial  future   is

clouded,  myopic and, as I have said,  uncertain  and

that  uncertainty  is  precisely  what  needs  to  be

avoided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are we to think of a fiscal policy and its

effect  on the economy of the country which  says  in

short,  "We  might double the rate of income  tax  or

company  tax during the course of the next year;  or,

of  course,  we might impose a purchase  tax  at  the

point  of import, only we have not made up our  minds

whether  it  will  work;  or  we  might  follow   the

Federation tax on tobacco, but actually we  have  not

the  courage at the moment because it would  lose  us

too  many  votes?" This is not the way to  restore  a

badly  shaken  confidence in the present Government's

ability to govern. This is not the way to hasten  the

flow  of capital into new industries. It is, in fact,

a  complete  negation  of the promise  given  in  His

Excellency  the Governor's speech that  "the  maximum

encouragement  will  be offered  to  both  local  and

overseas investors", and a neglect of what should  be

the  central  objective of the Government's  economic

policy, namely, to expand the national income.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What, in fact, has happened? The Government has

broken  its promises by introducing indirect taxation

which  falls on rich and poor alike. Call  samsu  and

stout  a  luxury if you please, but do not deny  that

these  in  Singapore are largely  the  poor  people's

drinks  and  by  taxing them still further,  you  are

placing a greater burden on the poor man's pocket. In

taxing  liquor,  it  is very much  open  to  question

whether  the  increase in revenue hoped for  will  be

realised and whether diminished consumption will  not

be  the  result. I would remind the House, Sir,  that

the estimated revenue from liquor in 1954 amounted to

$21 millions, but the final amount collected came  to

about $1 million less. In 1955 the revenue is likely,

according to the revised estimates, to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>



rise  again to nearly $21 millions, showing that  the

falling-off in consumption in 1954 has been partially

rectified.  Whether the increase this year  has  been

partly the result of jubilation at the Labour Front's

election victory or the drowning of sorrows  at  this

disastrous event depends on one's point of view,  but

it  seems  hardly a practical move to tax a commodity

the  consumption of which must be close to its  peak,

and  I venture to predict that the Hon. the Financial

Secretary will not obtain the $4� millions extra yield

which  he  is  hoping for. In fact, I  believe  I  am

correct  in saying that the tax had to be reduced  on

still  wines  a year or two ago because of  a  marked

falling-off  in consumption, and that after  the  tax

was  reduced, consumption began to rise. This  is  an

indication  of  the precarious ground  on  which  the

Government is treading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to petrol, while it can be maintained that

an  increase  in tax only affects the car  owner  and

that  this  source  of revenue is still  particularly

buoyant,  nevertheless, it should be remembered  that

60  per  cent of the cars on the island are below  11

horse-power  and are owned by middle  class  people.

Say   what  you  will,  the  imposition  of  indirect

taxation  does  not  place  the  burden  of  taxation

squarely on the shoulders of those best able to  bear

it,  which  the  Government has stated  to  be  their

taxation policy, but in some form or another it  must

affect  the  poorer  classes as  well.  It  is  sheer

wriggling  on  the  part of the Government  to  shift

their  ground from their stated policy and to try  to

obscure  a broken promise by talk of luxuries,  quite

apart from the inconsistency of not taxing cigarettes

or   champagne   which,   I   hardly   suppose,   are

necessities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I leave the revenue side and

consider expenditure, there are at least three points

missing  from  the  Hon. the  Financial  Secretary's

speech  which should have been made, in  my  opinion,

and  regarding  which  we  shall  hope  to  have   an

assurance before the close of this debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, that we shall learn how many millions of

dollars are being lost to the Treasury through income

tax evasion,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>



what practical steps are being taken by Government to

combat it, and what extra revenue vigorous action  of

this sort can be expected to yield in the next year;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, that the Government is fully aware that

the cardinal basis of its economic policy must be the

expansion of the national income, that the Government

will  not wreck any possibility of this expansion  by

being evasive and mysterious as to whether or not  it

is  proposed  to  increase the rates  of  income  tax

during the course of the year if the Federation  will

fall in line;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, that, on the contrary, it will carry out

its  declared policy of encouraging investment,  both

locally  and  from  overseas,  by  such  methods   as

allowing  income  tax  relief's,  both  initial   and

annual,  on  the  cost  of factory  construction  and

initial  plant  and  ensuring that such  construction

goes  ahead  with  the least possible  administrative

delay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only in this way can the Government restore

confidence  to  the country, create conditions  which

will  give buoyancy to our revenues in 1956 and  also

in  1957, and bring hope of work to the growing  army

of  unemployed, on which vital subject the  Financial

Secretary was singularly silent. As long ago as  June

last, the Hon. the Chief Minister informed this House

that  an Industrial Development Corporation was being

set  up,  and  it still seems to be in the  realm  of

consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is indeed a most extraordinary move for the

Government to range over the whole realm of taxation,

stating  not only what can and cannot be  taxed,  but

what  might or might not be taxed in the middle of  a

financial  year,  almost like a  Budget  leakage  six

months  in  advance.  Normal  practice  is  for   the

Government  to  announce its taxation policy  at  the

Budget  session, it being understood that this policy

holds  good  without  alteration for  twelve  months,

unless, of course, some very severe financial  crisis

were  to  haste the country which required  immediate

action.  A  deficit of 15 odd million dollars,  which

may turn out not to be a deficit at all, cannot claim

to  be  a  critical position in view of the country's

reserves. In our view, therefore, it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>



not  only unorthodox finance but undesirable  finance

at  this  stage  to  hint that  there  may  be  extra

taxation in the course of the financial year. Such  a

policy   is  an  encouragement  to  speculators   and

hoarders and reveals that the Government has no  firm

line  of  its  own,  and this lack of  confidence  is

passed on to the country where it gets magnified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If my hon. Friend failed significantly to indicate

what constructive measures the Government proposes to

take to increase the revenue of the country, clouding

the position over with hints of untimely taxation, he

was  equally evasive on the question of economies  in

the  realm  of  expenditure.  It  is  true  that   he

mentioned   that   requests   from   Ministries   and

departments had been pruned by $21 millions as far as

development was concerned. It is true that he  stated

that  all  applications  for  new  appointments  were

examined.  But these are annual events and cannot  be

regarded  as economies. I am mindful of the words  of

the  Hon. the  Chief Minister in his speech  on  His

Excellency  the Governor's Address in April  of  this

year when he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A short acquaintance with Government does seem to

indicate that we are apt in many spheres to live on a

somewhat  extravagant scale, and we  intend  to  take

action  shortly to bring about a realisation  by  the

Departments of the important need for economy."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may have been a careful examination by

Ministers  to  see  whether  a  new  appointment   is

necessary,  but  what  attempt  has  been   made   to

eliminate  waste in materials, or to  lower  building

costs through a re-examination of our standards?  The

Hon. the  Financial Secretary hinted that  something

ought  to  be done about it in the future,  but  this

kind  of vagueness is not what one would expect  from

the Government, which has, after all, been over seven

months   in  office.  That  the  Government  is   not

completely  wholehearted  in  its  desire   to   make

economies  seems  evident  from  the  failure   after

several  months to set up an Estimates  Committee  of

this  House.  Owing  to  the  non-existence  of  this

Committee,  I  hope, Sir that you will permit  me  to

quote  one  example of what I mean  with  the  barest

minimum of figures.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;36 primary schools in Group A of the Education

Development Budget cost $240,000 each to  build,  and

these are almost completed. If I read the Development

Estimates  correctly,  the  Government  is  about  to

launch  on  18 schools in Group B in 1956, and  these

are   calculated  at  cost  $250,000  each,   or   an

additional  $10,000 per school. Has any  effort  been

made by the Minister or the Council of Ministers,  in

the absence of an Estimates Committee, to see whether

perfectly satisfactory primary school buildings could

not  be  completed for, say, $200,000, which  I  have

reason  to  believe is not impossible? If the  S.I.T.

has  been  able  to  construct  apartment  blocks  at

considerably lower costs than was thought possible  a

few  years  ago, why is the same not  being  done  in

respect  of  schools? A saving of  the  type  I  have

indicated would reduce the cost of the 1956  building

programme under this head alone by approximately

$900,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apply this principle to other departments, in

particular to the Medical Department, and within  the

revenue  available,  I  am  convinced  that  we   can

continue  to increase our social services at  a  more

rapid  rate  than  that indicated in  the  Estimates.

Reductions  of  this  nature today,  streamlining  in

personnel and running costs, would give a chance  for

the revenue of the country to increase simultaneously

with  the  growth of the national income, instead  of

being out of step with it, thus making heavy taxation

not  only  a  necessity but also an almost inevitable

boomerang.  But  instead of Ministers devoting  their

attention to this vital matter, what do we  find?  We

find  that  the  Council of Ministers, between  them,

have  been provided in the Estimates with  a  sum  of

$31,800  for entertainment during 1956 and  that  the

six  Elected Ministers are to have provided to  their

own  offices, transport and travelling,  the  sum  of

$28,490.  The  point  is that this  Budget  has  been

dubbed  an  austerity  Budget.  Projects  have   been

abandoned  because  money is not available,  and  yet

over  $60,000  is  to  be  voted  to  Ministers   for

entertainment  and  transport expenses.  To  say  the

least, this is setting an undesirable example. We are

all perfectly prepared to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>



be  reasonable in this matter. Clearly the  Hon. the

Chief Minister must have some entertainment allowance -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Thank you!



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> - but not a very much larger sum -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr C. H. Butterfield)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order. Yes, Mr Butterfield?



<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> On a point of order, Sir. My point

of  order is that the hon. Member is anticipating now

what  is  the subject matter of an order  of  another

day,  and discussing now the entertainment allowances

of Ministers. I am referring to Standing Order 35.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Which part of Standing Order 35, Mr

Butterfield?



<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> The first part, Sir. There are a

number  of  motions of which notice has  been  given,

Sir, relating to the items allowing for entertainment

allowances  and so on, and my submission,  therefore,

is  that  at this stage what the hon. Member says  is

out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Standing Order 35 (1) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It shall be out of order to anticipate an order of

the day by discussion...".



<br><br>The  "Committee of Supply" is not yet an Order of the

Day.  It will become an Order of the Day when  I  ask

the  Financial  Secretary  later  on,  "Committee  of

Supply - what  day?" and he gives his  answer.  At  the

moment,  there is no Order of the Day. Continue,  Mr

Ede.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, I was saying that we consider that the

Hon. the Chief Minister should have an allowance, but

not a very much larger sum than that allocated to His

Excellency the Governor. Equally clearly the Hon. the

Chief  Secretary should have some allowance, but  not

on  the  scale  that has been customary  in  previous

years  now  that he holds, if I may say  so,  a  less

exalted  position. If extravagance of  this  sort  is

permissible  at  the highest levels, one  can  hardly

expect  economies  in the departments  of  government

themselves.  We on this side of the House  very  much

deprecate  the  provision  of  these  perquisites  of

office  and we shall move amendments on each occasion

in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>



Committee of Supply unless the Government agrees to a

very drastic revision of this sum of $60,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must now touch briefly on certain main heads of

expenditure where we disagree with Government  policy

and where, in two cases, we note with regret that the

Government  has  failed entirely  to  carry  out  its

promises.  I  must  refer you to His  Excellency  the

Governor's speech of April last which laid  down  the

policy of Government for the ensuing year:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Community Centre scheme will be developed and

more  facilities  provided  for  the  underprivileged

youths of Singapore."



<br><br>But  what  do we find when we turn to the Development

Estimates?  Token  votes  only  for  three  community

centres,  for youth holiday camps and for a Home  for

Handicapped  Children;  in other  words,  a  complete

failure  to tackle these important projects.  In  the

realm  of  Medical  and  Health  His  Excellency  the

Governor's speech made this promise:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government will expand all medical and health

services,  including  the establishment  of  district

hospitals."



<br><br>I  voiced  our  misgivings regarding the Government's

policy  towards the expansion of the medical services

seven months ago, and it is unfortunately quite clear

that  our fears have been realised. The plan  of  the

previous  Government, which it has  been  fashionable

for  the hon. Members to castigate as the Progressive

Government,  was  to  provide ten cottage  hospitals,

five  in  the urban area and five in the rural  area,

but  this highly desirable scheme has apparently  now

been  abandoned  altogether. Furthermore,  while  the

Minister   for   Health   recently   made   a   Press

announcement that a new $3� million district hospital

was  to be built on the old Kallang Airport site,  he

forgot  to  mention the important fact  that  no  new

provision for it has been made in the 1956 Estimates,

and this project is therefore only a paper one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the general plan of the Government regarding

the  expansion of the medical services? The chief one

would  seem to be the building of a $2 million  urban

health centre, 75 per cent of which will, in fact, be

paid for from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>



Colonial  and Development Welfare Fund. This  is  the

year's  main project, but unfortunately it  will  not

add immediately to the existing medical services,  as

it  is  a  teaching centre and not intended primarily

for  treatment.  For  the rest,  most  of  the  funds

available  are to be spent on altering and  improving

wards   in  existing  hospitals - always  an  expensive

business.   Surely  the  proper  policy - and   it   is

Progressive  Party policy - is to get  on  as  fast  as

possible  with  decentralisation? Surely  the  proper

priority was to allocate sufficient funds to  get  on

with  the  building  of  the new  district  hospital,

leaving the improvements to the General Hospital to a

later date if they still turn out to be necessary? We

are extremely dissatisfied that so little progress is

to  be  made in the direction of decentralisation  of

the  medical  services. So much for the  Government's

efforts in the realm of health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to education, the Government is at least

consistent.  Having  ignored secondary  education  in

toto in His Excellency the Governor's speech, it  has

continued to ignore it in the 1956 Estimates. It  has

given  no new provision for this purpose, but only  a

revote sufficient to meet the building of two schools

which should have been completed this year. This is a

dismal  fact,  in  direct contrast to  the  Hon. the

Minister for Education's statement in this House only

a  fortnight  ago  that  the  six  secondary  schools

provided for in the 1955 Estimates would be built  in

1956,  which  has turned out to be a  somewhat  empty

promise.  Worse still, although a sum of $20 millions

has been set aside, quite rightly, in my opinion, for

grants-in-aid to vernacular schools, there is no sign

in  the  Estimates  of  any recasting  of  the  whole

educational  system  and no reorientation - and  I  use

that  word  deliberately - in plans. We shall  consider

the Government's education programme in detail in the

Committee of Supply and, though I shall say  no  more

today, it seems to me to be most disappointing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to Public Works. Under this head, I will

reserve  most of my comments for the Committee  stage

and refer only to one point. We find that in the Hon.

the Financial Secretary's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>



speech and in the Estimates very little reference  is

made to the question of flood alleviation. The latter

shows  a vote of $123,000 to complete only the  Bedok

scheme, while the former mentioned, in passing,  that

out  of  a  sum of $35 millions which would  probably

have  to  be borrowed in 1956, $5 millions  would  be

needed for flood alleviation, housing loans, etc.  In

the  Sessional  Paper  on the Draft  Estimates  flood

alleviation   was  referred  to  as  a  miscellaneous

commitment.  As I have said, it has been lumped  with

housing  loans and other unspecified items. I submit,

Sir,  that this is not proper budgeting. We  on  this

side  of the House want to know, and the public  want

to  know, what are Government's precise plans in this

important  matter and we are not satisfied  with  its

being  pushed  into a rag-bag of odds  and  ends  and

called a miscellaneous commitment. Nevertheless,  the

fact  that  the  Government does not propose  to  use

vigorous  and  immediate  measures  to  tackle   this

important  problem comes as no surprise, in  view  of

the  recent statement of the Minister in charge  that

flood  alleviation would cost an awful lot  of  money

and   there  was  none  to  spare,  and  anyway   the

exceptional  rains of last year were  being  repeated

only  after  60  or 70 years or so and  could  hardly

happen  again in the immediate future. As far as  the

violence   of  the  monsoon  is  concerned,   it   is

incredibly unwise to place one's faith in the law  of

averages.  As  the development of land  in  Singapore

proceeds  apace, the run-off of rain  water  is  more

rapid  and  as each year passes, smaller and  smaller

storms  of shorter and shorter duration will  produce

the same flood conditions as today, and therefore, of

course,   they   will   recur  more   frequently.   A

shortsighted,  do-nothing policy  regarding  flooding

will not do. As things are at the moment, the farmers

and the vegetable growers are to suffer more frequent

destruction  of  their crops and  the  town  dwellers

consequently are to pay more for their vegetables. If

the  cost  of  living  is to be  kept  down  and  the

devastation  of wide areas of land and  its  valuable

top  soil  be avoided, a comprehensive three-year  or

five-year plan to tackle flood alleviation must start

at once, and the Government must



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>



not shirk its responsibility in this respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, Sir, sum up as briefly as I can what are our

main objections to this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Hon. the Financial Secretary hedged

round  an  unconvincing Budget with reservations  and

contradictions.  On the one hand, he  stated  that  a

deficit  of  $22  millions less $7�  millions  to  be

raised by extra taxation was not a fictitious figure.

On  the other hand, he said "It is possible that,  by

the  middle  of  the year, savings will  have  become

available  because  of the inability  of  the  Public

Works  Department  to make the progress  expected  on

certain major items."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Government has broken its promises by

increasing  indirect  taxation which  does  not  fall

solely on those best able to bear it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, it has hinted at mid-year taxation of

either  a  direct or indirect kind, which  creates  a

lack   of  confidence,  encourages  speculators   and

hoarders  because the types of likely  taxation  have

been  revealed and is totally uncalled for  when  the

country's finances are basically sound.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, it has failed to give an assurance that,

whatever  action  may  be  felt  necessary  regarding

personal tax in the future, company tax will be  left

alone  so  as  to  stimulate  the  expansion  of  the

national income, the starting of new industries,  and

of  giving  the growing army of unemployed  the  hope

that they can look forward to more jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, it has failed to examine the possibility of

lowering  the standards of building, with  particular

reference to the Education and Health departments, so

that  the  funds available can be made to stretch  as

far  as possible, and no Estimates Committee has been

appointed for this purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixthly, funds available have not been in all cases

allotted to priority projects. The Head: Public Works

Non-Recurrent  General  has  been  increased  by   $1

million  over 1955 by items which are not of pressing

importance,   while   entertainment   and   transport

allowances  to  Ministers at $60,000 is  not  a  good

example to set.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 996</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventhly, certain Heads contain huge estimates of

expenditure,   for   example,   $5�  millions   for

acquisition    and   development   of    sites    for

resettlement, and nearly $6� millions  for  purchase

of  land, with no breakdown figures whatever to  show

how these lump sums were arrived at and no indication

that  this intended acquisition or purchase has  been

correlated with the Government building programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, inadequate consideration and provision have

been given to flood alleviation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, therefore, we are not convinced that

the  revenue available is being allocated  so  as  to

stretch  as  far  as  it possibly  can.  We  are  not

satisfied with Government's what-we-might-do-tomorrow

outlook  in place of a firm what-we-shall-definitely-do-today  policy, and we regret that  the  Government

pays  no more than lip service to the principle  that

the  country  can  no  longer  plan  expansion  on  a

champagne basis.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it

would   appear   that  the  Labour  Front   Coalition

Government  has decided not to show its hand  in  the 1956 Budget  to  implement fully  the  socialisation

programmes  which it promised the people  during  the

election.  As  it is, what we had from the  Hon. the

Financial  Secretary on the 9th  of  November  was  a

rehash  of  Budgets  of  previous  years,  with   the

increased  expenditure principally in  the  Education

and  Health services. We wonder whether the  decision

not  to  depart from the tried and proven formula  is

due  to  want  of  courage or want  of  experience - we

suspect it is probably due to both.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is, however, perturbed that, in the first year

of  a  nearly popularly but now reduced to a minority

elected  Government, the fiscal expert for the  first

time  promised  a  deficit  which  he  described  and

emphasised  would  not  turn  out  to  be  a  surplus

eventually as in the preceding years, and he followed

on  and promised bigger and more substantial deficits

in future years. His crystal ball showed a deficit of

$40  millions in the year 1959, and therefore  he  is

now telling the people to tighten their belts and  to

expect more and bigger



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>



taxation  in  all quarters, ranging from  income  and

company  taxes to luxury and purchase taxes, as  well

as  other possible sale tax to be dreamt up  for  the

electorate. The prophet of doom has spoken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I submit, it is for the people to ask Government

what other ways and means it has at their disposal to

increase  national income, other  than  the  levy  of

bigger and higher taxes. One has no need, I hope,  to

remind  Government of the law of diminishing  return.

Sooner  or  later, one will be taxed out of existence

if  Government were to stand still, fold up its  hand

and  expect miracles to happen. The people would feel

much  happier if Government would turn its  attention

to  the curbing of the rising cost of government. The

figure  for  the  civil  service  for  1956  is   $98

millions,  which  is three times  that  of  1949  and

nearly  twice  that of 1952. Ways and means  must  be

found  to  stop this spectacular rise, and efficiency

stepped  up in Government services to save taxpayers'

money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When one examines the Budget in closer detail, it is

obvious that Government may not be very confident  of

its  ability to ferret out tax evaders, as  surely  a

very  small  percentage of the  people  are  actually

paying income tax in full?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the item under Broadcasting, one is aware that up

to  31st  October, 1955, 39,619 radios and radiograms

had  been imported. Against this figure, only  11,285

sets  were exported, leaving a net balance of  28,334

sets  for sale in Singapore only. Yet Government does

not  envisage  any  substantial increase  in  revenue

derived from the sale of radio licences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, in order to find the money to meet the cost

of  social services, the economy of this country must

first expand and prosper, resulting in an increase of

national   income.   Trade  and  industry   must   be

encouraged   to  produce  a  healthy   and   economic

structure  that  will  in  turn  produce  dollars.  A

climate of political stability free from strikes must

be  attained, and that the Government has  failed  to

do.  Instead  of flights of capital,  we  would  have

hoped for influx of capital.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One would be assured of the future of Singapore and

Malaya  if  Government  would  introduce  schemes  to

assist new light and secondary industries. Reasonable

income  tax  concessions for new industries  must  be

introduced.   Industrial  research  and   development

centres under Government auspices should be built  to

help  young  industrial enterprises to  compete  with

foreign  goods.  Government must be ready  to  remove

obstacles  and administrative red tape  in  approving

new  factory  schemes  so  as  to  avoid  unnecessary

delays.  Unless  Government takes the initiative  and

has  a positive approach to the economy of Singapore,

I  am  afraid it will find it more difficult year  by

year  to  produce balanced Budgets, which we know  is

the   first  requisite  of  the  sound  economy   and

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as to its final decision to increase tax on

liquor  and  petrol, the Government shows a  singular

lack   of   consistency.  We  were  told  they   were

frustrated  by  the  Federation  Government  in   the

levying  of  a  direct  tax on income,  and  we  were

further told that they were similarly frustrated when

they considered tax on luxuries. But now we are faced

with the fact that tax will be increased on samsu and

beer -  the  poor  man's  drinks - and  the  rich  man's

champagne,  gin and rum have been left out untouched.

We  were  also told that the Government, for want  of

courage,  did not increase the tax on cigarettes  and

tobacco,  which are hardly necessities, but there  is

now  an  increase  in the tax on petrol  which  is  a

necessity. We were left with no other conclusion than

that this Government has no fixed fiscal policy,  and

we  sympathise with those people who are singled  out

to be penalised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also touch at this time on the expenditure

on  Education.  We note with approval the  fact  that

educational programmes are receiving more  and  prior

attention,    as   evidenced   by   the    increasing

appropriations each year. This is a proper  trend  as

the  education of this country's children is  of  the

first  importance  in the building of  a  democratic,

independent  Malayan  nation. The  emphasis  on  this

cannot   be   over-exaggerated.  We   are,   however,

particularly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>



interested in the proportionate distribution  of  the

funds  for  schools of all communities, as  from  the

appropriations,  one can tell Government's  intention

as  to  the different types of schools. We are deeply

interested  in  the  attitude of  Government  towards

Chinese education and Chinese schools, whether it  is

their   intention  to  raise  its  position  in   the

education  scheme  of Singapore. The  fact  that  the

biggest  number of taxpayers in Singapore  today  are

Chinese   would   justify  an  equitable   and   fair

distribution  for the education of  those  who  would

much  prefer to be educated, firstly, in the  Chinese

language. From the Budget, we note that there  is  an

increase of $10 millions which has been earmarked  as

grant-in-aid for the Chinese schools. We will reserve

our  comment on this to a later time, when the report

on Chinese education is tabled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the school building programme that the

Government is embarking on next year, we note that  2

secondary  and 18 primary schools will  be  built  in

1956. We would very much like to be enlightened as to

how  many  of  these  are  Chinese  schools,  English

schools, Malay schools and Indian schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I must remind hon. Members that only

one  day is allotted for the Second Reading.  If  any

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Sir, I thought that,

as  the  time  was  nearly  up,  I  would  wait  till afternoon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a source of wonder to me

that  every year we are asked to approve a Budget  in

which  we have little or no say. If we, on this  side

of   the  House  which  represents  fourteen  Elected

Members,  had  anything to do with  constructing  the

Budget,  then it would have been different  from  the

one  framed  by  the eleven Elected  Members  on  the

Government Benches.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Form a government and construct a Budget!



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Will you have a little patience?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Can we, for instance, Sir, ask what

is  happening  to  our  United States  hard  currency

earnings? We have asked about this, but we have never

got  a satisfactory reply. Can we, for instance,  ask

why  such  a  large  amount of our revenue  is  being

drained  away  by the expatriates? Can we  also  ask,

Sir,  why  a large amount of capital by European  and

other  firms  is  being sent  away  in  the  form  of

dividends? Can it not be kept in this country?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, looking at this Budget, one could see that

expenditure is going higher year by year, and in this

year's  Budget  expenditure is the highest.  Sir,  in

Sessional  Paper No. Cmd. 28 of 1955,  page  12,  the

Hon. the  Financial Secretary has  said  that  "with

regard  to  the future, revenue is tending  to  level

off."  Well,  Sir, he is not optimistic about  future

revenue whilst expenditure is mounting up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the natural resources of this Colony, I

have  time  and  again pointed out that  we  have  no

natural   resources   whatsoever   like   any   other

countries, or even like what the Federation has  got.

Sir,  we live on our entrepot trade and that is  also

limited  because,  as time goes on, the  neighbouring

countries will naturally be getting imports from  the

source of production.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the other hand, Port Swettenham and Penang

are being developed with more harbour facilities, and

if  rubber and tin are to be exported direct from the

Federation, where do we stand?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that we must develop the cottage

industry,  which is a good thing for  the  housewife.

But   can  we  develop  large-scale  industries  like

Hongkong? Can we do that? Let us compare Hongkong and

Singapore.  In Hongkong there are no strikes.  Their

income  tax, I believe, is about 12� per  cent.  They

can  produce things cheaper. Let us compare Singapore

with  other  countries. We have got to  compete  with

other  countries like Japan and Germany in industrial

goods. Sir, prewar, Japan used to sell its shirts in

the London market, even right in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>



Manchester. Now, while we are still in peacetime,  we

can   compete   only  if  we  are   to   produce   by

manufacturing  cheaper. In our  present  position,  I

wonder whether we can compete at all. I do not  think

industrialists will invest money here unless they can

compete   in  selling  the  same  article  as   other

countries.  Sir,  the main factor  in  production  is

industrial  peace. Have we got it here? Well,  I  can

recollect  that  the  Chief  Minister  said  that  he

welcomed  the  strikes.  And who  is  responsible - the

present Coalition?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are not allowed to utilise our hand currency

earnings  for  our  own benefit.  It  is  the  United

Kingdom  who takes it away. We cannot keep. If  these

hard currency earnings were to be kept by us for  our

own  benefit, then our dollar would be much  stronger

than  even  the  United States dollar.  We  have  got

plenty of our reserves in hard currency which is  not

being utilised for ourselves. Can we have a say about

it?  We  cannot. We have no right to it. I have  been

asking about this, year after year, but no steps have

been  taken  that  we should utilise  these  currency

earnings for our own sake. Suppose we were to utilise

it  ourselves  to  import  goods  direct  instead  of

through the United Kingdom, we would have got  things

cheaper  for our own people. On the other hand,  Sir,

we  are  allowed to import hard currency  goods  from

HongKong by paying more in Malayan dollars, and also

thereby  enabling  the  Hongkong  importer  to   make

profit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, most of our revenue is being drained away by

the  expatriates  in  the way  of  salaries,  passage

leaves  and  pensions. Can we do anything  about  it?

This  has been going on for about 134 years.  We  are

told  that they have done good. Well, they are  being

paid  to do good. They have got to serve. It is their

duty.  But  have they done any good by drawing  these

huge  salaries, barring out at least 90 per  cent  of

the local people from the top jobs?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, about trade. What are we doing to keep our

capital  in this country? As one of the hon.  Members

on  my  side  has said - I think it was the Member  for

Seletar - most of our savings are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>



being  invested, even by banks, in places other  than

Singapore,  where their earnings come from.  You  can

save a lot - set up savings societies and so on - but the

first   thing  should  be  that  people   must   have

confidence in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said about entertainment expenditure.

I do not think I will dwell much on that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, see what happens in the free countries.

Take India for example. Indianisation - after 200 years

of British subjugation. Today India -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Subjugation!



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> It may be a bad word - my English may

not  be  as correct as a lawyer's - but today  what  is

India  doing? Apart from the Civil Services, even  in

private  firms the foreigners have agreed to  appoint

Indians  to three out of every four senior vacancies.

If  we want to Malayanise this country, why cannot we

do  it? We can easily get our own people to do  their

jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we are asked to approve a Budget which is

being  presented to us by only eleven Elected Members

as  against fourteen on this side, but I am sure  the

Government will carry it through with the help of the

ex-officio Members or Nominated Members. Well, I will

say this is a colonial Budget and I am voting against

it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

interested  in  that infinitesimal part  which  deals

with  the  entertainment and transport allowances  of

Ministers.  It is a little pathetic, Sir,  but  since

they  want to criticise it, I think we should  answer

it.  The  first  criticism I saw was in  the  Straits

Times  sometime last week in which a  person  by  the

name  of,  I  think,  Chan Kum  Chee  suggested  that

lasciviousness of its Members -

opposition  to  the Government, will appreciate  that

the  City Council is an inferior body to the Assembly

whole year, $31,300 has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>



been   budgeted   for  by  the   City   Council   for

entertainment and expenditure to date is  $24,550.  I

have  not heard, Sir, this man Chan Kum Chee, or  any

of  his Progressive friends, attack the entertainment

allowance  in the City Council. As you are  no  doubt

aware,  Sir, though we have extended the life of  the

City  Council, the majority of its members  are  from

the  Progressive Party. And it seems  that  the  City

Council may spend $31,300, but the Government of  the

country,  Sir, cannot spend even less than  that  for

entertainment expenses. Now, Sir, that is the kind of

conduct which seems to me to reflect not only on  the

Party  that seeks to attack the Government for making

moderate  provision for essential entertainment,  but

it  also brings into disrepute the entire concept  of

democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to draw attention, Sir, to certain

facts about this question of entertainment allowance.

For  example,  there  is allocated  to  me  as  Chief

Minister a sum of $10,000. Now, I do not get that  as

part of my emoluments. I do not touch a single dollar

of that money. That money is merely a provision for a

contingency.  The way we work it in  the  Council  of

Ministers,  Sir, is that bills must be  submitted  to

the  Hon. the Financial Secretary, who must  satisfy

himself that the occasion is an appropriate one for a

Government  function  and  he  must  pay  the   bills

himself. The Minister sometimes pays in advance,  but

when  he  submits  the  bill he  gets  just  what  is

indicated  on  it, so that it may well  be  that  the

$10,000 is not spent or it may be overspent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think hon. Members may be interested to know just

what types of entertainment have been given since  so

much  stress has been laid on it. The first  occasion

was  the farewell party to Sir John Nicoll - the  first

occasion  on which this Government had an opportunity

to give a function, and it was the intention then not

so  much  to  give a farewell party  as  to  give  an

opportunity  to  the common man to get  to  know  his

Government; and to that dinner, Sir, were invited not

the  Armed  Services or the Consular Corps,  who  get

invited to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>



all these functions, or the heads of departments, but

683   persons,   consisting   of   trade   unionists,

representatives      of     youth      organisations,

representatives  of the Police and  Members  of  this

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next function was one for Malcolm MacDonald at

which  there were 4,000 people present and in respect

of  which  every Member who was elected was given  an

opportunity of inviting fifty of his constituents, so

as  to  make  it possible for Mr. and Mrs. Singapore,

the people of this country, to take part in their own

business.  I  am proud of this, that we  have  broken

away  from  the tradition of the past  and  that  the

entertainment which has been given by this Government

has been predominantly for the people of this country

and  at  which the people of this country  have  been

present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others, Sir, were a Chinese dinner party in honour

of the Rt. Hon. Mr Lennox-Boyd, at which the Parties

in  this Assembly were represented; a Chinese  dinner

for  the  Foreign Minister of Indonesia;  a  cocktail

party  for the Colombo Plan officials; a dinner party

for  the Colombo Plan Ministers, and lunches  to  the

Ministers   of   the  Federation.  As  Minister   for

Commerce,   I   gave   a  lunch   to   the   Hongkong

industrialists,  who  organised  an   exhibition   in

Singapore,   and   also  to  certain   Indian   trade

delegations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, in every instance, the bills went forward

to  the Hon. the Financial Secretary and there was no

question  either  of my receiving more  or  receiving

less,  so that the $10,000 that is allocated  to  the

Chief  Minister is not a fixed sum but is  one  which

will  vary  with the necessities of the occasions.  I

feel that it is more than a little cheap that a great

city  like Singapore, which permits its City  Council

to  spend more than $31,300 on entertainment,  should

take  objection  in this fashion to  the  normal  and

necessary   expenditure  for  the  normal  courtesies

extended  to visiting personalities and on  occasions

of public importance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we come to the question of transport, Sir. The

sum represented there is the payment of a sum of $150

a month to Ministers. I myself pay $150 a month to my

driver, apart from the Provident Fund, apart from the

insurance,  apart  from the cost  of  the  car,  from

petrol, and from repairs. But that is the sum we have

fixed,  in  trying to be modest, in fact,  more  than

modest. You can quite appreciate, Sir, that if any of

the  hon. Members opposite were to be in my position,

I  have  not the slightest doubt that they would  get

themselves Daimlers and liveried chauffeurs, and they

would  be  to some extent within the logic  of  their

positions  in Singapore. The President  of  the  City

Council has a car and a livened chauffeur. You,  Sir,

have   a  car  and  a  liveried  chauffeur.  But   my

Government  has been sincerely seeking to  achieve  a

different  standard of expenditure. It may  be,  Sir,

that  in some of the receptions of the past, we  have

erred  a little. I have looked at it carefully and  I

am  prepared to admit that, perhaps, they were  on  a

large  scale, and I am certainly going to be a little

more  careful  in  the future; but to  say  that  the

provision  of  $31,000 a year for  entertainment  for

Singapore  is  exaggerated  is,  with  respect,  Sir,

disgraceful. As regards the question of transport,  I

challenge  hon. Members opposite to suggest  that  it

could  be any less because I myself, Sir, have worked

it  out.  I  believe that my normal  expenditure  for

transport is about $500 a month, but I take $150 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> That is for having a house in the country.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, you will forgive the hon.

Member  opposite.  He has a certain predilection  for

seeking  the limelight at all times, and he has  been

rather silent for a considerable length of time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Just you wait!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Now, Sir, in a particularly

sterile debate to date, without a single constructive

suggestion from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1007</b></font><br><br>

Members opposite, it is more than a little depressing

to   look   at   this  galaxy  of  fourteen   vaunted

representatives  of  the  people  and   watch   their

inability  to do anything but throw stones  and  mud-pies;  completely  incapable  of  appreciating   what

Government seeks to do and what Government has  done;

completely  incapable of anything  but  sterile  and

quite often unreasonable criticism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede), on the one

hand,  complain  that we have put  five  cents  on  a

gallon of petrol in order to get it to the same level

as the Federation. Five cents on a gallon is supposed

to  bear  very heavily on the poor man - five  cents  a

gallon.  Any bus would do at least ten miles  to  the

gallon;  so  half  a  cent a mile  for  about  twenty

passengers - that, Sir, is dreadful imposition  on  the

poor  by  way of indirect taxation. But in  the  same

breath  he  says,  "Why  do you  not  put  a  tax  on

tobacco?"  That, Sir, according to Progressive  Party

logic,  is  not  indirect taxation. It  is  merely  a

question  of what Government does is wrong  and  what

Government  does  not  do is wrong.  The  Member  for

Tanglin  wants a tax on tobacco. Now,  Sir,  I  quite

agree that in the ultimate analysis tobacco is not an

essential commodity of life but it is the poor  man's

one  luxury and to some that are addicted to  it,  it

would  be very difficult for them to give it  up.  To

put  a  tax on tobacco would mean to place  the  main

burden  of  taxation on the middle class and  on  the

poor  whom  we seek to protect, and if we cannot  tax

the rich, we will not tax the poor. It is no question

of  timidity, Sir, it is a question of principle. The

question of an imposition of a further tax on tobacco

will  come when more factories have sprung up locally

to  manufacture cheaper cigarettes, so that the  poor

people  need not be deprived completely of their  one

luxury  and  can  have  access  to  cheaper  locally-manufactured  cigarettes. We have that  in  mind.  It

will  come  when we can lay the burden, as we  should

lay  the  burden,  by direct taxation  and,  in  this

respect,  it is curious to note that the  Member  for

Serangoon (Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>



Lim Choon Mong), who belongs to the same Party as the

Member for Tanglin, could not have sufficient liaison

between  them in order to speak the same language  on

the  same morning. The Member for Serangoon  was  all

for  direct  taxation  and increase  of  income  tax,

forgetting  the shades of his President.  The  Member

for  Tanglin,  Sir,  warned us that  we  must  reduce

taxation in order to attract capital to this country.

This  is  the type of criticism that a Budget,  which

has   received   the   greatest  and   most   careful

consideration  on  our part, has elicited  from  hon.

Members opposite.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the Member for Tanglin and, I think,

others  as well have made a reference to the  general

impression  in the country about the inefficiency  of

the Income Tax Department. Sir, I do not suppose that

there  is a single Income Tax Department in any  part

of  the world which is not charged by its public with

inefficiency.  I  do not suppose that  there  is  any

country  in  the  world where there is  not  material

evasion of income tax but I would like to say  this - I

know  that  the  Member  for Tanglin  said  it  in  a

constructive spirit - that Government is very conscious

of  this  public feeling and that Government is  very

anxious   to  seek  to  strengthen  the  Income   Tax

Department   for   the  purpose   of   dealing   more

efficiently with existing tax evasion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other matter, Sir. I would not take up

much time. In view of the unexpected adjournment,  we

are  very  short of time at the moment, but  I  would

like to say this on the attack made that we have been

guilty of leakage of Budget secrets. That is a normal

practice for Government to disclose its Budget policy

and  not  the means by which it achieves that policy,

but  I think hon. Members opposite should stop for  a

moment  to realise this: what happened here, although

not normal practice it is quite true, was that we had

to   meet   an   abnormal  situation,  because   this

Government  is not in complete control of its  fiscal

policy.  We  are, to some extent. Sir,  tied  to  the

chariot of the Federation and it is only proper,  out

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>



respect to this Assembly and no more, that it  should

be  aware  of the intent and the final decision.  The

final decision, Sir, does not in any way indicate our

policy   as  such  if  it  were  divorced  from   the

background of the means by which we have to  come  to

this compromise, which is not to our liking. That  is

why  it  was necessary to indicate what the decisions

were,  what the desires were, and what the  decisions

ultimately became.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanglin drew attention to a

statement  I made that we were very anxious  to  seek

curtailment  of Government expenditure. That  remains

true,  and  directions have been given  to  heads  of

departments,  and  I believe they have  been  loyally

complied  with,  but I am still far  from  satisfied,

Sir,  not because there is any suspicion in  my  mind

that  I  have not received every assistance from  the

civil  service  in  the effort to  bring  down  to  a

minimum  the  expenditure in the various departments,

but because I think that the whole structure requires

a  comprehensive review by experts in order to assist

in bringing down the expenditure of this country; and

I  would  like to say this, Sir, that we have  sought

the assistance of the Government of India to send  us

three  men  who  are,  in  their  own  right,  Indian

Government  experts on organisation  and  method.  We

have  asked  for them in the hope that we would  have

them  for at least one year so that they could review

the   position  and  make  recommendations  for   the

reduction of expenditure and, at the same time, teach

some  of  our  local  civil  servants  the  procedure

whereby we can, in future, keep a constant check on a

very  natural  tendency, Sir, on the  part  of  civil

servants - both expatriate and local - to  indulge  in  a

bit of empire-building on their own. This goes on  in

every country in the world, and we do need experts in

organisation  and method. Unfortunately,  the  Indian

Government itself, Sir, has very great need of  these

men  and  they  have been unable to comply  with  our

request. It is my intention to take it up again  with

the appropriate authorities in New Delhi when I visit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>



it early next month. I would like to say that I am by

no means complacent about the sum - indicated, I think,

by  the  leader of the Democratic Party (Mr  William

Tan) - of  $98  millions spent,  for  example,  on  the

Personal Emoluments of our civil servants. I  am  far

from   complacent  about  the  expenditures  of   the

Government. We have been seven months in office, Sir,

and  this  sort  of axing is not done  in  a  day.  I

certainly  intend to pursue methods which I  have  in

mind  for  greater  reduction in expenditure  in  the

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to end, Sir, by expressing regret that

hon.  Members  opposite  have  not  seen  fit  on  an

occasion  of  this  nature to make suggestions  of  a

constructive character that could assist  us  in  the

government  of  this  country,  instead   of   merely

indulging in party politics from the Opposition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, of all the

sterile speeches we have heard this morning, I  think

the one by the Chief Minister about the entertainment

expenses  and travelling allowances of his  Ministers

is about the most sterile of them all. It is a petty,

completely irrelevant matter which has been raised by

petty people and taken in an extremely serious manner

by  the  Chief Minister who thought that  it  was  an

attack  on  the integrity of his Government.  No  one

suggests,  for one moment, that his Ministers  fiddle

their  expense accounts or do not show bills  to  the

Hon. the  Financial Secretary. The point  taken  was

that there should not be this extravagant example set

by  Government Ministers. The most unfortunate  thing

about  today's debate is that the speech by the  Hon.

the  Chief  Minister was concerned almost exclusively

with the entertainment allowances of City Councillors

and  Members  of this Assembly, with their  transport

difficulties    and    their    personal    transport

arrangements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister has said that he has had

no  constructive criticism coming from this  side  of

the  House.  It  was  probably because  the  People's

Action  Party  did not choose to speak this  morning.

However, whether he will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1011</b></font><br><br>



consider what we have to tell him as constructive  or

just  the slinging of mud-pies and stones is a matter

of which, I think, he is not the best judge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been suggested that you

should  not  be  a judge of what is fair  and  unfair

reporting  and  the  Hon. the  Chief  Minister   has

strenuously  defended you. I would  like  to  suggest

that, at the end of the speeches for the day, what is

fair or unfair, as said by the Opposition, should not

be  a  matter  which rests with the  Hon. the  Chief

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the nature and character of a

government  is  not decided by florid and  flamboyant

declarations of policy and intention. The final  test

is   the  fiscal  policy  of  the  Government   which

determines whether it is blue, light blue, light pink

or  deep red. The Hon. the Chief Minister should  not

have  been  so  surprised that he found little  which

contradicted   his   Budget,   because   the   placid

assumption of all the speeches made this morning was: "It was a jolly good Budget and we got way with it."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was the Member for Tanglin Club - I beg his

pardon - the hon. Mr Sutherland - who could not  conceal

his  relief that he was not made to pay what was  his

due and fair share of the taxation of this country.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Do not talk rubbish! I never -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Sutherland has impressed on

the  Hon. the Chief Minister that if he,  the  Chief

Minister,  were  in future to do what  is  right  and

fair,  then he, Mr Sutherland, would, on  his  part,

meet  the  Hon. the Chief Minister's not  inordinate

demands for the welfare of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there were two Progressive speakers, the Member

for Serangoon and the Member for Tanglin - and this  is

the  only  point on which I agree with the  Hon. the

Chief  Minister - namely, that  they  both  spoke  with

different  voices. The Member for Serangoon  must  be

very  careful  about what he says. What he  expounded

means, in effect, a Socialist



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>



programme,  which  would  startle  those   who   have

supported  and financed his Party. As for the  Member

for  Tanglin,  he  is a more adroit businessman,  who

showed  all  the  skill  which  the  running  of  big

business  in  this Colony inculcates  in  a  business

executive. References were made to the fact that  the

taxes were indirect. No reference was made as to  how

taxes should be raised in a direct and concrete form.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was the Member for Tiong Bahru (Mr William

Tan)  who was rather vague. He proposed that the Hon.

the  Chief  Minister should encourage local industry,

trade  and  commerce.  "Do not  think  of  increasing

taxation,"  says the leader of the Democratic  Party,

"but  think  of  increasing the  basis  of  taxation.

Increase  the  income and then, at the same  rate  of

tax, you will have more money to run the government."

And  the  Democratic Party will be happy, the  Labour

Front  will  be happy and the people will  be  happy.

Sir,  it  is  one  of  those attractive  propositions

which,  no  doubt, if ever the Democratic  Party  and

their  new-found  friends  in  the  Progressive  camp

should  form a government, we shall have the pleasure

of watching them try to put into operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was the Member for Telok Ayer (Mr R.

Jumabhoy).  Now,  Sir, I have a particular  affection

for   the  hon.  Member.  In  the  sometimes   dreary

deliberations of this House, he brings a light touch.

He  brings  the  right  personal  touch.  He  is  not

concerned  with  taxation. He is concerned  with  the

dire and deepening crisis in the constitution when he

finds  that the Chief Minister has only eleven  votes

now  and  he, on his side, has got fourteen.  Sir,  I

have  recently had several telephone calls  from  the

Member for Telok Ayer, and he has been instructing me

on the merits and demerits of the constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I never thought much of the Rendel

Constitution  even after it had been revised  by  the

Hon. the Chief Minister. I will think much less of it

if  it ever came to the stage where one could have  a

conglomeration of opposing and naturally  fissiparous

forces all bound together with only one ambition



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- to share the spoils of office. That would be a sight

even  more delightful than the one we have had before

us.  It is quite true that two of the people of  whom

the  Hon. the Chief Minister was once so very  proud

when  he  said,  "When I look at the Members  of  the

Opposition and I look behind me, I thank God for  the

men I have behind me", -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I still do. I have not -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I do not thank God for what has

happened  and I will not thank God for the switch  of

sides by the two hon. Members of this House. No doubt

they have good and solid reasons for doing so and  we

shall in this House by and by come to -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is this relevant?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was referring

to  the speech by the Member for Telok Ayer and  mine

is as relevant as his.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there was the speech by the Member for

Seletar  (Mr  Nair). Now, that  was  a  constructive

speech.  There we have someone who made proposals  as

to  how the rural areas should be supplied with  more

libraries,  not the travelling type,  but  the  fixed

type.  There  were all kinds of ingenious suggestions

about  how one could build cheaper schools.  However,

he  said,  one  should not build those  cheap  houses

built  by the S.I.T., because one of these days there

will be better houses to live in. Then everybody will

leave  the  S.I.T. houses and stay in beautiful  houses

built  by  private  enterprise where  there  will  be

dining rooms plus a kitchen. Now, Sir, I do not  know

how  the  Member for Seletar reconciles  his  cheaper

schools  with dearer houses. No doubt, it is  a  pity

that he has not up to now been given the opportunity - we  all  hope he will eventually be given before  the

life of this Assembly expires - of contributing to  the

democratic  processes of the Labour Front Government.

[Interruption.]  Sir, I am glad  that  the  Hon. the

Chief Minister was duly excited at such a prospect.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we in the People's Action Party

feel - perhaps  we  are the only Party  in  this  House

today  which  does, and perhaps I more  than  anybody

else  in  this  House - terribly  disappointed  at  the

failure of a Socialist idea. I have not one good word

to  say  about  this Budget. It is  no  different  in

substance  from  any of the other Budgets  that  have

been  presented before the Legislative Council  since

the  British re-occupation of Singapore. I  hold  the

Labour  Front directly responsible for  some  of  the

shortcomings  of this Budget. For other shortcomings,

I  hold  the  colonial officials who run  the  Labour

Front Government directly responsible.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I object to that, Sir, on a

point of order. Is the hon. Member entitled to make a

remark  of that character? It is disgraceful! Utterly

contemptible!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. I am, of course, as hon.

Members  will realise, bound by Standing Orders,  and

if  that  statement can be considered to  come  under

Standing Order 31 (4) which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It shall be out of order to use offensive and

insulting language about Members of the Assembly",



<br><br>then, of course, it is out of order. The other

Standing Order says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Member shall impute improper motives to any

other Member."



<br><br>I  cannot see that that applies. I, for one, consider

that  the  expression  used by  the  hon.  Member  is

perhaps a flight of rhetoric which I hope he will try

not to indulge in too often and too long.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker,

Sir, it was not a flight of rhetoric which induced me

to  use that particular phrase, but an inclination to

call a spade a spade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, I propose to deal with the

Budget  defects in the two broad heads under which  I

have  classified its shortcomings. The first is where

I  hold  the Party Government to have been at  fault.

The second head is where I hold the Party Government - if  I  may  put  it inversely - not to be  directly  at

fault, but nevertheless, indirectly responsible for.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a Socialist Government shows

itself  in  its  taxation  and  its  expenditure.   A

democratic   Socialist   Party   seeks,   through   a

parliamentary  democracy, to  introduce  taxation  in

order  that money could be taken from those who  have

and  to introduce social services in order that money

or  benefits can be given to those who have not. Now,

Sir,  the  Hon. the Minister for Communications  and

Works  (Mr  Thomas)  is a much  better  lecturer  on

academic Socialism than I am. No doubt, he will  come

to the rescue of his apt disciple, the Hon. the Chief

Minister,  when  he explains away  this  Budget.  The

purpose of a Socialist movement is to create  a  more

egalitarian society and to bring about in a  peaceful

and  orderly  way  a  redistribution  of  wealth  and

opportunity.  Everyone  in Singapore,  including  the

hon. Mr Sutherland, has accepted the verdict of  the

electorate  given  on 2nd April. No  one  doubts  the

right  of the Labour Front Government to put up taxes

in  order  that its plans and its promises  could  be

implemented.  Everyone in the "have"  group  has  not

been  able to conceal his great relief that this  has

not, in fact, happened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Financial Secretary in his speech made

an  apologetic  admission  of  the  failings  of  the

Government which he is now serving. There  are  still

echoes  in  his  speech of the  talk  to  extend  the

benefits of a welfare state. For instance, on page  5

of his speech which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These were subsequently pruned to $211 millions. In

making  these reductions, the following objects  were

kept  clearly  in  mind: the need to  limit  ordinary

departmental  recurrent expenditure  to  the  minimum

required  for  the efficient discharge of  Government

business: the need to make adequate provision for the

expansion  of the social services: and  the  need  to

augment   the  funds  likely  to  be  available   for

development   by  a  substantial  contribution   from

revenue...".



<br><br>To   "expand"  the  benefits.  Then  there   was   an

apologetic  explanation why this  taxation  to  raise

funds  which were necessary to implement  the  Labour

Front Programme could not be brought about. A lot  of

possible avenues were explored - income tax, companies

tax, first registration of motor cars, etc. etc. They



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>



went  up to the Federation and, of course, the  whole

scheme fell through.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also there were a lot of, in my

view,  "defensive"  warnings of  large  increases  in

expenditure,  both  recurrent and  non-recurrent.  In

fact,  so  much  so that the hon. Mr Sutherland  was

much  alarmed at the future prospect and much excited

that such a stage should ever be allowed to pass. But

he comforted himself with the fact that all Financial

Secretaries  in  colonial  governments   had   always

threatened the people with dire consequences, but the

dire consequences never came to pass.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the criticisms of the speech of the Hon. the

Financial  Secretary have this one tacit assumption - a

change  at  a  quiet  pace. The social  and  economic

changes  required in Singapore are to be carried  out

at  a  pace which a peaceful and stable society would

require.  That  is  an  assumption  with  which   the

People's  Action Party profoundly disagrees.  We  all

know  that  there is a political emergency in  Malaya

with an armed rebellion, lasting for eight years.  We

have  tried, in the short life of our Party, to bring

home  the  fact  that  this  political  rebellion  is

largely  caused  and  aided by  economic  and  social

injustices. Our approach to the problem of  governing

Singapore,  our approach to the problems of  economic

and social injustices, must therefore be an emergency

approach, not a peacetime approach.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is useless to spend more money on the

Police - about $2 millions more - for the reorganisation

of the Special Branch and other things. It is useless

to  try and cure the political discontent if one does

not,  in  the  same  spirit of ruthlessness - ruthless,

because  I  think  the  Hon. the  Chief  Minister  is

capable  of  being a ruthless administrator  for  the

good  of  the  country - pursue  remedies  swiftly  and

decisively  to  get rid of all the  awful  things  to

which  the Hon. the Chief Minister himself,  when  he

was campaigning during the elections, referred.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that within the framework of the existing

taxation  policy - I know the Hon. the  Chief  Minister

does not desire



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>



to  hear constructive criticism - a lot can be done  to

meet  this economic and social emergency. It  is  our

view that taxation should be pushed up to the maximum

that  the  economy  of the country can  take  without

upsetting  the  basic trades and the  basic  economic

structure of this country. It is our view, too,  that

we  should  be  prepared to mortgage our  future  and

borrow up to the hilt if we are to save the future at

all.  I do not know what was at the back of the  mind

of  the  Hon. the Financial Secretary when,  in  his

speech  on  at  least  three separate  occasions,  he

indicated that the Singapore loan market is  limited.

It says on page 7:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... not because our credit is in doubt"



<br><br>(in  spite of the Labour Front Government - that is  my

own parenthesis, Mr Speaker, Sir)



<br><br>"but  because  the  capacity of the  loan  market  is

limited."



<br><br>On page 11, he repeats:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Part of this sum can be met from liquid balances

but the great bulk of it will have to be borrowed  in

1956. This may not be altogether easy. There will  be

other borrowers on a not unlimited market."



<br><br>Again, on page 14:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The local loan market is not unlimited in capacity.

There  will be other borrowers in the market  besides

Government. Access to other markets may be  difficult

to obtain."



<br><br>The  whole  tenor of his speech is one of seeking  to

forestall any criticism that, in fact, the Government

has no faith in itself; that, in fact, the Government

is not prepared to do what is necessary, but is doing

from  habit  exactly what it has always done.  It  is

because of this attitude of mind that we get the Hon.

the Minister for Communications and Works -



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> You must do your homework!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> If the Hon. Minister had done his

homework,  when he was learning Socialism,  he  would

know  that  it  is not for a Socialist government  to

say: Flood control is impossible.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>



It costs $60 millions. We have no money. We cannot do

anything about it. All we can do is not flood control

but    flood    alleviation   for   $123,000.    That

Miscellaneous  item  of  $5 millions,  to  which  the

Member  for  Tanglin  (Mr Ede) referred  is  perhaps

inclusive of this $123,000 for flood control.  It  is

that timidity, that completely unimaginative frame of

mind,  that has led them to make such futile changes,

if any changes were, in fact, attempted by the Labour

Front.   $60  millions  for  flood  control   becomes

$123,000   for  flood  alleviation.   There   was   a

magnificent opportunity to bring home to  the  people

that  democratic  Socialism can  deliver  the  goods.

There  was  an opportunity, if revenue could  not  be

raised by direct taxation and immediate taxation,  to

mortgage  the future, to do something which  must  be

done  by any government if it intends to govern  this

country in a forceful and efficient manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the economic and social battle for

Malaya  is likely to become more important  than  the

military and political battle. It is likely to become

very  much more important after these projected talks

with  representatives of the Malayan Communist Party.

Every  political Party understands - now at  any  rate,

they  did  not  before, not the Progressives  or  the

Democrats - that the people at large are not interested

in   "isms":   Capitalism,  Socialism,  Fascism,   or

Communism.  They are only interested in  seeing  that

their  ordinary lives improve. Whoever  can  work  to

improve their ordinary conditions of life gets  their

loyalty  and allegiance. That is the basic  principle

which  I  think the Labour Front Government at  heart

really  understands. It is for  that  reason  that  I

propose  to examine the Labour Front's Programme  for

housing,  health, education and welfare within  their

own   framework,   within  the  framework   of   this

constitution, and within the framework of the  Budget

that  has  always  been introduced  in  the  previous

Legislative  Councils - housing, a house to  live  in;

health,  education  for your children,  and  welfare,

security for the family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labour Front Programme on housing, which I think should be well



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>



known  to  those who were its authors,  was  a  bold,

imaginative and an ambitious programme. Page 3 says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Labour Front is convinced that no tangible

progress towards solving the Colony's housing problem

can  be  achieved  without a  Government  subsidy  on

housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extent of this subsidy will be carefully

investigated  and, to the amount that  the  financial

resources  of the Colony can bear it, it is  proposed

the subsidy should take the following form: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) A direct contribution from Government to

finance  the  housing  programme  of  the  Singapore

Improvement  Trust at a much more accelerated  speed

than at present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will entail converting the S.I.T. into a

statutory  Government  housing  agency,  instead  of

being   a  quasi-Government  body  with  restrictive

powers as at present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) A reduction of the present interest rates on

Government loans to the S.I.T., thereby providing  for

cheaper rentals for Trust accommodation and carrying

this important social amenity to a larger number  of

the lower income group.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The encouragement of Housing within a Co-operative movement which assists the common man

through  thrift and enterprise to possess a home  of

his  own. It is proposed to assist this movement  by

lending  a  large portion of the capital needed  for

housing projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) The Labour Front considers housing as

important as water, roads and electricity."



<br><br>Now,  Sir,  the  Hon. the Financial  Secretary,  on

behalf  of  the  Labour Front, has  this  to  say  on

housing:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As I stated earlier, there are other commitments of

a  capital  nature in addition to those appearing  in

the development estimates. Funds for the construction

of low rental housing will have to be supplied to the

Singapore  Improvement Trust. It is  hoped  that  the

Trust  will be able to build new Units to a value  of

at  least  $18 millions in 1956, although  much  will

depend on whether some solution can be found for  the

problem of clearing suitable sites."



<br><br>$18 millions, Sir, for the S.I.T. for 1956. He doubts

whether  the S.I.T. could, in fact, use up  that  $18

millions.  The Progressive Party has been doing  that

in conjunction with their colonial administrators for

many  years.  The S.I.T. has, in fact, at  one  stage

given  up  the hope of ever catching up with  housing

because it said the birth rate was increasing at such

a  terrific  pace. A programme which was dynamic  has

been  watered down into a continuation of Progressive

Party Policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health - Labour Front Programme, page 5 reads:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"THE MEDICAL SERVICES.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Colony is endowed with one of the finest

medical services in this part of South East Asia.

Yet, the benefit of such services has not been

reaching the masses" -



<br><br>(masses - a very popular word. I remember the Member

for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong) using it. It was

very dangerous for him to use it.) -



<br><br>"in the manner that is their right and privilege. In

its first four-year term," -



<br><br>(we have been informed it is going to be a two-year

term now, Mr Speaker, Sir, - so they had better hurry

up with this programme) -



<br><br>"the Labour Front will strive to implement the

principle of taking the medical services to the

people rather than having the people go to the

medical services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end the Front will sponsor and encourage

schemes  for the decentralisation of the General  and

Kandang Kerbau Hospitals by the provision of district

hospitals  with outpatient departments and  maternity

wards  in  areas where there are large concentrations

of the population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labour Front will lay it down as a matter of

Government  policy  that  all  services  provided  in

hospitals - specialist treatment, operations, etc. - will

be  free  for one and all. The provision  of  special

wards, however, will be maintained" -



<br><br>(this  is obviously for the benefit of those on their

side of the House) -



<br><br>"so  that  those who can afford it, may be placed  in

special  wards. This will provide a source of revenue

that cannot readily be dispensed with. There will  be

no   difference  whatsoever  in  the   treatment   of

patients, whether in special or in ordinary wards."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the Hon. the Financial Secretary, on

behalf of his Labour Front Government, says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Under Head 52: Medical and Health, provision is

made  for  560  new  appointments. These  are  spread

throughout the many departments and divisions of  the

Department  and  reference  must  be  made   to   the

Estimates to find out where and what they are. In all

personal  emoluments total $18.5 millions as compared

with  $16.8  millions in 1955. Recurrent  expenditure

totals  $8.1 millions compared with $8.2 millions  in

1955. The contribution to the Hospitals Board and Tan

Tock  Seng  are reduced below 1955 levels. Again  the

special  expenditure contribution  to  the  Board  is

reduced  from  $1.5 millions in 1955 to  $979,000  in

1956.  In all, Medical and Health Expenditure  totals

$28.8 millions compared with $27.4 millions in 1955."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all that the Labour Front has done

in this field of Medical and Health is to increase by

$1.36 millions, the amount voted for it in 1955



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>



by  the  Progressive Party-cum-colonial Government - $1.36  millions - and  of  that the  Hon. the  Financial

Secretary was kind enough to inform us, a great  deal

was  going  to  be  taken up by annual  increases  in

emoluments for serving officers. Where is the capital

development? One district hospital worth $3 millions,

of  which an almost token vote of $100,000 is  sought

for 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education - Labour Front Programme, page 5 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"FREE SCHOOLING FOR ALL.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labour Front's Policy on education is free

compulsory schooling for all children, in English or

vernacular schools, for the first six years as a

matter of first priority. Thereafter scholarships or

grants may be provided in deserving cases."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Financial Secretary, on page 8, on

behalf of the Labour Front Government, says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Education: Personal Emoluments have increased from

$18.7 millions to $20.2 millions. 964 new

appointments have been added, mainly for probationary

teachers. This gives a clear idea of the rate of

expansion of the Department."



<br><br>Finally he winds up saying that the increase, which

is $12.9 millions over last year's Estimates, is

largely to meet the natural increase in the cost of

teachers, and the $10 millions extra cost to give

equivalent treatment to Chinese schools by grants-in-aid. No attempt is made to achieve this commendable

ideal of free compulsory schooling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon has cited his personal

experience of people knocking at his door asking  him

to  use his influence as a school-master to get their

children  places in school. I am afraid, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  that  he  will find it extremely  difficult  to

fulfil  all his personal obligations unless  he  gets

the  consent  of the Hon. the Minister for  Education

(Mr Chew Swee Kee) to spend some millions of dollars

immediately,  and not in the future,  to  bring  this

about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Sir, nothing has been said of welfare, so I

cannot blame the Labour Front for not doing anything.

They did not say a word about welfare but the Hon.

the Financial Secretary said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Social Welfare: Provision for Public Assistance has

been increased from $4 millions to $5 millions."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one looks at the Estimates on page 17, there is

an  increase  shown of $1.07 millions over  what  was

voted  last  year. Mr Speaker, Sir, an  increase  of

$1.07  millions  to  look after the  welfare  of  the

people, sickness benefits, unemployment benefits  and

T.B. benefits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one looks at the Head: Police, one finds that it

has  gone  up  even more than Social  Welfare,  $2.65

millions over what was spent last year - $2.65 millions

out  of  a  total of $50 odd millions. We  are  told,

amongst other things, that the Special Branch of  the

C.I.D. is  to be reorganised. Sir, if  one  were  to

spend  more money, not just a little bit, but  a  lot

more money on housing, health, education and welfare,

it  is my belief - I may be quite wrong because it may

be a bit too late in the day - but it is my belief, the

only  faith  that one can have in such  a  situation,

that  it would not be necessary to have more and more

increases of expenditure on para-military forces.  It

is  better to prevent a situation which gives rise to

this  need  for  more policemen rather  than  try  to

contain   the   situation  from  getting   worse   by

repressive Police measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How, asks the Labour Front Government, are we to get

the  taxes? The Hon. the Chief Minister has said that

tobacco is a poor man's luxury and one of these days,

when  cheap tobacco is manufactured locally, he  will

tax  imported  tobacco. He will tax imports,  but  he

will  allow  cheap local tobacco to be  sold  without

tax.  Now,  Sir, I seldom agree with the  Member  for

Tanglin and I hope I shall not have much occasion to - unless,  of course, he gets converted into  something

or  the other. But I must agree with him that tobacco

should not have been allowed to escape unscathed.  It

is not a necessity and, in fact, there has been a lot

of  medical literature to say that people should  not

smoke  cigarettes.  Of course,  the  Hon. the  Chief

Minister  is one who enjoys the fragrance of Virginia

in  a  leather-bound  pipe and, like  the  generous-hearted man he is, he likes everybody in Singapore to

enjoy   his   vices   and  share  the   benefits   of

civilisation.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I enjoy whisky too.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> And whisky and champagne and

caviare  more  than anything else. I  say  this:  This

cowardly  refraining from imposing a duty on  tobacco

to  bring it up to the Federation level is not worthy

of  a Socialist movement. I say it is a cheap way  of

avoiding any measure if it brings unpopularity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We say that taxation could have been increased on

income  tax  and  companies  tax,  in  spite  of  the

Federation  Government wishing  to  reconsider  their

position in two month's time -



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> How?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad that

the schoolmaster still wishes at this time of life to

learn  something about economics. They have seen  fit

to put up the rate of estate duty well beyond that in

the Federation. They have made it so that today it is

cheaper for a rich man to die in the Federation  than

to die in Singapore. The Hon. the Financial Secretary

has  said that there would be a flight of all wealth,

companies,  and  capital in the Federation  if  there

were discrepancies in fiscal rates, either income tax

or  companies tax or any other form of taxation which

is  direct.  Has  it not occurred to  him  that  this

estate  duty would mean a flight of capital?  Has  it

not  occurred to him that it would be cheaper  for  a

rich  man  to hold shares in a company registered  in

Kuala  Lumpur  and  not registered in  Singapore,  on

which  he will pay Federation, not Singapore,  estate

duty?  Has  it not occurred to him that  a  rich  man

would find it worth while to have a large mansion  in

Johore  Bahru instead of Singapore to reside  in,  on

which  he will pay Federation, not Singapore,  estate

duty when he dies.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> He lives in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> "He lives in Singapore?" He will

die  domiciled  in the Federation. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

the  Hon. the Chief Minister is a man  who  is  well

versed  in  advising clients how to work the  law  to

their  advantage  in a lawful manner.  In  fact,  his

great  success in life has been because he  was  most

adept   at  advising  those  who  do  business   with

countries whose currencies come



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>



under foreign exchange control, how they can work  it

that the law, in fact, does not militate against them

when  obviously  the  law was  designed  to  militate

against them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my other point, Sir, is that it is impossible

for the Federation not to put up the income tax. They

are in a more acute economic position than Singapore.

They wanted two years ago, in my recollection, to put

up  the companies tax and the income tax. It was then

the Member for Tanglin's friends and relatives in the

Progressive  Party  Government  who  most  vehemently

prevented  it. They gave some millions of dollars  of

Singapore money, which had already come out of  their

pockets,  to  the  Federation to  prevent  them  from

taking more money out of their pockets in the future.

There  should  have  been more courage  and  boldness

shown,  more  imagination. The long-term  trends  are

clear. The Federation taxes cannot be below Singapore

taxes. They cannot afford it, and if we had increased

either the companies tax or the income tax, it  would

not  have  been  worth any company's  while,  or  any

shareholder's  while, to transfer his assets  to  the

Federation  because he will be caught with  the  same

taxes in the Federation in a very short time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I will come - I know the Hon. the Chief

Minister is somewhat alarmed, Mr Speaker, Sir,  that

he has shot his arrow for the first time -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I will remind you of your promise, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now deal

with the faults of the Budget for which I do not hold

the  Hon. the Chief Minister and his elected  Members

directly  to blame. [Interruption.] We can  carry  on

after four. It does not matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> There is no question -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> We will carry on beyond four p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Would you, Sir, perhaps remind the Member -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Is it on a point of order?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it on a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Well, Mr Speaker, perhaps -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Is it on a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. I am asking the Chief

Minister whether it is on a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If you were to remind him, Sir,

that  there  is such a thing as a guillotine  on  the

Second Reading of the Budget and there is no question

of   suspension.  The  hon.  Member  has   given   an

undertaking about the length of his speech and it has

been  arranged that he should have an opportunity  to

do  so  in full, giving the Government an opportunity

to speak in reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I cannot pay any regard to that because

it  is  not  a  point of order and because  the  hon.

Member did not give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would just

like  to  say that I was asked how long I  thought  I

would  take, and there was no undertaking. There  was

absolutely no binding consideration of any sort.  But

I  shall try my best to see that his colleagues  have

an opportunity to meet my points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Sir, my attack now is on those who framed this

Budget,  and I would be prepared to believe that  the

Labour   Front  Government  as  such  has  not   been

responsible  for  the perpetration of  this  colonial

Budget. In fact, I am quite prepared to believe  that

a  great number of them may not know what this is all

about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the form of the Estimates. This is the

first time, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the Government  of

the  Colony of Singapore has had to present a  Budget

to be discussed publicly. Before that, they did it in

the discreet cloisters of Empress Place.

<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Do not waste time!

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Why was there no Committee of

Estimates to go



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>



through  this Budget so that we will know what  these

items  are  all  about? There are  innumerable  items

which no one, unless he is a Member of the Government

and has access to Government files, can know about. I

shall  refer  to  a  few of them briefly  by  way  of

example.  There  has  been  a  change  in  form   and

classification.  My  contention  is  that  the  whole

presentation   in   this  form  is   inadequate   and

unsatisfactory   because   it   gives    insufficient

information.  What information it does give  is  very

difficult   to  comprehend.  Take  an  example,   Mr

Speaker,   Sir,   first  of   all,   at   page   108,

"$40,000 - Commissions,  Conferences  and   Visits   of

Advisers".   What   is  it  all   about?   Who   gets

commissions, conferences and visits of advisers?  The

Treasury?   "Title  changed  from   Commissions   and

Conferences.       Previously       shown       under

Head - Miscellaneous Services."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, at page 53 - "Passages and Miscellaneous

Travelling Expenses - $ 1,600,000." What does it mean?

I  can  quite  believe, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  that  our

expatriate civil service do require a very large  sum

of  money  to  flit back and forth on  their  regular

recuperative journeys, back to their homeland. But  I

do  not  understand  what "Miscellaneous  Travelling

Expenses"  mean. Does it include, for  instance,  Mr

Cresson's flight to Britain and back? Who has control

over   this?   Last   year,  the   Estimates   showed

$1,000,000.  This year we are asked to  vote  another

$600,000. We do not know what this is all about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on page 78, we have this curious item - nobody

can make sense out of it. I have asked quite a number

of  those who ought to know what it is all about  and

they  say  they do not know. Under the Head:  Police,

item  14,  "Expenses connected with Medical Treatment

in  United Kingdom." What is it all about?  Are  they

people  who  have  been shot and must  recuperate  in

Britain? Is it because our medical facilities at  the

General Hospital are inadequate?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Is it your intention to talk so that we cannot answer you?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> No, Mr Speaker -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Well, get on with it.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> And the classification of those

Tables. One is told that Personal Emoluments mount up

to $98 millions. One assumes that that is the cost of

the  civil service running the Government. But  when

one  turns  to  page  78 and finds  out  under  Other

Charges,  Special  Expenditure: "Police  Lieutenants,

thirty-four: - Provision for 7 months only - $351,920",

surely there must be some means by which we know that

$98   millions  does  not  include  all  these  other

"Salaries and Allowances; Clothing and Accoutrements;

Leave  Pay;  Light  and  Water Charges  and  Domestic

Service" (for Police Lieutenants) "and Passages"  and

that   they  come  under  payment  for  services   of

Government servants?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have under the Head: Prisons, at page 86,

"Staff  Salaries and Allowances" which is  not  shown

under Personal Emoluments and not included in the $98

millions.  What are we to make of it? And one  finds,

if  one tries as I did to find out how much our civil

servants cost -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Why do you not ask?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It is supposed to be in the

Estimates.  After  one finds out what  the  Hon. the

Chief  Secretary and the Chief Justice are  paid,  if

one  turns  to page 250 one suddenly sees  under  the

Head:  Public  Works, "Replacement  of  Crockery  and

cutlery in residences of the Chief Justice and  Chief

Secretary - $7,000". Surely, all this is payment of the

Civil Service that we are maintaining?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first charge on the form of the Budget is that we

should  at  least  have tables from  which  we  could

easily  know how much is the charge on the  community

for a particular item.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the point of substance on the Estimates for

which  I  do  not  held the Hon. the  Chief  Minister

responsible -  the  content of it.  The  whole  Budget

reeks of colonialism. The Hon. the Chief Minister has

told  us proudly, "This is your Government! I am  the

Government!  I  was elected! This is not  a  colonial

Government!"  Let  me  read to  the  Hon. the  Chief

Minister what he is, asking us in his Budget to pass.

Personal   Emoluments   $98   millions,   of    which

expatriation pay - one gets these figures by going page

by  page on an adding machine and churning it  out - is

$1.9  millions, approximately 2 per cent of the total

Personal   Emoluments:  Variable   Allowance,   which

everybody enjoys, $18 millions; Standstill Allowance,

$11,000;  Hotel  Allowance,  $328,000;  Entertainment

Allowance, $51,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Can we not read?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> There are other

allowances - Passages and Travelling. Does the Hon. the

Chief  Minister realise that he is asking us to  pass

under   the   Head: - Governor - "Household   Requisites,

Government  House, expenses $6,400; Upkeep  of  Motor

Cars, $7,000"?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then under the Head: Commissioner-General, Residence

Upkeep, $80,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Head: Assistant Commissioner-General for

Colonial  Affairs - Expenses of Office  and  Residence,

$123,000.    Then   we   have   under    the    Head:

Legislature - Upkeep  of Speaker's House  and  Grounds,

$8,000 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Is the hon.

Member   speaking  on  the  general  policy  of   the

Administration as contained in the Estimates?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Indeed, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member is not out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Even though he breaks his word, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Indeed! Chief Secretary's

Residence, $13,660, Chief Justice, $4,640 -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> This is the last time I will

believe you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I ceased to believe the Hon. the

Chief   Minister  long  ago,  Sir.  Under  the  Head: Governor,  we  find Allowances to Governor's  Deputy,

his  Private  Secretary, and his Aide-de-Camp.  Under

the  Head: Commissioner-General, we have the  Private

Secretary, Duty Allowance; Contribution to H.M.G. for

Salaries and Allowances of Household Staff. All  this

is democracy -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> It makes you drunk to -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Transport for the Government total

of  sums under each head $1 million: Governor $5,000;

Commissioner-General   $500;   Legislature    $1,500;

Supreme  Court $7,500; etc., totalling up $1 million.

What is this fantastic thing we are asked to pass? Is

this  democracy,  Sir? I know of  certain people  who

would  be delighted to read of this because  it  will

only renew their faith in that this constitutionalism

is  a lot of eye-wash. This is, in fact, colonialism,

legal  lawful  looting. The Hon. the  Chief  Minister

says  he believes that his civil service have carried

out   economies.  He  issued  a  directive  and  they

faithfully  carried  it  out.  Does  he   know,   for

instance,  how these economies were effected  in  the

Medical  Department? Medical Department economies - not

in   emoluments.  That  did  not  go  down.  Nor   in

appointments, because they are going to appoint  many

new  superscales, a fact which has set the  whole  of

the  senior  local  medical service  up  in  arms - all

superscale  posts  for  expatriates.  But  there  are

economies  by  reducing provisions - Medical,  Surgical

Equipment  and  Stores, General Hospital,  provisions

less   $125,000,  Medical,  Surgical  Equipment   and

Stores, less $13,800; Kandang Kerbau, provisions less

$129,000,  Medical,  Surgical Equipment  and  Stores,

less  $45,000;  Woodbridge, less $50,000,  Medicines,

less   $20,000:   Trafalgar  Home,  provisions   less

$77,700;    Medicines,   plus   $12,000;   Middleton,

provisions  plus $2,000, Medicines, less $4,000;  St.

Andrew's,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>



provisions  less  $10,000,  Medicines  less   $3,000;

Middle Road Clinic, provisions less $5,000, Medicines

less $5,700. A total reduction of about $400,000  for

provisions  and $76,700 for Medicines  and  Supplies.

The   Government   has  a  saving  of   $300,000   in

contribution  to the Hospitals Board, but  Provisions

and  Medicines are reduced by $471,000. That  is  the

economy.  I do not blame the Hon. the Chief Minister.

As  I  have  said in my opening, I can quite  believe

that  he, in fact, did not understand what his  civil

servants  were doing. But I say this is not the  kind

of  Administration  that we  want  because  it  is  a

matter -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Do you prefer an Administration

where people break their word and their undertaking?

officers.  Transients whose loyalties  are  elsewhere

and  who regard Malaya merely as a stepping stone  in

their  personal careers may be retained on  temporary

contracts coterminous with their utility."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some 25 new appointments which we have

tabled for amendment in the Bill in the Committee  of

Supply  which are all earmarked, and we  shall  prove

them  to  be  earmarked, for expatriates.  The  whole

Malayanisation policy is being defeated -

attacked by a left-wing Party because they have got a

right-wing Budget -

<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I squirm to see a Member break

his word.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please, this debate is getting

out  of  order. Hon. Members must remember that  they

are bound by Standing Orders, and however difficult a

<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to  apologise for these interruptions,  but  I  would

like   to  say  this.  There  is  such  a  thing   as

arrangements outside in respect of allocation of time

and I think you can understand, Sir, how sore we feel

that  there  should be a breach of such an agreement.

But I do regret -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do hope that perhaps the time will

come  when  we  will have an Opposition  Whip  and  a

the time -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> We did get together.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have a most

recalcitrant Chief Minister when he cannot get his

way. He asked me how long I would take. I said half

an hour to three quarters of an hour. It is about

three quarters of an hour now and I shall be stopping

very shortly in order to give his Ministers a chance

to say something before sentence is passed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole Budget is a total disappointment and the

Hon. the Chief Minister should be the first to

realise it. It is the same old form with the same old

expenses. When we last queried the Labour Front

Programme scheduled for four years, we were told,

"Oh, we should not be too quick about these things

because, after all, it is going to be spread over

four years." Mr Speaker, Sir, it is quite unlikely

that there will be more than one Budget which the Labour Front will introduce in 1956, if the Hon. the

Chief Minister keeps his word that he will quit in

1957 and have fresh elections. Of course, he may

not - we do not know. But, if there is only one more

Budget and if they do not retrieve themselves -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir, I

respectfully suggest, Sir -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order, Mr Chief Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> It is a point of order and I

suggest that the speaker is being offensive.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In what way, Mr Chief Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> In suggesting that I will not

keep my word.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I ask for a ruling on that, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> You are making it very difficult for

me, Mr Chief Minister. I have already indicated that

perhaps the hon. Member is engaging in flights of

rhetoric and I cannot really rule that what he has

said is, in fact, offensive within the meaning of the

Standing Orders.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am much obliged to you, Mr

Speaker, Sir, but what I wanted to point out to the

Hon. the Chief Minister in a polite way is that,

unless he does something about next year's Budget

before his Government goes out of office and faces

the electorate, he will have gone down as a phoney

Socialist -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> That is my business!

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Indeed, it is his business, Mr

Speaker, Sir -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Not your business!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Unfortunately, it concerns the

whole  country. And it concerns the People's  Action

Party,  because the policy of the Labour  Front  may

make the fight for a democratic constitution in this

Colony  successful or unsuccessful. I wish the  Hon.

the  Chief Minister, as he knows well, every success

but I wish to point out to him that what he is doing -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Keep your points to yourself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> - is not leading to a successful

conclusion of his Government's programme.  They  will

stand condemned unless they do something about it  in

the  very near future. They will stand condemned  for

having  moved, after all the promises, after all  the

rhetorics at which the Hon. the Chief Minister is  so

very  good,  a completely mundane, prosaic,  colonial

Budget.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> They can go back to the double-talking P.A.P.!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all

of us have enjoyed very much the wonderful and so far

the  hottest debate this morning till now, especially

the  speech delivered by the Member for Tanjong Pagar

(Mr  Lee  Kuan Yew). It looks as if he is  going  to

become once again the champion of the people. He made

the  criticism  that this Member was wrong  and  that

Member  was  wrong. It looks as if the  whole  House,

except  the Member for Tanjong Pagar, was saying  the

wrong thing!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sorry that I cannot say that the Member

for  Tanjong Pagar had said anything constructive.  I

have  to  confess that I feel very sorry  that  party

politics should have intruded into this House,  which

is  largely an elected Assembly, because this is very

harmful to the country. I sincerely hope that all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>



Members  of  this  House will put  away  their  party

interests  and  have the interests of the  people  of

Singapore at heart when taking part in this debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me get on with my humble speech. I am sure a

lot  of  you will find it very dull because I  cannot

speak  the Queen's English as well as the Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar  can. We have expected an  imaginative

programme  covering  public  works  development,  new

schemes  for fisheries and agriculture, measures  for

flood control and slum clearance for the poor people,

but the 1956 Budget has come as a big disappointment.

The  people  of Singapore have a right to expect  the

Labour Front Coalition Government -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, Mr Chief Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder if

you  will forgive this interruption. If I am to  have

an  opportunity  to  answer the various  observations

that  have  been made, I shall have  to  take  a  few

minutes  on the Government side, and I was wondering,

Sir,  if the House would permit, under the provisions

of  Standing  Order 71, suspension  of  the  Standing

Order empowering an adjournment of the debate on  the

Second Reading of the Budget at 4 p.m. and permit  it

to continue. Would you permit me, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can I have some indication as to how

many   other  Opposition  Members  desire  to  speak,

because  if  there are they should all be  given  the

opportunity too, so that if there is going  to  be  a

suspension of Standing Orders, then it should be  for

the benefit of all?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Several hon. Members having indicated their desire

to  speak by a show of hands, the</i><b> Chief Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you. Mr Speaker,

Sir,   may  I  respectfully  move  that,  under   the

provisions of Standing Order 71, the Standing  Orders

for  the  conclusion  of the sitting  at  4  p.m. be

suspended,  Sir, and that the debate  continue  today

until a vote is taken?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I must first have the general assent of

the  Assembly that that course be taken. As there  is

no dissenting voice, the motion can be put.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the present business be exempted

from  the provisions of Standing Orders 7 and 69  (2)

to enable it to be concluded," put, and agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please continue, Mr Lim Cher Kheng.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I think the people of Singapore

have  a  right  to  expect a Labour  Front  Coalition

Government that is no longer colonial in outlook  but

one that is conceived by the people's representatives

for  the  good  of the people, to make  comprehensive

plans  for  the  development of off-shore  fisheries,

institute    research   schemes   for    agricultural

development,  plan  flood control projects  in  rural

areas,  and  go into the problem of industrialisation

and  development of the country's natural  resources.

Only  by  the  encouragement of local  production  of

foodstuffs  and  expansion  of  industries  can  this

country be independent of other areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the field of education, the Labour Front

Coalition Government preceded the appointment  of  an

All-Party  Committee on Chinese  Education  with  the

much publicised announcement of its reorientation  in

attitude towards Chinese education, but this has  not

been   fully  reflected  in  the  1956  Budget.   The

appropriation for the grant-in-aid to Chinese schools

has  increased from $4,370,000 to about $10 millions,

but  out  of the total appropriation of $46  millions

for  the  education service for 1956, Chinese schools

only  receive slightly over 20 per cent. I fear  this

could  not  be  construed as  a  fair  and  equitable

distribution of funds, as Chinese schools cater to as

many  students  as  the  English  schools.  From  the

Estimates,  we understand that many new schools  will

be  built  in  1956, but we would like Government  to

clarify  in  more detail what types of schools  these

new ones will be.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sincerely hope that the Government will declare

its  stand  on  vernacular  education  in  clear  and

unequivocal  terms, for a fair and  equitable  policy

towards  all  races in their school development,  and

that  sufficient funds be allotted both in  grant-in-aid  as well as in capital expenditure. Only in  this

way can a fair and equitable policy be realised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us come to the medical services. In the Budget

we  could  not  trace any signs of increase,  or  any

chance  of  increase, in hospital beds. We  sincerely

hope  that  all  Hon. Ministers,  and  not  only  the

Minister for Health, will pay a personal visit to the

Outdoor  Patients Department of the General Hospital,

and  see  clearly for themselves what the  people  of

Singapore  are so much in need of in these  difficult

times.  And  then we hope that the elected Government

will  try  their best to cut down on  some  items  of

expenditure  which have been bitterly  criticised  by

Members  of the Opposition and do something of  which

the people of Singapore are really in need.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I do no think I could add anything more to  the

general  feeling in this House that the Labour  Front

has  not  translated  its claims  of  Socialism  into

financial terms.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Speak for yourself!



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> The colonial officials that

stand  behind  the Government have,  I  am  sure,  no

objections  to  the Socialist speeches  made  by  the

Chief  Minister if it will fool the people, but  they

will surely object to Socialist action. And the Chief

Minister  probably  finds  that  he  will   have   to

displease  his friends, and so we have a Budget  that

is no different from many that came before this. When

expenditure  envisaged by this Budget  is  completed,

the  Labour Front would have had 20 months of office,

that  is, if no more revolt takes place in the Party.

The  Labour  Front Programme - the four-year  one - would

still be unborn -

<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Who prepared your speech?



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> I did.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> Probably all the Socialist

promises by the Labour Front are going to be  crowded

into  the  last 28 months of its term  if  the  Chief

Minister calls for new elections in 1957, as  he  has

promised.  Then, of course, he can claim he  did  not

have  the  time to fulfil his promises - I mean,  those

promises  that he did not have to break for the  good

of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people living in the rural areas, I am sure,

must  be  happy to know that the Government considers

the Rural Board self-sufficient. Increased rates will

not  mean  improved services but just a reduction  of

Government expenditure. This is indeed a novel way of

fulfilling the promises made during the elections. It

is a new way of rural development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the expenditure in the Development Estimates,

I  am  afraid I do not see the purpose of  allocating

$4.4  millions if more than $2.5 millions is unlikely

to  be spent. I refer to page 8 in Cmd. Paper No. 28.

This,  I think, is cheap deception but the Government

has -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. The hon. Member must

not   use  the  words  "cheap  deception"  here  with

the Government. Will he please withdraw those words?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> He is a P.A.P., Sir!

please withdraw the words "cheap deception"?



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> I withdraw the words "cheap

deception",  but the Government has so  much  to  be

ashamed of that it might not matter to them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Ching Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Ching Siong (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Labour Front claims to be Socialist. It is always

talking about its Socialist programme, but what I

want to know is, does the Labour Front consider this

Budget a Socialist Budget?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> A beginning.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Ching Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Ching Siong:</b> Can the Chief Minister, with

his  capacity  for  self-deception, convince  himself

that it is really a Socialist Budget?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Point of order, Sir. As the P.A.P. -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order. Sit down, please, Mr Chief Minister -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> - is very fond of deception, I

would like to counter it.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps the Member for Bukit Timah did

not  hear me when I reproved the hon. Member who last

spoke when he used the word "deception". It is not  a

parliamentary word and I must ask him to withdraw it.

He must not use the word "deception".



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Ching Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Ching Siong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I withdraw

it.  I  do  not  want to give a lesson  in  Socialist

economics.  The Nominated Minister for Communications

and Works will do that.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Can you?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Ching Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Ching Siong:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. I know that the whole

debate is becoming very trying, but can I remind hon.

Members of another Standing Order? I have referred to

quite  a number of them today, but the Standing Order

I have in mind is Standing Order 37 (4) which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"While a Member is speaking all other Members shall

be silent and shall not make unseemly interruptions."



<br><br>Carry on, Mr Lim Ching Siong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Ching Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Ching Siong:</b> I will point out to the

Nominated Minister for Communications and Works  (Mr

Thomas)  that  a  Socialist  Budget  must  aim  at  a

redistribution of income. This is generally  done  by

an  increase in direct taxes and increase  in  social

services. The Chief



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>



Minister  probably knows that this  Budget  does  not

even attempt this. After all, it was drawn up by  the

Hon. the  Financial  Secretary,  who  is  neither  a

Socialist nor a member of the Labour Front. He  is  a

colonial  official. Therefore, we can have  Socialist

speeches  by  the Chief Minister while the  Financial

Secretary quietly gives us a colonial Budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Estimates of Expenditure

proposed  show  clearly that the basic  policy  of  a

colonial  government can never change.  It  does  not

matter  who carries out the policy or who appears  in

this  House  and  offers the justifications  and  the

apologies.  It does not matter whether they  are  the

Progressives or the Labour Front. Nor does it  matter

whether   they   call   themselves   Socialists    or

capitalists. If they accept the colonial system, then

their  programmes are always the same. They  may  use

different words to explain the same things. They  may

think  that  they  can fool the  people  with  pretty

words, but action will show they are humbugs and that

is what this Budget shows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colonial policy has been to encourage English

education  and  cut the people of this  country  from

their  cultures and traditions, so that they will  be

really  stooges of the colonial masters, and so  that

they  will be cut away from the masses of the  people

and have no choice but to throw in their lot with the

foreigners  they have been taught to ape. The  Labour

Front is carrying on this policy -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> You lie!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Ching Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Ching Siong:</b> $59 millions is to be spent on

education.  This  includes  $11.4  millions  in   the

Development  Estimates.  Out  of  this,   only   $1.7

millions  will be spent on Malay education and  Malay

schools, but even all this money will not be spent on

Malay education. $600,000, or one-third of it, is for

the  purpose  of  teaching English in Malay  schools.

This  means only $1.1 millions, or less than two  per

cent,  will be spent on the teaching of the  national

language.  We  see in the Development Estimates  that

$35  millions  is  being spent by  the  Public  Works

Department  for  building  schools.  Of   this   sum,

$300,000, or less



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>



than  one  per cent, is being spent on Malay schools.

Of  the  $10  millions  that is  to  be  voted,  only

$50,000, or half per cent, is for Malay schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the building of Chinese schools, the

Government does not even plan to spend a single cent.

The  Singapore Chinese Girls School, which is to  get

$20,000  from the Education Board, is not  a  Chinese

school. It is an English language school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are told to expect great things from the All-Party Report on Education. We can see in the Budget

proposals  here  what the Labour Front  thinks  about

national  education, or at least what their back-seat

drivers think. This shows us that we must not  expect

anything from the Report. It will be one more of  the

Labour  Front's promises that have to be  broken  "in

the  interests  of this country"; but,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir, let me tell the Government and the Minister  for

Education that they cannot fool the people  by  their

pretty speeches -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> We leave that to the P.A.P.!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Ching Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Ching Siong:</b> The people know them for what

they are. They know that these men are just spokesmen

for  the colonial government. Their thinking is  done

for  them by their European officials. Therefore, Mr

Speaker, Sir, may I advise the Minister for Education

to  have the courage to withdraw this insult  to  the

people  of  this country and offer us an estimate  of

expenditure on education that will meet our  national

aspirations?  Let  me  suggest  that  he  does   some

thinking instead of having it all done for him by the

colonial officials.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before I sit down, I would like to

draw your attention and the attention of the Minister

for  Health  to  some of the items in the  Estimates.

Cmd. Paper No. 28 boasts that because of economies in

expenditure,   it   has  been  possible   to   reduce

Government's  contribution to  the  Hospitals  Board.

What  are these major economies? Expenditure on  food

and  medicines for patients has been reduced.  Nearly

$500,000 have been saved in this way. I would like to

know how many Members of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>



Government are proud of such an economy? Is the Chief

Minister proud of it? Or did he not know?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> We have heard, Mr Speaker, Sir, from

the Member for Bukit Timah (Mr Lim Ching Siong) that

he  believes the thinking of the Government  is  done

for them by colonial officials. It is not, of course,

the  case,  but  I certainly think a very  good  case

could  be made out to provide some colonial officials

to  do the thinking for the Opposition, because their

thinking  is  really very poor quality  indeed.  They

could  well  do with some to write their  briefs  for

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of my work on flood control, I was

reading  recently a little article by Chang Wen-kuang

of the Paoting Special District in People's China. He

did  not  teach me much about flood control,  but  he

made one very useful remark on general principles. He

objected  very  strongly, Mr  Speaker,  to  "certain

people who pay no heed to the existing situation  and

formulate their plans blindly"; and I feel that these

words  "pay  no  heed to the existing  situation  and

formulate   their  plans  blindly"  might   well   be

embroidered  on a banner and hung over the  heads  of

the  Opposition, because I have seldom heard so  many

speeches  which took no account of the situation  and

which,  as  far  as  they  formulate  at  all,   were

formulated with a more than myopic blindness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are one or two points of detail with which I

would  like to deal but I think, first, I might clear

up  a misapprehension in the minds of the Opposition.

It  has appeared again and again. I expected it  from

the - is it still Progressive or are they merged? I  do

not know. We still use the word Progressive -



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Keep to your point.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> The anonymous Parties of the Right. I

expected  from  them that they would  not  know  what

Socialism  is  about, but I am disappointed  to  find

that the Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew),

and following



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>



him  other Members of his group, also lashed out,  in

misapprehension, at the nature of Socialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to give a lecture on Socialist

economics although I have been invited to  do  so  by

the Member for Bukit Timah, but I do think they ought

to  find out what they are talking about before  they

talk.  Socialism  is not a welfare state.  A  welfare

state  is  not Socialism. A welfare state  may  be  a

transition  stage where a Socialist arrives  at  some

point. In Russia, the welfare state is still "pie  in

the sky". The Russian Socialist Government imposes  a

very  low  standard  of living in  the  interests  of

accumulating   more  capital.  Communist   China   is

following  on  the same lines. In Great Britain,  the

Democratic   Socialists - the  Labour   Party - put   the

welfare state first and progress towards other  parts

of  Socialism  later. It is a complete mistake - and  I

say  it  with  regret because I thought we  had  some

people  in  the  Opposition who knew  what  Socialism

was - to  believe that the welfare state is  the  first

objective  of Socialism. It is not. I cannot  give  a

full  lecture  on  Socialism but in this  context  of

Budget  work  the  essential facet of  Socialism,  on

which  I  will  ask the so-called Socialists  of  the

Opposition to fix their minds, is that we must  apply

the  techniques  of  technology  and  planning  on  a

national  scale.  That is the basic  facet  on  which

other aspects of Socialism are going to depend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amiable suggestion by the Member for Tanjong

Pagar  that all the money in the world that we  could

possibly  raise  be instantly seized  and  spent - "$60

millions on flood control! Have it straightaway! Good

heavens,  give it to the City area alone! Never  mind

the  rest of the island! Let us put $60 millions into

the  City  area!  We have not got a plan  yet?  Never

mind! Spend the money! There is no need to have plans

and no need to survey the island! No need to find out

where the water comes from and where it goes to!  No,

just  spend the money! No need of putting it  in  the

Budget   at   all!  Have  some  boldness,   audacity,

temerity,  courage! Do not run away!" Oh,  it  was  a

lovely speech! What he meant by it was just



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>



nothing at all. Does he seriously think that  we  are

going  to spend $60 millions without having a  proper

survey  and a proper plan? He may be a man  who  does

that sort of thing, but I certainly do not think that

a responsible government can do it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> How about getting the plans quicker?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I have already informed the House - I

think  the hon. Member was present - that planning  and

surveying throughout the year has been going  on  and

one   plan  has  been  presented  and  is  now  being

implemented.  Next Wednesday the plan  will  go  into

action  to deal with the small-scale flooding in  the

Bedok-Ketapang area, and that is the first stage.  It

is  a  relatively  small  thing.  It  does  not  cost

$123,000  as he thought. It costs $523,000, $400,000

more.  He  has not studied the Estimates  with  quite

enough  care perhaps to see what the total  cost  is,

but that is the total cost as shown in the Estimates.

If  he  or the Member for Tanglin, who talks on  such

similar  lines, would like to come along  at  8  a.m.

next  Wednesday,  the 23rd, to the 8th  mile,  Changi

Road,  I will arrange that they can come with me  and

see  the  start  of  a nice little  flood  prevention

scheme  for that little area. They will have time  to

get   back  and  change  before  the  Assembly  meets

afterwards, I hope.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, since I am talking about flooding, I might

mention another aspect because this is one thing that

several   Members  have  spoken  about.  I  am   also

arranging  for the Chief Drainage Engineer  to  visit

Lorong  Tai Seng shortly and to give a little lecture

to the farmers on what they can do in the way of self-help.  They  have  made  some  attempt  at  self-help

already,  but unfortunately they did not  quite  know

what  to do. They did it rather the wrong way, but  I

hope  shortly  to be able to arrange,  now  that  the

levels have been taken, that they can be apprised  of

what they have to do to help themselves. I shall  try

to be present for that lecture and if any hon. Member

would like to come,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>



I  am  sure  the people of Lorong Tai Seng  would  be

delighted to see him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main problem about this flood prevention is one

which   I   have  explained  before,  but  it   seems

impossible for the Opposition to grasp it. It is that

you  have got to get the water off the island. It  is

no  use  merely shifting the water from one place  to

another  on the island and drying one place in  order

to  drown  another. You have got to get  it  off  the

island.  Now,  the development of Singapore  is  such

that you find roads running across all the points  at

which  the water has to get away. You will also  find

in  housing  estates all kinds of complications.  You

cannot  just dig a whacking great drain out  to  sea: you  cannot  get the water away without very  costly,

and  very lengthy works. In due course, Flood Control

reports will be available and they will be tabled  in

this  House. Members can then discuss them. They  can

look  into  the cost involved and if the  Member  for

Tanjong Pagar feels so strongly that $60 millions for

flood prevention is chicken feed or peanuts, well, by

all  means let him get up and urge that we spend  the

money and justify it against all the other costs that

will  have  to be met as well. If he is so  confident

the  money is there, perhaps he will show us  how  to

get it and advise - oh, very cleverly - advise us how  to

dispose of our available money without depriving  any

other essential Government service of the money which

it needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Tanglin raised a point about the

extravagance in Government building. He was very much

disturbed  because  he said that the  Government  had

done nothing, since it came into office, to deal with

this  problem  of  extravagance in building  and  the

wasteful  use  of materials. He made quite  a  heart-rending  little  speech about it.  Unfortunately,  he

does  not  know what he is talking about. If  he  had

asked  me  beforehand, "Have you done  anything?",  I

would have given him all the details, but he has  not

asked  me  and so he has exposed himself to  a  reply

which I hope will give him great satisfaction.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was very soon after we came into office that we

first  started  discussing  the  cost  of  Government

buildings, because it was obvious that we  would  not

have  enough  available funds to deal  with  all  the

things  that had to be done, and it was obvious  that

we could cut something off the cost of building. Some

months  ago  a  file was opened in my  Ministry.  The

matter  has been discussed and dealt with and we  now

have taken what, in effect, is a complete overhaul of

the  machinery by which plans for buildings are dealt

with.  We  have  the Public Works Standing  Committee

which has been given additional powers to ensure that

planning  is  not wasteful, and to ensure  that  when

heads  of departments put up a scheme, they will  not

put  up an extravagant or unnecessary scheme. We also

have  a special Working Party on the cost of building

schools. We  also have a special working party on the cost  of

building  medical units - hospitals and other  medical

buildings -  and  finally we are  in  the  process  of

setting  up  a high level Advisory Panel representing

the  Government,  the  City  Council,  the  Singapore

Improvement Trust and private experts who will advise

the   Government;  firstly,  on  means  of   reducing

building  costs  in general; and,  secondly,  on  any

project  which  is  scheduled to cost  more  than  $1

million.  So  when the Member for Tanglin  says  that

nothing  has been done, I can only tell  him  that  a

great  deal has been done and I hope, in due  course,

he will see the fruits -



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> When?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Well, that is the point I am just coming

to.  You see, here again, you have this thing of  not

heeding    existing   conditions   and    formulating

criticisms  blindly. If you will  think  of  it,  any

project necessarily involves a year or even two years

in  the  planning  stage before the  actual  building

starts  to  go up. If our Working Party  said,  "This

school  has just got the foundations laid out but  we

are  now  going to cut it out. Or we will  decide  to

have  the classroom a little bit smaller or  take  a

little



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>



bit  off the width of the corridors", you would  tear

up  a  year's work, tear up your contracts. You would

be  frightfully  wasteful and  uneconomic.  The  only

thing to do is to put your Committee to work on  your

future planning, meanwhile carrying out your existing

plans,  except that when they are at an  early  stage

they  can be changed. Therefore, it is impossible,  I

am  afraid,  to promise you that when a Committee  is

set  up  today,  there  will be no  more  extravagant

building  tomorrow, because although you  could  stop

the  extravagant  building  you  would  also  put   a

complete  stop to the whole building programme,  and,

therefore, it is necessary to take time. I know  that

time is a thing which the Opposition is reluctant  to

allow  us, but I am afraid they will have to  put  up

with it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other point about the so-called

extravagance  of  Government  buildings.   You   must

remember  that  the Government builds in  the  public

interests  and has to maintain buildings from  public

funds,  and  if  the buildings fall  down  or  become

unusable,  they will have to be replaced from  public

funds.  But the private builder does not do that.  He

builds  largely  for sale, and the maintenance  costs

and  so on then fall on the purchaser who, if  he  is

foolish  enough to buy a house that falls  down,  has

apparently  very  little  remedy  in  Singapore.  The

Government  should not go below a certain  reasonable

standard of permanence and soundness of construction,

or  else  we  will  be  faced year  after  year  with

additional and unnecessary costs for maintenance  and

repair, and finally we will be faced with high  costs

of replacement at an early date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That deals with the major points raised by the

Opposition  on  the things that concern  my  Ministry

most,  but I think I might deal briefly perhaps  with

another  thing. There seems to be some  confusion  in

their minds in that a lot of references were made  to

the  social services, and it is with reluctance  that

I,   once   again,  feel  myself  impelled  to   give

instruction  to  the Opposition. I  wish  they  would

instruct themselves and then we shall all save  time.

It would be, to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>



my   mind,   unwise  to  lash  out  into  extravagant

expenditure  on social services until  you  have  got

what stands first in our Labour Front Programme,  and

that is a survey of the national wealth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Great Britain, you have got a reasonably adequate

survey  machinery. The economists complained that  it

was  not  adequate but they managed to  produce  some

figures all the same, and they were able to say  that

the  total  capital expenditure on  fixed  assets  in

Great  Britain  was so many hundred millions  in  one

year,  and so many thousand millions in another year.

As  you  could  break  that  down  into  the  various

headings  under which it was spent, you can then  see

how  much  you are actually spending on fixed  assets

for  social  services. In Great Britain,  the  social

services, as a whole, come to around 30 per  cent  of

the  total  capital expenditure on all fixed  assets,

and  of  that 30 per cent, about 23 per cent goes  on

housing. I have not got the detailed figures. I  have

them  available in my bag but I will not  waste  your

time with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Housing is a very, very essential social service. It

is  almost  basic  in  the social  service  programme

because,  unless you get your housing done,  you  are

going to have a slum population and a slum population

is  a  political  and economic liability.  Some  slum

dwellers   in   Singapore - a  remarkable   number   of

them - manage  to  rise  above  their  environment  and

maintain   proper   standards   of   behaviour    and

cleanliness, character formation and so  on,  but  by

and  large, the pressure of life in the slum is  such

that,  scientifically speaking,  it  does  cause  the

population to deteriorate as human material. You  get

an  irresponsible,  unemployable,  uneducable,  dull,

backward,   and  criminal  population  which   is   a

permanent  liability to that part of  the  population

which  is  employable and productive and it  is  most

important that you should get rid of your slums as  a

matter of first priority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education and health services are, of course, social

services.  I do not think we need deal with  them  at

very great length, but what you should not forget



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>



are  the basic social services without which all  the

others  could not exist. Those basic social  services

are  water,  light,  roads, fire services,  drainage,

sewerage,   telephones,  postal  services,   prisons,

harbours,  airports,  barracks and  accommodation  of

that  kind,  and all the offices and equipment  which

the  public service needs. These are often overlooked

but they are, in fact, basic social services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the last "blind formulation" of the Opposition

which  I would like to deal with came, if I recollect

rightly, from the Member for Tanjong Pagar, I  think.

He  addressed  us with all the bounce and  the  jolly

cheekiness of a sixth form schoolboy in his  debating

society.  He  made his usual little  joke  about  the

Member for Tanglin Club (Mr Sutherland). He has made

it  about ten times now. It still amuses him although

it has become rather stale to the rest of us. He made

his usual little jeers and some jibes and he promised

us  a lot of constructive criticism. But when it came

to  the  point, nothing constructive emerged  at  all

except  what  he  had  copied  from  the  Member  for

Tanglin.   There  is  a  very  remarkable  similarity

between their two speeches -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Dear me, dear me!



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> And you may well say, "Dear me", because

it  was  really quite pathetic. I thought, hopefully,

that  soon after the little jokes, he would get  down

to  something constructive. But, Mr Speaker, Sir, we

got nothing constructive except a wild statement that

you  could impose taxation; you could do a  lot;  you

could tax up to the maximum; you could mortgage  your

future;  borrow up to the hilt - I do not know how  you

propose to pay - ten per cent or twenty per cent on the

money  you are borrowing? What rate are you going  to

pay?  Well, do not mind about that! Borrow the money!

It  does  not matter what it costs! Let  us  get  the

money  in!  Spend it at once! Never  mind  about  the

future because the present is so terrible! We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>



cannot get on! Well, it is a point of view, but it is

not  a  very fruitful one. What he was aiming  at,  I

think,  was a Socialist redistribution of  income  in

which  we  were  going to arrive  at  an  egalitarian

society.  I  think I am representing  him  correctly.

Well,  he is not certainly going to redistribute  our

income  very  rapidly by those techniques  of  fiscal

policy. The effect of his redistribution would be  to

distribute  our income to all the other countries  of

the  world  and  to  leave us in a  state  of  abject

poverty.  I do not think that that was his intention,

but that would probably be the result of the sort  of

fiscal policy which he envisaged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the egalitarian side of it, we might all be

left  in an equal state of misery and poverty, but  I

do  not think that is what he wanted us to be  in.  I

think  he  would  prefer us all to be prosperous  and

well.  In any case, the egalitarian idea is one which

is accepted by practically no Socialists in the world

today, except a few armchair Socialists. It has  been

abandoned  in Russia most emphatically. It  is  being

rapidly  abandoned  in  China.  It  has  never   been

accepted  in Great Britain. It was never accepted  in

Australia under its Labour Government. In fact, I  do

not  think  you can point to any place in  the  world

where  the  egalitarian idea remains in the Socialist

programme.  Whether  it  is possible  is  one  thing.

Whether  it  is  desirable  is  another.  But  as  an

immediate objective for a Socialist Government, I  do

not think it has got any value at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  sat  here  in  the morning  and  heard  with

considerable surprise some of the speeches.  Most  of

the  speakers are not known for their Left-wing views

and  yet  they  seem  to be more Socialist  than  the

Labour  Front.  The Progressives have become  greater

champions of the under-dog than the Socialists of the

Labour   Front.   Mr   Sutherland,   the   Nominated

representative  of  capitalism, is  the  champion  of

increase  in  income tax while the Labour  Front  can

only call out "Peace in the sky".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> "Pie in the sky"!



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> What has happened? They are out-labouring the Labour Front, just like the

Progressives  did  during  the  Assistant   Ministers

crisis. Probably the Government is happy at the  turn

of  events.  Now  there are no major difficulties  to

extend the Coalition. There will be no need for soul-searching  and  justification. The  Progressives  and

Democrats can join up with the Labour Front.  It  may

be  that these Parties will have watered down some of

their  Socialism  to accommodate  the  Labour  Front.

After  all,  the Progressives planned to build  seven

district  hospitals, or was it only six?  The  Labour

Front has only one to offer us - that a paper one,  not

a house made of bricks but a paper one. It reminds me

of a paper motor car they burn at Chinese funerals. I

hope  this  hospital is not made for burning  at  the

political  funeral  of  the  Labour  Front.  If   the

Government  goes on at the rate they have been  going

till now, the funeral will not be far away.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government seems to have forgotten that a large

number of people live in the rural districts and with

all sorts of services. All of it cannot be done in  a

year, but we expect to see a start. It is the absence

of  this that has disappointed most of us. They  need

pipe  water,  electricity and medical  services.  The

Budget  does  not  show that the Government  is  even

thinking  in these terms. The Government thinks  that

it  has to deal with a standstill Budget. They  spend

the  same amount of money as they did last year.  But

they  seem to forget that the population in the rural

areas  is  not at all at a standstill. It is  growing

and  therefore per capita expenditure is reduced. The

services  available to the people in the rural  areas

will  be  reduced. Therefore, it is a retreat  Budget

and not a standstill one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About a month ago, the Hon. the Minister for

Communications and Works (Mr Thomas)  informed  this

House  that nearly $60 millions is needed  for  flood

control. But in this Budget, they want to spend  only $163,000 -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Copy cat! It is $500,000.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1051</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> $163,000 is mentioned. Flood

control  should  have more priority  than  a  Special

Branch building. Probably as far as the Government is

concerned, the Special Branch is more important  than

flood control. After all, flood control can only save

farmers from a periodic loss of all their belongings,

while  the  Special  Branch  can  help  to  save  the

Government from political opponents -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> You are a dishonest liar!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. If it is a point of

order, Mr Chief Minister, please rise on a point  of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> - a thing that is going to be

progressively important.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Is the

Member permitted to read from somebody else's speech?



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> Nonsense!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have noticed that the Member for

Ponggol-Tampenis is probably referring to his notes a

little too frequently. But please carry on, Mr Goh.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> A thing that is going to be

progressively  important as more  and  more  election

promises are broken.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

had  not  intended to speak this afternoon,  but  the

remarks  of  the Hon. the Minister for Communications

and  Works  have prompted me to do so. He  says  that

building of all these works takes time. We agree that

it  takes  time but we also must think of  the  money

that is going to be spent next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Budget, we have now a sum of approximately

$30 millions provided for expenditure under the Head:

Public  Works  Non-Recurrent.  Now,  why  do  we  not

propose  to ask for this amount to be cut  down?  The

answer is because we also realise that today we  have

to  look  after  the under-privileged, and  everybody

will  have to face up to taxation. Still, we want  to

see  that,  for  the expenditure of  this  amount  of

money,   we   must   have   at   least   double   the

ac-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>



commodation.  During the last few  years,  we  have

heard  the Public Works Department lower the cost  of

quarters  for  the rank and file of the  Police  from

$10,000  to  $5,000  each.  This  is  a  very   great

achievement and, to my mind, there is no  reason  why

such standards cannot be applied to the quarters  now

designed or provided in the Estimates for Division  I

Officers,  or  for  Police Superintendents  for  whom

provision of $45,000 per quarter has been made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now unless we do so and do it straightaway, we are

going  to throw away millions and millions of dollars

which  we  can  ill  afford today. Strangely  enough,

during the last two occasions, I have found myself in

agreement with the Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr  Lee

Kuan  Yew) when he said that a change in the name  of

the department must involve a change of heart. I must

ask  the  Minister and his officers to  look  at  the

whole   programme  of  development  in  an   entirely

different light. Do not think that because you put up

substantial  buildings, like Fullerton  Building,  on

which a tremendous amount of money has been spent, or

substantial buildings like the General Hospital,  you

are going to save maintenance expenditure, because in

the  Estimates  there is $1,200,000 to  be  spent  on

renovation  and alteration to Fullerton Building  and

$2  millions  for the General Hospital.  Now,  is  it

necessary  to spend all this money on renovation  and

alteration? What saving is there to have  built  such

huge  buildings  to  last  a  thousand  years?  None,

because  we  have  now to spend $3,200,000  which  is

exactly  the  amount which will be required  for  the

very,  very  urgent district hospital at Kallang  for

which   only  $100,000  has  been  provided  in   the

Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to take up this question of the district

hospital at Kallang. About two years ago, after a lot

of  complaints that people had to travel a  long  way

through  a  crowded  town to  get  treatment  at  the

General  Hospital, especially for those who  live  in

the Katong and Serangoon areas, the Progressive Party

suggested  that, as soon as the Terminal Building  of

the Kallang Airport was vacated, it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>



should  be turned into a district hospital. I do  not

know  why  this  has  been  completely  turned  down.

Immediately after the election, I think the Hon. the

Chief  Minister said that this building was going  to

be  used  as a transit camp for persons displaced  by

fire  or by a benevolent Government who want to build

new  houses. I think someone has since persuaded  him

that  this  building is too good  to  be  used  as  a

transit camp. I ask, what use is this going to be put

to?  I  find that it is to be used not as a  district

hospital   but  as  headquarters  for   the   Malayan

Auxiliary Air Force.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> It is down in the Estimates. Very

well, if I am wrong I will withdraw this point.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Only the hangar.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Very well. I will not pursue this

point  if  I  am  wrong. Reading the Estimates,  that

appears  to  be  so.  But  I do  maintain  that  this

building is eminently suitable as a district hospital

and  it  can  be  started within  three  months.  The

provision  of  $1  million to convert  this  building

would  turn  it into a first-class hospital  and  the

other   $2   millions  could  be  used  for  district

hospitals which are sorely needed in the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urgently request that the Minister try and

change  the  whole system of building. I myself  have

taken it up as a hobby and I know there are ways  and

means  of putting up a building which can be done  at

half the cost of what is being done today without any

danger of collapse.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, once before I said that  hon.  Members

used  to  come  here with prepared speeches  and,  in

fact,  talk  nonsense.  In  this  connection,  I   am

dismayed  to  see that some Members have not  studied

the Budget, have not studied the Estimates at all, or

even  read  them  correctly. I am  referring  to  the

remark  made by the Member for Bukit Timah  (Mr  Lim

Ching Siong) that only $300,000 is provided



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>



for  Malay  schools.  Well, he  should  know,  as  an

elected  Member of this Assembly, that Malay  schools

are  Government schools. The $300,000 referred to  by

him  appears  under  Head D  48,  subhead  5  in  the

Development    Estimates.    It    clearly     reads: "Improvements and Extensions to Malay Schools".  That

does  not  indicate that the Government is  going  to

spend $300,000 on building one school or two schools.

It   is   going   to  be  spent  on  extensions   and

improvements  to  the  existing  Malay  schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede), and I think the Member

for  Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong), referred to  the

fact  that  no  new provision has  been  put  in  the

Estimates  for  secondary  schools.  Well,   no   new

provision is required because $1,200,000 is available

as  a revote from 1955. It would be unrealistic if  I

were  to  put  in  a figure of, say, half  a  million

dollars  for two schools when actually the Government

cannot  hope  to construct those buildings.  Now,  we

have - and this formed part of my answer last  time,  I

think - seven secondary schools. Two will be  completed

in   1956  and  plans  have  been  started  for   the

construction of two more secondary schools. I  should

tell hon. Members that we put into the Estimates what

the  Public Works Department can do during the  year,

instead  of  putting in some unrealistic  figure  and

thus  boost  up an unrealistic deficit. I  would  not

claim credit for that kind of thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin also says that in Group A in

the  Development Estimates there are 36 schools,  and

the  cost of each averages $10,000 less than that  of

the  18  schools in Group B, but he forgets the  fact

that  the cost is determined not only by the building

but  also  by  piling, the approach roads  and  other

factors.  Foundations  may raise  the  cost  in  some

cases, and extensions to road work may increase it in

other  cases.  So it is impossible to  lay  down  the

average  cost  just  by dividing  the  amount  of  $8

millions by 36 schools and $4 millions by 18 schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Seletar (Mr Nair) criticised

Government  for  a  project to  build  a  $2  million

library and bemoaned the fact that Government has not

provided any branches. Well, I would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>



suggest  to  the hon. Member that he read his  papers

daily and that Government has, in fact, three library

branches - one at Serangoon, one at Joo Chiat  and  one

at Siglap -



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Still inadequate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> No travelling libraries are at

present  run  by the Library but it is intended  that

there  should  be, though the travelling  and  branch

libraries would not, in my opinion - and I am supported

by  a most efficient Librarian - reduce the need for  a

central library.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Member for Bukit Timah criticised the

Government  for  not spending a single  cent  on  any

secondary school, I think his idea was only to invite

publicity. I would advise him to come to me  for  the

information that he wants, which is that in Group  C,

out  of  the  18 schools, one will be for  a  primary

Chinese  school  and another for a secondary  Chinese

school.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b>Mr

Speaker,  Sir, it has been pointed out by  some  hon.

Members today that nothing constructive has come from

the  Opposition in spite of the very lengthy speeches

that  we  have  heard.  That sentiment  I  thoroughly

endorse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only constructive - if it may be called

constructive - suggestion that has been made is by  the

Member  for  Paya  Lebar  (Mr  Lim  Koon  Teck)   in

connection with the use of the Airport Terminal as  a

hospital which I shall deal with in due course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon was very free with his

criticisms of the Medical Department. I can only  say

that he and also the Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede) are

quite  used  to  casting  and  slinging  mud  without

ascertaining  facts. It is a hobby and a  habit  with

them. The Member for Serangoon made a statement  that

despite  alterations,  as the Budget  shows - Expenses,

Alterations and Additions to Hospitals - there is not a

single increase in beds. That is absolutely wrong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Give me your figures.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> All alterations are designed to increase

the  number  of beds. In the General Hospital,  every

alteration has increased beds. Additional beds  as  a

result  of alterations and additions are 75. That  is

an exact figure, although the return from the General

Hospital showed about 107. I am being conservative in

saying that the increase there by alterations  is  75

beds.  This  figure does not include the  new  Mistri

Wing  of 300 beds. Alterations and additions are  now

commencing in Kandang Kerbau Hospital to provide  for

extra beds.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> How many beds?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Come to me on another day and I will give

you  that  information. Another remark he made  as  a

result  of his rather loose thinking is the  question

of  wards being built with air-conditioning.  Let  me

assure him that the new air-conditioned wards in  the

General  Hospital  for first-class  and  second-class

patients  completed early this year were  planned  by

the  previous Government. It is the intention of this

Government to provide one class of accommodation  for

patients  with minimum comforts, and air-conditioning

for medical purposes only. Those who wish to have air-conditioning   will   have  to  seek   that   amenity

elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further statement he made which is wrong and which

I  wish to correct him is the creation of extra posts

in  the Budget. He gave as an example posts for  five

Radiologists. It is necessary to create  extra  posts

even though there are still vacancies because we  are

sending our locally domiciled medical men abroad  for

further  education  (for F.R.C.S. degrees)  to  fill

higher  posts, and it is therefore necessary to  have

these posts vacant when they return. Let me refer the

hon.  Member to the White Paper No. 40 of 1954  which

was  a  report  of  the former Government  under  the

chairmanship, I think, of Sir Han Hoe Lim, and  which

report was adopted. It said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is necessary, of course, to ensure that when the

four  officers are sent on scholarships, there  shall

be vacancies for promotion on their return."



<br><br>On  the  5th  of July, 1954, that was implemented  by

another circular from the Chief Secretary:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That in making proposals for the award of

scholarships   to   their   departments,   heads   of

departments are required to ensure that there will be

vacancies  to which the scholars may be  promoted  on

their  return to duty after the successful completion

of their course of study."



<br><br>Later,  this directive was further amplified by  this

Government   on  the  17th  of  August,  1955,   when

referring to scholarships. It said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The basis for award is that the individual officer

shall  be assisted thereby to gain an Honours  degree

or  equivalent primary qualification which will  make

him  eligible  for immediate promotion  to  a  higher

appointment in the public service",



<br><br>and referring to the Fellowship courses, it stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The basis for award is that the individual officer

on not becoming immediately eligible for promotion on

the  successful  completion of his  course  of  study

shall  be  assisted  to attain  the  necessary  post-selection  or  postgraduate or  special  professional

qualification  for  eventual promotion  to  a  higher

grade of post."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It therefore follows that if, in any one case, it is

decided by this Assembly to delete the provision  for

a  new superscale post, the effect will be to prevent

local officers proceeding overseas for higher studies

during the coming year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we will go to the reference made to the hospital

at  Kallang which has been loosely referred to by the

Member  for Tanglin (Mr Ede), and I believe  by  the

Member  for Ponggol-Tampenis (Mr Goh Chew Chua)  who

called  it a paper hospital. I can only suggest  that

the  Member  for Ponggol-Tampenis is used to  burning

paper houses as a hobby. I have already made a public

announcement that the Government intends to  build  a

district hospital, and since my filling the  post  as

Minister for Health, I have sought proper sites.  The

first  site we thought that might be used was one  in

Katong Road, somewhere near the Post Office, which is

a  coconut  plantation, but we found it a little  too

small and required a lot of piling. Subsequently,  we

thought  that the site on the vacated Kallang Airport

would  be a useful one and after tests had been made,

we  found it suitable. The Member for Paya Lebar (Mr

Lim  Koon  Teck) suggested that the Airport  Terminal

could be used for a hospital.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>



Let me assure him that it is much, much too small  to

be  used  as  a  hospital. The site that  I  hope  to

acquire and on which I hope to build my hospital when

plans  are ready comprises an area of fifteen  acres.

The  Member for Paya Lebar says that he has taken  up

building as a hobby. I think it is more than a  hobby

when  he  suggested  that  we  should  build  cheaper

hospitals and I can assure him that we do not require

his  services to build cheap hospitals. Under Head  D

52,  subhead 10, item 4 of the Development  Estimates

gives  a vote of $100,000 for this district hospital,

but   the  estimate  that  is  allowed  for   it   is

$3,200,000. That $100,000 is only to cover  the  work

which  we  anticipate will be completed in  1956.  If

indeed we have done more work than necessary, we  can

always  go back to the original Estimate and ask  for

more.  There  is nothing to prevent us exceeding  the

$100,000 voted, because we have already estimated, as

I have said, $3,200,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the cottage hospitals that were suggested by

the  Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede). This may show  him

where  he  is  wrong.  He said that  the  Progressive

Party,  or  the  previous Government,  had  suggested

cottage  hospitals. The suggestion that was  made  in

the  Progress Report of the Medical Plan for 1953 was

for outpatient-cum-cottage or district hospitals, and

it went on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Colony population is increasing at such a rate

that  it  is  intended  now to  develop  outside  the

centralised medical institutions ..."



<br><br>though  the  population  has increased  considerably

since 1953. This goes on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Each of these new divisions would be so designed

that they could be expanded into full-sized hospitals

to   meet   the  growing  needs  of  the   increasing

population."



<br><br>That  is  exactly  what we are  doing  with  the  new

hospital  at Kallang. The new hospital at Kallang  is

planned  to provide for 250 beds in the first  phase,

and  to increase to 450 beds when funds and staff are

available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lots of criticism have also been launched against

the increase that has been provided for in the Budget

under  the Medical Heads. This increase under Medical

Head D 52 is to keep up with expansion which is daily

growing and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>



considering  the scope of expansion, the increase  of

less  than half a million dollars shows that  a  real

effort  has  been made to cut out all  but  essential

expenditure.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  when  I  raised my hand just now signifying  my

intention  to  speak,  I  believe  the  hon.  Members

opposite  must have made up their minds  that  I  was

going  to deliver a very long and hot speech. I think

they will be disappointed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But coming to business, it would appear, from the

Development  Estimates for 1956, that  provision  for

all  necessary  things has been made  for  the  rural

areas.  They  are  only left to be  implemented.  But

there  are  two  things, I observe,  that  have  been

overlooked  by  the Government. They are  electricity

and  telephones. I know quite a lot of villages which

have  no  such facilities at all. In my constituency,

particularly,   there  are  seven  villages   without

electricity   and   telephones.   The   inconvenience

suffered  by  the villagers as a result  of  this,  I

think,  had  better be left to the  imagination  than

narrated. I have brought this matter up once or twice

before in the Rural Board, but it seems nothing could

be  done  because of technical factors and economics.

Well,   Sir,  we  are  no  technicians;  we  are   no

economists; we are "orang2 ulu" pure and simple.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Did you say "orang bodoh"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang:</b> "Orang ulu". This much we know,

that  it  is  the duty of the Government  to  provide

services  for  the  people.  Without  wishing  to  be

sarcastic  and acrimonious, I do hope the  Government

will  seriously look into the matter and provide  all

these   facilities  as  soon  as  possible - that   is,

electricity and telephones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one bouquet for the Government, and that

is,  as far as water services are concerned, it seems

the  position is quite fair, but there is  plenty  of

room for improvement.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Hart, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> In reply, Sir. A great number of the

points  which  have been raised in this  debate  have

been answered by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>



my  colleagues on the Government Benches. A number of

them  are the subject of motions which will be  taken

in  the  Committee stage, and I think I can,  in  all

fairness, say that the bulk of the remainder could be

answered by a careful reading of Cmd. Paper No. 28 of

1955, of my speech on the 9th of November, and of the

Estimates  themselves. I will, if I  may,  take  this

opportunity to answer some specific points which were

made  in the course of the debate and which have  not

yet been replied to in full.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the 1954 accounts mentioned by my hon.

Friend the Member for Seletar (Mr Nair). These  were

completed  in May, the audit was finished in  August,

and they are now in the hands of the Printer and will

very  soon  be  in  the  hands  of  Members  of  this

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of the investments by the

Special Reserve Fund, I deplore, just as much as  the

Member for Seletar does, the depreciation in value of

the Special Reserve. I would point out, however, that

it  is a long-term reserve. We hope that we will  not

have to realise it for some time to come and there is

reason  to  hope that the value of the securities  in

which  it is invested will have appreciated  by  that

time. There are certain advantages in investing these

funds  overseas.  They  are invested  in  the  London

market.  They  can be realised as and  when  we  want

them.  I  do  not think funds invested  in  Singapore

would  have  that same liquidity. If  they  had  been

invested  in Singapore, I would not like to speculate

as to their value at the present time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been accused by many Members on the other

side of not having practised what we have preached in

our  various statements throughout the year about the

necessity for economy in the Government service. Now,

I  do  not  think  that that is altogether  fair.  In

drawing  up  the Estimates this year,  we  have  made

strenuous   efforts  to  limit  Government  recurrent

expenditure as much as possible. If Members will look

at  the  Estimates, they will see,  apart  from  some

extraordinary items



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>



like contributions to the Central Provident Fund  and

increased  provision for grants  in  aid  to  Chinese

schools and so on, that the recurrent expenditure has

been  kept  within the level of the  1955  Estimates.

Now,  that  in  itself represents a very considerable

economy  when  one  takes into  account  the  natural

expansion of the government machine during the course

of  a  year, and I can assure Members that  heads  of

departments  will  be required to keep  within  these

limits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I think Members will see, if they look with

care  at  the  Estimates  of Expenditure,  that  very

considerable economies have been effected in  Special

Expenditure. Our Special Expenditure in 1956 will  be

reduced  to  $16 millions, excluding  revotes  and  a

contribution to development. That represents  a  very

considerable economy. It has been achieved by  asking

heads  of departments to exclude from their estimates

provision  for  any service which is  not  absolutely

imperative in 1956 and which can be postponed until a

later  year, and to exclude any provision or  service

from  the  Estimates which cannot be spent  owing  to

delays  in  drawing up plans, or for items when  they

know cannot be delivered in 1956 even if ordered. The

object  of this exercise is to ensure that the  money

which  we have available in 1956 will be used to  the

best advantage, and that the Estimates of Expenditure

will  not be inflated by items on which money  cannot

be  spent and which would, by their very existence in

the Estimates, freeze funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards personal emoluments, we have been accused

that  we  have failed to cut down the number  of  new

appointments, and that the Government staff shows  no

tendency to decrease; that it, in fact, has increased

at  a rate faster than in previous years; and that  a

very  considerable amount of money is being spent  on

expatriates and so on. Well, Sir, I can say,  in  all

earnestness, that we did go through the Estimates  of

Personal  Emoluments this year with a fine tooth-comb

and  also  took out of the Estimates any appointments

or proposals for new posts which were not regarded as

absolutely imperative for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>



the efficient conduct of government business in 1956.

We  did, at the same time, take into account the fact

that to implement the development plans of the social

services, extra staff would have to be provided,  but

at  the same time we did ensure that only the minimum

of  this  extra staff required for the implementation

of these services was, in fact, included.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said earlier, I can say, in all sincerity,

that  we have drawn up these Estimates in such a  way

as to practise the maximum possible economy in 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the Development Estimates, we

have  endeavoured  to cut our coat according  to  our

cloth. That, I think, will be accepted as very  sound

policy - colonial, Labour Front, or P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> God forbid!



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I appreciate from what the Member for

Tanjong  Pagar said earlier that cutting  one's  coat

according  to  one's  cloth  was  not  a  fundamental

concept  of  the  economic  planning  of  the  P.A.P.

Naturally,  as  always  happens,  certain   essential

services  have had to be held back - not  abolished  or

abandoned - but  merely held back until  later  in  the

year or until next year. This, I think, has caused  a

certain  amount of heart-burning amongst  Members  of

the  Opposition, and certainly amongst my  colleagues

on  the Ministerial Bench, but we have made a note to

allocate   any   money   likely   to   be   available

subsequently  to those services which  have,  in  our

opinion,  a  high  priority and I think  it  will  be

agreed  that  in  devoting - and  I  am  speaking  from

memory - 34 per cent of the available funds for capital

works  to  Education and 25 per cent to  Medical  and

Health, we have not neglected these services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also said that, halfway through the year, we

will probably find that progress in some respects has

not  been  as  rapid as we had hoped  and  that  some

savings  are  available. If that  proves  to  be  the

case - as   I   think  it  will - we  will  introduce   a

supplementary  Budget  and  re-allocate   the   money

available,  thus bringing forward those  items  which

are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>



merely noted in the Development Estimates with  token

votes,  or perhaps which have had to be kept  out  of

the Estimates altogether.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I expected, when I drafted my Budget speech on

the  basis  of  Estimates showing a  deficit  of  $22

millions, I would be accused of crying wolf once more

in   the   established  tradition  of  the  Financial

Secretaries of Singapore, but I did think that I  had

been at some pains in my speech to point out that the

days  of  large deficits being converted  into  large

surpluses  have now passed and that we are now  faced

with  the hard reality of actual deficits. I  am  not

sufficiently foolhardy to endeavour to estimate  what

the  actual deficit will be, and I hope that  I  made

that clear in my speech. At the same time, I think  I

made  it  clear that there will be an actual  deficit

and that we must face that fact. I also tried to make

it  clear, and I think the figures I quoted  bear  me

out,  that unless steps are taken to reduce and cover

the  gap,  we  will  be faced with  an  even  greater

deficit  in  the years to come, not because  we  have

been   extravagant  but  merely  because  the  social

service plans, which are regarded as so important for

Singapore,  must  be implemented and  that  recurrent

costs will increase, no matter what steps we take  to

reduce expenditure to an absolute minimum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there were certain points raised in the course

of  the  debate - the  question  of  entertainment  and

transport  allowances for Ministers - which  I  confess

took  me  by  surprise, because I never thought  that

elected  representatives of the people of  Singapore,

who   appreciate  so  much  the  value  of   personal

relations  in  their commercial transactions,  should

have complained of, or drawn attention to, and indeed

criticised,  the very small amounts which  were  made

available  in the Estimates for 1956 to Ministers  of

the     Government.     But     the     point     was

raised - regrettably - and   has   been    satisfactorily

disposed  of  by  my  colleague the  Chief  Minister,

though it will again be taken



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>



up,  I fear, in the course of the Committee stage  of

the  Bill. I will speak then at greater length on the

details of the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards hospital facilities, criticisms made of

our programme for 1956 have been dealt with at length

by  my colleague the Minister for Health (Mr Braga).

It  struck me as astonishing that responsible Members

of  the  Opposition, first of all, had not  read  the

Estimates properly. Most of them have motor cars, and

although  I admit the increased tax of five  cents  a

gallon   on  petrol  would  probably  curtail   their

movements  to  a  certain extent, Singapore  being  a

small  place, could they not have gone  down  to  the

General  Hospital and to other hospitals to find  out

precisely what is being done with the money  that  is

being  spent?  It  struck me as astonishing  to  hear

Members say that money spent on alterations to  wards

was  not  going to result in any increase in hospital

beds.  That  is  a  most  astonishing  statement - that

anybody in their senses would spend money on hospital

facilities  without meeting the major requirement  of

Singapore, which is an increase of beds in hospitals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards district hospitals, complaints have been

made that we are making no progress with the work. It

has  been explained that we have changed our plan and

that  we are now going to Kallang and I think  nobody

would  care  to  question  that  decision,  which  is

putting  a  district hospital right in the middle  of

one  of the major centres of population of Singapore.

The site that has been provided will cost no money to

the  Government, but the site at Bukit Panjang  which

would not, in any case, have been suitable, had to be

acquired,  as  would  sites in  other  parts  of  the

island.  That  is the major advantage  of  putting  a

district hospital in Kallang, that the site is  free.

But before a start is made to build a hospital there,

plans  must  first  of  all be  prepared.  The  plans

prepared  for Bukit Panjang would not do.  New  plans

have  to be prepared, and on the site which has  been

reclaimed  from swamp only some 30 years ago,  it  is

necessary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>



to  sink  piles which will enable it to  support  the

buildings  which will constitute a district hospital.

It  is  for  that  purpose that the  money  has  been

entered in the Estimates this year - $100,000 for  the

preparation of the site to enable us to proceed  with

the building after the plans have been made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague the Minister for Education (Mr Chew

Swee  Kee) has dealt with criticisms which have  been

made  of the construction of schools. Three secondary

schools  in a programme of seven have been completed.

Tenders are now about to go out for two others.  They

will be completed in 1956 and sites for the final two

schools  in  this programme are now  the  subject  of

negotiation. Rapid progress has been made  in  recent

weeks in that connection and we confidently expect to

have class rooms for all these four schools in actual

operation by the end of 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the primary schools - 36 schools in Group

A - they  will all be completed early in 1956.  The  18

schools  in  Group B will be completed  in  the  same

year,  and we hope work will have started, admittedly

towards  the end of the year, on 18 schools in  Group

C.  That, I think, is greater progress than has  been

made by any previous Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the burning question of housing, we were

accused  of  having  made no progress  with  low-cost

housing in the rural areas. We have not neglected low-cost  housing  in  the rural areas.  We  have  indeed

approved plans and are about to start a pilot  scheme

for  low-cost housing at Bukit Panjang.  If  that  is

successful,   we  will  undertake  similar   projects

throughout  the  rural areas in the  island,  thereby

taking  the  population  away  from  the  centre  and

dispersing  it close to their places of work  in  the

rural districts in the island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of subsidising housing,

Members  are already aware that by granting loans  of

four per cent for 60 years and of three per cent  for

40 years, we are giving a very substantial subsidy in

so far as nobody could



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>



borrow on these terms for that length of time.  Again

we  subsidise housing very considerably - and  this  is

not  new - in  so far as we pay the cost of all  sites,

preparation,  levelling,  piling,  and  purchase - over

$25,000. Now that indeed is a very important item.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions were asked about slum clearance. I can

assure  the hon. Member who raised the question  that

we  are  proceeding with our plans. We are, in  fact,

about to come to the Assembly with proposals for what

is   called  by  the  Singapore  Improvement   Trust,

Programme  No.  8. Now that is for  the  clearing  of

slums  in, I think, Manila and Short Streets and  for

the construction of some houses on the open ground at

Kallang. That programme will cost $23.6 millions  and

the Assembly will be asked to approve funds for that.

Out  of that sum, $16 millions only will be loans and

$7  millions will be subsidy. Now I do not think that

can  be called ungenerous - a third of the cost of  the

scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards rural development, I am afraid I cannot

tell  you  exactly just how much has  been  spent  on

capital works in the rural areas, but I can tell  you

how  much has been provided in the Estimates for  the

Rural   Board  since  1947.  Now  this  is   a   most

interesting table. In 1947 the Estimates of the Rural

Board showed $1.4 millions; in 1948 $2.2 millions; in

1953  it had risen to $5.1 millions; in 1954  it  was

$6.7 millions; in 1955 it was $7.7 millions, and next

year  it  will  be $8.9 millions. Now  $8.9  millions

spent  in  one way or another on the rural  areas  is

quite  a  considerable sum, and  we  will  of  course

continue  to devote as much money as we  can  to  the

development  of  the  rural  areas.  I  have  figures

provided for the last two years as far as the capital

development  is  concerned. Last year  the  Estimates

included $3.03 millions, purely capital works in  the

rural  areas.  This year - again I speak from  memory - I

think it is $4.4 millions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague the Minister for Communications and

Works  (Mr  Thomas)  has dealt at  length  with  the

question of a Committee which has been set up to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>



reconsider the standards of construction. The  latest

information about that is that the Committee  on  the

standards  of  construction in schools  has  achieved

very considerable economies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other matters which have been raised.

Although  they are the subject of motions,  I  should

perhaps  deal with them. I realise that if funds  for

lighting  of  Goodwood  Hill  were  entered  in   the

Estimates, it would immediately cause an outcry,  and

I  questioned  this.  I am living  in  Goodwood  Hill

myself!  I  must say that very few of  the  residents

there have large high-powered cars. We all happen  to

be Government servants, and our cars are very small.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The Humber - a small car?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I queried that provision when the

Estimates came up. It was some months ago now  and  I

asked  "Why  must it go in? It seems unnecessary."  I

will  go  into  the matter in greater detail  in  the

Committee  stage. It is as a result of  an  agreement

with  the  City  Council who wish to remove  the  gas

lighting  at Goodwood Hill, and we are under  certain

obligations  in  1956 to allow  the  removal  of  the

supply of gas and to make the necessary provision for

electric lighting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of land, I think that is the subject

of  a  motion by my friend the Member for Telok  Ayer

(Mr  R. Jumabhoy), and I will give him the necessary

information in detail in the Committee stage; but, in

fact,  as  far as land is concerned, the estimate  is

based  very closely on the estimated requirements  of

various departments for development, for the purchase

of  sites, and for provision of sites for development

purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of the acquisition and

development  of sites for resettlement, the  Estimate

is  again  drawn up on the same careful basis  and  I

will give details later on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister has dealt with the question of

organisation  and  methods advisers.  We  are  making

every effort to get them, and when they do arrive I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>



think  they  will  be  able  to  make  a  substantial

contribution to effecting economies in the Government

service. This is a task which really requires  expert

men who have had experience of this sort of thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of an Industrial Development

Corporation and a research institute is under  active

consideration at the present time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of personal emoluments of $98.7

millions estimated this year - though not all  will  be

spent - I  cannot tell you how much will  be  spent  on

expatriate officers. I only know that they  represent

approximately between three and four per cent of  the

number of people employed by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, finally, we come to the question of taxation.

My  presentation of this item has been criticised  as

being irregular, unconstitutional, unorthodox. It has

been  said that my "Budget leaks" have increased  the

feeling of lack of confidence in Singapore. First  of

all, I should say that when this Assembly met for the

first time, His Excellency the Governor in his speech

said  that  we were going to undertake immediately  a

review of the revenue potential of the Colony, and in

fact  we  were  doing that. It has  been  given  some

publicity  from time to time. In these circumstances,

I thought it only right and proper that I should give

Members  of  the  Assembly  some  indication  of  the

interim results of our researches. I did endeavour in

my  speech to give an outline of what I thought  were

the  fundamental principles of taxation for Singapore

and I have not so far heard them criticised. In fact,

if  I  may  say so, I think they can be  regarded  as

unexceptional.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the Labour Front Coalition Government has

certain  principles of taxation which were enunciated

in  their election programme. Circumstances forced us

to  abandon these principles temporarily, to put  the

cart  before the horse of taxation; or to use another

metaphor,  change  the  batting  order - not  to  throw

anybody out of the team but merely to bring No. 3  up

and  put  him  as No. 1 because No. 1 happens  to  be

temporarily indisposed. That is why I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>



told  you in some detail what had passed through  our

minds  and in our deliberations before we were forced

to  introduce  increases  in indirect  taxation,  and

before  we  were able to introduce those measures  of

direct  taxation which we intend to do in the future.

I  do  not  think any harm has been done.  People  in

Singapore,  far  more able perhaps than  most  of  us

here, can size up with a great deal of accuracy  what

measures of taxation any government can bring  in  at

any given time. The mere fact that we have outlined a

genuine  policy of taxation will not have the  effect

of  lowering confidence. It will have the  effect  of

strengthening  confidence in the  Administration.  As

regards  the  proposals themselves, I  do  not  think

anybody  can criticise them as being harsh or  likely

to bear hardly on any section of the community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of yield, I have gone into

that  with  very great care, with the  assistance  of

experts from the Customs Department who have been  at

this  job all their lives. There will certainly be  a

slight   contraction   in   consumption.   That    is

inevitable,  but  it  will be  temporary.  But  I  do

confidently believe that the Estimates which  I  have

given  of  yield will materialise in  the  course  of

1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to say that gin was not forgotten.

We  considered the possibility of increasing the  tax

on  gin. Gin of all liquors consumed in Singapore is

still  going  steadily down as far as consumption  is

concerned.  I  felt  that to  impose  a  considerable

increase  of  tax on gin would merely accelerate  the

downward trend of consumption. Again, as far as I  am

aware, gin is no real substitute for whisky or brandy

or samsu -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> There speaks the expert!



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Thank you! I doubt very much whether the

increase of tax on these other liquors will  cause  a

movement towards gin. In any case, the position  will

be kept under review and should there be any tendency

in  that  direction, we will, of course,  immediately

take steps.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards champagne, I doubt very much whether the

consumption of champagne is a material factor in  the

life or revenue of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still wines: It was suggested that we had had to

reduce  this  duty  some time  in  the  past  because

consumption  was going down. That is perfectly  true.

Consumption did go down slightly but I think that was

due   to  economic  causes  rather  than  consumption

causes.  In  any case, during the last two  or  three

years, consumption has mounted very considerably, and

now  there  is a definite market for still  wines  of

under 26 per cent of alcohol and I think that we were

on  perfectly sound and safe grounds in restoring the

tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards estate duty, we did consider all the

facts  you  have mentioned and we are still convinced

that  from the short-term point of view no harm  will

come  from increasing estate duty in the way we  have

done and we hope that the Federation will be able  to

see  their  way sometime in the future to join  hands

with us in this respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now these are my comments on the Estimates. Finally,

I do not think we are myopic, hesitant or that I am a

Scottish  butterfly  wearing hobnailed  boots.  I  am

quite  impenitent about it. I think  these  are  good

Estimates. They are not colonial estimates. They  are

the  Estimates  of  this  Government,  reached  after

consultation    on    a    basis    of    Ministerial

responsibility. As regards form, I can  think  of  no

better form than the form in which they are drawn up.

From time to time I have made a study of the way  the

Estimates  are  drawn up in other  countries,  and  I

think  I  can safely say that the Estimates here  are

drawn  up  in even greater detail than in  any  other

country  that I can name; and indeed, as far  as  the

questions  which  my  friend the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar raised, if he would only pause to think of  it,

he  would appreciate and understand what the  various

sub-heads  mean, or if he could not find  a  solution

after a little cogitation, he had only to come to  my

office and say, "Look here, can you tell me what this

is all about?", and he would be informed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Committee of Supply, what day?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Wednesday and the two following days, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Until?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Friday, Sir. I hope the business will be

finished by Friday, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> But what are the days allotted, Mr

Financial  Secretary? Is it from Tuesday to  Saturday

inclusive?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In accordance with Standing Order 69

(4),  I  have allotted the time to be given for  each

head of expenditure in the Schedules to the Bill  and

for   the   clauses  of  the  Bill.  These  will   be

circularised  and will also appear  in  the  Official

Report.  In  allotting the time I  have,  of  course,

taken into consideration the indications given to  me

by  Members at the conference of the 18th of November

and  the  notices of amendments received  since  that

conference. In respect of heads on which I  have  had

no  indication that Members wish to speak, either  on

amendments or to the main Question, I have only  been

able  to  allot three minutes to each head, which  as

nearly  as  possible is all the time available  after

allowing for the times given for other heads.
