<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE ECONOMY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Volatility)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</b> asked the Minister for Trade

and Industry (a) whether the Singapore economy is likely to be

subjected  to even greater volatility in future as  we  invest

more  heavily in the life sciences, pharmaceuticals  and  bio-medical sectors; and (b) what measures his Ministry has  taken

or  will take to help mitigate the possibility of even greater

volatility of the Singapore economy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the greater variation in Singapore's

economic  growth recently is in part due to the volatility  of

the  global electronics industry.  After the bursting  of  the

Internet  bubble, global semiconductor sales fell  sharply  by

32%  in 2001 after a record 37% growth the year before.  Given

Singapore's small and open economy and the significant size of

electronics,  we cannot insulate ourselves from  the  cyclical

nature of the global electronics industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lessen the cyclical swings, we have been diversifying

our economy.  In manufacturing, we are strengthening the other

3 clusters besides electronics, namely, chemicals, engineering

and  the  Biomedical  Sciences.  Within  electronics,  we  are

developing   various   segments  like  data   storage,   info-communications and key modules to diversify the  value  chain.

As  these  segments do not necessarily follow the same  cycle,

the sector as a whole will be less volatile.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor asks if our promotion of life sciences,

pharmaceuticals  and  bio-medical sectors  will  increase  the

volatility in our economy.  This is not likely, for 3 reasons.

First,  the cycle for these 3 areas, which we refer to as  the

Biomedical   Sciences  cluster,  is  not   synchronised   with

electronics.  Hence, it can help to even  out  overall  growth

rates. For example, while electronics fell by 21% in 2001, the

Biomedical  Sciences  cluster  grew  by  10%,  moderating  the

decline in the manufacturing sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, within the Biomedical Sciences cluster itself,

there  are three different segments - pharmaceuticals, medical

technology and biotechnology. Pharmaceuticals account for some

80%  of  the  total Biomedical Sciences manufacturing  output.

Pharmaceutical producers have diversified their  manufacturing

activities to include formulation, fill and finishing of final

dosage  forms and biotech products. Although smaller in  size,

the  medical  technology industry is also expanding  strongly.

Last year, it enjoyed a 14% growth in manufacturing output and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>



contributed  the remaining 20% of Biomedical Sciences  output.

Over  time,  the increase in the number of plants and  product

types  will  also smoothen output patterns. As the  Biomedical

Sciences  cluster  develops greater  breadth  and  depth,  the

growth  pattern  will likely be more stable. In  this  regard,

rather   than  greater  volatility,  investing  in  Biomedical

Sciences  can help to even out the growth of the manufacturing

sector in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, media reports on monthly figures have

characterised  the pharmaceutical segment as "volatile".  This

is  not  accurate. There are no inherent swings in demand  for

pharmaceutical  products  per se. Rather,  the  variations  in

output  from  month to month are due to the way pharmaceutical

products  are  made.  Pharmaceutical  companies  in  Singapore

manufacture active ingredients for global markets in  batches,

to take advantage of the high degree of flexibility of our new

"multi-product" plants. The plants are designed to  be  multi-purpose  and  produce  different  batches  of  ingredients  at

different  times  of the year. Each batch of  ingredients  has

different  value  and market requirements. The  batch-oriented

manufacturing  process  is  a major  reason  for  the  seeming

volatility in Biomedical Sciences output from one month to the

next.  It would be more accurate to measure performance  on  a

year-to-year  basis, which shows that the Biomedical  Sciences

cluster  has  achieved strong and consistent growth  in  total

output, employment and value added for the past 5 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC has also recommended a number of strategies to

build  a  more  diversified economy. This includes  developing

exportable  services and encouraging greater  entrepreneurship

to complement the MNCs.  Our national objective is to build  a

globalised, diversified and entrepreneurial economy.



<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Minister  if, in addition to placing emphasis on sectors  such

as pharmaceuticals and biomedical, the Ministry would continue

to ensure that sectors which may not be identified as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>



growth areas but which are equally viable, for instance, those

proposed  by small and medium enterprises, would also  receive

equal attention or help?



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Absolutely. We are interested

in  all  viable sectors and we are paying particular attention

to  growth enterprises, including those from small and  medium

enterprises.   In fact, this constitutes a fair proportion  of

the recommendations in the Economic Review Committee's report.

<div align="center"><b>FREE TRADE AGREEMENT BETWEEN SINGAPORE AND EUROPEAN UNION</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Miss Penny Low</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  (a)  whether there has been any progress  towards  a

bilateral Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Singapore and the

European Union (EU) or does the EU still prefer to work  on  a

multilateral  FTA framework with ASEAN; and (b)  what  is  the

probability of a successful conclusion of either  FTA  in  the

next three years or so.



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the European

Commission  has  not  yet  replied officially  to  Singapore's

proposal  for  an EU-Singapore FTA although Trade Commissioner

Pascal  Lamy  commented publicly in February  last  year  that

Singapore  has  made a compelling strategic and economic  case

for such an FTA. In the past year, the European Commission has

been holding consultations with industry on whether there is a

strong  business  case  for such an FTA.  The  Commission  has

indicated on various occasions that its current priority is to

concentrate on the Doha Development Agenda and that it prefers

to  consider new FTA initiatives only after its completion  in

2005.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the EU's economic engagement with ASEAN,

Commissioner  Lamy has informed me that he  is  working  on  a

flexible  framework  which takes into  account  the  different

stages of development of the 10 ASEAN countries.  This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>



new  framework should be ready by the time he meets the  ASEAN

Economic  Ministers  in early April in Laos  at  our  informal

retreat.   Realistically, an EU-ASEAN FTA can only be a  long-term objective.



<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, how important

is the EU-Singapore FTA to Singapore?



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> It will be very important. The

EU  makes up a large part of our total economic account.  They

have  vast  investments  here.   We  are  by  far  their  most

important trade and investment partner in Southeast Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own sense talking to EU officials is that they

understand the advantages of having such an FTA with Singapore

but  they are concerned about how they engage ASEAN generally.

They  are  also concerned that they should not send  a  strong

signal  to the WTO that it is somehow less interested  in  the

Doha Development Agenda.  It is an important initiative for us

and  we  are  pursuing it.  I believe it will  take  time  but

eventually it will come about.

Singapore  is  currently pursuing; (b) whether there  are  any

other  major trade or government to government industrial  co-operation agreements in the pipeline; and, if so, (c) what are

the  benefits  of  these  efforts,  in  real  terms,  for  (i)

employees and (ii) investors.



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is

currently engaged in on-going FTA negotiations with Canada and

Mexico.  Some time this year, we will start negotiations  with

New  Zealand and Chile for a P3 (Pacific Three) FTA which will

enter three corners of the Pacific.  In March, we will begin a

joint study with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>



South  Korea on a Korea-Singapore FTA with a view to launching

negotiations  after that later this year.  In  April,  we  are

likely  to   launch negotiations with India on a Comprehensive

Economic Partnership Agreement which will include an FTA.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With China, we are engaged in FTA negotiations as a

member of ASEAN.  A framework agreement incorporating an Early

Harvest was signed by the leaders in Phnom Penh last year.  We

can  expect  to see the first round of commitments implemented

as  early as 1st January next year, and for the final round of

commitments to be implemented by the end of the decade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also involved in negotiations for an ASEAN-Japan

Comprehensive Economic Partnership.  This will complement  the

bilateral  FTA  that we already have with Japan.    Similarly,

ASEAN has embarked on an FTA joint study with India.  Finally,

with  the  successful  conclusion  of  the  US-Singapore   FTA

negotiations,  the  US  is pursuing an  Enterprise  for  ASEAN

Initiative, which will provide an enhanced framework  for  US-ASEAN economic engagement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maximise the advantages of these FTAs, we must achieve

greater   economic integration in ASEAN.  Prime  Minister  Goh

has proposed the concept of an ASEAN Economic Community as  an

eventual goal.  We are now pursuing this idea with other ASEAN

members to see how it can be realised.  We are laying stepping

stones to get us there.  One example is the Singapore-Thailand

Enhanced Economic Relations framework, which is co-chaired  by

the  Economic  Ministers from both countries. Another  is  the

cooperation with Indonesia on Batam and Bintan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from FTAs, we are also expanding the range of

investment guarantee agreements (IGAs) with various countries.

IGAs   will  accord  greater  protection  and  certainty   for

investments  into  and out of Singapore.  Currently,  we  have

concluded  IGAs with 27 countries, including China,  Cambodia,

Laos, Vietnam, Germany, France, United Kingdom and some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>



Eastern European countries.  Our FTAs also contain commitments

over  and  above IGAs.  We also have on-going IGA negotiations

with  countries such as Romania, Russia, Myanmar  and  Turkey.

In  fact,  we recently concluded negotiations for an IGA  with

Uzbekistan  and Peru.  The agreement with Peru is expected  to

be signed about now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors will find it more attractive to invest in

Singapore, so as to take advantage of our FTAs and  IGAs,  and

the greater economic integration of  ASEAN.  These investments

will   create  business  opportunities  and  more   jobs   for

Singaporeans.



<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Given the many FTAs that have been

signed,  what efforts are taken by MTI to educate  and  inform

the local business community about the opportunities presented

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this year, MTI

and  its  economic  agencies will be stepping  up  efforts  to

explain  the  provisions of these FTAs  to  all  companies  in

Singapore.   We  are  working  with  trade  associations,  the

chambers  of  commerce and the SBF.  We run  a  1800-telephone

call service for those with questions.  We have a website  and

you  can  be sure that we will be sparing no effort to explain

to  Singapore companies the advantages that they can  gain  by

making use of the provisions in some of these FTAs.



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> I would like to find out

from  the  Minister  how  do  our ASEAN  neighbours  view  our

initiative in all these FTAs or would they prefer us  to  work

within  the regional context as regards the liberalisation  of

trade ties?



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, some of our

friends   in  ASEAN  had  reservations  which  they  expressed

publicly  in  the  past  but,  in  recent  months,  far   from

expressing  reservations,  they  have  been  jumping  on   the

bandwagon.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> For the FTAs that have been

signed,  could  the  Minister enlighten  us  on  the  tangible

benefits  that small and medium enterprises or local companies

in Singapore have derived and whether examples could be given?



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> FTAs mean the removal of

tariffs  for  most products that go to our FTA  partner.   For

example,  our FTA with Japan enables some of our petrochemical

products  to enter Japan without tariff which gives  exporters

here  a  major advantage.  Under the US-Singapore  FTA,  there

will  be  hundreds  of millions of dollars'  worth  of  tariff

savings across a wide range.  A simple but graphic example  is

the  repair of US ships.  Before the FTA, any US ship repaired

outside the US will have to pay a special fee.  With the  FTA,

Keppel  and Sembawang can repair US ships in Singapore without

these  ships having to pay a fee and this of course encourages

our  shipyards to go out to all US ships in the region  to  do

their  business.  These are some of the advantages  which  the

FTAs can bring to our businesses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On existing trade patterns, the advantages in the initial

years  would  already be hundreds of millions of  dollars  and

they  will ramp up as various provisions of the FTAs come into

effect.   This  is  the first order effect.   A  second  order

effect  is  to exploit these FTAs, new investments  will  come

into Singapore.  Our objective is that, from Singapore to  all

parts  of  the  world, there should be minimal hassle  and  no

tariffs, and if you are serving more than one region  this  is

the best place to locate your activities.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Swee Say):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  may  I  have your permission  to  answer  both

Question Nos. 4 and 5 together because they are inter-related?



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Thank you, Sir. Mr Steve Chia asked

whether  Singapore is aiming towards 100% self-sufficiency  in

our  water  resources and, if so, when will this be  achieved.

Sir,  currently, we have two sources of water supply,  namely,

water  from  our  local catchments as well as untreated  water

from  Johor under the 1961 and 1962 Water Agreements.  As  the

two agreements will expire only in 2011 and 2061 respectively,

the issue of self-sufficiency does not arise until 2061.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question before us is therefore not so much one of

how  soon we can be self-sufficient in water supply.   Rather,

it  is  about  whether  we  can become,  firstly,  more  self-sufficient  by  2011  when  the 1961  agreement  expires;  and

secondly, totally self-sufficient by 2061 when the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>



1962  agreement  expires.   And  the  answers  to  both  these

questions are: Yes, we can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor asked whether the plans to increase the local

supply  can be speeded up just in case there is a need for  us

to  be  totally  self-sufficient.  Sir, PUB has already  taken

steps  to  strengthen  our local water supply  system.   These

include expanding the local catchments, launching NEWater  for

direct   non-potable  use  in  the  industry  and   commercial

buildings,  and  indirect potable use in our domestic  sector.

At the same time, PUB is also introducing desalted water under

a water purchase agreement with the private sector by the year

2005.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together, these three initiatives will more than make up

for  the  supply of water from Johor under the 1961 agreement.

After  2011, we will increase the amount of desalted water  in

our  supply  system  now that the cost of desalted  water  has

reached  an  affordable  level.  We  will  also  produce  more

NEWater  as  it is not only cleaner than PUB water,  but  also

cheaper than desalted water.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated by our Prime Minister at the launch of NEWater

on 21st February, there is therefore no need to renew the 1961

Water  Agreement  when it expires in 2011.   We  can  also  be

totally  self-sufficient  by  2061  when  the  1962  Agreement

expires,  if there is no new water agreement with Malaysia  on

mutually beneficial terms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor asked what are the targeted quantities and

proportion  of  NEWater and desalinated  water  that  will  be

produced by 2011 and 2061.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Singapore Green Plan 2012, our projection is

that  NEWater and desalted water will account for 25% of total

demand  over the next 10 years.  And this works out  to  about

100 mgd out of a projected total demand of 400 mgd by the year

2012.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 2061, the quantities and proportions of NEWater and

desalted water in our water supply system will depend  on  the

overall supply and demand situations, as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>



well  as  the relative costs of these two sources and that  of

other  potential sources made possible by future  advances  in

water  purification  technology.  As of  now,  we  expect  the

quantity  of NEWater to be higher than desalted water  because

it is much less energy intensive and cheaper to produce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia asked for the reason for NEWater to be

pumped back into the reservoirs, thus raising cost.  Mr  Steve

Chia  is  right  to  point out that indirect  potable  use  of

NEWater will cost more than if it is consumed directly.   Even

though  NEWater  is  cleaner than  PUB  water  and  meets  all

international standards for potable use, we have decided to go

along  with  the  recommendation of the  international  expert

panel  to  consume  NEWater  indirectly  by  mixing  it   with

reservoir  water.  This is to follow the established practices

in  the United States for more than 25 years.  We see no  need

for Singapore to set a new precedent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this does not mean that we are not taking full

advantage of the lower cost of NEWater.  In view of the ultra-pure characteristics of NEWater, more than 80% of NEWater will

be  used in the industry and commercial buildings directly for

non-potable  use.  Sir, in this way, we can  still  enjoy  the

cost  advantage  of  NEWater for the industry  and  commercial

buildings.  And yet, at the same time, we can free up more PUB

water for domestic use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia asked what will be the estimated cost of

water by the time we achieve self sufficiency.  Sir, the  cost

of  PUB water today is $1.17 per cubic metre plus 30% of Water

Conservation  Tax,  giving a total price of  $1.52  per  cubic

metre.   The projection by PUB in 1997 was that we would  have

to   increase  the  cost  of  water  to  $2  per  cubic  metre

eventually, in view of the high cost of desalted water at that

time.   But,  fortunately, with advances in water purification

technology, desalted water today costs much less than what  we

projected   five   years  ago.   But  more  importantly,   the

introduction of NEWater has further lowered the high  cost  of

additional supply of water in future.  We therefore do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>



not  foresee the need to increase the price of water to $2 per

cubic metre for some time yet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Mr Chia asked if Singaporeans are sold treated

water  at  S$5.32 per 1,000 gallons making it a whopping  445%

markup  from cost.  Sir, treated water is sold to Singaporeans

at $1.17 per cubic metre, or about $5.32 per thousand gallons,

as  stated  by Mr Steve Chia.  However, I am not sure  how  Mr

Steve Chia arrived at the figure of "445% markup from cost".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, besides the costs of collecting raw water and

processing  it  into  treated water,  PUB  has  to  build  and

maintain  an  extensive reticulation system  reaching  out  to

every home, every factory and every building.  PUB also has to

invest  in  new  collection facilities, additional  production

capacity  and  expanded delivery infrastructure to  cater  for

future increases in demand.  Let me assure this House that the

aim  of  PUB is not only to produce enough drinking  water  to

meet the needs of Singaporeans and Singapore, but also to keep

the  price of water at an affordable level to the best of  its

ability in a sustainable manner.



<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Sir, as we will be

relying more and more on NEWater, can the Minister assure  the

House  that  there  will  be no long-term  health  effects  on

consumers?  Can he assure us that PUB is fully satisfied?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, I would like to thank Ms Irene Ng

for  raising  the question.  Sir, I am aware that  in  today's

Today  newspaper,  there is an article  on  NEWater.   Reading

through  the article, it leaves the impression that the  long-term  health effect of NEWater is yet to be established.  Sir,

I want to point out that this is not the case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me explain the situation in layman's terms. All

over  the  world today, countries do introduce new sources  of

water  supply.   In every country, Singapore included,  before

any  new  source of water supply is introduced,  there  is  an

established requirement to conduct physical



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>



test, chemical test and microbiological test.  The findings of

these  tests are complete, comprehensive and sufficient  basis

to establish the suitability for potable use of the new source

of water supply.  In the case of NEWater, over a period of two

years,  we had conducted thousands of tests - physical  tests,

chemical  tests,  microbiological tests - and  it  is  clearly

established beyond any doubt that NEWater is safe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the article in Today seems to convey the point

that,  since  there  are  two  animal  tests  still  underway,

therefore we have not established the long-term health  effect

of  NEWater.   This is a wrong presentation of the  situation.

Such  animal tests are conducted all over the world,  not  for

the  purpose  of introducing new sources of water supply,  but

for  the  introduction  of new drugs.   Sir,  any  company  or

industry  that  wants  to introduce new  drugs  will  have  to

conduct  animal  tests, but not for the  introduction  of  new

sources of water supply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you may then ask: if this is the case, why did PUB

and  NUS go ahead to conduct these two animal tests?  Sir, let

me  put it this way.  The article is right to say that we  are

being kiasu.  We want to be so sure and safe that, even though

all  the  tests needed have concluded clearly that NEWater  is

safe  to  drink,  we want to make sure that,  on  an  on-going

basis,  we will continue to monitor NEWater, just to  be  very

safe.   In case something unknown happens, at least we are  in

there  to  monitor the development and, if need be,  take  the

necessary measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure this House that the safe potable use of

NEWater is never in doubt.  I was not at the interview.  So  I

do  not  know  whether  Prof. Lee and Prof.  Ong  were  either

misquoted, or quoted out of context.  But I leave  it  to  the

experts to respond to the article in the newspaper Today.



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir,

can the Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>



explain the rationale by the international panel of experts on

the recommendation to pump NEWater back to the reservoir?   If

it is not a good rationale, would we actually consider merging

it  after it is being treated so that you actually do  not  go

through a second treatment and you can save cost?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, Mr Steve Chia basically asked if

NEWater  is  safe and why did the international  expert  panel

recommend the indirect potable use and not direct potable use.

Sir,  the potable use of reclaimed water is not new.   It  has

happened  in some places in USA, for example, since 1972.   So

it  is  almost 30 years by now.  In USA today, the consumption

of  reclaimed water has to satisfy two requirements.  Firstly,

the  reclaimed water must be of potable standard,  meaning  it

must  be  able to meet all international standards for potable

use.   It  means the reclaimed water must be good  enough  for

potable  use  on  its own.  Secondly, having established  that

this  reclaimed  water has met the potable  standard,  in  USA

today,  they have stipulated that this reclaimed water  should

go through a process of naturalisation, meaning it is put into

the  reservoir, above ground or underground, and then  treated

again  through  conventional method  before  it  is  used  for

consumption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in other words, what we are saying is that even

though the NEWater plant in Singapore - using the words of the

international experts - is the best of the best in  the  world

today,  even  though the quality of NEWater is of the  highest

standard they know of, we still feel that, just to be  prudent

and  cautious,  we  should  follow  established  international

practices,  which is to let the reclaimed water go  through  a

process of naturalisation in the reservoir before we treat  it

again for indirect potable use.



<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> May I ask the Minister if he can

confirm  that  there  have been tests conducted  by  countries

overseas who have used NEWater in an indirect manner and  that

there are no long-term negative effects of such use?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, we have gathered the international

experts,  people  who are experienced in  the  area  of  water

reclamation and who have done it for many years before to  sit

on  our Expert Panel for NEWater.  Take the case of USA,  they

have been doing that for the last 25-30 years.  Today, you  go

to  Orange County, or Upper Occoquan in North Virginia, it  is

quite  clear  that they have consumed reclaimed  water  in  an

indirect manner for the last 20-30 years and there is no  sign

at all of any long-term health effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also add that anyone, including the reporter of

Today's  article,  who still has any doubt about  this  should

visit the NEWater Visitor Centre.  The whole purpose of having

the NEWater Visitor Centre is for members of the public to see

for  themselves and to convince themselves that NEWater indeed

is safe and clean.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My favourite exhibit there is one that blows up the pore

size  of  the  reverse osmosis membrane by 100 million  times.

With the enlargement, the size of the pores of the membrane is

now the size of a tennis ball.  In that exhibit, it shows that

pure  water is the size of a ping-pong ball.  As a  result,  a

ping-pong  ball can get through the reverse osmosis  membrane.

But in the case of an estrogenic compound, which could cause a

change  in  the sex of a fish, it is the size of  a  football.

Obviously, a football is much bigger than a tennis ball.   So,

no  estrogenic  compound is able to get  through  the  reverse

osmosis membrane.  In the case of a virus, it is the size of a

3-ton  truck, compared to the size of a tennis ball.   In  the

case of bacteria, it is the size of a building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if you go to the NEWater Visitor Centre, you can see

clearly  for  yourself that NEWater is really clean  and  very

safe.   I  want to repeat that we have established beyond  any

doubt that NEWater is clean and safe.  Otherwise, we would not

have introduced NEWater.



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, I would like to find out from the

Minister, by the time



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>



we  become self-sufficient in water supply, what would be  the

composition  of  the  typical glass  of  water,  in  terms  of

rainwater, desalted water and NEWater.  Of course, by then, it

is  unlikely that I would have a chance to taste that glass of

water.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think Dr Wang asked

a very interesting question.  Assuming that post-2061 there is

no  new water agreement with Malaysia; assuming that there  is

no  new  technology,  which is not  likely  to  be  the  case;

assuming that there are no other new sources of water  supply;

in  effect,  our  four  national water taps  would  have  been

reduced  to  only  three,  ie, local  catchment,  NEWater  and

desalted water.  Based on PUB assessment, even if we are to be

solely  dependent on these three sources of supply  alone,  we

will  still be able to meet all our water requirements in  the

long-term  and,  at  the same time, do  it  in  an  affordable

manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang asked what would be the projected mix for these

three  sources of water supply by then.  Again, our assessment

is  that, firstly, we do not really have to use every drop  of

water  again, again and again.  In fact, all we have to do  is

to  turn  every drop of water into two drops of  water.   That

would be enough for us to have a supply that is sufficient  to

meet  our long-term requirements.  Bearing in mind what I said

earlier  that  more  than 80% of the  NEWater  would  be  used

directly  for  non-potable  use in industrial  and  commercial

buildings, for a glass of water coming out of the tap,  we  do

not  expect the contents of NEWater to be significantly higher

than  the  10%  established in other countries.   In  the  USA

today,  after 25 years, on the average, they are now achieving

about 15-25% of water reclamation in terms of the contents  of

reclaimed  water  in  the tap water.   Based  on  our  current

projection,  we  do not have to come near to their  practices.

In  other  words, most of the water coming from the  tap  will

still be water from the sky and the sea.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>



estimated  rate  of loss due to evaporation in  the  reservoir

when  the  water has been pumped back in?  The second question

is:  since  we  are so kiasu in wanting to do so  many  tests,

should  we not be also a bit even more kiasu by waiting  until

the  test results are out before we pump the NEWater back into

the  reservoir,  rather than pumping it back in  when  we  are

still  awaiting the results of the test?  This is because  the

article did say that there is a long-term chronic toxicity and

carcinogenic  potential of the NEWater, which is  an  area  of

concern.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, Mr Chia's first question on

evaporation,  I  am not able to answer it.  It  is  a  natural

process.   Water  evaporates when the sun comes  up!   In  any

case, it goes up and comes down as rain.  It is a closed loop.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia asked why not wait till the test results

are  out.   Sir, it is very unfortunate that this article  has

created  this  doubt in the minds of the public, including  Mr

Chia.  As I said, I was not at the interview.  So, I leave  it

to  the two experts to clarify with the reporter whether  they

did  say  that  the  long-term  health  effect  has  not  been

established.   But,  as  I  mentioned  to  you  earlier,   the

international experts, in their report to the PUB, had in fact

clearly concluded that NEWater is safe for potable use.   This

question  of  long-term health effect of NEWater was  never  a

concern  because  it  has  been clearly  established.   It  is

unfortunate that the article has now created this doubt.  As I

said,  the experts should clarify the issue so that the public

would not be confused.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia asked, since we are so kiasu, why not wait

till  the  test  is  concluded.  Sir, today,  there  are  many

studies going on in the scientific community.  Let us say, one

study  may  be  on the long term side effect of the  sugar  we

take.   Does it mean that the Government should now  stop  the

sale of sugar in the marketplace?  There are many studies  on-going  today  saying that many things we eat, many  things  we

drink, even the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>



hamburgers  that  we eat in McDonald's, might  have  long-term

implications.   Does  it  mean that  we  should  stop  selling

hamburgers,  food and drinks?  The answer is no,  because,  at

the  end of the day, the job of the research community  is  to

continue to discover new knowledge that we do not know  today.

But  just because they are pursuing new areas of research,  it

does  not mean that we should now stop our life today,  as  we

still need to survive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me assure this House again that the Government

would  not have proceeded with the introduction of NEWater  if

we  were  not  fully  confident that the safe  consumption  of

NEWater  was  beyond any doubt.  Let me once  again  encourage

everyone  to  go ahead and drink our PUB tap water.   We  have

said  so before, and we say so again, that PUB's tap water  is

one of the best in the world today, and it is our intention to

continue to maintain this standard.  With the introduction  of

NEWater,  the  cleanness  of  PUB  water  has  not  only  been

maintained but has, to some extent, been enhanced.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>



Speaker, Sir, may I have your permission to take Question Nos.

6 and 7 together?



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Miss Penny Low and Dr Wang Kai Yuen

have sought clarification on MAS' rationale for the lifting of

the  financial  limits  on car loans.  This  decision  is  the

consequence of a general shift in MAS' supervisory  philosophy

from  prescriptive regulation to a risk-based approach,  where

MAS  avoids micro managing decisions by financial institutions

and  consumers,  and  applies supervisory  limits  only  where

necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a risk perspective, the financial limits on car

loans  were  unnecessary,  because such  loans  form  a  small

proportion  of  total loans in the financial system,  and  the

proportion of car loans that are non-performing is low.   From

a  consumer perspective, car loans are no different from other

forms of hire purchase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang has asked whether this sets a precedent for the

removal  of  other rules on consumer loans,  such  as  housing

loans.   This  is not the case.  Housing loans are significant

from  a  risk perspective because they form a large proportion

of  total loans in the financial system.  Unsecured loans  and

credit card facilities are smaller than housing loans, but MAS

regulates them for prudential and social reasons.  Many  other

regulators  around the world are likewise concerned  with  the

risks posed by rapid growth in property and consumer loans  to

the  health  of their financial systems.  Hence,  MAS  has  no

plans to remove these necessary safeguards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Low noted that there has been a rise in bankruptcies

and  unemployment rates and questioned the appropriateness  of

the  timing  of  this announcement.  The lifting  of  the  car

financing limits does not in any way imply that the Government

is   less   concerned  about  Singaporeans  facing   financial

difficulties   as   a  result  of  excessive   borrowing   for

consumption.   However, the lifting of the  limits  does  mean

that Singaporeans must take charge



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>



of  their own finances when making car purchases and determine

the   level  of  financing  that  is  appropriate  for   their

circumstances,  bearing in mind their repayment  ability  over

the longer term.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, financial institutions are expected to

act  prudently  and  decide on the quantum  of  financing  and

repayment  period, based on their assessment of the  repayment

ability of their borrowers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

and  Minister  for  Defence whether the Royal  Malaysian  Navy

vessels  have  been conducting patrol operations around  Pedra

Branca since 1964 and, if so, were these patrols conducted  on

a regular basis.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Second Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Defence (RAdm Teo Chee Hean) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, Malaysian leaders and their media have  claimed

that  their  Navy has been patrolling Pedra Branca waters  for

decades.  This is simply not true.  Malaysian state vessels  - Navy and Marine Police - came into Pedra Branca waters for the

first  time in June 1989, a good 10 years after the  Malaysian

claim  surfaced  in 1979.  This first spate of  violations  by

Malaysian  vessels took place over a 3-week  period  in  1989.

After  that,  there  was  a  lull before  a  second  spate  of

violations  in 1992, and then another lull, then in  May  2002

there  was a third spate before the current episode  from  the

end of last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In between these spates, over the decade between 1992 and

2002, we recorded eight other violations of our sovereignty at

Pedra  Branca by Malaysian state vessels.  Hon. Members should

note  that  all these violations have occurred well after  the

Malaysians first made their claim on Pedra Branca in 1979.  We

have protested all these violations, and sought



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>



the  cooperation  of  the  Malaysian Government  to  stop  the

violations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members of this House know, Singapore and Malaysia

signed  a  Special Agreement three weeks ago, on 6th  February

2003,  to  refer the Pedra Branca dispute to the International

Court of Justice.  Unfortunately, Malaysian naval vessels have

continued  to  violate  our territorial  waters  around  Pedra

Branca even after that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under international law, what disputing parties do

to advance their case after the dispute has arisen will not be

given  credence  by the court. Violations of  our  territorial

waters   around  Pedra  Branca  by  Malaysian  state   vessels

therefore do not strengthen Malaysia's case in any way.   Such

violations  can only lead to a tense situation on  the  ground

and increase the risk of unintended incidents.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, may I ask

the Second Minister for Defence what perhaps is the motivation

of  the Malaysians to continue to intrude into our territorial

waters around Pedra Branca?



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am unable to

speculate  on  what  motives  the  Malaysians  may  have  but,

clearly,  as I have said, at this late stage, their violations

into  our territorial waters around Pedra Branca will have  no

bearing on the case and will not strengthen their case in  any

way.

to the violations?



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, our ships have been on patrol

in  that  area since well before 1979 and continue  to  be  on

patrol  in  that area.  Whenever there are violations  of  any

kind  by anyone in that area, our ships on patrol will  inform

them  and,  if  necessary, we have protested to  the  relevant

governments.   In  the case of Malaysian  violations  of  this

area, we have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>

sent protests to the Malaysian government.



<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Sir, can I ask the Minister

whether these intrusions pose any danger, in terms of shipping

traffic,  because the Straits is known to be a very  congested

area  and  whether  the patterns of the intrusions  are  quite

reckless and haphazard?



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, we have had occasions in the

last  month  or  so  where  the Maritime  Port  Authority  has

received   complaints   by  passing  merchant   vessels   that

Malaysians  state vessels in the Pedra Branca area  have  been

causing interference with navigation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There had also been occasions, particularly in May last

year, where Malaysian vessels have behaved in an unseaman-like

manner, coming very close to our vessels on patrol there,  and

such actions could lead to unintended consequences.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, in

view  of  the  situation of the Malaysian  vessels  coming  in

despite this international understanding that such action will

have no basis for enhancing their claim, is this an issue that

the  Malaysians understand or is there a dispute  as  to  this

kind  of procedure?  If so, what kind of understanding  should

we  have?  Otherwise, we will continue to have situations like

this, where one side agrees and the other side disagrees  with

the  protocol as to what should now form the basis  of  future

action.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Malaysians

should be well aware of this because this is exactly the  same

position  that  they adopted in their dispute  with  Indonesia

over  Sipadan and Ligitan.  The Malaysians should also be well

aware of this because we have informed them so, both in person

as  well  as through our Third Party Notes that we  have  sent

them.

<div align="center"><b>CITIZENS CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE ASSISTANCE SCHEME</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Number of applications received)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Charles Chong</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister and

Minister  for  Finance  what  is the  number  of  applications

received  under  the  Citizens  Consultative  Committee  (CCC)

Assistance Scheme and what is the number actually qualified to

receive assistance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Second Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Hng Kiang) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, 14,161

applications were received under the CCC Assistance Scheme  in

January 2003.  Of these, two were successful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high number of applications is probably because many

members   of  the  public  thought  that  it  was  a   general

unconditional  handout from the Government  which  they  might

have  a chance of getting.  But the CCC Assistance Scheme  was

specifically   to  offer  additional  help   only   to   those

households,  with a monthly income of $3,600  or  less,  whose

extra  GST  expenditure is not adequately offset  by  the  GST

offset package.  The People's Association and MOF held a press

briefing on 25th January 2003 to clarify the rationale of  the

Scheme.   Recent  feedback from the CCCs  indicates  that  the

number of applications has tapered off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GST Offset Package was designed with a 5% GST rate in

mind.   Although the transition to a 5% GST rate is now phased

in  over  two  years, the Government kept the  offset  package

intact. This is an additional reason why the vast majority  of

Singaporeans are receiving offsets worth more than 100% of the

additional GST they have to bear.



<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

could  the Minister give us an indication as to how much money

was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>



disbursed in these two successful cases compared with the cost

of  administering the scheme?  And could he also give  us  his

view  whether we have failed to reach out to people who  would

benefit from the scheme or have we introduced inadvertently  a

scheme  which everybody seems to be applying but very few  are

qualifying?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The way the scheme is run, each

applicant  would have to list out his income and his  expected

GST  expenditure and also the expected offset package that  he

has  received.   We would then analyse and  see  what  is  the

difference.  And if indeed the offset package he has  received

is  less than the GST expenditure which he is likely to incur,

then  we  would  give him the additional assistance.   In  the

first family, the amount of grant approved is about $105.   In

the second family, it is about $72.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain that the CCC Assistance Scheme is not a

new scheme introduced by us.  We put in place this scheme when

we introduced GST in 1994.  If Members remember, Dr Richard Hu

explained why such a scheme was necessary.  I think he put  it

very  cogently.   Basically, we have  the  various  assistance

schemes for Singaporeans which provide a safety net.   All  of

us  have tried to be as comprehensive as possible in designing

these  safety nets.  But just in case people are not protected

by  these  safety  nets,  then we have  this  "mother  of  all

schemes" called the CCC Assistance Scheme where they just come

forward,  explain how it has affected them and if indeed  they

have  been  adversely  affected,  we  will  provide  them  the

assistance.  And that worked out quite well in 1994.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time round when we raised the GST, we have, of

course, had the experience of the previous GST arrangement and

we have improved the offset package. The most important change

that  we  have  made this time round is the ERS  which  really

hands  out  cash  grants  to  Singaporeans  and  we  are  very

confident  that  every Singaporean has got an  offset  package

that  more  than offsets the GST expenditure.  But because  we

had this scheme



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>



in  1994, we thought we should not remove the scheme and still

keep  this safety net even though we know that having improved

on the offset package, the number of applicants would be very,

very  few and indeed it turns out that actually the number  of

applicants  who were eligible would be very small.   But  this

GST  change comes amidst the economic downturn, so more people

are  in financial difficulties.  It comes about after we  have

run  the  EDRS scheme which unfortunately may have  given  the

impression to some Singaporeans that there can be handouts  if

they  come  to  the CCC and apply for it.   As  a  result,  it

generated  this  big increase in the number  of  applications.

That is the reason why PA and MOF took action to explain this.

I  think we are getting this message across and the number  of

applications has come down.



<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Minister

has not quite answered my question on the cost of disbursement

but  it  does not matter.  Would the Minister consider cutting

our  losses  and  diverting the cost savings  and  the  amount

allocated  for  this scheme to other worthwhile  causes  where

more Singaporeans can benefit from?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The reason why I did not answer the

question  is  because I do not have the  data.   We  have  not

estimated  the cost to run this scheme because this scheme  is

run  by  the  CCC.  So it is not easy to ascribe the  specific

cost   to   this   system.   But  I  think   it   is   useful,

psychologically and politically, for us to have this scheme so

that  whoever falls through the net knows that there  is  this

scheme that they can come forward and avail themselves.  It is

good  for  us  and  although we may have designed  the  offset

package  comprehensively, we never know which  sector  we  may

have  missed  out.  I think it is right for us to include  the

scheme.  We did not expect that many applicants would turn  up

and  that it would be costly for us to administer this scheme.

But  the perception on the ground is that this is a free grant

and everybody tries their luck.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now, we have to take actions to make sure that people

understand  the scheme properly.  I think it is  a  worthwhile

scheme to run.  It will run its course and, at the end of  the

exercise, people who felt that they have been disadvantaged or

they did not benefit from the GST package know that there is a

recourse  that  they can turn to.  And those who  tried  their

luck had been given a hearing.  We calculated for them to show

specifically  that the GST offset package that they  get  more

than pays for the additional GST expenditure.  I think we also

win  a  convert to the GST scheme.  It is good for us to  keep

the scheme and not close it and divert the cost of running  it

to other schemes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot

understand  why  the Minister says that it  is  worthwhile  to

continue  with the scheme when so far, only two  persons  have

benefited.   Does it make any sense for us to  have  a  scheme

like  this and we end up explaining to people why in the first

place  they  do not qualify at all?  Would it not be  possible

for  the  Minister  to  look into  the  formula  by  which  we

calculate their eligibility?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have explained the

background to the scheme.  If, when we introduced this scheme,

we  told  this House that we were removing this scheme,  I  am

sure  MPs  like Mr Tan Soo Khoon would have stood up and  said

that the Government should keep this scheme in case our offset

package was not comprehensive enough and, therefore, we should

have  this  safety  net to catch these people.   I  think  our

intentions  are quite clear. We have designed a  comprehensive

GST  package  but  the society has different segments  and  we

provide this safety net in case people feel that they have not

benefited  from the offset package.  We have run  the  scheme.

People  have  turned up.  They were unsuccessful.   There  are

some costs to us in having to explain to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, personally, I think this is worthwhile because when

you  sit  down with the person and go through the calculations

with him, you convince him that, in fact,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>



the  additional  GST expenditure that he has incurred  is  not

very  significant and the GST offset that he has got from  the

Government is significant enough to offset it.  So it may seem

a very costly and laborious way of convincing individuals but,

personally, I think it is worth it and, therefore,  I  do  not

think  we  should  stop in the middle of  the  exercise.   The

numbers are coming down, so I do not think that it will  incur

too much administration from now on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid that the

Minister  has  not got my point.  Why do we  want  to  have  a

scheme for which we have announced that there would be quite a

big sum of money - I cannot remember how much it was - and  in

the  end, we tell people, everyone who comes to us, that  they

do  not, in fact, qualify at all?  What is the point of having

such  a  scheme?  I am in support of a scheme to  help  people

during  these difficult times, especially if it is  to  absorb

the  increase  in the GST, but I think what we would  like  to

have is a scheme that works and not a scheme that, in the end,

ensures  actually that from the word "go" when you apply,  you

do not qualify at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we must understand

the  objective  of the scheme. We started off by  saying  that

when  we increased the GST, all Singaporeans would be expected

to  pay  a higher GST component when they buy things.  At  the

same  time, we have a GST package which will help them  offset

this  additional GST component.  And because of  the  ERS,  we

make  sure that everybody is better off with the GST  package.

That  is  the  intention of having this scheme.   Because  the

design of our ERS is by household type and therefore there may

be those people, for example, who stay in private property but

at the lower end of the private property, who have high income

levels,  who may not be a national serviceman, and do not  get

the  extra GST.  So there may be a segment of people  in  that

situation  whose income level may be around $3,000  or  $2,000

and  because they are not staying in an HDB flat, they may not

be  the  head  of the household and therefore do not  get  the

benefit through



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>



the  Utilities  Save and the S&C grant, they  do  not  benefit

fully from the offset package.  So these are the cases that we

want to cater for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we made this announcement, we have set aside a few

million  dollars.  We did not make it a very big programme  to

cater for this group.  We know from our calculations that such

families  ought to be very few, but from 1994  till  now,  the

household formations and the type of housing in Singapore have

changed.  I think Members would remember that when Dr  Richard

Hu  proposed this scheme in 1994, he was very concerned  about

many  of the families staying in the Chinatown area which  are

not HDB flats. They are not heads of households, so they would

not benefit from the S&C grant, the Utilities Save and schemes

like  these.  Therefore, we kept the spirit of that scheme  to

cater  for such people who do not fall into the main  segments

that  would  benefit from the GST package.  The  intention  of

designing  this scheme is good.  It is intended to  target  at

that group of people. As it turns out, that group is far fewer

than  we expect.  We have raised expectations.  People thought

that  it  was a free handout. They came and tried their  luck.

We  cannot  turn them away, so we used that as an  educational

exercise.

countries, currencies and sectors.  The investments range from

global equities and global fixed income to special

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>

investments  and real estate.  Hence, while we  may  not  have

made  spectacular gains during the dot.com era, we  were  also

spared the huge losses when the bubble burst.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are difficult times for investors. Equity markets

around  the world have come down sharply.  But the  impact  of

market   movements  on  our  portfolio  is  buffered  by   the

diversified assets that we hold.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's investments overseas have produced good

returns  over the years.  Our investments have generally  done

well  relative to market benchmarks, such as the MSCI, as well

as  against  portfolios managed by the world's  top  financial

institutions and fund management companies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, can the Minister clarify Dr

Mahathir's  comment  that  from their  economic  intelligence,

Singapore  had  made  big  losses  from  investments?   Second

question:  what is GIC's average investment returns  over  the

past 10 years?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Again, I would not want to speculate on

the basis of Dr Mahathir's intelligence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Intelligence report.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Intelligence report, sorry.

Otherwise, that may create another big hooha.  Let me rephrase

it  -  intelligence report.  Thank you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of average returns, as I explained in my

reply  earlier,  the  funds are spread  over  different  asset

classes, and we have different benchmarks by which we evaluate

the  fund  managers who are given these funds to  manage.   So

far, we have done well compared to these benchmarks.  So,  our

returns are better than the benchmark returns.



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, is the Minister denying

that we are making big losses, as stated?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, our investments have done well

relative to market benchmarks.  So, there will be places where

we  make losses and there will be places where we make  gains.

But  we must look at it in the overall context.  We must  look

at  it  in  the  timeframe that we use.  We must  look  at  it

against  the  benchmarks.  For example, when the market  comes

down  30%,  to say that you do not make losses,  you  must  be

very,  very  good.  But if the market loses 30% and  you  lose

25%,  then you have done better than benchmarks.  So, you must

look at it from that perspective.

<div align="center"><b>(Lowering concessionary rates for mortgagors)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister for

National  Development if his Ministry will look into  ways  to

lower   the   concessionary  rates  charged  to  Housing   and

Development  Board  mortgagors to below 2.6%,  without  asking

them to go for private bank loans.



<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Sir, the HDB borrows funds from the Government at the CPF

Ordinary  Account  interest rate for  its  concessionary  rate

loans  to  eligible HDB mortgagors.  The CPF Ordinary  Account

rate  is computed based on the sum of 80% of the Fixed Deposit

rates  and 20% of the Savings Deposit rates of the three major

local  banks,  subject to a minimum of 2.5%, as  provided  for

under  the CPF Act.  By committing to a minimum rate of  2.5%,

the  Government ensures that CPF members enjoy a good rate  of

return  on  their CPF funds. Today, in contrast,  the  average

fixed deposit rate of the three major local banks is only 1.33

% per annum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB pegs its concessionary interest rate at 0.1% above

the  CPF rate in order to cover its administrative cost.  With

the  current CPF Ordinary Account interest rate at 2.5%, HDB's

concessionary interest rate is 2.6%.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB can lower its concessionary interest rate only if the

CPF lowers the Ordinary Account rate that it pays its members.

HDB,  therefore,  has  no  plans to adjust  its  concessionary

interest rate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, is it a statutory

requirement for HDB to borrow funds only from the CPF?



<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> It is not a statutory requirement

for  HDB to borrow its funds only from the Government who,  in

turn,  takes  it  from the CPF Board.  But Mr Steve  Chia,  as

someone  who  used  to work in the finance industry,  must  be

familiar  with the concept of the difference between borrowing

funds from long-term sources versus short-term sources, and he

should  not confuse the two.  The HDB and the Government  have

decided, quite rightly, that we should use funds from the  CPF

Board,  because this is a long-term source of funds which  are

taken  on  20-year repayment terms.  And as  anybody  who  has

borrowed money to fund his mortgage from HDB will know,  these

are   often   terms  running  from  10,  20   to   30   years.

Consequently, it is a prudential and sensible arrangement  for

the  HDB to continue to rely on the stable source of long-term

funding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rates which we see the banks offering right now are,

in a sense, promotional rates.  To give Members an example, if

we  look at what the concessionary rate had been for HDB  over

the last three years, it had been flat at 2.6%.  For those who

have  borrowed  money  from banks, if  we  look  at  the  non-promotional rates over the last three years, it had, in  fact,

been  at  around  5 or 6%, more than double the  concessionary

rate which HDB had been charging.  So, what we have right  now

is a sensible, safe and a secure system that works.  2.6% is a

reasonable rate to pay for any mortgage.  And anyone  who  has

been  in  this business for any length of time will know  that

this  is a system that works; this is a system that is secure.

However,  we have provided choices.  So, if people  feel  that

they are willing to enter the market and subject themselves to

market risks at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>



market  rates,  they are entitled to do so.  But  if  they  do

that,  they  cannot come back to HDB and say they now  want  a

concessionary rate loan again.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</b> asked the Minister for Manpower in

view   of   the   increasing  number   of   retrenchments   of

professional,  managerial and executive staff aged  above  40,

(a)  what  special  programmes are in place to  re-train  this

cohort  for  relevant jobs to be created  by  the  Free  Trade

Agreements that have been concluded and (b) how can  we ensure

that  some  of  these relevant jobs will be made available  to

them.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  Singapore's Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with  important

trading  partners  such as New Zealand, Japan,  European  Free

Trade    Association,   Australia   and   recently   concluded

negotiations  with  USA, will save our exporters  hundreds  of

millions  of dollars of tariffs a year and open up  access  to

previously closed or restricted sectors.  This will create new

opportunities for our companies to expand overseas and attract

more investments here to take advantage of the increased trade

access.    This   will   also  result   in   more   employment

opportunities for Singaporeans.  The nature of the jobs  which

will  be  created  will depend to a large  extent  on  whether

industries  are  quick off the mark to seize  the  new  market

opportunities  and  also  on  the nature  of  new  investments

attracted to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, the extent to which Singapore and

Singaporeans  benefit  from these  FTAs  will  depend  on  our

companies'  ability to seize the opportunities afforded  under

the  FTAs  to  grow and expand internationally.  The  recently

concluded FTAs will not help us to hold on to jobs that are no

longer  competitive, whether in the manufacturing or  services

sectors.    We  have  to  remain  more  productive  than   our

competitors.  Our workers must also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>



have  the  requisite skills and capabilities to take on  these

new  job  opportunities. Workers without the  relevant  skills

must  be  prepared  to  upgrade and  be  retrained  to  remain

employable.  This is the only way for us to benefit  from  the

FTAs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mature professionals, managers and executives, otherwise

known  as PMEs, who have unfortunately been retrenched or  are

currently  still unemployed can take advantage of the  various

training  programmes established by my Ministry, such  as  the

Strategic   Manpower   Conversion  Programmes   in   Infocomm,

Internationalisation, Healthcare, Social & Community  Services

and  Logistics sectors to equip themselves with new skills and

capabilities.    In   addition  to  this,  professionals   and

executives who are interested in starting their own businesses

can  take  advantage of my Ministry's Self-Employment Training

Programme.   My  Ministry will consider  what  other  training

programmes   are   needed  and  relevant  to   enhancing   the

employability of professionals, managers and executives.

for  the  period from 1st January 2002 to 31st December  2002,

(a) how many employers had defaulted in the payment of Central

Provident  Fund  (CPF) contributions and what  was  the  total

amount  of the arrears; (b) how many employers were prosecuted

for such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>



defaults;  and (c) whether the CPF Board was able  to  recover

the arrears on behalf of the workers.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, from 1st January to

31st  December 2002, there were about 6,500 cases of employers

defaulting  on  their  employees'  CPF  contributions.    This

translated into a default rate of 0.6% for 2002.  The  Board's

stringent  and  effective enforcement actions have  helped  to

keep the default rate low.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of arrears involved for 2002 was $17 million

(or  0.1% of the $16 billion contributions for 2002).   As  at

31st  January 2003, the outstanding arrears have been  reduced

to  $4 million.  The Board is continuing recovery actions  for

the remaining arrears.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers have a grace period of 14 days after the end of

the  month  for which the contributions are due  and  payable.

Those  who  fail  to pay up by then will be charged  interest,

while   compound   fines  will  be  imposed  on   recalcitrant

employers.  Employers are informed that legal action  will  be

taken against them unless the CPF contributions, interest  due

and  compound fines are paid within the notice period  stated.

In 2002,  about 700 employers were convicted in court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Board takes a serious view of employers who pay

late or fail to pay CPF contributions for their employees  and

is  committed to ensuring prompt recovery of the  CPF  arrears

for employees through speedy enforcement action.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, could the Minister give us a bit

of  the  profile of employers who defaulted?  Are  they  MNCs,

local companies and which sectors are they from?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I do not have the profile here,

but my understanding is that a broad spectrum of companies are

involved.   Perhaps  our  small  local  companies   may   also

represent a significant sector of those who were in default of

their employees' CPF payments.  If the

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman</b> asked the Minister for

Health  (a) in each of the last 5 years what is (i) the number

of  abortions by teenagers and (ii) this number in  proportion

to  all abortions; and (b) if the trend is increasing, whether

his Ministry is collaborating with other Ministries to develop

programmes to address the trend.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  in  1998, there were 1,368 teenage abortions  out  of  a

total  of 13,838 abortions.  In 1999, 1,424 out of a total  of

13,753  abortions.  In  2000, 1,730 out of a total  of  13,734

abortions.  In 2001, 1,698 out of a total of 13,140 abortions.

In  2002,  1,626 out of a total of 12,749 abortions.   So,  as

Members  can  see,  the number of teenage  abortions  averages

about  1,500 annually, and represents about 12% of  the  total

abortions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-abortion counselling is provided to teenagers at the

School Health Services, Health Promotion Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry monitors the situation closely and works with

other  Ministries, like the Ministry of Education and Ministry

of  Community  Development  and Sports,  on  sexual  education

programmes that aim to reduce teenage abortions.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could I ask

the  Minister  whether he could enlighten this  House  on  the

possible  reasons why about one in four pregnancies  or  about

14,000 babies get aborted in Singapore each year?  And in view

of  the  declining birth rate, what has his Ministry  done  to

look into this matter?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The decision for individuals to go for

abortion  is a personal decision and the reasons for doing  so

cover over a wide range.  If the Member likes, we would put up

a specific reply on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>



the  reasons.  Offhand, I cannot provide the specific  reasons

with   specific  percentages.   The  number   has   not   been

increasing.  As you can see, the total number of abortions had

indeed  come down from about 13,800 to 12,700.  So,  over  the

last five years, through our various efforts, we have kept the

number declining, albeit in a very gradual way.  Of course, we

would  like  all babies to be wanted babies and we would  also

like  to raise the birth rate.  To this end, we work with  all

the various agencies to try and achieve this objective.



<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> I wonder if the

Minister can comment on how this 12% average in the last  five

years compares to the previous years, and whether we should be

concerned  about  any  trend in terms of abortion,  especially

among the teenagers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, he mentioned about pre- and post-counselling - I do not know whether there was post-counselling - for

teenagers.   Is the counselling only meant for the  teenagers?

Are  families involved in the counselling?  At the same  time,

are  the  fathers  of  the aborted foetuses  involved  in  the

counselling process?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The counselling is done as a pre-abortion counselling, as I mentioned in my reply. The

counselling  is  mandatory for the young teenagers.   For  the

rest, we will encourage them to go for such counselling.   The

counselling involves the women directly affected.  And we also

encourage  them to bring in their families so that counselling

can  be done holistically.  So we try our best to explain  the

implications  and consequences, and lead the affected  persons

through  the process.  And there is a mandatory period,  after

the  counselling, for them to reflect on the  counselling  and

before they make a decision to proceed with the abortion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, am I correct to say that

our abortion law was enacted in 1970 and reviewed in 1974?  Is

it  not  overdue to relook into this abortion law to  keep  up

with the changing times and circumstances?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> We review the Abortion Act regularly

internally,  and  I  remember two years ago  we  had  quite  a

vigorous debate on this issue too.  So this is always  on  the

agenda.



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, in view of the low birth

rate   in  Singapore,  would  the  Ministry  consider  greater

incentives for promoting adoption rather than abortion?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> There are such schemes in place and we

have a committee to encourage procreation, marriage and birth.

These are some of the measures which they are promoting.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang:</b> I would like to ask the

Minister if there is a study to review the various reasons and

factors  for teenage abortion and whether more efforts  should

be  taken to look at human sexuality programmes in schools, to

make it mandatory, in a sense, for teenagers to understand the

various  issues  involved.  Because it  seems  that  for  some

cases,  abortion  was used as a means of  family  planning  or

birth control.  They use it as a form of birth control instead

of  what  it should be.  So, is there any attempt to  actually

step up efforts?  I think there is a danger of a growing trend

in teenage abortions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> As I mentioned in my reply, we do work

with  MCDS  and MOE on the various programmes to  educate  our

young  women.   MOE,  for example, has a  sexuality  education

programme  in  the  schools.  I hear that it  has  been  quite

successful.   This was implemented about two  years  ago,  and

they monitor the progress of this programme.



<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Sir, the Minister has not

commented on the 12% average and whether over the past  years,

the  Ministry  is  seeing  any  trend  in  terms  of   teenage

abortion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> My apologies. I do not have the data

before these five years.  We would take a look at those data.



<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Am I right to assume that for teenagers

who want abortion, it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>



not  mandatory for them to bring their parents along  for  the

counselling session?  If so, why so?  Because if a person  who

wants to drive needs to be above 18 years old, surely a person

who is below 18 and wants to go for an abortion should receive

adequate attention and care and some form of family support in

her decision.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> We went through this debate two years

ago  -  whether  it  should be mandatory and whether  parental

consent  should be necessary before teenagers are  allowed  to

have  abortions.  I think Members will understand  that  there

are pros and cons.  Many of the teenagers who come forward for

abortion  may not have the necessary family support.   And  if

you make it mandatory, you may force some of them to undertake

illegal  abortions in the side lanes or even out of Singapore.

So,  there is a downside risk if you make it mandatory.   When

this  legislation was introduced, we decided it was  wiser  to

keep  it  voluntary.  We make every effort  to  encourage  the

young  girls to bring in their families because family support

is  necessary.  But, on balance, we feel that if  we  make  it

mandatory  for  parental consent, then we may  drive  some  of

these young girls underground.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry works closely with our community partners to

help   teenage  parents  and  their  newborns  who  may   need

assistance.    Healthy   Start  is  a  community-based   early

intervention programme provided by family service  centres  to

identify families at risk and their vulnerable newborns.  Such

families  are identified by family service centres  after  the

babies  are  born at the hospitals.  Regular home  visits  are

made  to  assess  the family situation, and to  link  them  to

relevant   community   resources  for  financial   assistance,

emotional support, childcare arrangements as well as parenting

and family life enrichment programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other support mechanisms include pregnancy crisis

helplines,  temporary  shelters  for  teenagers  during  their

pregnancy,  and assistance on adoption for those  who  do  not

have the means to raise the child.



<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Can I ask if the Ministry

has detected any profile of such teenagers?  Also, what is the

proportion of the different actions, in terms of whether  they

keep  the  baby or whether they give up the baby for adoption?

What  is  the proportion of the different actions?   And  when

they  keep the baby, what is being done specifically  to  help

these teenagers and their parents?

breakdown  in terms of the different actions, but I  would  be

most  happy  to  provide the details to the Member.   If  they

choose  to  keep  the baby and if the family  service  centres

identify  the teenage parents and the newborn are at risk,  we

will  provide  assistance through the Healthy Start  programme

and  other intervention means which are being carried  out  by

several FSCs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> May I ask the

Minister  whether  there  is any specific  timeframe  for  the

revision of the new scheme.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The ElderShield scheme was launched

very recently.  The immediate priority of the Ministry and the

ElderShield insurers is to ensure the smooth operation of  the

scheme.   We need to let the scheme run for a while to  get  a

better  feel  of  the application and payout rates.   Then,  I

think,  we  have  a meaningful basis to make  changes  to  the

premiums and the payout.  You need better data on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>



payout ratios if you want to make changes.  But we will  leave

it  to  the insurers.  If they feel that there are any  market

gaps  which  they can modify the scheme to fill in,  they  are

free to come to us and propose how they can fill in the market

gaps.

<div align="center"><b>LICENCE FEE FOR TAXIS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Rationale)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</b> asked the Minister for

Transport  if he will (a) explain the rationale and basis  for

charging the licensing fee of $25 per month per taxi  on  taxi

operators for monitoring the performance of taxis; (b) explain

how  the  quantum of $25  is arrived at; (c) ensure that  this

additional cost will not be passed to commuters; and (d) state

how   the  Land  Transport  Authority  plans  to  monitor  the

performance of taxis.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> You have got two minutes, Mr Khaw.



<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan (Senior Minister of State for Transport) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan) (for the Minister for Transport):</b> The objective of the

Taxi  Operator Licence regime is to improve the level of  taxi

service.  Under this regime, taxi operators will be made  more

accountable  for the quality of their taxi services,  as  they

will need to meet a set of Quality of Service standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Taxi Operator Licence regime will require the

regulator,  LTA,  to closely monitor the performance  of  taxi

operators  and  their compliance with the Quality  of  Service

standards.   LTA  will  also investigate and  enforce  against

errant  taxi  drivers under the new Vocational Licence  Points

System.   As  all these are new activities, additional  budget

and manpower resources will be required.  The licence fee will

enable LTA to fund these activities relating to regulating and

improving the taxi industry.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA expects to analyse and audit fairly often the

performance records of the taxi companies for compliance  with

the  Quality of Service standards in the initial  one  or  two

years.   It  has estimated that it needs an annual  budget  of

$5.3  million,  which includes the salary cost for  28  staff.

The main cost items are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) To develop and operate a new centralised computer

system to administer the Taxi Operator Licence regime and  the

records of some 85,000 taxi drivers;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) To enforce the Quality of Service standards by

analysing the radiophone booking systems of the taxi operators

and commissioning external audits of the operators' radiophone

booking systems and their operations;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) To conduct investigations and enforcement

against errant taxi drivers; and, lastly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) To monitor taxi services by conducting taxi surveys

and auditing indicators submitted by the taxi operators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there are about 19,000 taxis in Singapore, this works

out  to a licence fee of $25 per taxi per month.  This is less

than 1% of the gross turnover of the operators.

<div align="center"><b>SEIZING OPPORTUNITY IN UNCERTAINTY</b></div>



<div align="center"><h4>PART I: OUTLOOK AND RESPONSE</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2001, our GDP shrank by 2.4% in our worst-ever

recession  since  Independence.  Last year began  promisingly.

Despite the uncertainties of the war against terrorism and the

conflicts  in the Middle East, initially the recovery  of  the

United  States economy boosted our growth prospects.   But  as

the  year  progressed, a wave of corporate  scandals  and  the

WorldCom and Enron collapses shook the confidence of investors

and consumers.  This slowed down the US economy.  The European

Union  (EU) and Japanese economies also lost steam.   However,

the  East Asian economies did well.  Our exports to China grew

strongly, but this was not enough to make up for the  fall  in

external demand elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the unfavourable conditions, our economy grew by

2.2%  in  2002.   Unemployment peaked at  4.6%,  but  improved

slightly  to 4.2% by the end of the year.  Manufacturing  grew

by  8.3%  driven  largely  by the small,  but  fast-expanding,

biomedical   science  cluster.   Exports  remained  resilient,

growing by 1.9%.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore continued to attract investments. We garnered

over  $9  billion of fixed-asset investments in manufacturing.

Foreign  manufacturing fixed-asset investments rose from  $6.6

billion  in  2001  to  $7 billion last year,  while  committed

foreign  business spending grew by 35% to $1.5  billion.   The

electronics cluster continued to attract the largest share  of

investments followed by the chemicals cluster.  Investments in

biomedical  projects generated the second highest  value-added

for the economy.  All these investments are expected to create

21,000 jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite some public concern about the cost of living, the

Consumer Price Index (CPI) last year fell by 0.4%.  Healthcare

and  education  costs rose, but housing and car  prices  fell.

Lower electricity tariffs, cheaper accommodation and household

durables  combined to reduce housing costs by  2.2%.   Cheaper

petrol   and   a   lower  road  tax  reduced   transport   and

communication  costs  by  1%.  Basic  food  items  like  rice,

cooking oil, meat, seafood and vegetables all cost less.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government implemented a slate of measures to help

Singaporeans cope with the downturn and adapt to the  economic

restructuring.    Last  year,  our  training   and   upgrading

programmes helped 36,000 workers learn new skills to match the

jobs  that  are  available or being created.   The  Off-Budget

package  helped all Singaporeans, especially the  lower-income

and unemployed.  800,000 HDB households received 10 months  of

utilities  rebates worth a total of $226 million.   A  further

$110 million went towards helping Singaporeans through rebates

on rental and service and conservancy (S&C) charges.



<br><br><b><i>Immediate Outlook</i></b>



<br><br><u>Global</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the major uncertainty hanging over the world

economy is the prospect of war in Iraq.  Consumers are holding

back  their  spending, and companies are  delaying  investment

plans.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>



Within a few weeks we will know whether war is going to  break

out.   Within a few months we will know how things have turned

out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One significant worry is oil prices. After a war, they

could fall back to normal and give a boost to growth, or  they

may  stay high and slow down the recovery process.  The crisis

in  Venezuela, which has significantly reduced world  supplies

of oil, makes it more likely that oil prices will stay high.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growth in Europe and Japan this year is expected to

remain sluggish.  In the US, the consumer confidence index  in

January  reached  its lowest level since  1993.   The  present

projection  remains  for a pickup in the second  half  of  the

year, bringing growth close to 3%, slightly better than 2002.



<br><br><u>Regional</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In East Asia, sustained domestic consumption should

maintain  growth  at  rates  similar  to  last  year,  despite

tensions  in the Korean peninsula.  Exports from the Southeast

Asian region should stay robust, as stronger demand from China

should  partially compensate for the weaker  demand  from  the

developed  economies.  China is a large  and  rapidly  growing

market  that offers many opportunities to nimble entrepreneurs

and companies.  India's economy too has much potential.  It is

showing  a  new  dynamism  and  a  more  outward  orientation,

especially in the southern states.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic cooperation among the ASEAN countries is

gradually deepening, for example, through the ASEAN Free Trade

Area  (AFTA).  ASEAN  is also launching Free  Trade  Agreement

(FTA)  negotiations  with China and Japan,  and  preparing  to

benefit  from  an  FTA  with India and  the  Enterprise  ASEAN

Initiative  with  the US.  Terrorism is  still  a  problem  in

Southeast  Asia,  but after the Bali bombing, ASEAN  countries

are cooperating more closely to combat this threat.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><u>Singapore</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the external conditions, I expect Singapore's

economy  to continue to grow slowly in the first half  of  the

year.   In  the second half, if the US economy and the  global

electronics  industry strengthen as we hope, Singapore  should

also  recover more strongly, and our unemployment should start

to decline.  For 2003 as a whole, MTI expects GDP growth to be

between  2% and 5%, although it is less likely to  be  at  the

high  end of the range.  Like in 2002, growth is likely to  be

narrow  and  uneven across the different sectors.  A  broader-based recovery is not expected until 2004.



<br><br><b><i>Starting Well</i></b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we now live in a fundamentally changed

world.   Singapore is at a turning point.  We  face  not  just

greater  economic  volatility,  but  also  new  political  and

security uncertainties.  Competition is keener and changes are

coming faster.  To stay in the race and ahead of the pack,  we

must   constantly  adapt  to  the  changes  around   us,   and

restructure our economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After many years of rapid growth and development, our

people  now enjoy a high per capita income and a high standard

of  living.  But as our economy matures, it will be  difficult

for  us  to  maintain the same high rates of  growth  that  we

experienced  in the 1980s and 1990s.  Structural  unemployment

will  become  a  more serious problem.  Older,  less  educated

workers  who fail to update and upgrade their skills  will  be

particularly  vulnerable.   The Government's  fiscal  position

will  tighten  as  slower growth means less buoyant  revenues,

while  an  ageing  population will lead  to  increased  social

spending.  We must find new sources of growth or else stagnate

and decline.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These challenges are formidable, but we can overcome

them.   Over the last 30 years we have built up our financial,

physical  and  human resources through toil and teamwork.   We

have strengthened our social cohesion and institutions.  We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>



share  ideals  and  values that help us to  work  harmoniously

together  for maximum results.  These key advantages  help  us

tackle  difficult  problems  together,  and  restructure   our

economy for continued prosperity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already begun the task of restructuring. In

October  2001,  the Government announced the establishment  of

the  Economic Review Committee (ERC) to develop new strategies

to  take  us forward.  Last year, the Government accepted  and

implemented two major recommendations of the ERC.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we decided to restructure our tax system. We

are  lowering  corporate  and top personal  income  tax  rates

substantially.    This  will  help  to  retain   and   attract

businesses  and  talent,  and  thus  create  good   jobs   for

Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time we are raising the GST rate. The

Government provided a generous $4.1 billion offset package  to

help  Singaporeans adjust to the GST increase, and ensure that

no  household will be worse off for at least five  years.   In

addition,  the Government is phasing in the GST increase  over

two  years,  instead  of raising it to  5%  in  one  step,  as

originally planned.  This puts an additional $650 million into

the pockets of Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we restructured the CPF to focus on the basic

retirement  needs of Singaporeans and trim over-investment  in

housing.   This  will keep the burden of CPF contributions  as

low  as  possible, while meeting the essential  needs  of  the

majority of the population.  To help older workers aged  50-55

stay  employable,  we also capped employers' contributions  to

their CPF at 16%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides these ERC recommendations, we responded to the

recession  by  moderating  wage  increases  to  maintain   our

competitiveness  and  retain  jobs.   Singaporeans  have  been

guided by the National Wages Council's recommendation of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>



wage  restraint,  which extends until June this  year.   Their

willingness   to   accept  these  sacrifices  reflects   their

pragmatism,  as  well  as  the close  tripartite  relationship

between the unions, employers and the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This clear response has distinguished us from other

countries.   Foreign  investors and analysts  have  noted  our

decisive  actions to restructure the economy  and  tackle  the

downturn,  as well as our support for difficult but  essential

policies.   This  is  a key reason why we  have  continued  to

attract  investments,  even  as investment  flows  into  other

Southeast Asian countries have declined.



<br><br><b><i>Moving Ahead</i></b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made a good start in restructuring the economy to

secure our future.  But this is a long process, and much  more

work lies ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this month, the ERC completed its work and

published  a  comprehensive report.  It recommended  immediate

measures to help our economy recover fully from the recession,

as  well as longer term strategies to make Singapore a leading

global city.  These five strategies addressed our:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our External Ties



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Competitiveness and Flexibility



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Entrepreneurship and Singapore Companies



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Manufacturing and Services; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Human Capital



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government accepts the recommendations in the ERC

report.   These recommendations reflect the inputs of  over  a

thousand  participants  from the private  sector,  the  labour

movement, as well as the public sector.  The Government thanks

all  of  them  for  their  efforts and  contributions.   Their

proposals provided a sound basis for revitalising our economy,

and  for  sustaining growth in the next phase of our  economic

development.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first explain these five strategies before I give

the  Government's response to the immediate steps  recommended

by the ERC.  Later, in Part III of the speech, I will announce

specific measures to implement the ERC recommendations.



<br><br><u>External Ties</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our first strategy is to expand our ties with economic

partners globally and in Asia, especially Southeast Asia.  The

US,  the EU and Japan will continue to be our main markets and

sources  of investments.  But we must also seize opportunities

in new markets, particularly China and India, by deepening our

knowledge of their business conditions and expanding trade and

investment ties with them.  Singapore must make itself  a  hub

for  strategic  and high value-added activities  of  companies

that operate in our broader hinterland of greater China, India

and  Australia,  which are within a seven-hour  flight  radius

from us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must continue to deepen our economic integration with

our  ASEAN  neighbours,  and make  ASEAN  more  attractive  to

foreign  investors.  By combining our complementary strengths,

ASEAN countries can compete more effectively, and hold our own

in manufacturing activities, even against China.  This is what

Singapore is doing together with Batam and Bintan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a small, open economy dependent on world trade,

Singapore  supports  multilateral trade liberalisation  within

the  World  Trade Organisation (WTO) framework.   However,  we

must  complement  this with bilateral FTAs  with  key  trading

partners to expand our economic ties and assure our access  to

their markets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already signed FTAs with Australia, New Zealand,

Japan  and  the European Free Trade Association  (EFTA).   The

negotiations  for  the  US-Singapore  FTA  were  concluded  in

January.   We  look  forward  to  signing  and  ratifying  the

agreement this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are currently negotiating FTAs with Canada and Mexico.

We will also launch



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>



a trilateral FTA with New Zealand and Chile.  We are likely to

launch  FTA  talks with India and also South Korea this  year.

As  part  of ASEAN, we are negotiating an FTA with  China  and

doing a study to launch an FTA with India.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These bilateral arrangements will save our exporters

hundreds  of  millions of dollars in tariffs  a  year,  create

opportunities  for  our  companies  to  expand  overseas,  and

attract  more investments here to take advantage of the  FTAs.

This will result in more jobs for Singaporeans.



<br><br><u>Competitiveness and Flexibility</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our second strategy is to strengthen our competitiveness,

and  enhance the flexibility of the economy.  Given our  small

land  area  and our dependence on imported energy,  we  cannot

compete based on costs alone, against larger countries  better

endowed with natural resources.  Instead, we must redouble our

efforts  to  improve  our  microeconomic  competitiveness  and

efficiency.  We must offer a superior business environment and

an internationally competitive cost structure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is committed to keeping taxes low,

especially direct taxes on companies and individuals, in order

to  keep the burden of government light, encourage investments

and reward enterprise.  We believe that a 20% tax rate will be

highly   competitive,   but  we   will   continue   to   track

international trends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF must stay focused on its core purposes of

providing basic financial security in retirement, housing  and

healthcare   for   the  majority  of  Singaporeans.    To   be

sustainable  over  the long term, the CPF must  not  become  a

heavy  imposition on employers that deters them from employing

workers or growing their businesses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our labour market must be flexible, so that workers can

move freely from one job to another, and companies can hire or

shed  workers  when  they  need to.  The  more  difficult  and

expensive it is for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>



companies  to  downsize, the more reluctant they  will  be  to

employ   people   in  the  first  place.   This   will   raise

unemployment, to the detriment of workers, as has happened  in

Germany.   Work  arrangements such as overtime practices  must

become  more  flexible to accommodate the  ups  and  downs  in

business  conditions.  Our wages need to reflect the worth  of

the  job  and  the  contribution of the employee,  instead  of

depending rigidly on the seniority of the person.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, competitively priced infrastructure will help

keep  business  costs low.  We should not  subsidise  services

below  their  true cost, but nor should we allow  monopoly  or

cost-plus pricing to inflate costs for other businesses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land is one of the most important factors of production.

To  make optimum use of this resource, the land market must be

efficient  and flexible.  This is especially so for industrial

land,  because MNC projects can go to any number of countries.

Hence we must ensure an adequate supply of industrial land  at

a  competitive price.  We can do so, because we have  reserved

enough   industrial  land  to  meet  the  needs  of  a   large

manufacturing sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must improve the quality and efficiency of

infrastructure  services  like utilities  and  port  services.

NEWater  is an economical, assured and high quality source  of

water  which  complements our other water  sources.   It  will

adequately  meet the needs of both industries and  households.

In   the   electricity  market,  competition  in  a   properly

structured  industry will ensure that electricity is  produced

and  supplied  as efficiently as possible.  Since  we  started

restructuring  the electricity industry in 1995,  productivity

per worker has increased by 60%, and tariffs have come down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In port services, PSA Corporation has cut tariffs and

given  $300 million worth of rebates to shippers, in order  to

provide  better  value  to  its customers.   To  meet  growing

competition, PSA must cut its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>



costs  and  be  as  lean as possible.   This  is  why  PSA  is

retrenching its staff and rationalising its operations.  These

steps  are  painful, but unavoidable if PSA  is  to  grow  its

market share, and remain the world's port of call.



<br><br><u>Entrepreneurship and Singapore Companies</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our third strategy is to encourage the spirit of

entrepreneurship among Singaporeans.  To thrive in a  volatile

and  unpredictable environment, and to ride on the  growth  of

emerging regional markets, Singaporeans must take risks, seize

opportunities  and  create new possibilities  for  themselves.

Every Singaporean must rely on his own wits and initiative, in

order  to respond quickly and supplely when conditions change.

It  is heartening that despite the slow economic growth, about

600 more new businesses were registered last year compared  to

the previous year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entrepreneurship is not just for the minority of

Singaporeans who take the plunge and start up new  businesses.

It  is a mindset that all of us should share.  It must pervade

all businesses, large and small, as well as the public sector.

In  Singapore, an entrepreneurial and innovative civil service

bureaucracy must not be a contradiction in terms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government policies will help to foster entrepreneurship.

Low  direct taxes will allow successful entrepreneurs to  keep

more  of  the  fruits  of their labour.  Improvements  to  the

education system will expose Singaporeans to business concepts

from  an  early  age.   The  public sector  will  continue  to

simplify   its  rules  and  procedures  and  cut   red   tape.

Ministries  and statutory boards will avoid crowding  out  the

private  sector  by spawning companies to do things  that  the

private sector can do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entrepreneurship requires talent. While we develop our

own  talent, we must also attract entrepreneurs from all  over

the  world to launch ventures and develop ideas here.   To  do

so, we must offer an environment in which good ideas stand the

best chance to be nurtured and take off.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Producing entrepreneurs will also depend on our social

values.  A society that prizes self-reliance is more likely to

produce  winners.  So is one in which winners are  celebrated,

while  the  unsuccessful are encouraged to  learn  from  their

mistakes and try again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must become such a society. Then we can produce a

constant  stream of dynamic start-up companies, some of  which

will  grow into major players.  Our established companies  can

also  develop  into internationally competitive  firms.   This

will enable us to continually renew our economy, staying ahead

of others through innovation and enterprise.



<br><br><u>Manufacturing and Services</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, we must promote manufacturing and services as

twin  engines of growth.  Manufacturing will remain a mainstay

of  our economy.  Our strong manufacturing base generates  80%

of  our exports, sustains many domestic support industries and

provides  good  jobs for Singaporeans.  We  must  continue  to

strengthen and upgrade this key economic sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other countries too are relying on manufacturing to spur

their economic development.  Competition is fierce, especially

from  emerging players like China.  They do not just  rely  on

their low costs.  They are also upgrading their technical know-how,  and moving into higher value-added activities.  We  have

no  choice but to upgrade our own manufacturing technology, or

else see our manufacturing sector hollowed out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strengthen the manufacturing sector, we must acquire

new  technologies and capabilities.  Research and  development

(R&D),  coupled  with  enhanced  protection  for  intellectual

property, are critical elements.  We must help Singaporeans to

continually improve their skills and acquire new ones in order

to push our manufacturing sector further up the value chain.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To diversify our economy, we must complement

manufacturing with a robust services sector.  Services already

make  up  about two-thirds of our GDP and overall  employment.

However  we  must promote our services sector  more  actively.

Exportable  services offer good growth potential, because  the

growing  middle  classes in China and India will  demand  many

services which we can provide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are already a key hub for seaport and airport

services,  logistics, trading, info-communications technology,

financial services and tourism.  We will continue to invest in

these   areas  and  use  our  strong  position  to  meet   the

competition from other countries.  At the same time,  we  will

grow  new  services industries like healthcare, education  and

the creative industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the services sector, the trend worldwide is to

outsource  semi-skilled  jobs  to  countries  with  cheap  and

abundant labour.  Many US multinationals have outsourced their

back-end call centre operations to the Philippines and  India,

lured  by  low  wages and an ample supply of English-speakers.

Part  of  the training for call operators is to watch American

TV  serials,  so that they can discuss the latest episodes  in

the  proper American accents, and make the callers think  they

are  talking  to  people in the US.  So  in  services,  as  in

manufacturing,  we  need to upgrade our  workers'  skills  for

higher-value jobs, and train enough workers in the skills that

these  new  services industries need.  Ultimately,  our  human

capital drives our competitiveness.



<br><br><u>Human Capital</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our fifth strategy is therefore to invest in our people.

This  is  a key prerequisite for the success of all our  other

strategies.  We must continue to develop our talent  to  their

maximum  potential.  Continuing education  and  training  will

help our workers update their skills and keep their jobs.  The

recent changes to our upper secondary education system and the

planned  expansion  of tertiary education  will  have  a  far-reaching impact on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>



abilities  and outlook of the next generation of Singaporeans.

The  new,  broader-based  educational system  complements  our

traditional focus on numeracy and technical knowledge  with  a

new   emphasis  on  independent  project  work  and   creative

thinking.   It  will  enable  Singaporeans  to  thrive  in   a

knowledge-driven economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the world, dynamic cities like New York, London

and  Shanghai are competing for global talent.  This is on top

of   the   considerable  talent  inflow  from  their  national

hinterlands.  Since Singapore lacks a domestic hinterland,  it

is  even  more vital for us to reinforce our own  talent  pool

with  global talent to sustain a sophisticated and  globalised

knowledge   economy.   Singapore  welcomes   anyone,   whether

entrepreneur, scientist, engineer, manager or artist, who  can

contribute to our growth and prosperity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also strengthen our links with the community of

overseas Singaporeans, numbering some 150,000-strong.  Many of

them have a deep sense of attachment to Singapore and want  to

offer their experience, expertise and network of contacts.  As

our   economy  globalises  further,  the  number  of  overseas

Singaporeans will grow.  Our international network  will  help

us  to  sense  what is happening in all the major cities,  and

equip Singaporeans with the exposure and flexible attitudes to

operate in a diverse world.



<br><br><b><i>Tackling Immediate Issues</i></b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the measures in this year's budget are directed

at these five strategies.  However, before I discuss them, let

me  address the ERC recommendations dealing with the immediate

economic situation.



<br><br><b><u>CPF Changes</u></b>



<br><br><i>CPF Restoration</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC recommended that the Government defer for two

years any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>



further  restoration of the current CPF contribution  rate  of

36%.   The rate would thereafter be restored progressively  to

the  full  40%,  although the pace and timing will  depend  on

prevailing  economic  conditions.  The ERC  also  proposed  to

proceed  with the other changes to the CPF scheme,  which  had

been linked to the full restoration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government accepts these recommendations. The

Singapore  economy has not yet fully recovered from  the  2001

recession.   Moreover,  the current slowdown  is  not  just  a

cyclical downturn, but a reflection of a fundamentally changed

environment.   Even  as we pursue longer  term  strategies  to

adapt  to  this  new  landscape, we must maintain  Singapore's

competitive position and make sure the recovery is  firmly  on

track.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deferring any further CPF restoration for two years will

ensure  that we do not increase the burden on employers before

the economy has fully recovered.  It will send a strong signal

to  investors that Singaporeans understand what is  at  stake,

and are determined to face up to the new challenges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Singaporeans have expressed concern that delaying

the  CPF restoration will hurt workers' savings.  But the more

urgent  priority  now is to help them keep their  jobs.   When

companies are assured that their business costs are not  going

up,  they are less likely to retrench workers or move  out  of

Singapore.   They may even be encouraged to hire more  workers

as soon as business picks up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we will proceed to phase in other

changes  to the CPF system that we had intended to do when  we

restored  the  CPF contribution rate.  These  are  changes  to

restructure and improve the CPF scheme, and we should begin to

implement them progressively, giving Singaporeans enough  time

to adjust.



<br><br><i>CPF Salary Ceilings</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we will phase in the reduction in the CPF salary

ceilings.  The ceiling



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>



is  currently $6,000 for private sector employees.  This  will

be lowered to $5,500 in January 2004, and further to $5,000 in

January 2005.  The civil service will also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>



rationalise the salary ceilings of the public sector to  match

that of the private sector, including the pensionable officers

who have lower CPF contribution rates.

<pre>

              Table 1:  Lower CPF Salary Ceilings



  CPF Salary Ceiling     Current      From        From

                                     1 Jan     1 Jan 2005

                                      2004

    Private Sector       $6,000      $5,500      $5,000

 Public Sector (Non-     $7,000      $6,000      $5,000

     Pensionable)

    Public Sector        $9,333      $8,000      $6,667

    (Pensionable)

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change will refocus the CPF scheme on the basic

needs  of  the  majority of the population,  rather  than  the

higher  income earners who are better able to plan and provide

for  their  future  financial  needs.   It  is  not,  however,

intended  as  a  wage  cut.   As recommended  by  the  ERC,  I

encourage  employers to pass on part of their cost savings  to

deserving  workers  through the variable component  of  wages,

such  as bonuses or other variable payments.  This will depend

on  the circumstances of each company and the contribution  of

each worker.



<br><br><i>Employee Contribution Rates for Older Workers</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we will phase in the lowering of the employee

contribution rate for older workers aged 50-55.  The  rate  is

currently 20%.  It will be lowered to 18% in January 2004, and

further  to  16% in January 2005.  These changes  will  enable

older  workers to take home more of their pay, and  will  help

them  when  their  companies phase out  seniority  based  wage

structures.

</pre>



<br><br><i>Contribution Rates for Special and Medisave Accounts</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we will phase in higher contributions to the

Special  and Medisave Accounts for all Singaporeans.  This  is

to  strengthen  savings  for old age  and  healthcare.   These

changes will be phased in gradually over three years, starting

from January 2004.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CPF members need not worry that these changes will leave

them  with  less  savings in their CPF  Ordinary  Accounts  to

service  their  mortgage payments.  We  are  implementing  the

changes  over several years, during which we expect  wages  to

increase.   In  addition, the Government will give  those  who

purchased  their properties before 1st January 2004  continued

access  to their Special Accounts to top up their CPF mortgage

payments,  to the extent that these payments are  affected  by

the changes.



<br><br><u>Business Costs</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC also recommended that we keep other components of

business  costs  as low as possible.  This the  Government  is

doing,  as I explained earlier. Besides wages, land, utilities

and   infrastructure  services  all  should  be  competitively

priced.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several concessions which were introduced as part of the

Off-Budget measures in 2001 were subsequently extended and are

still in effect.  They include the property tax rebate, rental

rebates, and the reduction of the diesel tax on taxis and  the

reduction  of  petrol excise duties.  These four measures  are

scheduled  to expire on 30th June 2003.  I have reviewed  them

and will extend or modify them as follows:



<br><br><i>Property Tax Rebate</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have decided to give a new property tax rebate for

commercial  and industrial properties for the  period  of  1st

July  to  31st December 2003.  The rebate will be $2,000  plus

15% of the balance property tax payable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rebate will cut costs for businesses, both large and

small,  who own their own premises.  It will give them greater

certainty amidst the current business



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>



environment.  The total property tax savings for the year will

be  $456 million, inclusive of the rebates given for the first

half of the year.



<br><br><i>Rental Rebates</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rebates on rental have been given to HDB's 18,000 tenants

and  lessees, JTC Corp's 7,000 tenants, and the Singapore Land

Authority's (SLA) commercial tenants.  Some 2,900 stallholders

in  ENV,  HDB and JTC hawker centres are also enjoying  rental

rebates.   As business conditions remain weak, the  Government

will extend the rebates by another six months, till the end of

2003.   These will lower business costs for tenants by another

$204  million,  on top of the $200 million of  rental  rebates

already given for the first six months of this year.



<br><br><i>Diesel Tax for Taxis</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diesel tax for taxis was reduced from $5,100 to

$4,700  in  the  2001 Off-Budget package.  I have  decided  to

extend  this reduction by another six months, till the end  of

2003.  This will cost the Government about $4 million.



<br><br><i>Excise Duties on Petrol</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, excise duties on petrol are levied either at

an  ad  valorem rate on final pump price before GST, or  at  a

prescribed floor rate, whichever is higher.  If petrol  prices

rise,  the  duties go up correspondingly.  This  adds  to  the

burden  on businesses and motorists.  To address this, I  have

decided  to impose excise duties on petrol at a specific  rate

instead,  so  that  the duties no longer  fluctuate  with  oil

prices.  This takes effect from today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new specific duty rates for various grades of petrol

will  be  set at the current floor rates of the petrol  excise

duties,  taking  into account the Off-Budget reductions  which

are  in  force,  so that there will be no increase  in  petrol

duties after 30th June 2003.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will cost the Government about $60 million annually.

Details of the changes are in Annex A (Cols. 117-118).

<br><br><u>Foreign Worker Policy</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC recommended that we keep our foreign worker

policies   flexible,  so  that  companies   can   employ   the

professionals   and  workers  they  need,   especially   those

companies which cannot find enough local workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our policy is to admit a controlled number of foreign

workers  and  this  will continue to be  a  major  competitive

advantage.    These   foreign  workers  help   to   keep   our

manufacturing  sector  viable  and  competitive,  notably   in

shipbuilding  and  ship repair.  They reduce overall  business

costs  and do jobs which Singaporeans are unwilling or  unable

to take up.  In a factory, without foreign workers manning the

third  shift,  there would be no jobs in the first  or  second

shifts  for  Singaporeans.  In services too,  foreign  workers

help  many  local  companies to stay in  business,  especially

SMEs, thereby creating more jobs for Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we need to strike an appropriate balance between

meeting industry's needs for affordable, skilled manpower  and

keeping  Singaporean workers from being displaced.   The  best

instrument  for controlling the number of foreign  workers  is

the  foreign  worker  levy.  This is a price  mechanism  which

leaves  maximum  flexibility for the market  to  allocate  the

foreign  workers  to  where  they are  most  needed  and  most

productive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, when our economy was hit by the Asian Crisis,

the  Government  sharply lowered the foreign  worker  levy  to

reduce business costs.   Since then the levy rates have stayed

at  the  same low level.  Last December, we extended the  levy

reduction until June 2003.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will extend the levy reduction for another

six months, until the end of 2003.  As foreign worker numbers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>



have  remained stable, there is no urgency to raise  the  levy

back  again.   The  only  exception is  the  levy  on  skilled

workers,  which is now just $30.  MOM will review the  skilled

worker levy this year to decide whether it is necessary to peg

it at a more realistic level next year.



<br><br><i>Help for Singaporeans</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the ERC recommended that the Government help

Singaporeans  to cope with the current economic  difficulties.

These   include   employment-oriented   measures,   such    as

encouraging  part-time  work,  augmenting  MOM's   job   bank,

improving job-matching efforts, and counselling and retraining

retrenched  workers.   They also include financial  assistance

for lower income households.  The Government agrees with these

proposals.



<br><br><i>Economic Restructuring Shares</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from helping Singaporeans find jobs, the Government

is  also providing them with substantial support by offsetting

the  GST  increase  through the Economic Restructuring  Shares

(ERS).  In FY 2002, the Government set aside



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>



$1.2  billion for the first tranche of ERS.  Most Singaporeans

would by now have received their basic allocation of ERS worth

$400.   To date, almost two-thirds of the ERS have been cashed

out.   Some  lower income Singaporeans in 1-  and  2-room  HDB

flats  and welfare homes failed to get their ERS because  they

did  not  top  up  their CPF accounts.   We  are  giving  them

additional   time   to   get  their   ERS.    The   grassroots

organisations  are  contacting them  individually,  to  extend

financial  assistance, if necessary.  Those who apply  by  the

deadline of 31st March will get their ERS on 1st May 2003.



<br><br><i>Utilities Save Scheme</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have decided to extend the Utilities Save scheme by one

year  to  help households, especially lower-income ones,  cope

with their utilities charges.  Households in 1- and 2-room HDB

flats  will  enjoy rebates for six months over  the  one  year

period from July 2003 to June 2004; those living in 3-room HDB

flats  will get four months; those living in 4-room HDB  flats

will get two months; and those living in 5-room HDB flats will

get  one month.  The rebate will be worth $35 per month.  This

will cost $71 million.

<br><br><i>Service & Conservancy Charges</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year I announced that the Government would be giving

rebates  for  two to five months of S&C charges  in  2003  for

Singaporeans  living  in  all 1-  to  5-room  HDB  flats.   In

addition,  the 1-room, 2-room and 3-room flats would  also  be

getting partial rebates on the remaining months



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>



of  the  year.   This was part of the package of  measures  to

offset  the  GST increase.  To help families in this  economic

climate, I have decided to enhance this by granting one  extra

month of rebate on S&C charges for all 1- to 5-room HDB flats.

<pre>

      Table 5:  Rebates for Service & Conservancy Charges



   HDB Flat Type     Original Number    Revised Number of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will increase the total number of months of S&C

charges waived to six months for 1-room flats, five months for

2-  and 3-room flats, four months for 4-room flats, and  three

months  for 5-room flats.  This extra month of rebate will  be

granted  in April, and will cost the Government an  extra  $31

million.

<br><br><b>Pulling Together</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures I have outlined will address the immediate

economic   difficulties  and  lay  the  foundation   for   the

strategies to restructure our economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, we expect the Singapore economy to grow

more  slowly, even after the present slowdown, because we  are

now  at a higher level of development, and external conditions

are  more  difficult.  We grew by an average of 7.3% per  year

over the last 15 years.  For the next phase, the ERC estimates

our  medium-term growth potential will be 3% to 5%, comprising

labour force growth of 1% to 2% and productivity growth of  2%

to 3%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growth of 3% to 5% is lower than what we have become used

to,  but  it  is  still  an ambitious target.   Few  developed

countries with per capita GDPs similar to ours have maintained

such  a high rate of growth.  However, the major global cities

in  those countries, such as London or New York, which draw on

wider  hinterlands, have been able to grow faster and  sustain

higher per capita incomes than their national averages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore too should be able to achieve 3% to 5% growth,

provided  we  too adopt the approach of these  global  cities.

This  is  why we must stay flexible, adapt quickly to changing

markets  and  technologies, continue to welcome global  talent

and keep on upgrading our capabilities.  Then



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>



we  can take advantage of the new opportunities, provide  good

jobs  for  our  people, and raise our income and  standard  of

living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not every Singaporean will find the going easy. The

powerful  forces of globalisation will widen our income  gaps.

A  small  number of citizens will need help to keep  up.   But

every  Singaporean  can benefit from our  country's  progress,

provided he puts in the effort and is willing to adapt himself

to the opportunities and jobs available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will concentrate its social safety nets on

the  minority  of Singaporeans who need them the  most.   This

will  ensure  that the help reaches the neediest  Singaporeans

without  undermining  our  work ethic  and  culture  of  self-reliance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the task of caring for less successful

Singaporeans   cannot  fall  entirely   on   the   Government.

Singaporeans have a responsibility to look after others  doing

less well than themselves.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>



The  generous  response of Singaporeans to charity  drives  is

thus both heart-warming and reassuring. Concern for our fellow

citizens and Government assistance will help keep our  society

cohesive as we navigate an uncertain world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No amount of aid to lower-income Singaporeans can

substitute  for  job-creation through strong economic  growth.

Despite the uncertain outlook, we are well placed to seize the

opportunities that only present themselves in uncertain times.

If  we  stay  the  course, when the storm  clouds  clear,  all

Singaporeans will share in the fruits of success.



<div align="center"><h4>PART II: THE FY 2003 BUDGET</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now turn to the Budget for the

Fiscal Year 2003.



<br><br><b><i>Revised FY 2002 Budget Estimates</i></b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me recap the FY 2002 Budget. I refer Members

to  the  first  column of the budget statistics table  on  the

</pre>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I presented the Budget last year, I estimated

operating  revenue at $29.2 billion and total  expenditure  at

$28.3  billion, leaving a modest surplus of $900  million.   I

also  estimated then that the surplus would turn into a  small

deficit  of  $190 million after accounting for the package  of

offsets, rebates and Economic Restructuring Shares.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the second column of the table shows, the revised

operating  revenue is almost the same as the budgeted  amount.

Tax revenues were lower because of the cut in corporate income

tax  to  22%  in YA 2003 and slower economic growth,  but  Net

Investment Income (NII) contribution was higher than expected.

The  revised  total  expenditure is about $1.0  billion  less.

Therefore,  in  addition to the $1.2 billion special  transfer

for  the  ERS,  I  have  decided to  make  additional  special

transfers to the Lifelong Learning Fund (LLF) and the  Medical

Endowment Fund (Medifund).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lifelong Learning Fund is an important part of our

continual education and training (CET) framework.  Established

three years ago, the Fund will be built up to a target size of

$5.0  billion  to  ensure a secure and  continuing  stream  of

income   to  support  lifelong  learning  in  Singapore.    As

highlighted  by the ERC, we spend less on CET at the  national

level  than on pre-employment, formal education and  training.

I  have  therefore decided to transfer $500 million  into  the

Lifelong  Learning Fund, to bring the Fund  to  $1.5  billion.

This  will generate $60 million of interest income a  year  to

fund skills upgrading and retraining programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Medifund has helped many needy Singaporeans to pay

for  their  medical bills during this economic  downturn.   To

enable  the Medifund to help more Singaporeans, I have decided

to  increase it to $900 million through a $100 million special

transfer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking the revised revenue, expenditure and special

transfers into consideration, an overall budget deficit of $90

million is now expected for FY 2002.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><b><i>Projected FY 2003 Fiscal Position</i></b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to the FY 2003 Budget, which is summarised

in the last column of the table.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operating revenue for FY 2003 is estimated at $29.6

billion.  This includes $3.0 billion in NII contribution,  and

is  $500  million  more  than the operating  revenue  for  the

previous  year.   Total  expenditure  is  budgeted  at   $30.0

billion,  comprising  $20.4 billion in operating  expenditure,

and  $9.6  billion  in development expenditure.   Taking  into

account the $600 million provision for ERS, the Government is,

therefore, projecting a deficit of $900 million, before taking

into account the fiscal changes in this Budget Speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government turned in a budget deficit in FY 2001, and

is likely to be in deficit again in FY 2002 and FY 2003.  This

will  be  the  third consecutive year that the  Government  is

running a budget deficit.  But this is the appropriate  fiscal

stance  to  adopt in an economic downturn.  During recessions,

revenues will fall, but expenditures need to be maintained  to

fund  essential projects and services, thereby resulting in  a

budget deficit.  This deficit serves as a stabiliser to  steer

the  economy towards the path of recovery.  The Government has

done this previously, although not in recent years.  After the

deep  recession  in  1985, we ran a  budget  deficit  for  two

consecutive years, in FY 1986 and FY 1987.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assure the House that this Government has not changed

its  longstanding  prudent fiscal  policy.   The  Ministry  of

Finance continues to plan for a modest budget surplus over the

business  cycle.  In difficult years, we can accept a deficit.

But  we intend to accumulate surpluses in good years, to cover

these deficits and build up the reserves for rainy days.  This

prudent and disciplined approach has kept the Singapore dollar

strong  and  inflation  low.  If we spend  beyond  our  means,

inflation  would  go  up, the value of  Singaporeans'  savings

would be eroded, especially our CPF savings, and confidence in

our currency and economy would fall.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we must recognise that it will be more difficult

to  balance  the budget in future, even after the economy  has

recovered.  Revenues will be less buoyant, as we lower  income

tax  rates further, and as our GDP grows less rapidly.  On the

other  hand, we will come under persistent pressure  to  spend

more,  especially  in healthcare and social services,  as  the

population ages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government expenditure has already gone up over the

years.   A decade ago, it was only 15% of GDP.  This year,  it

will be 19% of GDP.  This is still low compared to the 40%  or

50%  share  of  GDP  that  the Government  takes  up  in  most

developed  countries.  This is the result  of  our  deliberate

policy  to focus spending on critical areas that yield lasting

returns, but it also reflects our relatively young population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In healthcare, for example, our national expenditure

currently stands at 3.5% of GDP.  3.5% is much lower than  any

developed  country,  but this is not  solely  because  of  our

efficient   healthcare  system.   It  is  also   because   our

population  is much younger.  If our population had  the  same

age profile as, for example, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>



UK,  then  based on our present spending patterns  alone,  our

national  expenditure  on healthcare would  be  7.2%  of  GDP,

higher than the UK's figure of 6.8%.  Similarly, if we were to

match  the  age  profile of Japan, our healthcare  expenditure

would  be  close  to  Japan's  (6.6%  versus  7.4%).   As  our

population  is  ageing rapidly, we must  expect  our  national

health  expenditure, including Government's share,  to  go  up

too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higher Government spending will mean higher taxes. To

keep  taxes  as  low  as possible, we must  target  Government

social  spending  to  reach  those  who  need  it  most.   One

effective way to do so is through means-testing.  The Ministry

of  Health  (MOH)  already  uses means-testing  to  decide  on

subsidies  for  step-down healthcare.   As  revenue  pressures

intensify  in future, we will need to extend means-testing  to

other  medical  and social services.  This  will  ensure  that

truly needy Singaporeans receive adequate support, despite our

budget constraints.



<br><br><b><i>Expenditure Priorities</i></b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to the Government's expenditure

priorities.



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2003/20030228/20030228-HA-0760079.gif">TABLE 7:  SECTORAL SHARES OF FY 2003 BUDGET</a><br>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><u>Social</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will maintain the balance of expenditure

across  the  four  sectors:  Social,  Security,  Economic  and

Government Administration.  Nearly half of the Government's FY

2003  expenditure  will  be on social development.   MOH  will

spend $1.2 billion to subsidise Singaporeans' healthcare costs

through  13  public hospitals and healthcare institutions,  17

polyclinics and 64 voluntary welfare organisations.  MOH  will

also  spend $270 million on health research and promotion,  as

well  as  the  Interim  Disability  Assistance  Programme  and

Eldershield.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue to invest heavily to develop

Singapore's  human  capital  to  the  maximum.   Some  660,000

students  will  benefit from the $4.5 billion  that  MOE  will

spend on their education from primary school to university.



<br><br><u>Security</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will devote 36% of total expenditure to the Security

and  External Relations sector.  This will maintain and  raise

Singapore's  preparedness  to  handle  both  conventional  and

terrorist threats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must maintain and upgrade our conventional defences.

A strong SAF is the shield for our security and our deterrence

against potential external threats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Singaporeans must be vigilant against

the  threat of terrorism.  While we have broken up the  Jemaah

Islamiyah group in Singapore, the group is still active in the

region and key members remain at large.  The formation of  the

Immigration  and Checkpoints Authority (ICA),  in  April  this

year, will enhance security at our checkpoints.  The ICA  will

exploit cutting-edge technology such as gamma ray scanners and

biometric  identification tools to prevent undesirable  people

and  goods  from entering Singapore.  The Home Team will  also

enhance  its  ability to prevent and respond to accidents  and

incidents.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><u>Economic</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help Singapore develop new economic capabilities and

sharpen   our   competitive  edge,  MTI's   budget   will   be

significantly increased.  The Government will set  aside  $500

million  to  grow  Singapore companies and help  them  venture

abroad.   We  will invest $1.0 billion to strengthen  our  R&D

capabilities   and   $1.8   billion   to   enhance    industry

capabilities.   Another $1.2 billion will  be  spent  on  land

reclamation   and   upgrading  our  industrial   and   tourism

infrastructure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our first-class transport infrastructure is a key

competitive  advantage.   It  raises  the  efficiency  of  the

economy and enhances our quality of life.  MOT will spend $1.2

billion  to  expand  and improve our rail and  road  networks,

including  the  MRT  Circle Line and  the  Kallang/Paya  Lebar

Expressway.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue its strong support for re-training and upgrading workers' skills. In addition to the

$500  million top-up for the Lifelong Learning Fund in the  FY

2002  budget, this year I am setting aside another $37 million

to  enhance  MOM's  many  employment assistance  and  training

programmes.   This  will generate 20,000  additional  training

places under the Skills Redevelopment Programme and 7,500  job

placements  through the People for Jobs Traineeship Programme,

which  provides financial support to employers who hire  older

unemployed workers.



<br><br><u>Government</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our e-Government Action Plan for the public sector was

launched  three years ago.  Today, more than 90%  of  services

which  can  be  delivered electronically are  already  online,

making  Singapore  a  world leader in  e-Government.   To  the

public, this means faster and more convenient access, as  well

as  more  innovative and seamless public services.  From  next

month, the Government will be providing an online consultation

portal  on eCitizen to obtain public feedback on new policies.

This  will  include the consultation on the changes to  income

tax laws following from this Budget.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, not all Singaporeans are IT-literate. To help

those who do not have access to a computer or are not able  to

use  one, the Government has established eCitizen Help Centres

at  CDCs  and  CCs.  This is part of our plan to  ensure  that

everyone  may  enjoy  the  convenience  and  benefits  of   e-Government  and  e-services.  From March 2003,  eCitizen  Help

Centre  services  will also be available from  private  sector

outlets such as Fuji Film and NTUC Fairprice which sign up  to

offer the service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the cost of these improvements, the Government's

administrative  functions  will  only  consume  5%  of   total

expenditure.  As always, the bulk of Government resources goes

to  the  operational  ministries to deliver  services  to  the

public.  The Government sector will remain lean and efficient,

and will restructure itself if necessary to deliver value-for-money services.

<div align="center"><h4>PART III: STRATEGIES FOR GROWTH</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now set out

the  measures,  especially tax measures, that  the  Government

will  implement  in this budget to support the strategies  for

restructuring our economy.



<br><br><b><i>Competitiveness and Flexibility</i></b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enhance Singapore's economic competitiveness, the

Government   will   implement  the  ERC   recommendations   on

restructuring taxes, on exempting foreign income and  domestic

interest income



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>



from tax, as well as on portable medical benefits.



<br><br><u>Corporate and Personal Income Tax Rates</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I reduced our corporate and top personal tax

rates  from  24.5%  and  26%  respectively  to  22%.   In   my

assessment,  our present rate of 22% is still competitive  for

now.  Therefore, I will not be reducing corporate and personal

income  tax  rates further this year.  Nor,  given  the  tight

budget  position, will I be giving any rebates on these taxes.

However,  I  reaffirm  the  Government's  intention,  which  I

announced last year, to bring the tax rates down to 20% by  YA

2005.



<br><br><u>Foreign Income</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, the Government has received repeated

requests  to  exempt  from tax foreign  income  remitted  into

Singapore.   Until  now, we have resisted this  proposal.   We

already  have  a  comprehensive  network  of  double  taxation

agreements  and unilateral tax credits, under  which  we  give

credit  for taxes paid on foreign income.  We may also  exempt

taxes  on foreign income from specific overseas projects under

section  13(8)  of  the Income Tax Act.  In practice,  foreign

income  which  has been taxed elsewhere usually does  not  get

taxed  again  in Singapore.  At least that's the  Government's

view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were also concerned that this exemption would create a

loophole,   which  could  seriously  erode   our   tax   base.

Individuals  and companies could avoid tax on their  Singapore

income  by  round-tripping  and  transfer-pricing.   This   is

difficult to detect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the Government's view that this was not a

problem,  we  have  continued to  receive  feedback  from  the

business  community, and now from the ERC,  that  taxation  of

foreign   income  indeed  poses  difficulties  to   companies.

Companies  find the existing tax credit system more cumbersome

than  an  exemption system.  As more companies  globalise  and

earn  a larger share of their income from overseas operations,

this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>



will  be an increasing problem. Simplifying and improving  the

tax treatment of foreign income will make us a more attractive

business hub and boost our services exports.  Moreover,  other

countries, for example, Germany, the Netherlands and Malaysia,

have shifted from the tax credit system, to exempting specific

categories of foreign income from tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have therefore decided to exempt from tax all foreign

income  in the form of dividends, branch profits and  services

income from 1st June 2003 onwards.  This will mean that  about

90%  of  all remitted foreign income will be tax exempt.   The

exemption   will  be  available  to  all  taxpayers,   whether

individuals  or  companies, but it will apply only  to  income

earned from jurisdictions with headline tax rates of at  least

15%.  All other foreign income will continue to be subject  to

the existing tax credit system.  This will curb round-tripping

and  transfer-pricing  while keeping our  system  simple.   An

alternative would be to impose anti-avoidance rules, but  that

would  be  complex to administer and burdensome to businesses.

The IRAS will release more details by May 2003.



<br><br><u>Domestic Interest Income</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC also recommended that interest income sourced

domestically  be exempted from tax.  Our current  practice  of

taxing domestic source interest income encourages funds to  be

parked  offshore in interest-bearing deposits and instruments,

thereby   benefiting  the  financial  and  commercial  banking

sectors of other countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have therefore decided to exempt from tax interest paid

to individuals derived from standard domestic savings, current

and  fixed  deposits.  This change will help  retain  domestic

funds  in  Singapore,  and also attract back  funds  currently

placed offshore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exemption will be implemented in two phases.

Depositors  with  POSBank already enjoy tax exemption  on  the

interest from the first $100,000 of their deposits.   From  YA

2004, in addition to this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>



tax exemption on POSBank deposits, I will exempt interest from

amounts  exceeding the first $100,000 in each of the  standard

savings,  current  and fixed deposit accounts  of  individuals

from  the first dollar.  From YA 2006, the exemption  will  be

extended  to  the full amount of these deposits of individuals

from  the  first dollar.  This two step process  is  necessary

because  under  an  agreement between the Government  and  DBS

Bank, depositors with POSBank enjoy the exclusive right to tax

exemption  on  interest  from  the  first  $100,000  of  their

deposits until 31st December 2004.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This exemption will cost the Government $43 million per

year.  The IRAS will release more details by April 2003.



<br><br><u>Portable Medical Benefits</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As workers get older and change jobs more frequently, it

becomes  more  important  for them to  have  portable  medical

benefits.   This will provide them with medical  coverage  not

only  when they are in employment, but also when they  are  in

between  jobs.  Furthermore, if a worker develops a long  term

medical  condition, without portable medical benefits he  will

face difficulties finding another employer willing to take him

on and incur the expense of treating his medical condition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address this problem, the ERC recommended that the

Portable  Medical Benefits Scheme or the Transferable  Medical

Insurance Scheme be developed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Portable Medical Benefits Scheme will involve

additional  contributions  to  the  CPF  Medisave  account  by

employers.   To encourage employers and workers to  switch  to

the  new  scheme,  I have decided to raise the  tax  exemption

limit for additional Medisave contributions for private sector

employees from 1% of an employee's monthly salary at  present,

to a lump-sum of $1,500 per employee per year.  This will take

effect from YA 2004.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, medical benefits are tax deductible expenses

for employers, up to a limit of 2% of payroll.  From 1st April



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>



2004,  employers who implement either of the new schemes  will

continue  to  enjoy a 2% deduction limit.  However,  employers

who  do  not  implement these schemes will only be allowed  to

deduct 1% of their total payroll for medical expenses.



<br><br><b><i>Entrepreneurship and Singapore Companies</i></b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now take the House through what the Government

plans  to  do  in  response to the ERC's  call  to  facilitate

entrepreneurship in Singapore.



<br><br><u>Companies Act Amendments</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last October, the Government accepted all the

recommendations  of  the  Company Legislation  and  Regulatory

Framework  Committee  (CLRFC) which aim to  simplify  business

regulations, support entrepreneurship and lower  the  cost  of

raising capital in Singapore.  Let me highlight three  of  the

Committee's proposals.



<br><br><i>New Business Vehicles</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will introduce two new business vehicles

next year to give businesses more options in structuring their

business  activities.   The Limited  Partnership  and  Limited

Liability  Partnership structures will  be  available  to  all

businesses.  They offer limited liability to the partners,  as

well  as  the flexibility of being structured as partnerships.

Small  businesses  and  start-ups may  find  these  structures

useful for their business activities.



<br><br><i>Company Secretaries</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lower business costs for private companies, the

Government  will remove the statutory requirement for  private

companies   to   appoint  professionally   qualified   company

secretaries.  Although a private company must still appoint  a

company secretary to keep proper records, it is free to choose

between doing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>



so  internally and outsourcing the job to professional company

secretaries.



<br><br><i>Audited Accounts</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audited accounts will no longer be required for dormant

companies, and for exempt private companies with small  annual

turnovers.   This  will  reduce  compliance  costs  for  small

businesses,  leaving them to decide whether they need  audited

accounts.   The  annual turnover threshold for exempt  private

companies will initially be set at $2.5 million, and  will  be

raised  to $5 million after one year.  I have decided to  make

this  change in two steps after taking in feedback  from  both

companies and audit firms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislative changes to the Companies Act will be made

soon.



<br><br><u>Concession for Enterprise Development</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the expenses incurred by businesses before trade

revenue is earned may not be eligible for tax deduction.  With

effect from YA 2004, I have decided to regard the first day of

the accounting year in which a business earns its first dollar

of  trade  revenue as the point at which the  business  starts

trading.  Businesses will benefit from tax deductions for  all

revenue expenses incurred during that accounting year.   If  a

business  is  able  to prove that it has started  trading  and

incurred revenue expenses even earlier, it will be allowed  to

deduct these expenses as well.



<br><br><u>Revised Overseas Investment Incentive</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Overseas Investment Incentive allows an

approved  company to deduct losses arising from  the  sale  of

shares  or  liquidation  of  an approved  overseas  investment

against  its  statutory income.  To help our companies  expand

overseas, I have decided to revamp this incentive to allow  an

approved  company to defer its income taxes for two  years  if

its  approved  overseas  investment  incurs  operating  losses

during  the  first three years of the investment.   This  will

affect all new investments made from 1st January 2004.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The details of the tax changes to foster entrepreneurship

are in Annex D (Cols. 121-122).



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2003/20030228/20030228-HA-0760121.htm">ANNEX D - TAX MEASURES TO PROMOTE  ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SINGAPORE COMPANIES (Cols.  121-122)</a><br>



<br><br><u>Government Procedures and Rules</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC has underscored the importance of minimising

Government  rules  and  regulations  so  as  not   to   stifle

entrepreneurship.  The Government has set up several  channels

to streamline and review its procedures and rules to make them

more pro-business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pro-Enterprise Panel is a joint public- and private-sector committee which frequently solicits feedback on rules

and  regulations that can hinder entrepreneurs.   Out  of  500

suggestions  received from entrepreneurs  over  the  past  two

years,  50% have been implemented and regulations were  either

removed or relaxed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Rules Review Panel of five Permanent Secretaries is

currently  overseeing  an effort by all Ministries  to  review

their  rules by the end of FY 2004, and thereafter every  five

years.    One  outcome  is  that  one-third  of  all  required

statutory declarations have been removed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, 12 Government licences are due to be removed

in  FY 2003.  This includes a hatchery licence administered by

the  Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority.  Currently, Singapore

only  has  one hatchery and it is already issued with  a  Farm

Licence.   Hence,  it does not make sense for  the  agency  to

duplicate  its  regulatory efforts.  If Members  discover  any

other licences which seem redundant or meaningless, please let

me know about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for those licences which are still needed, and there

are  a few, putting them online allows us to reduce processing

time  and costs for entrepreneurs.  BizFile is a fully  online

system that cuts the time taken to incorporate a company  from

a   few  days  to  a  couple  of  hours.   By  July  2004,  an

entrepreneur  will  be  able  to  apply  for   many   of   the

registrations and licences required to start up a company



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>



through a single online form on the eCitizen portal.  From 1st

March 2003, a new Government-wide authentication system called

SingPass,  short for Singapore Personal Access, will  be  made

available  to  any individual who seeks to transact  with  the

Government online.



<br><br><u>Public Sector Market-Testing</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from streamlining its rules, the Government will

create  more  opportunities for businesses.   My  Ministry  is

introducing  market-testing for non-core  Government  services

this   year,  beginning  with  new  services.   Public  sector

agencies will be required to compare the cost of providing the

service  in-house against the price quoted by  private  sector

vendors.   If a private sector vendor can deliver the  service

more cost-effectively, it will be engaged to do so.



<br><br><u>Statutory Board Companies</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Government will progressively stop

providing  services  that  the  private  sector  can   supply.

Ministries  and  statutory boards will no longer  set  up  new

companies,  except  in strategic areas or  where  the  private

sector is not ready.  The Ministries have started a review  of

all their companies, to be completed by this fiscal year.   It

will   be  repeated  every  three  years  to  determine  which

companies should be retained, and which should be divested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have so far identified a few dozen companies, mostly

small, which are non-strategic and can be divested within  the

next  few  years.   Two larger examples are Ascendas  and  PSB

Corp.   Ascendas develops, markets and manages business  parks

in  Asia,  while  PSB  Corp's core  business  is  in  testing,

technology,  consultancy  and  training  services.   A  third,

smaller  example  is Hdbay, which provides interior  designing

services  and  develops  e-commerce  applications.   It   also

accredits and recommends renovation contractors to homeowners.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><u>Minister of State in Charge of Entrepreneurship</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strengthening the spirit of entrepreneurship is a long

term  effort,  involving  not just policy  changes,  but  also

changes in mindsets and culture.  The ERC recommended that the

Government designate a Minister or Minister of State  to  work

with  the  Entrepreneurship 21 Ministerial Committee,  and  be

responsible  for promoting and driving the diverse initiatives

to  develop  a more entrepreneurial Singapore.  The Government

agrees.   Mr  Raymond  Lim, Minister of State  for  Trade  and

Industry,    who    chaired    the    Entrepreneurship     and

Internationalisation  Sub-Committee  of  the  ERC,  will  take

charge    of    the   Government's   efforts   to   facilitate

entrepreneurship in Singapore.



<br><br><b><i>Manufacturing and Services</i></b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will introduce a range of new or enhanced

measures  to  sustain the competitiveness of our manufacturing

and services sectors.



<br><br><u>Intellectual Property</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On manufacturing, the ERC recommended that we move beyond

being  a  production base, to become an innovative creator  of

products  and  new businesses.  On services, the ERC  proposed

that we focus on exportable services, and develop new services

like  healthcare, education and creative industries, in  order

to  service  the  region.  These are all high value-added  and

knowledge-intensive activities.  Investors in these fields  do

not  look for the cheapest location, but for the country where

their  intellectual property (IP) enjoys the best  protection,

and where the environment is most conducive to the creation of

new  IP.   This  is  an  area where  we  enjoy  a  significant

advantage over our regional competitors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will build on this lead. We will continue to build up

and attract talents in R&D and in the creative fields.  The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>



Ministry  of Law is conducting a comprehensive review  of  our

current  IP  laws to support the growth of new industries,  to

take  into  account technological advances, and to  strengthen

further  IP  protection.  To make Singapore  a  key  node  for

developing,  managing  and commercialising  IP,  I  have  also

decided to introduce the following tax measures:



<br><br><i>Royalty Income</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage firms to hold their IP rights in Singapore,

I  have decided to extend the Unilateral Tax Credit Scheme  to

royalties  remitted from all non-treaty countries.  This  will

take effect from YA 2004.



<br><br><i>IP Acquisition</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies can currently apply to EDB or IDA for writing-down allowances over a five-year period for capital

expenditure  incurred in acquiring intellectual property  such

as   patents,   copyrights   and  trademarks.    To   increase

Singapore's  attractiveness  as an  international  IP  holding

location, I have decided that writing-down allowances will  be

granted automatically, subject to the condition that the legal

and  economic  ownership  of the IP lies  with  the  Singapore

entity.   This  will  apply to IP acquired  on  or  after  1st

November 2003.



<br><br><i>Patenting Costs</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage more companies to patent their inventions

and  make  Singapore an attractive base for IP  management,  I

have  decided to complement the Patent Application  Fund  Plus

grant scheme with tax deductions for the costs of patenting an

invention.  This will apply to patenting costs incurred on  or

after 1st June 2003.



<br><br><i>Foreign Income for R&D</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To increase the stockpile of funds for R&D activities

conducted  in Singapore or controlled from Singapore,  I  have

decided  to  introduce  a  new R&D incentive,  which  will  be

effective from 1st June 2003.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>



Companies  under this incentive will be granted tax  exemption

on foreign sourced royalties and interest income that are used

for R&D purposes.



<br><br><i>Provision of Information and Digitised Goods</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have decided to facilitate the flow of online

information  and  digitised goods  by  granting  exemption  on

withholding tax for payments made by end-users to non-resident

persons.  This will take effect immediately.



<br><br><u>Integrated Industrial Capital Allowance</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our manufacturing sector draws strength from its

international  linkages, for example with  Batam  and  Bintan.

Corporate  groups  increasingly split their activities  across

geographical boundaries.  Marketing or other high  value-added

activities  are concentrated in the main company,  with  other

activities distributed to its regional subsidiaries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To accommodate this business model, I have decided to

introduce   an   "Integrated  Industrial  Capital   Allowance"

incentive   from  1st  March  2003.   Under  this   incentive,

companies  will  be  allowed to claim  capital  allowances  on

equipment   that   is  used  by  their  subsidiaries   outside

Singapore.



<br><br><u>Upfront Land Premium for Leased Land</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have explained earlier the importance of competitively

priced    industrial   land   for   attracting   manufacturing

investments.   Currently, tax deductions are granted  for  the

upfront  land  premium  paid by  a  lessee  in  respect  of  a

designated lease for the construction or use of a building  on

JTC  or HDB industrial land, provided the lease tenure is  not

more  than 30 years.  This restriction was imposed at  a  time

when  it  was  unlikely  for lessees to have  upfront  premium

scheme terms exceeding 30 years for an industrial land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage companies to undertake investments in

Singapore over longer periods, I have decided to extend the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>



current  30-year lease tenure restriction to a  60-year  limit

with effect from YA 2004.



<br><br><u>Private Wealth Management</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we upgrade our manufacturing sector, we must also spur

our services sector to become our second engine of growth.  In

financial services, the development of world-class trustee and

custodian  services  in Singapore is integral  to  Singapore's

development as a wealth management centre.  To support this, I

have decided to introduce the following changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I have decided to extend income tax exemption to

foreign   trusts  administered  by  all  trust  companies   in

Singapore, and not just those administered by Approved Trustee

Companies (ATCs) from YA 2004.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, by 1st June 2003, the existing lists of

designated  investments and specified  income  under  the  ATC

scheme will be replaced with an exclusion list.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, to reduce compliance costs for trust companies

currently  having to comply with different sets of  conditions

for the purpose of income tax exemption for foreign trusts and

the  zero-rating  of  trustee  services  provided  to  foreign

trusts, I have decided to align the set of conditions for both

from 1st June 2003.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the current GST relief provision in respect of

trustee  services  will  be extended to  trust  administration

services  provided by a Singapore trust company to  a  foreign

trust of which it is not the trustee from 1st June 2003.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from improving the tax environment for trusts, the

Government  is  conducting  a  comprehensive  review  of   the

Singapore  Trustees Act.  We must bring our trust laws  up  to

date so that they are relevant to today's needs and supportive

of  financial sector activity.  This is critical in developing

the trust industry.  The revised legislation will be tabled in

FY 2003.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><u>Approved Marine Hull and Liability Insurer Scheme</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The services provided by our transport and logistics

industry  account for about 8% of GDP and establish  Singapore

as  a  leading  centre  for  global trade.  With  intensifying

competition  from  lower-cost regional  centres  and  changing

trade  patterns  towards  Northeast Asia,  we  must  transform

ourselves into a leading supply-chain management hub.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Approved Marine Hull and Liability Insurer Scheme

currently  provides  tax  exemption  for  income  derived   by

approved  marine  hull  and liability  insurers  from  writing

offshore  marine hull and liability insurance business  for  a

period  of 10 years.  To further encourage the development  of

marine  insurance expertise in Singapore, I  have  decided  to

extend  the Approved Marine Hull and Liability Insurer  Scheme

to  also cover income derived from writing onshore marine hull

and liability insurance business with effect from YA 2004.



<br><br><u>Approved Third Party Logistics Company Scheme</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third party logistics companies generally undertake

vendor-managed inventory operations where they import and hold

goods  belonging to foreign principals, and deliver the  goods

to  local  customers  only  upon instruction  by  the  foreign

principal.   In line with ERC recommendations, I have  decided

to  introduce a scheme whereby qualifying companies can import

goods  belonging  to  them  or to foreign  principals  without

payment  of  GST.  Under the new scheme, these  companies  can

also  move  goods to their customers who are under  the  Major

Exporter Scheme, and other qualifying companies under the same

scheme,  without charging GST.  This scheme will be  effective

from 1st January 2004.



<br><br><u>Improved Global Trader Programme</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International trading is a highly mobile and tax-sensitive industry. Although Singa-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>



pore  has  flourished as a regional trade hub, we are  neither

key producers nor consumers.  Instead we have leveraged on the

presence  of international trading companies to build  up  our

global  reach.   As  countries around  us  develop  their  own

infrastructure  and  networks,  Singapore  will  face  stiffer

competition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Global Trader Programme (GTP) now offers a 10%

concessionary tax rate on all qualifying trade income.  I have

decided  to enhance and expand the GTP with immediate  effect.

Under  the enhanced scheme, an approved global trading company

would  be  granted concessionary tax rates of 5%  and  10%  on

qualifying offshore trade incomes, depending on the  company's

turnover and business spending.  In addition, the GTP will  be

expanded   to   include   high-growth,  medium-sized   trading

companies.   This  will  give a further boost  to  Singapore's

status as an international trading centre.



<br><br><u>Tax Holiday for the Singapore Commodity Exchange</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Commodity Exchange (SICOM) has developed

into  a  global rubber futures trading centre.   In  order  to

compete  with  other emerging exchanges in the  region,  SICOM

must continue to improve on its facilities and strengthen  its

financial reserves.  I have therefore decided to grant another

five-year tax holiday to SICOM, with effect from YA 2004.



<br><br><u>Submarine Cable Capacity</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage telecommunications operators to provide

international  connectivity, I have  decided  to  exempt  from

withholding tax payments for the use of capacity on  submarine

cables   operated  by  non-resident  persons,  with  immediate

effect.  I have also decided that payments for the purchase of

Indefeasible Rights of Use on submarine cable system  will  be

granted  a  writing-down allowance over its useful  life  with

effect from YA 2004.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><u>Ministerial Committee on Services</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues involved in growing our services sector cut

across  various  Government  agencies.   Given  that   it   is

impractical  to  designate a single agency to resolve  diverse

economic and social objectives, the Government agrees with the

ERC  recommendation  to  set  up a  Ministerial  Committee  on

Services,  which I will chair, to coordinate policy  and  make

the necessary trade-offs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The details of the tax changes to promote manufacturing

and services can be found in Annex E (Cols. 123-132).



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2003/20030228/20030228-HA-0760123.htm">ANNEX E - TAX MEASURES TO HELP THE MANUFACTURING AND SERVICES SECTORS (Cols. 123-132)</a><br>



<br><br><b><i>Human Capital</i></b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the quality of our human capital underlies the

success  of  all  other restructuring efforts, the  Government

will  introduce  a  number of measures to  upgrade  our  human

capital.



<br><br><u>Continuing Education and Training</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In future, workers will to have to change jobs more

often,  and to upgrade their skills continuously to keep  pace

with  economic  restructuring.  To help them,  the  Government

will  put  in  place a comprehensive continuing education  and

training   (CET)   framework,   focused   on   enhancing   the

employability and competitiveness of our workforce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will establish a statutory board under the

Ministry  of Manpower to enhance the development and promotion

of   continuing  education  and  training  for  adults.    The

statutory  board will coordinate CET and employment assistance

efforts by working closely with various economic agencies,  as

well as the private and people sectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statutory board will build up professional

capabilities to strengthen the curriculum design and  delivery

of  adult education and training, and promote the upgrading of

all  segments of the workforce.  It will also drive  industry-focused



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>



workforce development programmes and oversee the training  and

placement  of  unemployed workers.  Its mission  is  to  bring

greater  coherence  and coordination to the  CET  effort,  and

ensure that our resources committed to workforce training  and

employment assistance are effectively spent.



<br><br><u>Course Fee Relief</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1986, resident taxpayers have been able to claim

tax relief for approved courses related to their employment or

courses    that    result   in   academic   or    professional

qualifications.   The ERC has recommended raising  the  course

fee  relief  from the current level of $2,500.  The Government

agrees   that  lifelong  learning  and  training  to  maintain

employability  is becoming more important in today's  volatile

and  uncertain economic environment.  I have therefore decided

to  increase the course fee relief to $3,500.  This will  cost

the Government an additional $6.4 million per year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Government has reviewed the

conditions  for  claiming  course fee  relief.   Seminars  and

conferences  are  becoming increasingly necessary  to  upgrade

oneself.  I have therefore decided to expand the scope of  the

relief to include seminars and conferences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, people may need to retrain not just for their

present jobs, but to prepare for possible career shifts.  I am

therefore  extending  the  relief  to  courses  that  are  not

directly related to one's current profession.  To qualify  for

the  relief,  the applicant has to establish that  the  course

resulted in a career switch to a relevant job within a  period

of two years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resident taxpayers who complete courses, seminars or

conferences  starting from 1st January  2003  will  enjoy  the

enhanced course fee relief.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><u>Overseas Talent Recruitment</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Double Tax Deduction (DTD) for Overseas Talent

Recruitment  Scheme  introduced in 1998  allows  employers  to

claim  a  further  tax deduction for approved  relocation  and

recruitment expenses incurred in the hiring of top talent from

abroad.  The scheme helps offset the extra cost that companies

bear to employ such persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision to relocate is often easier if the

individuals  are able to bring their families with  them.   To

encourage  employers  to  support  the  additional   cost   of

relocating top talent with their families, I will increase the

deduction  limit for the employer from $15,000 to $25,000  for

P1  employment pass holders, and from $5,000 to $15,000 for P2

employment pass holders.  I will also increase the cap for tax

deduction from $150,000 to $275,000 for employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes will take effect for expenses incurred from

today.   Further details can be found at Annex F  (Cols.  133-134).

<div align="center"><h4>PART IV: TAX AND FEE CHANGES</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these tax and policy changes are the

Government's response to the main recommendations of the  ERC.

The  report  contains other suggestions, which the  Ministries

will follow up expeditiously.  Some of the ERC's ideas require

more study.  The Government will examine these ideas carefully

to find the best ways to implement them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the ERC-related measures, I am making

several other tax and fee changes.



<br><br><b><i>Liquor Duties</i></b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To rationalise our liquor taxes, we will adjust selected

liquor  duty  rates.  Excise duties will be  raised  for  some

types of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>



liquors,  and reduced for other types in order to  rationalise

the  duties  and  bring  them in line with  our  international

obligations.   The  new rates are at Annex G (Cols.  135-136).

The  changes  will take effect today and result in  a  revenue

gain of about $9.4 million every year.

<br><br><b><i>Tobacco Duties</i></b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the proportion of smokers in Singapore dropped

from  18%  in  1992  to 14% in 2001, the percentage  of  young

female  smokers aged 18 to 24 increased from 2.8% to  8.2%  in

the  same  period.  To discourage smoking, and  especially  to

deter the young from picking up the habit, the Government will

take  every  opportunity to raise excise duties on  cigarettes

and other tobacco products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I raised the excise duty on cigarettes from

$180  per  kg  to  $210  per kg.  I have  decided  to  further

increase the excise duties on all tobacco products with effect

from  today.  Excise duty on cigarettes will go up  from  $210

per kg to $255 per kg.  The new excise duties on other tobacco

products are at Annex H (Cols. 137-140).



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2003/20030228/20030228-HA-0760137.htm">ANNEX H - CURRENT AND NEW EXCISE DUTIES FOR TOBACCO PRODUCTS (Cols. 137-140)</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also noticed the emergence of low-priced cigarettes with slightly lower tobacco content. The

low prices make such cigarettes more accessible to our youths.

I  have therefore decided to tax cigarettes by sticks, instead

of  by weight so that these cigarettes are subject to the same

duty  rates  as regular packs of cigarettes.  Under  this  new

system of taxation, the excise duty on each stick of cigarette

less  than  1g will be 25.5 cents, and each additional  1g  or

part  thereof will attract a duty of 25.5 cents.  So there  is

no  point having an extra long cigarette.  To give traders and

cigarette  companies time to adjust their  systems,  this  new

system of taxation will be implemented from 1st July 2003.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual revenue gain from these changes is about $194

million.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Travellers can currently bring in tobacco products not

exceeding 2 kg without a permit, by paying duty on them.  This

is  equivalent to 100 twenty-stick packs of cigarettes.   Some

people  have  found  that  paying duty  on  cigarettes  bought

overseas is still cheaper than buying cigarettes here.  I have

decided to lower the limit to 400g, which is equivalent to  20

packs  of  cigarettes.  This will take effect from  1st  April

2003.



<br><br><b><i>Motor Vehicle Taxes</i></b>



<br><br><u>Valuation Method</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will change the basis for valuing motor

vehicles.   We  will  change from the Brussels  Definition  of

Value (BDV) method to the Customs Valuation Code (CVC) method.

This  new  basis  will  exclude obligatory  expenses  such  as

advertising,  promotion, warranties, showroom and  warehousing

costs  from a vehicle's taxable value.  The effect will be  to

decrease the ARF and excise duty payable for most vehicles  by

3% to 5%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is consistent with our policy of gradually lowering

the costs of owning a car and raising usage costs, in order to

strike  a better balance, and enable more Singaporeans to  own

cars.  For a typical 1,500 cc car with an assessed open market

value or OMV of $15,000 under the existing valuation system, a

5% tax saving would amount to about $1,100.



This  change  will take effect from 1st April  2003.   Details

about the valuation method can be found in Annex I (Cols. 139-140).



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2003/20030228/20030228-HA-0760141.htm">ANNEX I - VALUATION OF  MOTOR VEHICLES (Cols. 141-142)</a><br>



<br><br><u>ARF and Excise Duty Rebates for Wheelchair Lifts</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help the elderly and disabled meet their transport

needs, I have decided to exclude the cost of wheelchair  lifts

and other costs associated with the installation of such lifts

from  the  OMV of a vehicle when computing the ARF and  excise

duty  payable.  This change will take effect immediately,  and

will complement other

efforts  by National Council of Social Services and  voluntary

welfare  organisations to provide transport services for  this

group of needy Singaporeans.



<br><br><b><i>Childcare Benefits</i></b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many parents find it difficult to juggle both work and

childcare,  and  one  parent may have to  stop  working  as  a

result.   Childcare  benefits defray the cost  of  alternative

care  arrangements  for their children and encourage  them  to

stay  in  the workforce.  I have therefore decided  to  exempt

from income tax employer-subsidised childcare benefits paid to

licensed childcare centres with effect from YA 2004.  This  is

in  line  with the Government's efforts to promote  pro-family

practices in the workplace.



<br><br><b><i>Stamp Duties</i></b>



<br><br><u>Stamp Duty on Leases</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, all property leases are levied with stamp

duty.   To reduce the tax burden on families living in  rental

flats,  and  the inconvenience to businesses and  the  general

public,  I have decided to exempt from stamp duty leases  with

annual  rents  that do not exceed $1,000.   This  change  will

benefit some 3,500 households that start a new lease or  renew

the  lease of a 1- and 2-room HDB rental flats each year.  The

exemption  will  also cover the fixed duty levied  on  99-year

leases  that some 32,000 households enter into each year  when

they  purchase flats from HDB.  About 30% of all  leases  will

now be exempted.  Households and businesses can expect to save

about $340,000 a year from 1st April 2003 onwards.



<br><br><u>Seller's Stamp Duty</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seller's stamp duty on the sale of residential

properties  within three years of purchase was  introduced  in

1996  to  curb  property  speculation  and  to  stabilise  the

property  market.  It was suspended indefinitely  in  November

1997 when the property market cooled down.  Since the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>



property  market  is stable, there is no longer  any  need  to

retain  the seller's stamp duty.  I have therefore decided  to

abolish this duty.



<br><br><b><i>Promoting Philanthropy</i></b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our tax system recognises taxpayers who support

charitable causes.



<br><br><u>Donation of Land and Buildings</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1st April 2003 onwards, I will be giving income tax

deductions for donations of buildings and parcels of land made

to  Institutions  of a Public Character (IPCs).   Donors  will

have the flexibility to decide if they would rather donate the

sales  proceeds  of the asset, or the asset  itself,  as  both

options  will  now  allow  them an equivalent  amount  of  tax

deduction.



<br><br><u>Stamp Duty on Donations</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, IPCs have to pay stamp duties when they

receive  donations  of immovable properties  and  shares.   To

lessen  the  burden on IPCs receiving such  donations  and  to

encourage bequests and donations from estates to IPCs, I  have

decided to exempt all donations to IPCs from stamp duty.  This

will take effect immediately.



<br><br><u>Donation of Public Sculptures</u>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we develop our economy, we should not neglect to

preserve  our  cultural  heritage.   I  am  introducing  three

enhancements  to  the Public Sculpture Donation  Scheme,  with

effect   from  1st  July  2003.   The  enhanced  scheme   will

incentivise  donors  to adopt existing sculptures,  commission

and  donate  sculptures  or publicly display  sculptures  from

their  private collections.  The National Heritage Board  will

be releasing the details of this scheme by 1st July 2003.



<br><br><b><i>Overall FY 2003 Fiscal Position</i></b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the tax changes in response to ERC

measures, taken together



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>



with the rebates and other tax and fee changes, will cost  the

Government  $324 million in FY 2003.  This will  increase  the

deficit  from the $900million projected in the FY 2003  Budget

to  $1.2  billion.   The Government is able  to  finance  this

deficit  from funds accumulated in its current term  and  will

not need to draw on past reserves.



<div align="center"><h4>PART V: NEW CHALLENGES, FRESH GOALS</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we cannot predict how the international

security  situation will evolve, nor do we know for sure  when

the  global and regional economy will regain its health.   But

we  can  and  will  use our resources and  strengths  to  give

ourselves   the   best  chances  to  succeed,   whatever   the

circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this spirit, the Government accepts the ERC

recommendations  to revitalise the economy  in  the  immediate

future  and  sustain growth over the longer term.   Vigorously

implemented,  over  a  decade  these  strategies   will   make

Singapore  a leading global city, a hub of talent,  enterprise

and innovation, and one of the best places in Asia to live and

work.   We  will  be  host to both global  MNCs  and  emerging

business networks linking up China, India and Southeast  Asia.

Our  broad  economic  base  will have  services  complementing

manufacturing   industries,  start-ups   operating   alongside

established  companies, and Singaporean companies  reinforcing

MNCs.   These diversified activities will provide a wide range

of  rewarding  jobs  for  Singaporeans,  either  as  knowledge

workers, skilled technicians, or semi-skilled workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change will not be effortless. There is no safe harbour

where  our  ship  can  shelter to rebuild  and  refit,  before

heading  out  to  sea.  In a rapidly unfolding situation,  all

work  must  be  done  onboard ship while we  are  sailing  and

battling the elements.  The Government will act to bring about

and facilitate these structural shifts, but success ultimately

depends on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>



resourcefulness and resilience of Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must shake free of our old mindsets, and adjust our

positions  to better face a changed world order out  of  which

new  opportunities will arise.  Some of us may not  find  this

easy  to  do.  But everyone who makes the effort will  find  a

place  in the new Singapore economy.  And all will get focused

assistance from the Government and support from employers  and

unions.   Through our joint efforts, our economy  will  bounce

back.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, the purpose of restructuring is

more  than  finding new growth sectors and creating new  jobs.

It  means forging a bond between all Singaporeans, in a spirit

of  joint  endeavour,  to secure our  common  future.   In  an

uncertain  and  volatile  world,  we  have  to  overcome   new

challenges and set fresh goals for ourselves.  We have to grow

as  a united people, to create a better tomorrow for ourselves

and  our  children, regardless of race, language or  religion.

And we must bring to this task tough minds and warm hearts.

<div align="center"><h4>NOT ANSWERED BY 2.00 PM</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>LICENSING FEES OF TAXIS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</b> asked the Minister for

Transport  if he will (a) explain the rationale and basis  for

charging the licensing fee of $25 per month per taxi  on  taxi

operators for monitoring the performance of taxis; (b) explain

how  the  quantum of $25  is arrived at; (c) ensure that  this

additional cost will not be passed to commuters; and (d) state

how   the  Land  Transport  Authority  plans  to  monitor  the

performance of taxis.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of the Taxi Operator Licence regime is to

improve  the  level of taxi service.  Under this regime,  taxi

operators  will  be made more accountable for the  quality  of

their  taxi  services, as they will need  to  meet  a  set  of

Quality of Service standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Taxi Operator Licence regime will require LTA, as the

regulator,  to  closely  monitor  the  performance   of   taxi

operators  and  their compliance with the Quality  of  Service

standards.   LTA  will  also investigate and  enforce  against

errant  taxi  drivers under the new Vocational Licence  Points

System.  As  these are new activities, additional  budget  and

manpower  resources will be required.  The  licence  fee  will

enable LTA to fund these activities relating to regulating and

improving the taxi industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA expects to analyse and audit fairly often the

performance records of the taxi companies for compliance  with

the Quality of Service standards in the initial 1-2 years.  It

has  estimated that it needs an annual budget of $5.3 million,

which  includes the salary cost for 28 staff.  The  main  cost

items are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To develop and operate a new centralised computer system

to administer the Taxi Operator Licence regime and the records

of some 85,000 taxi drivers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enforce the Quality of Service standards by analysing

the  radiophone  booking  systems of the  taxi  operators  and

commissioning  external  audits of the  operators'  radiophone

booking systems and their operations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conduct investigations and enforcement against errant

taxi drivers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To monitor taxi services by conducting taxi surveys and

auditing indicators submitted by the taxi operators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there are about 19,000 taxis in Singapore, this works

out  to a licence fee of $25 per taxi per month. This is  less

than  1%  of  the  gross turnover of the operators.  (This  is

minuscule and comparable to licence fees paid by operators  in

other  regulated industries, e.g. telecommunications  sector).

It  amounts  to  less than 3 cents per taxi trip,  against  an

average fare of around $7.  As you can see, the licence fee is

not excessive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As LTA will need to set up the audit and enforcement

framework, the work will be more intensive in the first couple

of  years.  As the $25 licence fee is based on the budget  for

this  more  intensive phase of the regulatory work,  LTA  will

review  the quantum of the licence fee after two years, taking

into account the actual costs incurred.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share Dr Amy Khor's concern that taxi companies should

not  pass  on this cost to commuters. We have liberalised  the

taxi   industry  to  allow  new  entrants  into  the   market.

Obviously, taxi companies will have to take into consideration

the  new  competitive landscape before considering passing  on

this cost through any rental adjustment or fare increase.

<div align="center"><b>PRESCHOOL GUIDELINES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. <b>Mr Gan Kim Yong</b> asked the Minister for Education how

many  of the preschools here have complied with the guidelines

announced recently by his Ministry and what measures are being

taken  to  monitor the progress of the preschools in complying

with these guidelines.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education has announced various

guidelines  and measures to improve the quality of  pre-school

education  in  Singapore. The first of these measures  concern

teacher training in the pre-school sector.  In December  2000,

MOE  announced  that  all  kindergarten  principals  would  be

required   to  obtain  the  Diploma  in  Pre-school  Education

(Leadership)  by 2006. In October 2001, MOE further  announced

that  one  in  four teachers will be required  to  obtain  the

Diploma  in  Pre-school Education (Teaching),  and  all  other

teachers to have Certificates in Pre-school Teaching by 2008.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been good progress made in the number of

teachers  going for training among all the major  kindergarten

providers. MOE has an open channel of communication  with  all

kindergarten providers and is keeping track of developments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second initiative undertaken by MOE to uplift the

quality of pre-school education has been the development of  a

framework  for  kindergarten curriculum, based  on  a  set  of

desired  outcomes  for  pre-school education.  The  curriculum

framework was launched in January this year.  The framework is

available to all kindergartens, which are encouraged to use it

as  a guide to design their own programmes that meet the needs

of children physically, emotionally, socially and cognitively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE does not intend to make the pre-school curriculum

framework a formal requirement for all kindergartens.  This is

consistent  with  the  Government's  approach  of  having  the

provision of pre-school education remain in the hands  of  the

private  and  community sectors. Such an  approach  encourages

innovation as each kindergarten operator strives to  meet  the

needs of its pupils.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, MOE is currently reviewing the legislation

necessary   for   regulation  of   pre-school   education.   A

Kindergarten  Education Bill will be introduced in  Parliament

within a few months.

<div align="center"><b>INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

how  many industrial accidents resulting in death and  serious

injuries  were  recorded in 2002 and  whether  there  was  any

improvement in the safety record compared with previous years.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were a total of 3,388 industrial accidents in 2002.

This is a reduction of about 11 % compared with 2001. However,

the  number  of fatal industrial accidents increased  from  52

cases  in 2001 to 64 cases in 2002, an increase of about  23%.

Out  of this increase of 12 fatal cases, 11 cases occurred  in

the   construction   industry.   The   number   of   permanent

disablement cases also increased from 83 to 93, an increase of

12% over the same period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when compared to accidents in 2000, the safety

performance in 2002 was still better.  Nevertheless, MOM  will

continue with its efforts to enforce safety regulations and to

remind all contractors and factory occupiers to pay particular

attention to safety at work.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently more than 140,000 foreign domestic

workers (FDWs) in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;214 FDWs filed claims with the Ministry last year. This

was  an  increase  compared to the  181  claims  in  2001  but

substantially lower than the peak of 406 in 1998. We were able

to resolve their disputes amicably with their employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, there were 19 substantiated cases of FDW abuse

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian passport contains 24 or 48 pages with

allowance for an additional 10 pages to be added on.   The  US

passport holds 24 pages with allowance for another 24 pages to

be added on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore passport contains 96 pages. This is more

than  the  number  of pages in the Canadian and  US  passports

(even  with  the  additional  pages  added)  as  well  as  the

passports  of many other countries. Our experience shows  that

only  approximately  10%  of the number  of  applications  for

passport renewal is due to the pages being used up before  the

passport's  10-year validity period expires.  Hence,  for  the

majority   of  Singaporeans,  the  96  pages  are  more   than

sufficient to meet their travel needs.

Singaporeans  who  have  a  CPF  balance  greater  than  their

property loan and vice versa.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of financial year 2002, the total CPF savings

kept  with  the CPF Board was $96.4 billion.  Of these,  $94.4

billion  (or 97.9%) were invested in Government Bonds  and  $2

billion (or 2.1%) in Advance Deposits*.



*  These are unaudited figures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The returns on the funds invested in Government Bonds and

Advance  Deposits are pegged to the same interest  rates  that

the Board pays its CPF members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interest rate that the CPF Board pays on balances in

the  Ordinary  Account (OA) is pegged to  the  12-month  fixed

deposit  rates (80% weightage) and the savings rates of  banks

(20%  weightage). The minimum guaranteed rate for OA  is  2.5%

per annum.  For balances in the Special and Medisave Accounts,

the  CPF  Board pays an interest rate that is 1.5%  above  the

prevailing  CPF  interest  rate,  i.e.  at  4.00%  per   annum

currently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Board does not receive any interest from the

Housing and Development Board (HDB), as the CPF Board does not

place any funds with the HDB.  As highlighted earlier, all CPF

savings  were  invested in only Government Bonds  and  Advance

Deposits. The Government, however, does provide the  HDB  with

mortgage financing loans at an interest rate that is pegged to

the  CPF  interest  rate  to enable the  HDB  to  finance  its

concessionary mortgage loans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Board does not track the proportion of

Singaporeans with CPF OA balances greater or lower than  their

property loans.  It is unclear why Mr Chia wants to compare  a

member's  CPF balance with his property loan.  If the  concern

is  that  the member has used too much CPF for housing,  there

are  checks against that, such as the withdrawal limit,  which

at  present is equal to 150% of the lower of the valuation  or

the  purchase  price  of the property and would  be  gradually

reduced  to  120% over the next 5 years.  If  the  concern  is

about  the  member's ability to finance his housing loan,  his

current  CPF  balance is a poor measure of  that,  because  he

could have withdrawn his CPF savings under other schemes, such

as  for  investment under the CPFIS.  Also, he could  use  his

monthly  OA  contributions to finance his loan;  that  is  not

reflected  in  his  current  CPF balance.  Hence,  it  is  not

meaningful to compare CPF balances with housing loans.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister for

Education if he will give a breakdown of the number of  bonded

and  bond-free scholarships, offered by the Government and its

related  organisations,  to  Singaporean  and  non-Singaporean

students.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government offers a wide range of scholarships

through   its   various   Ministries   and   agencies.   These

scholarships are devolved to and administered directly by  the

specific  Ministries and agencies. The Ministry  of  Education

does  not  have data on the scholarships given  out  by  other

ministries  and agencies.  In 2002, the Ministry of  Education

itself  offered 217 bonded scholarships and 26,274  non-bonded

scholarships  to Singaporeans. The Ministry also  offered  144

bonded  and  689  non-bonded scholarships to non-Singaporeans.

These  scholarships were of various types, covering  different

levels of education.
