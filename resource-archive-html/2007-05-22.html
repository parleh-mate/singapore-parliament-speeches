Through its arts and academic programme, the School aims to nurture not just the next generation of artists, but also creative professionals and leaders in all fields with a strong grounding in the arts.&nbsp; In its admission process, the School therefore adopts a holistic approach that takes into account students' artistic talent, creative potential and academic aptitude.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of these, the School's first criterion is artistic talent.&nbsp; This is demonstrated at the School's two-day Talent Academy where the students' artistic talent and potential will be assessed via individual auditions or portfolio presentations, group workshops and interviews by the School's faculty, and by reputable arts practitioners and specialist educators from Singapore and overseas.&nbsp; The School will make its offers to students based on their artistic talent and potential. Thereafter, students will need to qualify for the Express course based on their PSLE results before they are admitted to the School.

Once admitted, the School is committed to develop all the students' potential - artistic or academic - to the fullest. Students with exceptional artistic talent but lacking in academic achievements will receive additional coaching to help them&nbsp;bridge the gap.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen (Nominated Member):</B>&nbsp;Sir, I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister why there is a minimum PSLE qualification as a criterion for entering into the School in the first place and how a minimum PSLE qualification is in line with an arts education, and whether or not the Minister will consider lowering the overall PSLE aggregate score for the next intake of students.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lee Boon Yang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; Dr Lee Boon Yang</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said in my main answer, the School of the Arts is not just to train artists or arts professionals.&nbsp; It is to train young Singaporeans who are talented in the arts, and to give them the opportunity to&nbsp;develop both their artistic side and also their academic side.&nbsp; Having said that, we understand that there is interest among some students who may not have the academic ability&nbsp;but who have demonstrated that they have the artistic talent.&nbsp; As I have said earlier on, we would certainly consider this on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp; But I think we should not embark on&nbsp;a School of the Arts on the basis that it has no interest in fostering academic excellence - that anyone who has an<p align=left>Column: 875<p> artistic capability or interest will be welcomed, regardless of their academic achievement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should start a school on the basis that it has to meet&nbsp;expectations, and it has to serve a range of&nbsp; student population and their parents.&nbsp; Mind you, these are 13-year-old kids - these are not adults - coming to the School of the Arts.&nbsp; Their parents will also be very concerned if they send children to a school which has no emphasis on academic excellence.&nbsp; How many parents would be prepared to embark their children on a course of study at age 13, which will channel them narrowly in one single direction and have no option to do other things?&nbsp; I think we should give the parents this reassurance - that the School of the Arts is, in fact, a comprehensive school,&nbsp;a school that offers academic excellence and, at the same time, develops the artistics side of their children.&nbsp; In that way, we can ensure that the School will do well,&nbsp;that it will provide good service, and that it will bring up young generations of Singaporeans who are equally well-versed in academic subjects as well as in their artistic area.&nbsp; If we do not do that, I think we are headed in the wrong direction and we will not give the School the opportunity to develop fully.</p></div></span>		       		<!--TITLE_NAME:EN BLOC PROPERTY SALE COMMITTEES--><p align=left>Column: 875<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:EN BLOC PROPERTY SALE COMMITTEES:::878--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>EN BLOC PROPERTY SALE COMMITTEES</span></B></div><BR>		<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Measures to ensure transparency--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>(Measures to ensure transparency)</span></B></div><BR>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; <B>Mr Chiam See Tong</B> asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Law what measures will the Government take to ensure that en bloc property sale committees exercise transparency, act fairly and do not abuse its powers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Minister of State for Law (Assoc.

Advance notice of an<p align=left>Column: 876<p> application for en bloc sale must be sent to all owners. An owner who does not agree to the en bloc sale can file an objection with the Board. The Board takes all objections seriously and examines them very carefully.&nbsp; For example, if there is an objection on the method of distribution of the sale proceeds, it will look into how the method of distribution was determined. As another example, if an objection is raised on the sale being by private negotiation, the Board may look into the reasons why it was not done via a tender exercise.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, I would like to assure Mr Chiam that the Strata Titles Board is not a mere rubber stamp which approves an en bloc sale application just because the required 80% or 90% majority has agreed to the sale.&nbsp; Indeed, the Board will dismiss the application if it is satisfied that the transaction was not done in good faith and in an aboveboard manner. Thus, the Board had, on two occasions, dismissed the applications because the procedures set out in the legislation were not complied with.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are always reviewing the procedures to see how they can be improved. For example, in 2004, as a result of feedback received, we improved the process by requiring regular updates on the number of owners who had executed the Collective Sales Agreement to be put up in the development in the&nbsp;four languages and also requiring that the CSA be signed by the required majority within 12 months, so that all owners, whether or not they have signed the CSA, will not be kept in suspense for an indefinite period.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, MinLaw believes that there is room for some tightening of the en bloc sale procedures.&nbsp; This is why, during the recent Committee of Supply debate, the Minister for Law announced that a study team reviewing our en bloc sale legislation had made some important <p align=left>Column: 877<p>recommendations, for which MinLaw would put out a paper for public consultation.&nbsp; One of the proposed changes is that the setting up of an en bloc sale committee must be done at a general meeting convened by the management corporation.&nbsp; Not only will this make for better accountability, it will also serve as notice to all owners of a possible en bloc sale initiative being started.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public consultation closed recently on 12th May. We received quite a lot of feedback. We are now evaluating the feedback received.

All classes of liquor licence holders will be included in the scheme in December this year.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In recent years, TP has also adopted a targeted approach in its anti-drink drive education efforts. For example, TP has been working closely with the key stakeholders to drive home the anti-drink driving message. Some key initiatives include arranging with taxi operators to provide taxi services at various entertainment outlets, country clubs and restaurants, and appealing to hotels, discotheques, pubs, <I>karaoke</I> lounges, night clubs and other entertainment outlets to look after their drunk patrons by arranging for taxis or car jockeys to send their patrons home.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anti-drink&nbsp;driving messages have also been disseminated through various platforms, such as television commercials, radio broadcasts, newspapers, banners, posters and other forms of outdoor advertisements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me say&nbsp;that&nbsp;all of us can play a part to curb drink driving. &nbsp;For example, when friends visit a pub, they&nbsp;should designate someone amongst them to drive. Make this the "cool thing" to do.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 887<p> Family members can constantly remind their loved ones not to drive when they drink.&nbsp; Indeed, if anyone sees friends and loved ones who have drunk try to drive, they should stop them.&nbsp; As in the case of drugs, we must adopt a zero tolerance approach to drink driving.</p></div></span>		       		<!--TITLE_NAME:CONVENTION FOR THE ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN (CEDAW)--><p align=left>Column: 887<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:CONVENTION FOR THE ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN (CEDAW):::891--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>CONVENTION FOR THE ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN (CEDAW)</span></B></div><BR>							<!--MP_NAME:Prof. Thio Li-ann--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.&nbsp; <B>Prof. Thio Li-ann</B> asked the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (a) what steps have been taken to address the concerns expressed by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, which oversees the Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), in its 2001 Concluding Observations on Singapore's Initial and Second Periodic Report; (b) what has been done to promote CEDAW principles to the public and private sector and to disseminate the Committee's Observations to Singaporeans at large; (c) whether the Government will consider withdrawing any of its reservations to CEDAW; and (d) whether it has adopted the recommendation of the Committee to study reforms in relation to Muslim personal law in other countries with similar legal traditions and, if so, what are the findings of such study.<br></p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister of State for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon) (for the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports)</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is committed to the advancement and well-being of women.&nbsp; Following our presentation to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women in 2001, the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS), together with the Inter-Ministry Committee (IMC) on CEDAW, have been reviewing our policies, laws and services<p align=left>Column: 888<p> to meet the changing needs of society and our women.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These include:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp; &nbsp;Amending our nationality law so that a Singaporean woman can transfer nationality to her child when she marries a foreigner and the child is born overseas.&nbsp; A Constitution (Amendment) Bill was passed on 19th April 2004.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp; Removing the quota on the intake of female medical students in 2003 to give men and women equal opportunity to read medicine at the National University of Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii)&nbsp;Addressing gender wage differentials by issuing a Tripartite Declaration, by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), National Trade Unions Congress (NTUC)&nbsp;and Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF), on Equal Remuneration for Men and Women Performing Work of Equal Value in November 2002.&nbsp; We also ratified the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention 100 on Equal Remuneration to signify our commitment to equal pay for equal work.</p></div></span>		          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">        	      		<!--TITLE_NAME:--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B></span></B></div><BR>							<div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv)&nbsp; Encouraging equality in gender roles in the family through our parenthood programmes so that both men and women, fathers and mothers are able to harmonise work and family life.

But some Singaporeans who are poor and who are really in need of maids cannot qualify even for one maid.&nbsp; So maybe the Government would like to change the system where it is more equitable to give those who are really in need of the maids a chance to have a maid.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hawazi Daipi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Hawazi Daipi</B>:&nbsp; Sir, we should not look at employing a foreign domestic worker as an entitlement.&nbsp; If Mr Chiam's concern is that this&nbsp;household who cannot afford a foreign domestic worker because of the levy should be assisted, then I think we have to be very prudent in our approach.&nbsp; It would not be desirable for foreign domestic workers to be hired by low-level families who have problems making ends meet.&nbsp; We have to be careful in managing the number and, at the same time, the welfare of foreign domestic workers because, when they are here, we want them to be well taken care of and&nbsp;well protected, and they should not be exposed unduly to the possibility of not being paid by the low-income family.&nbsp; I think we have to be very prudent in our approach in employing foreign domestic workers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, hiring foreign domestic workers should not be the only solution for our households.&nbsp; There are already assistance schemes administered by the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports.&nbsp; There are schemes and programmes run by voluntary welfare organisations, in conjunction with the <p align=left>Column: 898<p>Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports, to help children and the elderly, or the households who need assistance and who may not be able to afford hiring a maid.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

They can afford it.&nbsp; While those who are really in need, I think they should be given a maid, especially the husband and wife&nbsp;who are earning a living and they have children at home,&nbsp;and also there are elderly people to be taken care of sometimes.&nbsp; So can the Government not think of a system which is equitable -&nbsp;take from the rich and give it to the poor?</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hawazi Daipi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I do not think it is an issue of being equitable.&nbsp; For the different households and some of whom may need extra assistance, they are&nbsp;already paying concessionary levy and, as I have mentioned earlier, the amount of concessionary levy has been reduced over the years.&nbsp; This should be able to help those who may need some extra assistance from the Ministry of Manpower.&nbsp;</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

And we have to have a levy system to ensure that only those who can afford it would be able to employ a foreign domestic worker.&nbsp; For those who may need some assistance but cannot afford to pay the salary of the foreign domestic worker and/or the levy, then they should find other assistance schemes which are already made available by our Government agencies.&nbsp;

Our schemes are therefore designed to encourage and support work.&nbsp; Examples of such schemes are the<p align=left>Column: 900<p> Centre-Based Financial Assistance Scheme for Childcare (CFAC), and the Student Care Fee Assistance (SCFA) Scheme that enable parents to work while their children are cared for. The Kindergarten Financial Assistance Scheme (KiFAS) helps the low-income and needy to offset the cost of sending their children to kindergarten. The Baby Bonus can also be used to help defray the educational and medical costs of their children.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who are able to work, but need help to find employment, will be assisted under the ComCare Fund's Work Support Programme. They will receive employment assistance and financial assistance in addition to help with childcare and student care arrangements.&nbsp; Case management and employment-related training is also available.&nbsp; As at December 2006, 273 widows were on Work Support, the majority of whom&nbsp;have children.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also remember that the extended family has an obligation to support relatives who are less well off. This has been a key survival instinct for Asian societies, and we must maintain this noble tradition.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In extremis, those who are unable to work, and have no family support may be placed on the Public Assistance Scheme. As at December 2006,&nbsp;seven widows with young children were on the Public Assistance Scheme.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of our 'Many Helping Hands' approach, my Ministry works very closely with voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs).</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Family Service Centres (FSCs) and many VWOs provide many social services to vulnerable families, including specialised services, such as casework, counselling and support groups, to single parents, including widows, and their children.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 901<p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CDCs also actively work with VWOs and grassroots organisations to provide help to the needy. For example, the North West CDC has established a referral system with Wicare, to refer needy widows to Wicare to participate in Wicare programmes, while Wicare would refer needy widows to the CDC for financial assistance. In January 2007, for example, WiCare referred&nbsp;seven needy children to North West CDC, so that they could benefit from North West CDC's distribution of stationery and gift vouchers to needy students.&nbsp; The other CDCs also have similar referral systems with various VWOs and community groups within their districts.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More is being done to strengthen the cooperation between the CDCs and voluntary welfare organisations through the Comcare Local Networks platform. This platform will enable us to identify any gaps, and share ideas on how to more effectively reach out to the needy amongst us.

The first type gives flexibility to companies to provide for working hours that differ from what is specified in the Act.&nbsp; In 2005 and 2006, a total of 280 employers were granted such exemptions, for a maximum period of two years.&nbsp; They include security guard agencies,&nbsp;manufacturing, logistics and printing companies.&nbsp; To safeguard the well-being of workers, MOM will only approve such exemptions if the employer has obtained the consent of the employees to extend their overtime hours, demonstrated<p align=left>Column: 905<p> compliance with other Employment Act provisions, shown a good track record in maintaining safety, health and employment standards, and secured the agreement of the unions in the company, if any.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second type of exemption applies to a smaller number of employers who experience high volatility in the volume of work.&nbsp; For them, the requirements of the Employment Act, which assume a standard number of hours to be worked on a daily basis, would not be practical.&nbsp; For the workers, it is also not in their interest to earn a very low basic salary, but have a very high component in overtime pay, as their monthly income becomes highly unpredictable.&nbsp; The exemptions granted under section 41A enable these employers to pay the workers even when they are not needed to work, and to offset such payments against any overtime pay that may arise when the volume of work is high.&nbsp; In 2005 and 2006, 10 employers were granted such exemptions, also for a maximum period of two years.&nbsp; They were involved in activities, such as aerospace, the performing arts, manufacturing and logistics.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

MICA is committed to developing Singapore into a more vibrant and exciting global arts city.&nbsp; We will exercise flexibility in considering requests for later cut-off times for outdoor performances, especially if they are held in non-residential areas.&nbsp; This will need to be done on a case-by-case basis.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen</B>:&nbsp; Sir, I have a feedback.&nbsp; For one of the events in March which was held on top of the Market Street Carpark on a Saturday night, I was only given up to like 10.30 pm.&nbsp; What are the main considerations and would the Ministry&nbsp;actually consider extending this cut-off time for all events in non-residential areas or outdoor performances to at least, say, 2.00 am?</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lee Boon Yang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lee Boon Yang</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said, if a performance is held in an area where there are no&nbsp;residential premises nearby and there are unlikely to be any disturbances caused to other neighbouring areas, then we could consider appeals for extension.&nbsp; In fact, MDA had in the past received such appeals and they have, in some cases, where the condition warrants it, granted extension.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give you the example of the case of&nbsp;World of Music and Dance (WOMAD).&nbsp; It was held at Fort Canning.&nbsp; The cut-off time for this particular event was extended to 4.30 am because, in the case of Fort Canning, there was&nbsp;nobody nearby who would be likely to complain about noise nuisance.&nbsp; So although the normal cut-off time is 2.00 am, on special appeal and because of the special occasion, MDA was able to consider granting the organisers' request to have it extended to 4.30 am.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also other events where we have considered extending the cut-off time.&nbsp; Another example that I can cite<p align=left>Column: 910<p> would be a pop rock concert called Good Vibrations.&nbsp; Originally, the organiser wanted to hold it at&nbsp;an open vacant lot at Ophir Road.&nbsp; Of course, there were residential areas nearby.&nbsp; So the recommendation was to have it ended at 10.30 pm, so that&nbsp;it would not cause any disturbance to the residents and,&nbsp;in fact, there was also&nbsp;a hospital nearby.&nbsp; But when they appealed for extension of time, MDA was able to work with the organiser and say, "Look, if you move away from this location and go somewhere else, we will certainly consider a longer performance period and extend the cut-off time."&nbsp; Eventually, they were persuaded and they went to Fort Canning and were able to have the event continued until 1.00 am.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we will consider every such appeal on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp; We will study the nature and location&nbsp;of the event and also the past record, how they had performed, and whether the late night or early morning events held at such places had given rise to any&nbsp;noise complaints.&nbsp; If there are no such concerns, we are quite happy to accommodate and to work with the organisers so that their proposals can be accommodated.</p></div></span>		       		<!--TITLE_NAME:INVASIVE PNEUMOCOCCAL DISEASE IN CHILDREN--><p align=left>Column: 910<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:INVASIVE PNEUMOCOCCAL DISEASE IN CHILDREN:::912--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

and (b) what factors will bring about the introduction of pneumococcal vaccination in the National Childhood Immunisation Programme.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Health (Mr Heng Chee How)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister of State for Health (Mr Heng Chee How) (for the Minister for Health)</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, as invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is not a notifiable disease, we do not have the information on its incidence rate in<p align=left>Column: 911<p> Singapore.&nbsp; But we do have the hospitalisation data, and that&nbsp;has been on a downward trend.&nbsp; Between 2004 and 2006, the hospitalisation rate for IPD has declined by almost a third.&nbsp; Last year, there were 55 cases of hospitalisation of children aged five years and below due to IPD.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;IPD is not a major cause of morbidity in Singapore.&nbsp; As a comparison, there were some 20,000 cases of hospitalisation of children below the age of five each year.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of mortality, there were three deaths from IPD in the&nbsp;past five years.&nbsp; That translates to a mortality rate of less than one per 100,000.&nbsp; Over the same period, there were about 700 deaths among children in this age-group.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our IPD hospitalisation rate of 26 per 100,000 for children under five years of age recorded in 2006 is significantly lower than the US' rate of 97 per 100,000 which was recorded in 1998/1999, before the US included pneumococcal vaccination into its childhood immunisation programme.&nbsp; The US has since brought down its rate to 24 per 100,000 in 2003, which is comparable to our rate.&nbsp; So they are 24 per 100,000 and we are 26 per 100,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;The US experience shows that universal pneumococcal vaccination does not eradicate IPD.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonetheless, as the vaccine is safe and effective, vaccination is a viable option.&nbsp; However, for mass vaccination, its high cost is a major constraint.&nbsp; Currently, there is&nbsp;one manufacturer, and it costs up to $480 to vaccinate one child.&nbsp; Compare this to the existing childhood vaccination programme where the most expensive vaccination, ie, for diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough, which are the&nbsp;major causes of childhood morbidity and mortality in the past, together cost&nbsp;$40 per child.&nbsp;</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 912<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we will continue to monitor the cost-effectiveness and, if and when&nbsp;more competitively priced vaccines become available and significantly alter the cost-benefit ratio of pneumococcal vaccination, we will consider its inclusion in the childhood immunisation programme.</p></div></span>		          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

So it is an option that parents who want to&nbsp; immunise their child can do so.&nbsp; But when you talk about mass immunisation, that is, without exception, every child that is born here, then we would have got to look at the cost-effectiveness of things and weigh it against how many people are likely to contract such a disease, and looking at the hospitalisation data&nbsp;to see whether or not that is the best course of trying to prevent some of the complications that Dr Lam mentioned.&nbsp; Certainly, in terms of the treatment of the cases that have surfaced, there would be every attention paid to it. We will continue to monitor the cost-effectiveness of it. We do not exclude this as a possibility but it is to look for a time where if the cost comes down to a level that can justify its inclusion, then we can consider it.</p></div></span>		       		<!--TITLE_NAME:OUTDOOR REFRESHMENT AREAS AT HDB ESTATES--><p align=left>Column: 912<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:OUTDOOR REFRESHMENT AREAS AT HDB ESTATES:::914--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>OUTDOOR REFRESHMENT AREAS AT HDB ESTATES</span></B></div><BR>		<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Extension of operating hours--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>(Extension of operating hours)</span></B></div><BR>					<!--MP_NAME:Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18.&nbsp; <B>Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim</B> asked the Minister for National Development if the Ministry will consider <p align=left>Column: 913<p>extending the operating hours of Outdoor Refreshment Areas at HDB premises in suburban HDB estates that were originally designed as eating houses to further enhance the vibrancy of these locations.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (for the Minister for National Development)</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, currently, operators of HDB eating houses are allowed to operate Outdoor Refreshment Areas (ORAs) at their shopfronts from 6.00 am to 11.00 pm daily.&nbsp; The restriction in the operating hours of the ORA is necessary to prevent disamenities to residents, as the majority of these eating houses are located below HDB flats.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB has sought to meet the needs of both eating house operators as well as the residents by allowing the operation of ORA, but with appropriate conditions, such as restriction on operating hours.&nbsp; At a recent consultation session conducted by HDB to review and streamline ORA guidelines, the participants, comprising eating house operators and residents, had also proposed to retain it, so as not to cause disamenities to the neighbourhood and to maintain its residential character.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, there is no restriction on the operating hours within the eating house premises.&nbsp; They can continue to operate beyond 11.00 pm.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim (Marine Parade)</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he can consider extending&nbsp;the operating hours of these ORAs in certain parts of the suburban estates just to add some vibrancy and perhaps use some discretionary exercise in allowing some of the ORAs to be extended, say, by one hour during weekends, especially when many residents watch football matches at the coffeeshops.</p></div></span>				<p align=left>Column: 914<p>	<!--MP_NAME:Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman</B>:&nbsp; Sir, I think the current operating hours for ORAs&nbsp;are generous enough, up to 11.00 pm.

The Minister for Finance, instead of the President, would determine or authorise the type of securities or other instruments in which public moneys may be invested. This amendment covers Government's investments managed by GIC.&nbsp; MAS has made similar amendments to the MAS and Currency Acts, which were passed in Parliament on 12th February this year, such that the MAS Board, instead of the President, would now approve investments in new securities and instruments for MAS' investments.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rationale for this amendment is that the responsibility for approving<p align=left>Column: 915<p> categories of investments is an executive function that&nbsp;appropriately resides with the Government, instead of with the President.&nbsp; Investment risks are better assessed and managed by Government and its investment agencies, since risk management is part and parcel of regular investment decisions and operations.<br></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As such, the proposed amendment recognises that the role of the President is in the overall safeguarding and protection of past reserves rather than in approving specific categories of investments and assessing the risks involved in each category or each type of security.&nbsp; The President also approves the Board and CEO appointments of our key investment agencies, which include GIC Pte Ltd.&nbsp; The Government will also continue to report investment performance on past reserves regularly to the President.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The President has been consulted and agrees with the above amendments.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam].</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.</p></P></span></div>													<!--TITLE_NAME:GOODS AND SERVICES TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL--><p align=left>Column: 915<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:GOODS AND SERVICES TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL:::928--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>GOODS AND SERVICES TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL<BR></B></span><div><BR>											 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Order for Second Reading read.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.54 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now&nbsp; read a Second time."<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 916<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Goods and Services Tax (Amendment) Bill 2007 comprises two groups of changes.&nbsp; The first group related to changes announced in Budget Statements 2006 and 2007.&nbsp; The second group covers other amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act arising from regular reviews to improve our GST system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A public consultation on the Goods and Services Tax (Amendment) Bill that was drafted for the 2006 changes was conducted from 8th September to 6th October 2006. The draft Bill has been revised to incorporate the suggestions made by businesses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>GST budget changes</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me first highlight the amendments related to the budget changes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(a) GST rate increase</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To broaden our tax base, and to enable the Government to grow our economy and implement Workfare and other initiatives to strengthen social cohesion, the GST rate will be increased from 5% to 7% with effect from 1st July 2007. &nbsp;This change, which was actively discussed in this House during the recent Budget Statement debate, is reflected in clause 2 of the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(b) Zero-rating treatment for prescribed tools used in the manufacture of goods for export</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presently, the supplies of tools made to overseas clients but used in Singapore for the manufacturing process attract GST.&nbsp; To enhance the cost-competitiveness of local manufacturers and to recognise that such tools are business inputs and do not constitute private consumption per se, the supply of prescribed tools made to overseas clients will be zero-rated, if the tool is used in Singapore exclusively for the manufacture of goods for export. Clause 5 of the Bill reflects this change.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 917<p><p>(c) GST exemption for prescribed <I>Shariah</I>-compliant financing arrangements</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To promote <I>Shariah</I>-compliant financial activities in Singapore, the effective return arising from the provision of prescribed <I>Shariah</I> -compliant financing arrangements, in relation to the purchase of non-residential property, will be exempted from GST.&nbsp; The change will harmonise the GST treatment of prescribed <I>Shariah</I> -compliant financing arrangements with their conventional loan product counterparts to ensure a level playing field.&nbsp; This change is provided in clause 11 of the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(d) Deemed input tax credits for insurers<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presently, there are no input tax credits for insurers on cash payments made upon the occurrence of an insured event even&nbsp;under an insurance contract.&nbsp; As a result, GST is collected on gross premiums which are not reflective of the true value-add of insurance services.&nbsp; To capture the true value-add and to reduce the business costs of insurers, insurers will be allowed to claim deemed input tax credits on cash payments made under certain insurance contracts that are subject to GST. Clause 6 of the Bill reflects this change.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(e) Reduction of record-keeping period from&nbsp;seven years to&nbsp;five years<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presently, GST-registered businesses are required to keep GST records for&nbsp;seven years. To reduce business compliance costs and to support enterprise and entrepreneurship, clause 8 of the Bill amends the GST Act to reduce the record-keeping period from&nbsp;seven years to&nbsp;five years. This change is in line with the general move to reduce the record-keeping requirement for businesses down to&nbsp;five years to provide consistency for businesses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 918<p><p><I>Other tax changes</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now move on to the second group of tax changes covered by this Bill. These amendments arose from our regular reviews to improve the GST system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(a) Advance Rulings System</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, the advance rulings system.&nbsp; To provide greater clarity and certainty to taxpayers, an advance rulings system for GST will be formalised and enshrined in law with effect from 1st July 2007. Any ruling issued under the advance rulings system will bind the Comptroller of Goods and Services Tax to apply the statutory provisions in the manner as set out in the ruling. Clauses 10 and 12 of the Bill provide for binding advance rulings, the circumstances under which the Comptroller shall, may or may not provide the rulings, and their fee structure. This is similar to the advance rulings system for income tax, which was introduced last year. Under the advance rulings system for Income Tax, a non-refundable application fee of $525 is payable on the application for rulings. A further fee of $131.25 per hour is payable for any time beyond the first&nbsp;four hours, spent in considering the ruling by IRAS. More information on the fees for Income Tax rulings is available on IRAS' website.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(b) Revise GST rules for zero-rating of advertising services<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, to revise the GST rules for zero-rating of advertising services. Sir, to simplify GST rules, the zero-rating treatment for advertising services will be revised from one that is tied to the advertising subject, to one that is tied to the nature of advertising services.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the nature of advertising services relates to concept development, artworks and media planning, the supply will be zero-rated when it is made contractually to and for the benefit of an overseas person.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 919<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the nature of advertising relates to the sale of media space or airtime, the supply will be zero-rated when the advertisement is circulated outside or substantially outside Singapore. &nbsp;This change is reflected in clause 4 of the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(c) Time limit for claims relating to over-declaration of output tax in repayment returns</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, the time limit for claims.&nbsp; Presently, there is no time limit provided in law for claims relating to over-declaration of output tax in repayment returns. To provide clarity to taxpayers and to align with the reduced record-keeping period, the GST Act is amended to provide for a time limit of&nbsp;five years for claims of refunds relating to over-declaration of output tax in repayment returns.&nbsp; The amendments are provided in clauses 7(b) and 9 of the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(d) Consequential amendments arising from the reduction of GST record-keeping period</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, consequential amendments.&nbsp; Pursuant to the reduced GST record-keeping period, the time limits for GST-registered businesses to reclaim input tax that is paid late to suppliers and for the Comptroller to raise additional assessments will be revised to&nbsp;five years.&nbsp; Clauses 3 and 7(a) of the Bill reflect these changes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gautam Banerjee (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.05 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Gautam Banerjee (Nominated Member):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in the debate on the Goods and Services Tax (Amendment) Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the outset, let me declare my interest.&nbsp;My firm PricewaterhouseCoopers provides GST consulting services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 920<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I speak in support of this Bill, which seeks to improve, among other things, the efficiency of administering and collecting GST.&nbsp; I also commend the Ministry of Finance and the Inland Revenue Authority for the public consultation process which took place before the Bill was presented in Parliament.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, there are two points&nbsp;I would like to raise.&nbsp; The first point is on the public consultation process itself, and the second point relates to the proposed implementation of an advanced rulings system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me start with the public consultation process.&nbsp; In seeking public comments, the Ministry stipulated that the scope of the public consultation was to obtain feedback on areas of the draft legislation that needed greater clarity.&nbsp; However, many were disappointed that the consultation exercise was not intended to be a consultation on the policies, judging from the following statement in the Ministry of Finance's website at the time, and I quote,&nbsp;"The policies have already been decided through the due process."&nbsp; We were left guessing as to what constituted "due process".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this respect, I would ask the Minister to review the scope of any future public consultation,&nbsp;as there could be policies or matters relating to the fundamentals of the tax system that perhaps needed to be aired with the public at large.&nbsp; There are many cynics out there.&nbsp; So, if you give them reason to believe that you have already decided on&nbsp;a policy and&nbsp;are merely going through the motion of consultation on the peripheral issues, you&nbsp;will undermine the whole objective of getting public "buy-in".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On my second point, the present Bill proposes to introduce a new section 90A in the Goods and Services Tax Act.&nbsp; Specifically, section 90A intends to implement an advanced rulings system for <p align=left>Column: 921<p>GST, which requires the payment of a fee to the Comptroller of GST.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recall that&nbsp;when&nbsp;the proposal was first made in the Goods and Services Tax (Amendment) Bill 2006 released in September last year,&nbsp;there were reactions from tax practitioners and others that having to pay for a GST ruling gives the wrong signal in a self- assessment system like the GST, whereby taxpayers have to determine the correct amount of GST to account to the Government.&nbsp; I remember this being discussed&nbsp;in the <I>Business Times</I> in an article on 7th November 2006.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps, at this juncture, I should explain, for the benefit of Members, the difference between the two main systems of tax collection&nbsp; -&nbsp; the official assessment system and a self-assessment system.&nbsp; Under an official assessment system, a taxpayer provides information to the tax authority to apply the law and calculate the tax liability.&nbsp; In Singapore, income tax operates on this system, where as long as there is full and complete disclosure, the taxpayer has discharged his or her responsibility.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With self-assessment, the responsibility to determine the correct amount of tax to pay is shifted to the taxpayer.&nbsp; The Singapore GST system operates on a system of self-assessment, which means that it is the responsibility of a GST-registered business to prepare its GST returns accurately and on time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A self-assessment regime should make it easy for businesses to understand their tax responsibilities and obligations, because the tax department has effectively shifted the responsibility for determining the correct amount of tax to the taxpayer.&nbsp; However, in Singapore, there is a concern that many businesses may not fully understand their responsi<p align=left>Column: 922<p>bilities under&nbsp;a self-assessment system, which is still a relatively new system.&nbsp; This is borne out by the amount of tax and penalties collected from GST audits by the IRAS, which is consistently higher than that collected from income tax audits.&nbsp; Clearly, businesses in Singapore need more help from the IRAS to meet their obligations in a self-assessment environment.&nbsp; Paying for advanced rulings is not consistent with this objective.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While some jurisdictions charge for advanced rulings, we should take the cue from countries like Australia, which conducted a review of its income tax self-assessment regime in 2003.&nbsp; In considering the role of the Australian tax office and the provision of rulings, the Australian Treasury 2004 discussion paper questioned whether the tax office should continue to provide private rulings free-of-charge.&nbsp; The final review report concluded that private rulings should not be charged for.&nbsp; What it said was that, and I quote, "... within&nbsp;a self-assessment environment, taxpayers have&nbsp;the right to know the manner in which the tax laws apply to their circumstances (rather than being a privilege that would justify charging a fee)."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In its response to&nbsp;the public comments, the Ministry of Finance has said that the charging of a fee is to deter frivolous requests and that the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore would continue to respond to normal inquiries.&nbsp; I am not aware of the number and types of inquiries that the IRAS receives on a daily basis, but it would be difficult to see how its workload can be reduced if there is uncertainty in the law that requires a ruling.&nbsp; It is better to flush out problems and uncertainties upfront rather than for businesses to grapple with these uncertainties in computing their GST.&nbsp; After all, with the increase in the GST rate, the amount of tax collected will increase substantially and the IRAS should&nbsp;prepare <p align=left>Column: 923<p>itself for the extra workload to help businesses get their GST computation right the first time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry has also commented that with the proposed fee, the GST ruling will be legally binding on the IRAS.&nbsp; On this point, I cannot recall circumstances&nbsp;where the IRAS has withdrawn its rulings in the past, unless, of course, the facts of the case and the law changed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, Sir, I support the Goods and Services Tax (Amendment) Bill.&nbsp; I would, however, request the Minister to consider the two points I have raised on fundamental issues of open and comprehensive public consultation and the administration of a tax which is fast becoming an important source of tax revenues.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

It seems, from the Schedule, that&nbsp;a trader who is seeking an advanced ruling is being charged time cost, as the initial fee of $525 for the first of four hours will be supplemented by an hourly fee of $131 per hour beyond the first four hours.&nbsp; The trader is also expected to reimburse the Comptroller for any external consultations which he may need to make in making the advanced ruling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister of State whether the trader would actually <p align=left>Column: 924<p>have an estimate of the approximate fee that he may have to pay for his application.&nbsp;

I welcome the amendments to section 21, especially those relating to overseas advertisements.&nbsp; While the amendments relating to the promulgation of advertisements outside Singapore extend the existing provisions of zero rating for exports and international services, I am heartened that they have now included overseas advertisements.&nbsp; Certainly, this new amendment will, I believe, contribute significantly to two critical areas.&nbsp; The first is to support Singapore's effort at becoming a media hub.&nbsp; I hope these amendments will attract more advertising agencies and media houses to locate in Singapore, as the advertisements they book for their clients out of Singapore will be zero rated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, these amendments will enable and encourage our local companies to promote their products and services in international markets, thus supporting further our globalisation drive.&nbsp; By zero rating international advertisements, our local companies can drive and coordinate more effective international marketing and promotion programmes out of their home offices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am also heartened by amendments to section 21A, which relate to the zero rating of tools and other supplies from the manufacture of goods for foreign persons.&nbsp; I believe these amendments will help drive down the cost of doing business for our local companies doing sub-contract work for foreign companies.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 925<p> The effect of zero rating will help make our local sub-contractors more competitive.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, Sir, I wish to ask if such zero rating will also apply to manufacturing tools by Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and contract manufacturers.&nbsp; Both of these sectors are fast growing and attractive markets for our local companies, both large and SMEs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the amendments to the Fourth Schedule to provide for exemption for Islamic financing is another exciting development that I fully support.&nbsp; These amendments will no doubt support the growth of Islamic financing, which is attracting a great deal of interest in the business community.&nbsp; My only question is,&nbsp;why is this exemption restricted only to non-residential property transactions?&nbsp; Why can we not extend this to other forms of business financing as well?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members may be interested to know that Islamic financing and banking is not just for Muslims.&nbsp; In other countries which also practise Islamic finance, many financial institutions have reported that between 30-40% of their Islamic financing clients are non-Muslim companies.&nbsp; Because Islamic finance is not based on an interest rate paradigm, these companies have found that they enjoy greater predictability in their budgeting and they can protect themselves against sudden changes in interest rates.&nbsp; Sir, I hope the Minister for Trade and Industry can seriously consider extending this exemption to other areas of Islamic financing, therefore creating a new impetus to the development of this very promising sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on this note, I rise in support of the Goods and Services Tax (Amendment) Bill.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, I would like to thank the Members for the support of the Bill.&nbsp; Let me take the questions in turn.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the comments by Mr Banerjee on the advance ruling and the implementation issues are well noted and well taken.&nbsp; Currently, as he has noted, IRAS gives GST advice free of charge but these are not legally binding on the tax authorities.&nbsp; The proposed Amendment Bill will allow businesses who want certainty to obtain an advance ruling that is legally binding.&nbsp; IRAS therefore levies a fee for advance ruling because more work is needed to do the necessary due diligence and such ruling applications are generally more complex than enquiries and require more detailed analyses.&nbsp; I would like to assure him and Ms Sylvia Lim that the fees are based on a cost recovery basis of the resources needed in issuing the ruling.&nbsp; We are charging a fee, as he has pointed out, in order to deter frivolous requests.&nbsp; The rulings are usually specific to the company and provide the company with tax certainty.&nbsp; Let me recount the experience of the Australian system. When they implemented this legally binding advance ruling system, there was actually an overwhelming increase in the number of requests and therefore the deterrent nature of the levying of a fee is in place.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The details of the charging will be reviewed over time, and I would like to give assurance that the applicants will not be charged beyond what is the fair rate, in terms of the actual time used.&nbsp; Let me assure Mr Banerjee and Ms Sylvia Lim that even with a GST advance ruling system, taxpayers can continue to approach IRAS for non-binding tax advice on GST queries.&nbsp; And IRAS will continue to educate taxpayers on the correct GST treatments through the e-Tax guides.&nbsp; To date, IRAS has published more than 60 e-Tax guides on the website, clarifying all<p align=left>Column: 927<p> the various treatments that are applicable to GST.<br></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Mr Banerjee's point about consultation, let me assure him that MOF had carefully considered the various policy changes proposed in the GST Bill, including the advance GST ruling, before we launched the draft Bill for public consultation.&nbsp; So the public consultation is not limited to only the actual process itself.&nbsp; But I agree with Mr Banerjee that we should have made it clear that we welcome feedback, not just on the drafting of the legislation for compliance, but also on the policy changes as well.&nbsp; And I would like to assure him that MOF values the feedback/inputs from the public and the business community, and we will continue to take them into account.<br></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho has raised two points on the zero treatment for prescribed tools in the manufacture of goods for exports, whether it is applicable to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and contract manufacturers as well. The answer is yes.&nbsp; They will be able to zero-rate the supply of tools if they satisfy the prescribed conditions.&nbsp; The main conditions are that the tools must be supplied to an overseas person and used to manufacture goods for export.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On her other point of exemption from GST for Islamic financing, I would like to assure her that this would not be restricted to only non-residential properties transactions. Currently, Islamic loans and deposits as well as sale and lease of residential properties are already exempted from GST.&nbsp; Only Islamic financing arrangements involving non-residential properties would attract GST.&nbsp; Hence, with the proposed Bill, the effective return earned by financial institutions on the sale of non-residential arrangements under qualifying Islamic financing arrangements would now also be exempted from GST.&nbsp; So this is really to close the loop.<br></p><p></p><p align=left>Column: 928<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Mdm Ho that Islamic financing is a promising growth area for Singapore and MOF will actively monitor the developments and consider the need for exemption of GST for new forms of Islamic financing arrangements when they are proposed.<br></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mrs Lim Hwee Hua].</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.</p></P></span></div>													<!--TITLE_NAME:EMPLOYMENT OF FOREIGN WORKERS (AMENDMENT) BILL--><p align=left>Column: 928<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:EMPLOYMENT OF FOREIGN WORKERS (AMENDMENT) BILL:::944--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>EMPLOYMENT OF FOREIGN WORKERS (AMENDMENT) BILL<BR></B></span><div><BR>											 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Order for Second Reading read.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.21 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."<p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><I>Rationale</I></p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore today enjoys strong economic growth accompanied by plentiful new jobs - last year was an all-time high of 176,000 jobs, of which 90,900 went to local residents.&nbsp; The economic prospects continue to look promising. We have a strong investment pipeline with a number of large infrastructural projects being completed over the next few years. Growth is broad-based across all industry sectors, especially finance, info-communications, marine and process industries. As&nbsp;projected,&nbsp;an estimated 450,000 jobs will be available in the next&nbsp;five years if the economy grows between 4.5%&nbsp;and 6.5% each year.&nbsp; These positive outcomes are a result of confidence in our <p align=left>Column: 929<p>economic and labour policies which are business-responsive and pro-growth.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together with NTUC and employer organisations, we have established practices for a flexible labour market, which includes the judicious use of foreign labour to meet rapidly changing manpower demands. Our labour policies and harmonious industrial climate have resulted in jobs for all. Our employment rate is already one of the highest in the world - 76% of working-age Singaporeans are in employment.&nbsp; The strong labour market will get even tighter, as our economy grows. The number of workers needed to sustain this economic growth has exceeded the local supply.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ability of our companies to access foreign manpower is a comparative advantage. But our foreign worker policy cannot be based on a <I>laissez-faire</I> approach, which will be detrimental to our overall progress.&nbsp; To protect the well-being of foreign workers, we have imposed conditions on employers for their housing, remuneration and medical coverage. We also carefully identify where foreign workers are needed most and allow them into selected industries. We constantly monitor the labour situation and make fine adjustments to maintain the equilibrium between our economic competitiveness and other social objectives, to enable locals to compete for jobs. For example, we allow more foreign workers in the construction and marine sectors where locals are less inclined to work; we allow a lower proportion in the manufacturing and services-related industries, and almost none in community-based shops and stalls. We have also taken a more liberal approach, with lesser controls, towards foreigners with better qualifications and skills. This is intentional, to attract skilled labour for which there is a global shortage.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 930<p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers seeking better employment opportunities abroad is an integral feature of globalisation and benefits both sending and receiving countries. But we should also recognise that there are syndicates which exist in many countries that seek to exploit vulnerable foreign workers.&nbsp; Many exact payment through empty promises of work, only to leave them hapless and stranded in dire straits, especially in those countries which have porous systems or weak enforcement.&nbsp; And from time to time, it happens here and is picked up by the press.&nbsp; This is a continuing problem and discussed in many global forums each year.&nbsp; I recently attended a United Nations High-Level Dialogue on International Migration and Development -&nbsp;that was the name of this meeting&nbsp;- in September 2006, which highlighted the problems of illegal employment and mitigating measures needed to be taken by both the source and receiving countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers in Singapore who fall prey to the temptation of cheap labour in order to make a quick profit, can exacerbate this problem of illegal employment.&nbsp; As our economy grows, we can expect the proportion of foreign workers to increase with labour demands, and, with it, the temptation to illegally employ foreign workers. Other countries have found that illegal employment can escalate rapidly, if not nipped in the bud.&nbsp;So Members may have read, for example, that President Bush is pushing through a Bill for tighter border controls but in accepting the problem as a <I>fait accompli</I>, legitimising the status of some 12 million illegal immigrants already in the US.&nbsp;We cannot afford the number, even a fraction of that number. &nbsp;Malaysia, nearer home, &nbsp;is also exploring new laws to strengthen the regulation of its foreign workforce and curb the trafficking of illegal immigrants.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singapore, as a small island, we need to be vigilant and manage our foreign worker population well, to ensure that it continues to contribute positively <p align=left>Column: 931<p>to our economy. We need a robust system with effective laws, enforcement and safeguards against the illegal entry and employment of foreign workers and ensure that their well-being is protected. We have therefore in recent years expanded MOM's Employment Inspectorate and built up capabilities in intelligence, operations and investigations, among other areas. This has enabled us to step up enforcement in targeted sectors, such as the food and beverage as well as cleaning sectors, where there were higher incidence of illegal employment. We have also enhanced promotional and outreach efforts to educate employers and workers about employment and immigration regulations.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To better manage the foreign workforce in Singapore, my Ministry has reviewed the Employment of Foreign Workers Act, or EFWA. This Bill amends the EFWA to increase the penalties for selected offences, introduce new offences and augment the powers of Employment Inspectors to facilitate enforcement efforts.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also take this opportunity to rationalise the legislative authority for all work passes. Currently, Work Permits and S-passes are regulated through a different statute from the Employment Passes. This Bill consolidates the legislative authority for all work passes under the EFWA, and renames it to the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, or EFMA, to reflect its broader coverage. With the consolidation, the EFMA will be the key legislation governing the employment of foreigners at all levels in Singapore.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now highlight the significant provisions of the Bill.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><I>Illegal employment</I></p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I had earlier highlighted, the illegal employment of foreigners remains a<p align=left>Column: 932<p> problem. Their errant employers evade levy payments, deploy these workers&nbsp;illegally, and ignore conditions imposed to protect their well-being.&nbsp; The number of illegal foreign workers arrested has increased from about 2,148 in 1995 to 2,868 in 2006. Currently, the penalties for illegal employment and levy evasion are bundled, ie, a minimum fine equivalent to 24 months of the foreign workers' levy and a maximum fine equivalent to 48 months of levy&nbsp; or imprisonment of up to a year or both.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 of the Bill amends section 5 and introduces stiffer penalties specifically for the illegal employment of foreigners - there will be now a maximum fine of $15,000 or imprisonment of up to a year or both, for each case of illegal employment. For multiple charges, any fines imposed would be cumulative, whereas the jail terms may be ordered to run consecutively or concurrently depending on the court's discretion. A mandatory jail term of between&nbsp;one&nbsp;and 12 months will continue to apply to repeat offenders. Any penalties imposed will be over and above the restitution of any levy evaded by such employers. Similarly, clauses 13 and 9 respectively amend sections&nbsp;10 and&nbsp;6A to impose the penalty of a maximum fine of $15,000 or imprisonment of up to a year or both on foreigners who are illegally self-employed, and on occupiers who permit a foreigner without a valid work pass to enter and remain at their workplaces.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Some, knowing these rules, which are now made explicit, may choose to work around the system<p align=left>Column: 933<p> through fraud.&nbsp; The number of foreigners who obtained their Employment Passes and "S" passes through illegal means, by either using fraudulent documents or over-declaring their actual salaries, has increased by nearly four-fold from 97 cases in 2005 to 374 cases in 2006.&nbsp; These workers have entered our system illegally and, if left unchecked, these abuses will over time undermine the integrity of the entire system.&nbsp; Accordingly, clause 22 increases the penalties for such offences, which include the provision of false information, the illegal trade and alteration of work passes and the possession of forged work passes, to be similar to those for illegal employment, which are a maximum fine of $15,000 or 12 months' imprisonment or both.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 22 also creates a new section 22(2) which requires any employer, foreign employee or self-employed foreigner who knows or has reason to believe that an offence of false declaration has been committed, to furnish such information to MOM.&nbsp; For example, MOM investigators have come across cases where either the employer or employee, or both, are aware that false information pertaining to the qualifications held by the worker, or the salary to be paid, is being supplied to MOM as part of the work pass application process.&nbsp; However, because they use the services of a third party to submit the application, they choose to keep quiet about the breach.&nbsp; The new section 22(2) will allow MOM to reduce the number of fraud cases. &nbsp;The obligation on parties with knowledge that a deception is being perpetrated to report such knowledge to the authorities is not a&nbsp;new one.&nbsp; For example, it is an offence under the Bankruptcy Act for a bankrupt to fail to notify the authorities if he is aware that a false claim of debt has been lodged by any person under the bankruptcy.&nbsp; But let me&nbsp;assure the House that MOM has no intention of using this<p align=left>Column: 934<p> new provision to prosecute minor, technical breaches.&nbsp; Rather, we would want&nbsp;to target those who have committed violations to circumvent our controls.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Powers of Employment Inspectors</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure better enforcement, the investigative powers of the Employment Inspectors are also enhanced. &nbsp;Similar to enforcement powers enjoyed by immigration officers under the Immigration Act, MOM's Employment Inspectors will be empowered under clause 21 to arrest without warrant both local and foreign suspects for&nbsp;offences of greater severity, namely, illegal employment, the active deception offences, as well as the obstruction of MOM's investigations.&nbsp; They will also be empowered to seize any offensive weapons when making arrests.&nbsp; New sections 21A, 21B and 21C are introduced under clause 21 to prescribe the manner of arrest, the proper use of restraints, and the procedure for the search of arrested persons.&nbsp; These are similar to the provisions in the Criminal Procedure Code.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Other amendments</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill makes other administrative and technical amendments to allow better administration of the Act.&nbsp; Clauses 10, 19 and 21G respectively clarify the application, issuance and renewal procedures for work passes, specify the circumstances and manner in which the employer or the foreign employee should inform MOM of address changes, as well as stipulate the mode of disposal of documents or articles seized during investigations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For consistency, certain provisions that are currently under the Immigration Act are also replicated under this Act, including the exemption of the decisions of the Minister and Controller of Work Passes in relation to the issuance, suspension and revocation of work passes from judicial review.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 935<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed amendments introduced under this Bill will enhance the regulation and protection of our foreign workforce.&nbsp; It will help minimise the number of illegal workers and their negative social and economic consequences, even as our workforce grows.&nbsp;

Migrant workers, together with our local workers, have enabled our economy to sustain the growth momentum and helped us attract investments and grow industries.&nbsp; Take the local factories and restaurants, for example.&nbsp; They would not have survived without the number of foreign workers or employees who make up the shortfall in our local workforce.&nbsp; In turn, these workplaces continue to provide our local workers with employment opportunities.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, NTUC is concerned about the welfare of all workers, local or migrant.&nbsp; The labour movement has always recognised and accepted the need for foreign workers to supplement our limited human resources, and appreciates their contributions to Singapore's economic development.&nbsp; Thus, the labour movement has constantly called on the Government to strengthen efforts to stamp out the problem of unscrupulous employers who use non-documented workers and ignore the conditions imposed to safeguard workers' well-being.&nbsp; Illegal or non-documented migrant workers are most at<p align=left>Column: 936<p> risk of abuse and are without protection.&nbsp; To safeguard both the interests of local and foreign workers, we should not allow any foreigners to work in Singapore illegally or being illegally redeployed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While a large majority of our employers are responsible employers and treat their migrant workers well, there are some black sheep who will ill-treat their migrant workers, as seen from the isolated incidents that continue to be reported in our media.&nbsp; Thus, I strongly welcome the amendments.&nbsp; I think the mandatory one-month jail sentence for second conviction of any employer employing foreign employees without valid work passes is a strong enough signal.&nbsp; But I wonder why&nbsp;MOM did not impose mandatory sentence on those who give, sell or forge work passes.&nbsp; I think MOM should.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the situation of migrant workers in Singapore, primarily a host or receiving country of migrants, is generally good and we should continue to make Singapore the choice destination for migrant workers from the region.&nbsp; But, at the same time, I hope that MOM would also regularly review and strengthen the legislative protection for our local workers.&nbsp; We should not allow any disparity in the treatment of locals and migrant workers, and being perceived as giving more protection to migrant workers than locals.&nbsp; Our world Number One workforce deserves a world-class legislative protection and work conditions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, currently, the employers of work permit holders are required to ensure the well-being of all their migrant workers under the work permit conditions provided by the Employment of Foreign Workers Act (EFWA).&nbsp; I think&nbsp;MOM should also increase the penalty against employers who breach these work permit conditions.&nbsp; At the present moment, the penalty is a fine of up to $5,000 or a jail term of up to six months.&nbsp; I also hope that the list of<p align=left>Column: 937<p> the work permit conditions be revised regularly to enhance protection.&nbsp; I would also like to know whether MOM would include an amendment to safeguard workers against ill-treatment by unscrupulous employment agents, rather than just employers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides regularly monitoring the situation and reviewing the foreign manpower management framework and relevant legislation, I think the Ministry should also explore practical ways to reach out and generate awareness in helping migrant workers better understand and exercise their rights in Singapore.&nbsp; It is also important for the Ministry to reach out to and generate awareness among the SMEs so that they would understand their legal obligations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, at the end of the day, revised legislation and regulations are just means to an end.&nbsp; More responsible employers and caring workplaces will remain as the key to safeguard the welfare of our workers, regardless of nationality and background.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</B> Sir, I rise in support of the amendments proposed under the Employment of Foreign Workers (Amendment) Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amendments have a two-fold purpose:&nbsp;&nbsp;firstly, to consolidate the various legislative authority for all work passes under the Employment of Foreign Workers (Amendment) Bill and, secondly, to increase the penalties for selected offences, introduce new offences and enhance the powers of Employment Inspectors to facilitate enforcement orders.&nbsp; The increase in penalties will ensure that those who violate the Act will be sufficiently deterred, as otherwise the<p align=left>Column: 938<p> Act will lose its effectiveness and offences will continue to be committed with impunity.&nbsp; We certainly need a strong regulatory regime in order to provide better protection to our foreign workers, otherwise our image and ability to attract global talents will be affected.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the amendments will provide a more coordinated and coherent approach in regulating the employment of foreign workers.&nbsp; Under the current regime, some aspects of the regulation are governed under the Foreign Workers Act and the other aspects are governed by the Immigration Act, which is under the ICA.&nbsp; This is not only confusing for companies and&nbsp;workers, but I am also sure it increases the complexity in regulating foreign manpower on the part of MOM, the primary agency in dealing with workers of all nationalities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore's development today would not have been possible without the contributions of our foreign workers.&nbsp; They have contributed much to our efforts to&nbsp;develop into a world-class, dynamic and globally competitive workforce, ranked as the number one workforce by BERI for many years.&nbsp; Hence, our broad approach and strategies in managing foreign manpower is on the right track, and this Bill will further strengthen and enhance our position.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have a number of observations to make and some clarifications to seek from the Minister.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I notice that a new definition has been inserted under section 2 of the Act.&nbsp; A new word "employ" has been inserted.&nbsp; The word "employ", as defined by the Bill, means to "engage or use the service of any person for the purpose&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;of any work; or (b)&nbsp;of providing any training for that person, whether under a contract of service or otherwise, and with or without salary".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 939<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to seek a clarification from the Minister on the exact meaning of this provision, as it seems to be very broad, particularly the words "engage or use the service of any person for the purpose of providing any training,&nbsp;whether under a contract of service or otherwise, and with or without salary". &nbsp;This provision can be interpreted to mean that it is acceptable for an employer to bring in foreigners as trainees, without having to employ them under contracts of service and without having to pay them any salary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is the interpretation, then there are serious concerns of the potential for abuse and whether this would open the door for really cheap foreign workers to come in as trainees, to the detriment of local workers.&nbsp; I hope that this is not the intention of the law, and it would be of great help if the Minister could clarify this point in this House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This clarification, Sir,&nbsp;is also important in view of the recent announcement made by MOM that, with effect from 1st December 2007, undergraduates and graduates from overseas will be allowed to work here for short stints.&nbsp; They can work for up to six months and are not restricted to specific types of work.&nbsp; They are also not subject to minimum salary requirements, as mentioned in the MOM's press statement.&nbsp; Although the intention is to encourage more foreign students to come to Singapore and sink their roots here, the issue is whether this greater liberalisation of foreign students coming here to work, coupled with the new definition which I alluded to earlier on, will open the door for cheap labour in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I think that the law should provide for the reverse, ie,&nbsp;anyone being employed in Singapore as a student, trainee or otherwise, should be considered as employees so that they are covered under the Employment Act and are paid<p align=left>Column: 940<p> salaries before work passes can be issued to the employers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broadly, Sir, our strategy in employing foreign workers to augment our local workforce is a right one. &nbsp;Last year, although we created 176,000 jobs, we were not able to get Singaporeans to take up all the jobs and, as the Minister&nbsp;mentioned just now as well as&nbsp;on various occasions in the past,&nbsp;about 450,000 jobs would be created over the next five years.&nbsp; As a result, last year, almost half the jobs had to go to foreigners.&nbsp; Whilst I support this flexibility, I would also like to suggest that the Minister continue to monitor the impact of this policy of greater flexibility in the use of foreign manpower on our more vulnerable workers, specifically our low-wage workers, the older workers and the women who are currently out of the labour market.&nbsp; The last two categories were also touched upon by the Tripartite Committee on&nbsp;Employability of Older Workers.&nbsp; The tripartite partners have been collaborating very closely in order to assist our older workers and low-wage workers through job redesign and skills upgrading.&nbsp; It is important that our foreign manpower policy augments these efforts and not weakens them, as the concern is that the easy availability of foreign workers may discourage some employers from embarking on these initiatives.&nbsp; We have seen the great increase in the use of cheap sourcing and contract workers, and this has generally led to a decline in wages of these workers.&nbsp; We have done a fair bit for our low-wage workers, particularly with the introduction of the WIS, but that is not the panacea, as having a job and earning better pay is the real, long-term solution for our low-wage workers.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

This is one area where employers need to put more efforts and be more<p align=left>Column: 941<p> innovative in helping our women who want to work to return to the workforce&nbsp;or to help those who are currently in the workforce to continue working.&nbsp; I hope that the&nbsp;easy availability of foreign workers will not dampen our efforts to retain and attract women back to the workforce.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the other category of Singaporeans that I am concerned about is the older PMETs. The picture is still not so rosy for them, despite what the statistics show.&nbsp; I welcome the WDA's efforts to introduce a new programme, called the Professional Conversion Programme (PCP).&nbsp; I would like to urge MOM to consider scaling up this programme to cover more sectors and reach out to more older PMETs who are facing the squeeze. This is important as the greater liberalisation of the "S" passes from an initial start of 5% to 10% and then to 15%, barely two years later, would mean that employers now have greater access to younger and better educated foreign workers who can be employed on lower pay, for a longer period and from any part of the world.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the need to have foreign workers to uphold our own local workforce to meet the needs of our economy, but I would, at the same time, like to urge MOM to monitor the situation closely so that our more vulnerable workers are not affected and also our efforts in other areas, such as promoting the employment of older workers and women under the back-to-work programmes, are not compromised.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, I agree with the amendment to paragraph 13, that a work pass holder shall not allow any other person to have possession of his work pass.&nbsp; But the law is unclear about what happens if it is the employer who insists on keeping his workers' work passes, as is usually <p align=left>Column: 942<p>the case as some fear that their workers will moonlight or abscond.&nbsp; Greater clarity on this would have been useful.&nbsp; I would also like to urge MOM to communicate and educate our foreign workers on the changes under this law and the new penalties and how it would affect them, so that they are not caught by surprise, and that the greater protection that is intended to be accorded&nbsp;by this Bill will reach them and benefit them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, Sir, I support the Bill.&nbsp;</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>3.43 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to rise in support of the Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is said that strong fences make good neighbours.&nbsp; Nowhere is this more true than in the area of people relations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, these amendments make&nbsp;former&nbsp;grey areas&nbsp;into black and white.&nbsp; It requires both employers and fellow workers to observe a stricter worker regime.&nbsp; For example,&nbsp;it requires an employer of an employee or self-employed foreigner, who is aware of the commission of a false declaration offence, to notify the Ministry of Manpower. So, once one is aware of false information being supplied to the Ministry, as part of the work pass application process, one now cannot keep quiet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed amendments are necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;I support them for three key reasons.&nbsp; First, to ensure the employers do not flout the rules and, in the process, create an uneven playing field for themselves against others&nbsp;who are good&nbsp;and compliant employers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support it also because it will be a step forward in ensuring that it does not lead to a displacement of local workers in favour of foreign workers, a point which Mdm Halimah and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang have also made.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 943<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also support it because, at the same time, it will serve to safeguard the well-being of foreign workers themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, as our country progresses and with the strong economy that is fuelling strong job growth, we have to be mindful of such concerns.&nbsp; All too often, we know the sentiments expressed by some Singaporean workers that their jobs are slowly but surely being taken away by foreign workers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I declare my interest as the Advisor to the Amalgamated Union of Public Daily-Rated Workers (AUPDRW).&nbsp; Most of them are in the vector control unit and&nbsp;many of them are actively cleaning the streets.&nbsp; From a membership of some 30,000 in the past, they now have less than 10,000 members, and it looks like this will continue to decline. How is this so?&nbsp; Well,&nbsp;much of&nbsp;the work has&nbsp;gone to foreign workers.&nbsp; Understandably, there is some frustration and&nbsp;not a little resentment towards these workers. They tell me: why do they&nbsp;get the latest machines?&nbsp; Why do&nbsp;they sit around on buggies when others, ie, the local workers, are in the drains clearing out the rubbish by hand?&nbsp;&nbsp;They cost less to employers.&nbsp;They also&nbsp;get free transport and housing, whereas the AUPDRW&nbsp;workers&nbsp;have to pay for everything. So, in the end, some of our local workers may lose out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><B>[Mdm Deputy Speaker (Ms Indranee Rajah) in the Chair]</B></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, these are the raw emotions of workers on the ground and&nbsp;such&nbsp;amendments to the Bill may&nbsp;not reach their ears.&nbsp; However, I believe that such tightening of the rules&nbsp;is necessary to demonstrate our sincerity towards regulating the sector.&nbsp; It also shows that there is a genuine and fully costed demand for workers which will reflect their true market cost.&nbsp; It helps us to explain to our local workers that <p align=left>Column: 944<p>their foreign colleagues are not under-cutting the market in devious ways and through no fault of theirs, but that of their employers.&nbsp; It also serves to ensure that good and compliant employers are not disadvantaged.&nbsp; So the proposed amendments to this Bill address and allay such concerns.&nbsp; But it&nbsp;is&nbsp;just the beginning.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As a <p align=left>Column: 945<p>result, the property market also responded positively, and a host of en blocs added to the demand for more construction activities, and hence more foreign workers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Broadly, I am in support of the Bill to amend the Employment of Foreign Workers Act.&nbsp; However, there are aspects of the proposed amendments which I would like to share my views.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rapid demand for new hotels, offices and houses put a demand on the contractors and developers to meet pressing deadlines.&nbsp; What this means is that they have to get the materials and commit more workers to the site.&nbsp; Delays can be very costly and result in penalties.&nbsp; Nonetheless, I agree that this pressing need must not be met at the expense of social order and security by allowing illegal overstayers to continue working in Singapore.&nbsp; But I would like to address certain issues that I feel would require greater attention to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed Bill will empower the Employment&nbsp;Inspectors to arrest without warrant both local and foreign suspects for severe EFWA offences.&nbsp; Such offences include illegal employment and provision of false information, to name a few.&nbsp; This power is further set to be absolute in terms of enabling these officers to enforce the proper use of restraint similar to that in the Criminal Procedure Code.&nbsp; I find that it would be prudent that such actions, when necessary, be enforced solely on the offending foreign workers.&nbsp; The use of handcuffing, detention and respective actions under the state code paints a too harsh picture for employers and company staff.&nbsp; The restraints to be applied should take into account whether or not the suspect is likely to attempt to flee.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think this will not be necessary for Singapore employers.&nbsp; Such actions will only seek to demean an employer and punish his integrity and reputation, even<p align=left>Column: 946<p> before he is given a proper chance to explain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foreign workers, though wanting to provide a living to support themselves or their families or for whatever reasons, are fully aware that entering a country illegally is a crime in itself.&nbsp; Desperation may be a powerful weapon.&nbsp; The reasoning loses meaning for an offender to consider fleeing arrest.&nbsp; Therefore, I feel that this exercise of power should be used and authorised only by the Police or any other senior staff of the Employment Inspectorate on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amendments proposed will see harsher penalties enforced.&nbsp; A maximum fine of $15,000 or 12 months' jail or both will be added on top of the current illegal employment penalty.&nbsp; I urge the Minister to consider a reduction in the enhanced penalties.&nbsp; With the large workforce on sites, the multiplier effects of the original penalty would have dealt a serious blow to the financial performance of any contractor, let alone the enhanced penalties.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The objective of the proposed amendments, I believe, is to serve as a deterrence to would-be offenders.&nbsp; I feel that there is sufficient deterrence as of now.&nbsp; Unless the intention is to close down the contracting firms altogether, then imposing such heavy penalties will have the intended effect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that owners of these companies often delegate the groundwork to their operational managers.&nbsp; It will be too heavy a price to put on the owners should there be an oversight on the part of their managers.&nbsp; The increase in penalties enforced without proper justification at first sight will be duly unfair to these companies and workers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I want to dwell on the need to return the work pass after its cancellation.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 947<p> Today, we have modern technology which can easily trace whether or not a work pass is valid or has been cancelled.&nbsp; Why is there a need to return the cancelled work pass, when what matters is that the data&nbsp;in the Government records is updated?&nbsp; We are putting an additional imposition on the employers to recover the cancelled work passes and forward them to the Ministry of Manpower.&nbsp; Even for our passports, when they expire,&nbsp; we can just get a replacement without having to return the one that is cancelled.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, I want to know whether the Minister will consider allowing the work pass to be more generic so that the holder can multi-task and be allowed to perform related tasks, when necessary.&nbsp; As a country, we encourage job enlargement and multi-tasking, and I propose that the work pass of foreign workers be given a more generic role.&nbsp; For example, a construction firm should be allowed to use a worker at a work site to service his machines and&nbsp;equipment at another premises, so long as it is owned by the same company.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, on this note, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Prof. Thio Li-ann--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.22 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Prof. Thio Li-ann:</B> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I rise to support the Bill in general, although I have concerns about certain amendments which relate to how administrative actors under the Employment of Foreign Workers Act are held accountable in the exercise of their statutory powers.&nbsp; My major concerns are with the amended section 7.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current Government policy is to encourage both highly skilled and unskilled foreign workers to come and work in Singapore to meet the labour shortfall.&nbsp; Laws must be lined&nbsp;up with&nbsp;the objectives behind labour policies for this<p align=left>Column: 948<p> to be successfully realised.&nbsp; As a major labour importing country in Asia, Singapore should recognise and honour the contributions made by foreign workers to our economic growth.&nbsp; These include those employed in low-paying jobs as domestic workers and workers in the construction industry who often face hazardous work conditions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a nation and aspiring civil and civil rights society, we must ensure that aliens and strangers who come to work in our midst are not oppressed or mistreated as disposable commodities.&nbsp; Indeed, the need to address issues of migration and migrant labour is a global one.&nbsp; Closer to home, Singapore and other ASEAN states adopted the ASEAN Declaration on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Migrant Workers in January 2007.&nbsp; The Declaration acknowledges the need to promote the dignity&nbsp;of migrant workers, to redress abuses and recruitment malpractices they are vulnerable to and to ensure they enjoy decent working and living conditions.&nbsp; In translating these aspirations into reality, we have promises to keep and miles to go before we sleep.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Employment of Foreign Workers Act underpins the regulatory environment for managing foreign workers.&nbsp; The Act was designed to deal with the problems caused by employers seeking to evade regulatory measures, like the foreign worker levy, by illegally employing foreign workers without work passes or overstayers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current amendments under scrutiny pay some attention to issues of enforcement.&nbsp; The new section 22 introduces new offences involving active deception in the sale, forgery or unlawful alteration of a work pass.&nbsp; Aside from heavier fines and lengthy imprisonment terms, the amendments also confer extensive powers upon administrative officials to arrest without warrant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 949<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the old section 21, a police officer or employment inspector may arrest without warrant any person reasonably believed to be employed in Singapore while not in possession of&nbsp;a valid work permit.&nbsp; The amendment to section 21 extends this power of arrest without warrant beyond illegal workers, to include employers hiring foreigners without work permits, or who flout existing work permit conditions.&nbsp; It adopts a more holistic approach of targeting all culpable actors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The power to arrest without warrant is far reaching as it affects personal liberty through bodily restraint or physical incarceration.&nbsp; Personal liberty is a fundamental liberty guaranteed to citizens and non-citizens under Article 9 of the Singapore Constitution.&nbsp; This requires that in depriving a person of personal liberty, this must be done in accordance with law.&nbsp; Laws must satisfy a constitutional standard of fairness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This sort of broad discretionary power conferred by the Employment of Foreign Workers Act reflects the general expansion of centralised powers wielded by the administrative state.&nbsp; Discretion is essential to any regulatory regime.&nbsp; It allows an administrative official a legitimate margin of autonomy to apply his professional expertise to a case to ensure a good decision.&nbsp; Nevertheless, in a rule of law state, the need for checks and balances must be appreciated as discretionary power may be misused.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This harks back to the old conundrum of the problem of power, which raises two issues.&nbsp; First, governments must be empowered to govern effectively.&nbsp; Second, governmental power must be restrained to prevent abuses.&nbsp; As James Madison, the father of the US Constitution, noted, "If men were angels, no government would be necessary."&nbsp; How<p align=left>Column: 950<p>ever, men are not angels.&nbsp; While citizens may hope for the best to be ruled by a wise and benevolent platonic philosopher king or Confucian&nbsp;<I>jun zi,</I> prudence requires precautionary measures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Law and legal institutions must be constructed to deal with worst-case scenarios - to leash the leviathan or absolute sovereign state that Thomas Hobbes wrote about, which wields formidable power that may be&nbsp;a precipice&nbsp;deployed.&nbsp; How then shall we bind the leviathan?&nbsp; One way to prevent the arbitrary abuse of discretion is to set conditions identifying when discretion may be legitimately or unlawfully exercised.&nbsp; A popular conception of discretion must be compatible with the rule of law, and must&nbsp;appropriately balance the values of fairness and efficiency.&nbsp; A statute can provide clear guidelines in this respect, as in new sections 21A, B and C.&nbsp; For example, handcuffs can only be used for specified purposes, excluding punishment.&nbsp; Further, to be lawful, the power to arrest and to search arrested persons must be exercised with strict regard to decency.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I raise my reservations chiefly in relation to the amended section 7 which governs work pass applications.&nbsp; The Controller has the power to grant or&nbsp;refuse to issue these permits or to vary the conditions.&nbsp; Although there is no constitutional or statutory right to be given a work permit, this still represents an important interest or privilege at public law, as the grant or refusal of a work permit implicates livelihood issues.&nbsp; The Controller cannot wield absolute power in handling work permit applications and must be accountable for how power is exercised.&nbsp; It usually falls to the court as the independent and impartial branch of the Government to determine when administrative actors, like the Controller, are acting within the four corners of their statutory powers as a matter of administrative law.&nbsp; The court will seek to<p align=left>Column: 951<p> ensure that the decision-making process satisfies common law test of rationality and fairness.&nbsp; Indeed, this is a facet of the rule of law, as the Court of Appeal stated, in the case of <I>Chang Suan Su versus Minister for Home Affairs</I>, the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion is contrary to the rule of law.&nbsp; All power has legal limits and the rule of law demands that the court should be able to examine the exercise of discretionary power.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the current Act, if, for example, the Controller refuses to issue a work permit, section 7(4) provides an aggrieved employer a statutory remedy of appealing to the Minister.&nbsp; The Minister's decision is said to be final and cannot be questioned by any court.&nbsp; If this finality clause is literally interpreted, it would seem that the buck stops with the Minister, as part of the Executive branch.&nbsp; As the statute is silent, it is unclear whether an aggrieved applicant could still go to the courts to apply for a judicial review of the Controller's decision.&nbsp; Or under section 7(4), did Parliament intend only the Minister could correct a defective decision made by the Controller?&nbsp; If so, the aggrieved individual would hit a dead end in terms of remedies if the Ministerial appeal fails, and there would be no significant judicial role in controlling the bureaucracy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This sensitivity arises as case law from other jurisdictions suggests that while there is a presumption that the aggrieved individual should first use an available statutory remedy rather than go for judicial review, that individual can apply for judicial review after unsuccessfully exhausting a statutory remedy.&nbsp; So, if the Controller does not grant a work permit and if the Minister upholds the Controller's decision, the aggrieved individual can then take the matter to court.&nbsp; Indeed, there are Commonwealth cases which have allowed individuals in appropriate cases to proceed directly to courts without even using an available<p align=left>Column: 952<p> non-judicial remedy, such as appealing to a Minister.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Controller's decision under the terms of the Employment of Foreign Workers Act is subject to judicial review, what are the grounds on which a decision may be challenged?&nbsp; There are conventionally three grounds of judicial review or three arrows which an individual can shoot in challenging the making of a decision.&nbsp; There are two substantive grounds of review - illegality and irrationality - and one procedural ground of review, that of procedural impropriety which concerns procedural fairness.&nbsp; A decision found to be illegal, irrational or procedurally improper is <I>ultra vires</I> or unlawful.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In sum, under the existing Act, it was unclear whether an aggrieved person could bypass the section 7(4) procedure of appealing to the Minister and go straight to court to ask for judicial review on any of the three grounds as described.&nbsp; Singapore's case law is, I think, not conclusive on this matter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the new statutory regime, the old section 7(4) is substantially retained and recast as the new section 7(5).&nbsp; Persons may still appeal to the Minister from an adverse decision of the Controller, and the Minister's decision shall be final.&nbsp; In addition, a new provision amending section 7(6) is introduced.&nbsp; This provides that judicial review in a court of law does not lie against any decision of the Minister or Controller except for questions relating to compliance with any procedural requirement of this Act governing such decision.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the effect of this new provision?&nbsp; Two points are worth mentioning.&nbsp; Firstly, if my reading is correct, it seems that this provision clarifies the problem of whether section 7 decisions made by the Controller and Minister concerning Work Pass applications are subject to judicial<p align=left>Column: 953<p> review.&nbsp; It appears that the answer is yes.&nbsp; Therefore, there are two remedies for section 7 decisions made by the Controller where an existing work permit is revoked.&nbsp; Firstly, an appeal to the Minister and also applying for judicial review.&nbsp; Secondly, the new section 7(6) is a limitation clause.&nbsp; While it allows the judicial review of the Minister's and Controller's decision under section 7, it also truncates or limits the scope of judicial review and therefore weakens this check on administrative action.&nbsp; As stated, there are generally two heads of substantive review and one head of procedural review.&nbsp; New section 7(6) limits judicial review by precluding the substantive review of section 7 decisions. Only limited review is allowed to ensure procedural requirements are complied with.&nbsp; Effectively, the two arrows of substantive reviews are not available and only one arrow remains to challenge the decision for non-compliance with procedural requirements.&nbsp; I wonder what these procedural requirements might be and hope that the Minister can clarify this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At any rate, an aggrieved applicant under section 7(6) may only apply for limited judicial review.&nbsp; If the rule of law postulates that the court should generally have the final say in determining the limits of legal power, then section 7(6), to some extent, departs from this principle. So it is understood.&nbsp; The reason why courts are usually the final arbiter on questions of law flows from the constitutional principle of the separation of powers.&nbsp; In Singapore, where the Cabinet effectively controls Parliament, the Legislature and Parliamentary Executive are fused, rather than separated. Thus, the exercise of judicial review by an independent judiciary to control the Executive branch assumes greater importance.&nbsp; By limiting the role of judicial review in controlling administrative action, the rule of law is qualified in so far as it seeks to ensure meaningful legal<p align=left>Column: 954<p> restraints on the exercise of political or administrative power.&nbsp; This does not mean that administrative actors like the Controller are not subject to checks.&nbsp; It just means that faith is primarily placed in the hands of non-judicial bodies like the Minister to control the Controller and secondarily to the courts.&nbsp; The presence of political rather than legal checks is quite typical of countries where Parliament is supreme.&nbsp; But, in Singapore, the Constitution is supreme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If substantive judicial review is ousted under section 7(6), one might imagine a worst case scenario where there may not be a judicial remedy for a double dereliction of duty. Hypothetically, what would happen if the Controller acts in bad faith or acts irrationally in cancelling a work pass because the applicant has frizzy hair which he personally dislikes.&nbsp; Allegations of bad faith or irrationality are substantive errors and cannot be reviewed under the Act which only allows judicial review for procedural errors.&nbsp; Further, what happens if an aggrieved applicant appeals to the Minister who does not apply his mind to the matter and just agrees with the Controller's decision without carefully re-examining the case.&nbsp; The Minister could be acting unlawfully by failing to use his discretion but, again, would be exempted from judicial review, as this is a matter for substantive review.&nbsp; What other remedies are then available?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Limitation clauses which curtail judicial review may be found in other statutes. One that springs to mind is the Internal Security Act.&nbsp; Under section 8(b)(2) of the ISA, no judicial review lies against decisions of the President or Minister except for questions relating to compliance with any procedural requirements set out in the ISA.&nbsp; The proposed new section 7(6) bears a strong resemblance to this clause.&nbsp; Here, again, the reduced scope of judicial review qualifies the rule of law.&nbsp; However, a stronger case for limiting judicial review under the ISA<p align=left>Column: 955<p> compared to other Acts on at least two grounds can be made.&nbsp; First, ISA is an extraordinary law whose chief goal is to deal with acts undermining state security.&nbsp; Many states today have enacted laws permitting detention without trial to deal with terrorist threats.&nbsp; Such laws substantially curtail due process rights, placing the state above rather than under law.&nbsp; However, this derogation from the rule of law is justified on grounds of necessity of national security.&nbsp; Of course, national security must not be lightly invoked as the justification for limiting basic rights, as this must relate to an exceptional rather than an ordinary state of affairs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many countries grapple with striking the appropriate balance between liberty and security, not just Singapore.&nbsp; In this process, it is argued that judicial review should be limited as judges are not security experts and should stick to questions of law, not politics or security.&nbsp; Indeed, such matters should be entrusted to the Minister who is expected to act in a politically responsible manner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the Constitution is the supreme law and under that, Article 149 gives Parliament extraordinary legislative powers to enact anti-subversion laws. The ISA was enacted and legitimated under this constitutionally mandated special power, even though the ISA clashes with other constitutional provisions as it limits judicial review and suspends the enjoyment of certain fundamental liberties. I am concerned that section 7(6) of the Employment of Foreign Workers (Amendment) Bill does not stem from this sort of extraordinary legislative powers stemming from Article 149 of the Constitution.&nbsp; While the Employment of Foreign Workers (Amendment) Bill is designed to serve the national interest of Singapore, it is surely not a matter of national security.&nbsp; I wonder if the Minister could elaborate on why it is necessary to limit judicial review in respect of decisions taken by the rele<p align=left>Column: 956<p>vant administrative actors under section 7 of the amended Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should be careful not to depart too readily from the constitutional law principle that administrative action should generally be subject to the legal control of the courts through judicial review, rather than relying on non-judicial methods of control, such as ministerial appeals.&nbsp; Both of course can co-exist.&nbsp; In fact, this would enhance the prospect of ensuring fair dealing between the individual and administrative state.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My final point is a suggestion on how to strengthen the statutory remedy of appealing to the Minister in relation to section 7 decisions.&nbsp; By analogy, judges are required to furnish reasons for their judgements which enable counsel to decide whether there are sufficient grounds for appeal.&nbsp; So, too, an aggrieved applicant under the EFWA needs to know, for example, why the Controller decided to revoke a work pass or to debar a person from applying for a work pass for a fixed period.&nbsp; This would help the applicant to evaluate whether or not to make an appeal.&nbsp; In certain Commonwealth jurisdictions, the common law has evolved the duty requiring administrative actors to give reasons for their decision.&nbsp; Of course, an administrator may informally choose to give reasons.&nbsp; However, it would be prudent to follow the best administrative law practices abroad where the duty to give adequate reasons has been codified by statute.&nbsp; Giving reasons is one of the fundamentals of good, open and rational administration.&nbsp; Further, telling a person why his application was rejected is to treat him with dignity, rather than impersonally as a member of a faceless mass of people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope these considerations will be taken into account, if not for this Act, for future laws which confer regulatory powers on the administrative state which affect the lives and interests of citizens<p align=left>Column: 957<p> and foreign nationals dwelling within our borders. Such procedural safeguards will enhance the construction of good administrative procedure, promote good governance, protect interest and fortify the rule of law.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other than the reservations expressed, I support the amendments in general.<br></p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.40 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B> Madam, I appreciate comments from Members of this House.&nbsp; First, I thank&nbsp;Members for&nbsp;affirmation of the widespread support for this Bill.&nbsp; Mr Yeo Guat Kwang said&nbsp;he strongly welcomes it, and there are other similar supporting statements that&nbsp;we are moving in the right direction, and MOM appreciates that.&nbsp; If I may address certain issues directly.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Yeo, and some other Members, asked whether this Bill does, through perception,&nbsp;give the impression that we are protecting foreign workers more than local workers.&nbsp; The answer is, of course, no.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the only Act that provides protection for our citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the Employment Act and other measures as well, in terms of&nbsp;the Workfare system,&nbsp;etc. So&nbsp;it should not be seen narrowly in that sense.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Yeo particularly&nbsp;welcomed the mandatory one-month jail for repeat offences and asked why similar offences of fraud or deception did not have such onerous penalties.&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalties are never cast in stone.&nbsp; We review them from time to time to&nbsp;see whether&nbsp;they are sensible or not.&nbsp; If you take what Ms Lee Bee Wah said, in fact, she responded on the opposite end, that it was too harsh.&nbsp; So there is a balance to be struck.&nbsp; But since I touch on the subject, let me just say that the penalties are never crafted <I>de novo</I>.&nbsp; We have to take reference from<p align=left>Column: 958<p> what the previous penalties were as well as in reference to other countries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; So are our penalties harsher, which is a point asked by Ms Lee Bee Wah?&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is no.&nbsp; For example, the first conviction&nbsp;is a fine of&nbsp; up to $15,000 or 12 months' imprisonment.&nbsp;For Taiwan, the penalty is three years' imprisonment.&nbsp; So it is certainly much harsher.&nbsp; In Malaysia, it has 12 months' imprisonment; in South Korea, it is the same.&nbsp; So there is, if you like, a benchmark.&nbsp; At the end of the day, we will see how effective it is.&nbsp; I agree with Members that this allows us to implement the framework for enforcement is also important.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah asked some questions.&nbsp; First, let me thank her for saying that this is a more coordinated and coherent framework.&nbsp; We agree.&nbsp; We wanted to consolidate the Acts together.&nbsp;Members would know from the statements that the enforcement was in two Acts - the Immigration and Employment of Foreign Workers Acts.&nbsp; It was not only cumbersome but administratively complex sometimes.&nbsp; So we have consolidated them today.&nbsp; She asked for this new definition of "trainee", whether it was meant to liberalise our policy.&nbsp; The answer is obviously not.&nbsp; This is a legislation to tighten up enforcement.&nbsp; The reason is&nbsp;that we are pre-empting,&nbsp;in other words, as employer and employee relationship changes, for example, like&nbsp;the personalised Employment Pass.&nbsp; This is a legislative umbrella to bring all foreign workers into and&nbsp;to apply the framework.&nbsp; So that was the main reason, and is certainly not a liberalisation.&nbsp; In other words, they would still have to comply with our Work Pass rules.&nbsp; But somebody can claim that he is not designated.&nbsp;&nbsp;He is outside&nbsp;the system and, therefore,&nbsp;he is not under this ambit.&nbsp; That particular clause clarifies it.&nbsp; We can dictate what kind of relationship it is and what you are, and then put you under this umbrella.&nbsp; That was the purpose for it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 959<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Seah Kian Peng basically agrees with the law and he supported it, and he said&nbsp;the majority will comply.&nbsp; I thank him for his comments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me address some points made by Ms Lee Bee Wah, in terms of powers of arrest.&nbsp; Let me just state, as some Members have noted, that under the Immigration Act -&nbsp;this is not new -&nbsp;MOM Employment Inspectors are already empowered to arrest without warrant local employers for EP offences. We can already do so&nbsp;for Employment Pass offences.&nbsp; But that was because it was under the Immigration&nbsp;Act.&nbsp;The Immigration Act governs the Employment Pass whereas the S Pass, Work Pass are under the EFWA.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we have consolidated them.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have just broadened and rationalised this.&nbsp; This is not something new.&nbsp; But, in effect, yes,&nbsp;she is&nbsp;right.&nbsp; We can also arrest local employers who commit offences for Work Pass and S Passes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were some concerns that now that&nbsp;we are given these enhanced powers,&nbsp;she conjured up images of offenders being handcuffed and then found out to be wrong. &nbsp;That can happen, and&nbsp;I would say that we are also concerned about this.&nbsp; We deliberated long enough whether actually we wanted these powers.&nbsp; The issue is not whether&nbsp;he is senior or whether&nbsp;he is authorised.&nbsp; The issue is training.&nbsp; I want to assure Ms Lee Bee Wah that</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

But, more importantly, our employment inspectorate officers are also trained to discharge these new powers professionally.&nbsp; In other words, we are not Dirty Harry, running around and just handcuffing people.&nbsp; That is not the idea.&nbsp; We want to be bound by SOPs and to be fair and judicious in the use of the power of arrest, just as we have under the current Act.&nbsp; To minimise <p align=left>Column: 960<p>overnight detention, the Act actually provides for the release of arrested persons on bail or personal bond.&nbsp; So I am very mindful of this as Minister.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make sure, and I have asked my staff, "Are you&nbsp;comfortable?&nbsp; Have you&nbsp;benchmarked yourself with the police and other people?"&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, we are not alone, in terms of enforcement agencies who have this power.&nbsp; There are other agencies who also have powers of arrest without warrant.&nbsp; Customs officers, you know, but IRAS officers too.&nbsp; IRAS officers are able to arrest without warrant but, of course, it is done by SPF or Immigration officers for persons caught leaving Singapore without paying outstanding tax payments.&nbsp; Yes, we are concerned and, therefore, we want them to be properly trained, so let me assure Ms Lee Bee Wah about that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Lee Bee Wah has also said that the penalties of $15,000 and 12 months' jail are too harsh.&nbsp; Let me just clarify that it is not imposed on top of the existing penalty.&nbsp; Basically, we just separated the levy restitution and, yes, we have stiffened that with a $15,000 fine and 12 months' jail, but, as I benchmark with other countries, as I have mentioned, it is not overly harsh.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Lee also asked why&nbsp;we need to return invalid work passes.&nbsp; The main reason is&nbsp;so that they would not be used for fraudulent purposes.&nbsp; The work pass has a premium in the market.&nbsp; Even if you disfigure it, people can still say that, "This is a work pass."&nbsp; So, that is the main purpose.&nbsp; It is a practical one.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Lee has asked whether&nbsp;MOM&nbsp;allows work permits to be used for workers in the construction sector to be used more generically.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have liberalised it.&nbsp; Previously, they were only allowed to work in one worksite.&nbsp; We have, firstly,&nbsp;liberalised that to say that they can&nbsp;work<p align=left>Column: 961<p> in any worksite.&nbsp; Secondly, MOM has liberalised it to say that, with the workers' consent, they can work for more than one employer.&nbsp; That is basically just to increase productivity, with the caveat that safety of the foreign worker is protected and that the foreign worker agrees to it himself.&nbsp; So, yes, we have liberalised it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now touch on the points which Prof. Thio Li-ann mentioned.&nbsp; Let me first thank Prof. Thio for that wonderful dissertation.&nbsp; That&nbsp;was a very useful lesson in legalities, and I was quite thankful I did not take up law.&nbsp; Medicine is much simpler - a patient is well, not well, alive.&nbsp; But it was a very useful thesis on how complex it is, and I take her point:&nbsp; how do we want to craft our legislation in this House, the Bills that we want to enact, how much discretion, what should be under judicial review, how much powers do we give, etc.&nbsp; These are weighty things which shape our society.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, let me assure Prof. Thio that the Controller will not withhold a work permit for someone because he does not like the colour of the hair.&nbsp; I have not, but, if you do know of any case, please let me know and I will act upon it,&nbsp;and subject&nbsp;to your review.&nbsp; But the purpose for excluding certain aspects&nbsp;from judicial review has its reasons.&nbsp; And, as Prof. Thio rightly pointed out, this Act is not the only one;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Immigration Act is an example of one&nbsp;where we have to protect certain national interests.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Thio has asked -&nbsp;I stand corrected but this is what I understood it&nbsp;- what can be excluded from judicial review.&nbsp; Our intention was that the Minister's and Controller's decisions relating to the issuance, revocation and suspension of work passes are excluded from judicial review in this scope.&nbsp; The actions outside the scope of section 7(6) are still subject to review, and that due<p align=left>Column: 962<p> process has been observed can be subjected to it.&nbsp; The reasons for this are obvious.&nbsp; Supposing we have information that someone might be engaging in suspicious activities, it&nbsp;may be hard to prove.&nbsp; They went through due process, they applied for the work permit, but, based on that information, I might not want to give it to that person.&nbsp; I can be subjected, if we do not have this rule that the issuance of the revocation can be subjected to judicial review.&nbsp; There are other circumstances.&nbsp; But this is not meant for frivolous use.&nbsp; There are specific aspects which we find that this is useful.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, Madam, let me thank Members again for their comments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
