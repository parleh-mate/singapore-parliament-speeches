<div align="center"><b>MR LOKE WENG CHEE</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align="center"><b>Tributes on Retirement</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Announcement by Mr. Speaker)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have to inform Hon. Members that Mr Loke Weng

Chee,  Clerk  of  the  Legislative Assembly, retired  from  its

service on the 18th day of May, 1965, on attaining the age limit

of  55  years. Mr Loke joined Government Service in early  1931

and  was in April 1947 drafted into the service of the Singapore

Legislature which he has served continuously from then until his

retirement. Mr Loke became Clerk of the Legislative Assembly in

March 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I first came to know Mr Loke as a Member of this House in

1959. I found him courteous and always willing to listen to  and

advise  those  seeking help. As Speaker, I found Mr  Loke  very

knowledgeable in matters concerned



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>



with  Parliamentary practice and procedure.  He  was  completely

dedicated to his work and to the fulfilment of the duties of his

post  as  Clerk  of  the  Assembly  in  the  best  Parliamentary

traditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall miss him but I console myself with the thought that he

has  left  behind  him  in the service of  the  Assembly  others

similarly imbued with a sense of dedication to duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I take this opportunity of wishing Mr, and Mrs Loke many

happy years of retirement.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, on

behalf  of  the  Government Benches, I would like  to  associate

ourselves with the sentiments you have expressed. Mr Loke  Weng

Chee, as Clerk of the Legislative Assembly, has led us through a

period  of Parliamentary and Constitutional development  in  the

history of Singapore. In this sense, therefore, his contribution

towards our Constitutional progress is considerable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Clerk of the Assembly, Mr Loke has to be correct in his

attitude, not only to Members on the Opposition Benches but also

to  Members  on the Government Benches. And from our observation

of  his  conduct in the affairs of the House, Mr Loke has  been

scrupulously  fair  to both sides. This, I am  quite  sure,  the

Prime  Minister  himself can attest to, as he has  been  on  the

Opposition  Benches  as well as being on the Government  Benches

today,  and  during  this  period Mr  Loke  was  Clerk  of  the

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, Mr Speaker, again to associate ourselves with

your  sentiments that Mr, and Mrs Loke enjoy a peaceful  and  a

happy  retirement, although knowing Mr Loke as we do,  that  he

looks  far  younger than his age, we believe he at  some  future

date could put himself to more active service in some other way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Huan Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Huan Boon (Bukit Merah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I, on

behalf  of  my colleagues, congratulate Mr Loke Weng Chee,  the

former  Clerk  of  this House, on the service  rendered  by  him

during the last 34 years?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although most of my colleagues, including myself, are new

to  this  House  in regard to many rules and procedures  of  the

Assembly, we did really have an interesting time with  Mr  Loke

during  the  last two years of his term of service. Besides  the

proficiency and high efficiency in his work, he is a man of fine

character,  without  prejudice  whatsoever.  He  has  been  very

friendly  and  fair to us, very patient with us, and  especially

has  been  very  helpful to me personally  whenever  I,  as  the

Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, called for a meeting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is therefore my sincere hope that any successor of Mr

Loke  will follow his example so that, through him, our opinions

can  be  freely lodged and discussed. And it is the Government's

responsibility to see that this fine tradition will flourish and

be preserved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, Mr Speaker, let me thank Mr Loke for his

assistance and guidance given to us during his time, and we wish

him to enjoy himself during the remaining years of his life.

<div align="center"><b>RESIGNATION OF MEMBER</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Announcement by Mr Speaker)</b></div>



<br><br>2.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is my painful duty to make this announcement to

this  House.  Ten minutes before I came into this  Chamber,  the

Member  for  Hong  Lim came into my Chambers  and  tendered  his

resignation   to   me  effective  as  from  today.   Under   the

Constitution and under the Standing Orders, my duty  as  Speaker

is clear; I accepted his resignation.



But  while discussing the matter of his resignation, the  Member

for  Hong  Lim  suggested to me that I read out  the  letter  of

resignation  which  he has sent to me. It is  a  fairly  lengthy

document  and  it  contains a number of  matters  which  do  not

concern  me as Speaker of this Assembly. I told this to Mr  Ong

Eng  Guan.  I  told him that it was no part of  my  function  as

Speaker  of this House to read out or to acquaint the  House  of

the  reasons for his resignation. He has other courses  open  to

him    which,    no   doubt,   he   will   avail   himself    of

.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand from the Clerk that under the previous

Constitution,  it was necessary for the Speaker  to  report  the

vacancy  to His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara,  but  the

present  Constitution is silent on this. So no doubt the  proper

authorities will take the proper procedure at the proper time.

<div align="center"><b>WOODBRIDGE HOSPITAL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Vacancies of Junior Hospital Attendants)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for Health when the

ruling  of  the Industrial Arbitration Court, that vacancies  of

Junior  Hospital  Attendants at Woodbridge  Hospital  should  be

filled, will be implemented.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Sia Kah Hui) (for the Minister for Health):</b> I am replying on behalf of the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the ruling of the Industrial Arbitration

Court made on 20th August, 1964, that all remaining vacancies of

Hospital Attendants at Woodbridge Hospital should be filled  not

later  than  31st  October, 1964, was duly  implemented  by  the

Ministry.   It  should  be  stated,  however,  that  whilst   no

difficulty  was encountered in filling 19 vacancies  for  males,

there  are  still  7  vacancies for female Hospital  Attendants,

although  40 were selected out of 237 applications  to  fill  14

vacancies. This situation arose either through refusal  to  take

up offers of appointment after selection, or resignation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has now initiated a second recruitment exercise

for  the  filling  of  these  7  vacancies  of  female  Hospital

Attendants.

<div align="center"><b>IN GEYLANG SERAI</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  whether the Government has any project to  demolish

Malay houses in the Geylang Serai area and replace them with  an

expanded housing programme.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I answer on behalf of my

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, the Government has at the moment no plans for

expanding  the  Geylang Serai development or  any  intention  to

demolish  the  Malay houses in the Geylang Serai area.  However,

where  new  unauthorised houses are found, action for demolition

will be taken.

<div align="center"><b>IN GEYLANG SERAI</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  whether applications from the Malay  community  for

Housing Board flats in Geylang Serai will be given preference.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> The Government has already reserved one

block  of  83  flats  for  sale to  the  newly  formed  Sharikat

Berkerjasama2  Perumahan Kebangsaan Singapura dengan  Tanggongan

Berhad. This Society will allocate the flats to eligible  Malays

who wish to purchase the flats for their own occupation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the objective of the Government in this plural society to

get  the people to mix as much as possible, and since one  block

has  already  been reserved exclusively for Malays,  no  further

preference will be given to them in allocation of Geylang  Serai

flats.

which is divided into four phases. Three phases have already

been implemented, but the fourth phase, which is related to the

<div align="center"><b>LAND ACQUISITION BILLS</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Law)</b></div>



<br><br>2.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

Members will recollect that in June last year we introduced  two

complementary Bills to amend the law relating to the acquisition

of  land  for  public purposes. The Land Acquisition (Amendment)

Bill, which was taken through on a Certificate of Urgency, froze

the  position  of appeals pending the enactment  of  substantial

alterations   to  the  law  embodied  in  the  Land  Acquisition

(Amendment  No.  2)  Bill,  which was  referred  to  the  Select

Committee for study.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main provision in the Land Acquisition (Amendment No. 2)

Bill  is to ensure that increases in land values as a result  of

public  development  should not benefit the  owner,  but  should

benefit  the  community at large. The Bill  aimed  to  save  the

Government  from having to give land-owners windfall  gains  and

increases in value as a result of public expenditure incurred in

the  area. Since the Bill was introduced into the House, further

consideration   has  been  given  to  the  problems   of   urban

redevelopment, and, in particular, to the pressures from private

developers on the old squatter settlements in the urban and

semi-urban  areas. Unable to evict squatters and tenants  because  of

the  freezing  of certain clauses of the Control of  Rent  Ordinance,  private  developers  are finding  it  profitable  to  pay

compensation  to  squatters to move out of the areas  they  have

been living in for many years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A social problem is created in that quite a number of these

communities, after taking compensation, have moved out into  the

outer  rural  areas, adding to the Government's difficulties  in

providing  water,  electricity, roads, rails  and  other  social

amenities at high cost in remote areas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now proposed that where private development necessitates

the  removal of these old established kampongs in the urban  and

semi-urban  areas,  the  Government should  have  the  power  to

acquire  a  portion of the land sufficient for  enough  low-cost

housing  units  to be put up to re-house families  of  Singapore

citizens who have been there since 1958. In this way, when urban

re-development  takes place, all sections of the community  will

share  in  the advantages of re-development. In order that  such

schemes can be practicable and do not become prohibitive in cost

to  the Government, compensation rates for the acquisition of  a

portion of the land for re-housing should take into account what

the developers would have had to pay these squatters to move out

into  other  areas,  and the fact that the  Government  will  be

undertaking the responsibility not only of low-cost housing  for

all  citizens regardless of their race, but also in the case  of

Malays  who are Singapore citizens and whose family incomes  are

less than $200 per month, or perpetual subsidy of 20 per cent of

the rent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The State Advocate-General's Chambers have looked into these

matters and have advised that, in order to remove any doubts  on

the  validity of this new legislation, it will be necessary  for

the  Malaysian  Parliament  to  exempt  such  a  Bill  from  the

operation  of  Article  13 of the Constitution,  which  provides

that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`no law shall provide for the compulsory acquisition or use of

property without adequate compensation.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representation will be made to the Central Government for such

an exemption provision to be passed in Parliament in order that

these projects can be carried out in Singapore without any

uncertainty about the constitutional validity of the formula for

compensation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, it may be relevant to note that the Indian

Government, when faced with a similar problem in connection with

their plans for land reform, had to effect a constitutional

amendment to a corresponding provision in the Indian

Constitution in order that their land reforms could be implemented.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Government's intention to re-introduce this Bill

after  the  necessary additional provisions have been added  for

acquisition  of land under private developers for re-housing  of

squatters  who are Singapore citizens and have been there  since

1958. If the Government were to carry the responsibility of

re-housing  squatters  arising out of private  development  without

being  held to ransom by private landlords, then we must  ensure

that  land  acquired  for public projects  can  be  obtained  at

economic  cost so that the private landlord, while he  does  not

lose,  would  not gain any windfalls as a result  of  Government

development   expenditure   and  because   the   Government   is

undertaking the burden of public re-housing of their  encumbered

land.  Increase  in value attributable to public expenditure  in

laying  sewers, roads and supplying community facilities in  the

area  should  not  go into the pockets of a few land-owners  who

have  done  nothing to add to the value of the land, hut  should

accrue to the State for the benefit of the whole community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government expects to re-introduce the

Bill  with necessary amendments at the appropriate time  at  the

next sitting of the Legislative Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak (Tampines)</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member wishes to ask any question arising

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister would like to answer that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, while we say we are looking after the  squatters'

interest,  we,  in  fact,  mean that  we  would  not  allow  the

landowner   just   to  turf  out  the  squatters   without   any

compensation. The Government itself is paying compensation. That

is what is meant.

<div align="center"><b>BARISAN EXPRESS CRITICISES SPEAKER'S RULING</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I wish to draw your attention,

Mr  Speaker, and the attention of the House to an article which

was printed in the Barisan Express dated 12th of June, 1965. The

article  states briefly that they had intended to move  at  this

sitting of the Assembly a motion which reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this House resolves that the Government of Singapore

should  urge the Central Government in Kuala Lumpur  to  achieve

honourable   peace   in  North  Borneo  and  Malaya, including

Singapore, on the principles as stated below:'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1), (2) and so on. And the article goes on to read as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`What the motion propounds is the correct way to settle the

Malaysia issue in order to free the people from imperialist rule

and  realise a peaceful, prosperous, independent and  democratic

society.  However, the day before yesterday, the Assemblyman  of

our  Party [that is, the Barisan Sosialis] received a note  from

the  Clerk  of  the  Assembly stating that the  motion  was  not

allowed  by the Speaker to be tabled for debate. The reason  is,

it  criticises  the resolution of the House on the  question  of

Malaysia and merger, and discusses internal matters which affect

other territories outside Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before receiving the letter, comrade Assemblyman Chia Thye Poh

of  our  Party  [that is, the Barisan Sosialis  Party]  saw  the

Speaker  to  express his views about whether or not  the  motion

should  be allowed to be debated. According to comrade Chia,  as

regards the question of criticising Malaysia



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>



and  the  bogus  merger, the fact is that if any  constitutional

arrangement  or  any ordinance which is dissatisfactory  to  the

people  and  has proved to be extremely disadvantageous  to  the

people,  the  Legislative  Assembly should  suggest  and  review

revision,  repeal  such  as in the case  of  the  former  Rendel

Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the motion which involves the matters of other

territories,  it  is  because  Malaysia  includes  North  Borneo

territories.  So  it is impossible that what  happens  in  North

Borneo  will  not  affect Singapore at  all.  Such  measures  as

conscription and increased taxation are clear proofs.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The article goes on to criticise that, because of the Standing

Orders,  7  days' notice being required before a motion  can  be

moved  in  the  Assembly, the Barisan Sosialis  Assemblymen  complained that they did not have adequate time in which to present

any  revised  version of the motion which they had presented  to you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two points, Mr Speaker, arising out of this article.

The  first point is that it is critical of the Speaker's ruling.

Whether  this  criticism  of  the  Speaker's  ruling  should  be

published  beforehand, before this Assembly meets, or should  be

discussed  in this Chamber is to be judged a breach of privilege

or  even  a  reprimand of the Speaker, I leave it  to  you,  Mr

Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the proper procedure, if that is

the case, is for a Member from the Government benches or anybody

who is complaining to move a motion to that effect, and leave it

to me, as Speaker, to decide whether I will allow that motion to

be  debated  without  proper notice. I think  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister should not go any further than he has actually done. It

is  possible under our Standing Orders to do that. If the  House

will  bear  with  me for a minute, I will give them  the  proper

reference.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under Standing Order 10

(1) (s) :

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Motions, with or without notice, complaining of a breach of

privilege or affecting the powers and privileges of the Assembly

or relating to a report of the Committee of Privileges.'



<br><br>will  come after business motions moved by Ministers. The Leader

of  the  House  was  drawing your attention to  this  particular

report. Meanwhile, Mr Speaker,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  a  formal motion is being prepared to be moved immediately

after  business  motions have been moved by Ministers  in  order

that  the matter can be properly debated in this House. I  think

it is important that such criticism of the ruling of the Speaker

in  an  article  published in a Barisan journal, the  editor  of

which  is  a  Member of this Assembly, should  receive  adequate

publicity not just in Barisan Express, which is somewhat limited

in  circulation,  but  in the more popular  channels  of  public

communication.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> May I direct the attention of the House to the

Standing  Orders  relating to the Committee of Privileges  which

appear  on  pages 44, 45 and 46 of the Standing Orders?  Now,  I

should  imagine that the circumstances delineated by the  Deputy

Prime Minister would come under paragraph 92 (7) (d) (ii) :



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Such a motion may be moved without notice if the Speaker is

satisfied  that the matter raised does, prima facie, affect  the

powers and privileges of the Assembly and has been raised at the

earliest opportunity.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that if the motion is moved at the appropriate time and if

the  mover of the motion satisfies the Speaker that there  is  a

prima  facie  case and that the matter has been  raised  at  the

earliest possible opportunity, then the mover of the motion will

be  allowed to speak on it. No motion will be put to the  House,

but  it will stand adjourned to the Committee of Privileges  for

determination  by  this Committee. Is the  position  made  quite

clear to Members?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Very well.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> May I carry on, Mr Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, Dr Toh, provided you do not now touch upon

the matters of which you are complaining, you may do so. But  if

you are going to in any way introduce them, I think it might  be

somewhat  premature. I suggest that we leave it till the  proper

time      when      the     mover     moves     the      motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I bow to your ruling, Mr Speaker, Sir. One

of  my colleagues will move the motion relating to the breach of

privilege at the proper time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But will you permit me to proceed to the second point which I

have raised? The second point in the article complains that  the

Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen do not have adequate time to put in

any motion at all to the Legislative Assembly for debate because

of the existing Standing Orders. Here, I would like very much to

clarify to the House, and to the public in general, and  to  the

Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen in particular, that if they had any

real intention to move or debate any particular motion or to ask

any  questions  in  this House, there was  adequate  time.  They

complain in this article that this Assembly has not met for  the

last  five months. They had five months in which they could have

presented  to  this  House any motion which they  thought  worth

while debating or could have asked any questions. How could they

say  in  this  same  article, in one and the same  breath,  that

because  under Standing Orders seven days' notice  at  least  is

required  before a private Member can ask questions  or  move  a

motion they did not have adequate time? I can only conclude that

Barisan  Sosialis Assemblymen are slow-witted or  they  have  no

intention  at all to bring up any serious matter for discussion.

Therefore, the allegations which they have made in this  article

are utterly pernicious, false and incomprehensible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

would like to speak in reply to the Deputy Prime Minister ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have already indicated to the House that

there is no right of reply and there is no right to debate on  a

Ministerial statement. But the Member is at liberty to  ask  any

number  of  questions he likes provided they arise  out  of  the

Ministerial  statement.  So  if  the  Member  will   frame   his

questions, perhaps we might get on with

it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now the Deputy Prime

Minister in his Ministerial statement said that an article in

the Barisan Sosialis paper made false allegations with regard to

some points. Now, which particular points? Can he make any

quotations? Is it not true with regard to the notice that seven

days' notice is required?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, the Standing Orders have been

published, copies have been issued to Members of this  Assembly,

and the public knows what the Standing Orders are all about.  If

Members  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis  had  any  real  or  serious

intention  - and if they had their wits about them or they  were

sufficiently intelligent enough - to move a motion for debate in

this House, they had five months in which to do it!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do they complain that they do not have adequate time to

present  a motion? It is true that the Standing Orders say  that

private  Members must give a minimum of seven days' notice.  But

that  did not prevent the Barisan Sosialis from submitting their

motions  a month ago. What were they doing during the last  five

months?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, from what the

Deputy  Prime  Minister has said, one can see that  he  has  not

explained  which particular part in the article of  the  Barisan

Sosialis is false. He has tried to give the impression that  the

article  in the Barisan was untrue. But he has not been able  to

give  examples and quotations of the untruths. Is it not a  fact

that  he  is deliberately using the privilege in this  House  to

create  an impression with the public against the ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b>

Order. I told the Member on the Opposition side that this  is  a

Ministerial statement from the Government Benches and that  they

may  ask  questions  with  no comments  on  the  statement.  Any

questions  relevant to the statement with a view to finding  out

facts  or  showing to the Minister that he is  mistaken  in  the

Statement  are  permissible. But no comments  on  the  statement

other than those questions, please. Have you finished, Mr  Chia

Thye Poh?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>



Perhaps  you would like to repeat the question? I did not  quite

follow it myself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Deputy Prime Minister has

said that

there  are  certain  paragraphs in the Barisan  article  to  the

effect  that the Assembly have not sat for a few months.  Is  it

not a fact?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, maybe I can be of some

assistance to the Member on the other side. I think  he  may  be

under  some  misapprehension that the Standing  Orders  of  this

Assembly  are  like those of the Parliament in Kuala  Lumpur.  I

sympathise  with the Member for Jurong, because in Kuala  Lumpur

if  his  motion  does  not come up for debate  on  a  particular

sitting of Parliament, it disappears from the Order Paper at the

next sitting. But I can assure him that in this Assembly, if for

any  reasons his motion is not reached at this sitting, it  will

be   carried  forward  on  the  Order  Paper  and  will  receive

precedence  and  pride  of  place in the  next  sitting  of  the

Legislative  Assembly.  Whatever he  raises  either  by  way  of

question  or  by way of motion, will be debated. It  will  never

lapse into the limbo of unasked questions and unmoved motions as

happened  to  him,  with so much of our  sympathy  with  him  in

Parliament.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, it is regrettable

that the Prime Minister has not answered my question. Instead he

refers to the Parliament in the Central Government. I was asking

whether it is not a fact that the Assembly have not sat for half

a year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is the point which my colleagues was

trying to make. Had the Member moved a single motion or a single

resolution,  we  would have summoned the Assembly  forthwith  to

debate it. I will give him this offer, Mr Speaker, Sir, It  is

seriously given now. If he would table any resolution now, today

before  4  o'clock,  we will meet here this time  next  week  to

debate  his  motion. I give him this categorical  assurance.  We

never run away from our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>



opponents.  Maybe in Parliament they are shy  of  him,  but  not

here. We are not. Table it before four.

<br><br>3.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to introduce a Bill intituled "An Ordinance

to  amend  the  Pineapple Industry Ordinance, 1957  (No.  15  of 1957)."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have here a Certificate of Urgency signed by the Yang

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate of Urgency handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I hand in to the Clerk His Excellency's

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Would you take your seat for a while, Mr

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill read the First time



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I would like to draw the Minister's attention to

Article  79  of  the Constitution of Malaysia,  which  reads  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) Where it appears to the presiding officer of either House

of Parliament or of the Legislative Assembly of any State that a

Bill  or  an  amendment to a Bill proposes a change in  the  law

relating  to  any  of the matters enumerated in  the  Concurrent

List, or to any of the matters enumerated in the State List with

respect  to  which  the  Federation is exercising  functions  in

accordance  with  Article  94, he  shall  certify  the  Bill  or

amendment for the purposes of this Article.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A Bill or amendment certified under this Article shall not

be  proceeded  with  until four weeks  have  elapsed  since  its

publication, unless the presiding officer, being satisfied  that

the  State  Governments,  or as the case  may  be,  the  Federal

Government, have been consulted, allows it to be proceeded  with

on the ground of urgency.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the position is this. The Bill has now been presented to

this Assembly. It requires my certification as Speaker that  the

Bill relates to a matter enumerated in the Concurrent List.  The

Bill  deals  with such a matter, and I certify  that  this  Bill

relates to a matter enumerated in the Concurrent List.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having certified that, the provisions to subclause (2) now

arise  and  as  the Minister - as I understand it  -  wishes  to

proceed with the Bill on a Certificate of Urgency today, he will

have  to  satisfy  me  that  the  Federal  Government  has  been

consulted  on this matter so that I may be satisfied  and  allow

the Bill to proceed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Minister proceeds with the Second Reading, perhaps

he  will  satisfy  me  that  the  Federal  Government  has  been

consulted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Federal Government have

been  consulted and they have no objections to this  Bill  being

proceeded with under a Certificate of Urgency.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Very well, please proceed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typed copies of the Bill distributed to hon. Members.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>Second Reading</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill provides for

amendments to be made to the Pineapple Industry Ordinance, 1957,

in order to provide for the establishment of a marketing corporation  which  shall be responsible for the promotion,  management

and control of the marketing of canned pineapple.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation is to be set up by regulations under the

provisions  of  the  Ordinance which will provide  it  with  the

necessary  powers  for  carrying  out  the  said  purposes.  The

establishment  of  the Pineapple Industry Marketing  Corporation

was  among  one  of the recommendations made by a Commission  of

Inquiry  appointed in 1959 jointly by the Federal and  Singapore

Governments   following  a  crisis  in  the  Malayan   pineapple

industry.  The  Commission recommended the  establishment  of  a

marketing  corporation  in  order  to  handle  sales  of  canned

pineapple   on  behalf  of  the  packers  so  as  to   eliminate

competition among themselves and thereby introduce stability  in

the pineapple industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government has given careful thought and

consideration to the recommendation and is satisfied  that  such

an  establishment  would be of benefit  to  both  the  pineapple

industry and trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The functions of the corporation will be to promote, manage and

control the marketing of canned pineapple. For this purpose, the

proposed corporation will act as the sole marketing agent for

registered canners in the sales of canned pineapple. All

registered canners will be required to sell their canned

pineapples through the corporation which will fix minimum

prices. In this way, the corporation will be able to eliminate

unhealthy competition and price-cutting, as has often happened

in the past. It is generally believed that the establishment of

an orderly market will assist in creating confidence in Malayan

canned pineapple in overseas markets and enhancing the

reputation of the Malaysian product. Furthermore, the proposed

corporation will be able to overcome



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>



financial  difficulties of some canners during the slack  period

of  sluggish  sales at the end of each year by making  loans  to

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's interest in such a corporation is enhanced by the

fact  that  over 95 per cent of canned pineapples  produced  are

exported  through  Singapore. In  1964,  for  instance,  out  of

2,450,000 cases valued at $38½ million produced, 2,351,000 cases

valued  at $37 million were exported through Singapore. Although

Singapore's  share  of production of canned  pineapple  is  only

slightly  over  20  per cent, it is the seventh  most  important

commodity  in  Singapore's exports, in addition, there  are  two

canneries  in  Singapore  supporting employment  for  about  450

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The membership of the corporation will be confined to six

existing pineapple canneries: two in Singapore and four  in  the

States  of  Malaya,  including the newly  established  Pineapple

Cannery  of  Malaya,  Limited,  at  Pekan  Nanas,  Johore.   The

corporation  will be managed by its members and the Chairman  of

the Malayan Pineapple Industry Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government financial backing is required during the initial

running-in  period of the corporation so that it  may  be  in  a

position  to  assist  canners  as  mentioned  before.  For  this

purpose,  both  the  Central and Singapore Governments  have  to

underwrite  an  initial working capital guarantee  of  up  to  a

maximum  of  $2 million to the corporation through  the  Malayan

Pineapple Industry Board before the corporation can build up its

own  capital from members' subscriptions. The Central Government

has  already agreed to undertake 75 per cent of the  $2  million

guarantee  and the Singapore Government has agreed to underwrite

the  balance of 25 per cent or $½ million. The corporation  will

make  loans  to canners against stock of canned pineapples.  Any

monies borrowed by the Malayan Pineapple Industry Board will  be

a  debt  due  to the Singapore Government and shall be  a  first

charge on the assets of the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Central Government presented its amendment Bill to

Parliament and it was duly passed on 15th July, 1964. As trade



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>



and   industry   are  concurrent  subjects,  it  is   desirable,

therefore,  that Singapore should introduce parallel legislation

so  that  the  corporation can be established here  as  soon  as

possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the

Bill. -[Mr Lim Kim San]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read

a Third time and passed.

relating to the Committee of Privileges, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That an article in the Chinese language published in the issue

of the Barisan newspaper (Chen Sien Pao) of the 12th June. 1965,

criticising the ruling of Mr Speaker made on or about the 10th

day of June, 1965, in respect of a motion filed, in this

Assembly on the 7th day of June, 1965, by the Member for Jurong

and supported by the Member for Tampines, constitutes a breach

of privilege of the Assembly committed by the publishers,

printers and the editor of the said newspaper and the author of

the said article.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> May I have a copy of that motion?

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On the first part of the sub-clause whether there

is a prima facie case, I am satisfied that there is a prima fade

case  casting aspersions on the ruling of the Speaker.  But  the

second  point on which I wish to be satisfied is that the matter

is  raised  with due diligence. When did it first  come  to  the

mover's notice?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I obtained a copy of the said newspaper only

this morning, Mr Speaker, and I had it translated straightaway.

Chamber. So this was taken up at the earliest opportunity.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In view of what the mover of the motion has said,

I am satisfied that, prima facie, it seems to affect a matter of

privilege.  This, of course, is merely a prima facie ruling,  it

may  well  turn out not to be so. The mover of the  motion  has

satisfied  me  that  he has raised the matter  at  the  earliest

possible opportunity, he having only read it this morning.  That

being  the  case. Mr Deputy Prime Minister, you may  move  your

motion and speak on it, but it will not be put to the House  and

it will stand referred to the Committee of Privileges. The mover

need  not  speak on it, but if he wants to, he may.  I  am  just

acquainting him with his rights under the Standing Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think I want to

add anything more to what has been said, but I would like to say

this, for the purposes of clarifying this point. The Speaker  is

not  above  the  law,  and  if  any  Member  of  this  House  is

dissatisfied with the ruling of the Speaker, it is open  to  him

to  move  a substantive motion to criticise and reverse  such  a

ruling.  That  is the proper procedure. And it is  open  to  the

Member  for  Jurong.  We  are not trying  to  stifle  debate  or

argument, Mr Speaker, Sir, which is the imputation of the whole

tenor  of  that  article. The proper procedure in  any  debating

Chamber where



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>



the  Speaker's  ruling  is  not considered  satisfactory  or  in

accordance with the Standing Orders on Parliamentary practice is

for a substantive motion to be moved against such ruling.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I take it, Mr Deputy Prime Minister, that you do

not wish to speak on the motion?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> No.

<div align="center"><b>(AMENDMENT NO. 2) BILL</b></div>



Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the need for this Bill has arisen because of

a number of deficiencies in the administration of Part II of the

Local   Government  Integration  Ordinance  with  reference   to

streets, particularly with regard to the wholly  unsatisfactory

position  with  regard to the making up of  private  streets  in

housing  estates.  The  Bill  will  now  afford  a  measure   of

protection particularly to future purchasers of houses  in  that

they would have properly constructed access roads.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, let me deal with the question of public streets. Under

existing   provisions   in  the  Local  Government   Integration

Ordinance, the Director of Public Works may recover the cost  of

acquiring the land and the cost of construction when he has made

up  a new street. The amendment now proposed in clause 2 of  the

Bill  will  provide that, in addition to the making  up  of  new

streets, there should be powers to recover the costs in  respect

of   the  widening  or  improvement  of  a  public  street  from

frontagers. This is a necessary provision, as, in the past,  the

whole  cost of such street works has been at public expense.  It

is reasonable that Government should be in a position

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>



to  recover  costs from owners who have obtained  benefits  from

such  works.  This  power  will be  discretionary  and  will  be

exercised  only when owners have benefited, as  it  is  not  the

intention  that Government should recover costs  of  minor  road

widenings or improvements to public streets by the provision  of

footpaths,  drains, and so on. The power will be exercised  only

in  cases where road improvements have benefited frontagers  as,

for  example, in the case of road deviations whereby  tracts  of

land  hitherto without means of approach have now proper  access

to  a  public  street, arising from which an increment  in  land

value accrues to the owners. It is therefore equitable that such

owners should be called upon to bear a reasonable proportion  of

the costs of the road works.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are provisions in this Bill, Mr Speaker, concerning

private   developers  making  up  new  streets.  While   private

developers  are required to submit street plans to the  Director

for approval, the existing law does not empower the Director  to

ensure  that the street works actually constructed do, in  fact,

conform  to  the  approved plans and specifications.  Under  the

amendment  in clause 3 of the Bill, it will now be incumbent  on

the  person  whose  plan has been approved by  the  Director  to

construct the street in accordance with the plan approved.  This

will  ensure  that any road constructed will not be sub-standard

and  will not be unacceptable to the Public Works Department for

taking  over  as a public street. Cases of applications  to  the

Public  Works  Department for taking over of  private  roads  in

housing  estates are not infrequent, and many had to be rejected

on the grounds that they were below specifications. As a result,

purchasers  of  houses  in  such private  housing  estates  have

genuine  grounds for complaint, having been given to  understand

that  the  roads  would be constructed to proper  standards  and

would be taken over as public streets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new clause 5, Mr Speaker, Sir, will prohibit any person

from  commencing work on a new building having a frontage  on  a

private  street, until he has deposited an appropriate sum  with

the  Director for the making up of such private street. This  is

to guarantee that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>



street  works  will be constructed according to  approved  plan.

These  are  necessary powers to restrain unscrupulous developers

who  do  not carry out their obligations to build the  roads  or

will  build  only  sub-standard roads to the  detriment  of  the

purchasers. The procedure for obtaining the deposit will  be  by

way  of  a  notice from the Director of Public Works determining

the  amount  that is required for the execution  of  the  street

works  and the date by which such works shall be completed.  Any

person who is aggrieved by such an order may, within ten days on

receipt  of the order, appeal to the Minister. In the  event  of

street works not being commenced or executed satisfactorily, the

Director  may cause the street works to be carried out  and  the

cost  of  such  works shall be recovered from the deposit  made.

When  the  developer has completed the roads  satisfactorily,  a

refund of the deposit will be made. There is also provision  for

a  refund  of deposit, when, owing to circumstances, a developer

does  not  intend to proceed with the development and wishes  to

have his approval cancelled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has constantly received complaints that private

streets have been made impassable or extensively damaged because

of  the  development of housing estates. But under present  law,

the  repair of these public streets can only be carried  out  at

the  expense of the owners of premises fronting or abutting such

private  streets.  This is grossly unjust, as these  owners  are

being  called upon to pay for the repair of their private  roads

which have been rendered defective by the actions of persons  or

firms  who are not frontagers, such as private contractors whose

lorries  cause  damage to the foundations  of  private  streets.

Under  the  amendment proposed in clause  8  of  the  Bill,  Mr

Speaker, the Director may now serve notice to compel any person,

firm or company who has caused the damage to repair such private

streets. The Director may also serve notice to prohibit a person

from  making further use of a private street for the purpose  of

transporting building materials until a deposit has  been  made.

This amount of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>



deposit  will depend on the cost which would have to be incurred

to bring the road back into a usable condition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment proposed in clause 9 is consequential on the

amendments  proposed  in clause 5. The Chief  Building  Surveyor

will  now  be prohibited from approving the plan of  a  building

unless  the  new provisions relating to access to a  new  street

have been satisfied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr  Speaker, I support the amending Bill moved by the  Minister

for  National Development on the grounds that with this amending

Bill I am confident that the residents in kampongs, particularly

in  Kampong Kembangan, where there are factories and other small

industries, will not be faced with difficulties due to roads and

drains  which have been damaged as a result of work carried  out

by contractors of such firms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, before elaborating further on this amending Bill,

I  would like to draw the attention of the Minister for National

Development -  and I would like an explanation from him - to  clause

2 regarding the provision that the "Director may recover cost of

new  street or of widening, opening, - etc. of public street."  If

this  is implemented, I believe that towkays, such as the M.C.A.

towkays, owning brick houses, will have no financial difficulty.

But   what   happens  if  this  clause  affects  the  semi-urban

residents,  especially  those in the Kampong  Kembangan

area  - Lorong  Marican,  Lorong  Marzuki,  Lorong  Maideen,

and  other lorongs?  In this area, the properties are owned

by  Malays  who have inherited them and they are wage-earners

whose incomes  are barely  enough  to  feed their families.

And some  of  them  are retired Government servants who have

bought such properties with their  gratuities. I think such

frontagers, as I  have  referred to, will not be able to pay

for the cost of widening the roads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If my memory serves me right, Mr Speaker, Sir, the roads in

Lorong Marican, Lorong Marzuki, Lorong Melayu,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>



Jalan Masjid, and other lorongs have been included in the scheme

of  making  up of new roads in the areas referred to  under  the

Local  Government Integration (Amendment) Bill, because the  residents  concerned are apprehensive. I am anxious to know whether

the  Government will proceed with such a scheme and whether  the

frontagers  will  be exempted from having to  pay  the  cost  of

making up such roads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to explain my support of the

amendments.  I  support them because this will ensure  that  the

users   of   private   roads   will   not   damage   the   roads

indiscriminately as mentioned in clause 8.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Kampong Kembangan, Mr Speaker, it can be said that all the

roads have been damaged by the lorries owned by contractors  and

timber merchants for the transportation of sand, and so on.  The

heavy  loads  of earth have resulted in the roads in  this  area

being  extensively  damaged. When these  roads  cannot  be  used

further,  they use the by-roads. For this reason, all the  roads

in  and  around  Kampong Kembangan are in a state of  disrepair.

When  the Government steps in and repairs the roads the  process

starts  again. The roads begin to be damaged, as in the case  of

Jalan  Damai. In the Malay settlement in Jalan Eunos, the  roads

have  been  built  by  the Government for  the  benefit  of  the

residents,  but lorries owned by contractors use the  roads  for

their transport ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We are now on the general principles of the Bill.

I  think  the  Member  is going too much into  details.  I  have

allowed  him to go into details in order to make his point.  But

having  made his point, I think he should leave the details  now

and get back to the principles of the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I am only

attempting to put the Minister in the picture as to the state of

disrepair  of  the roads in my area, which has  been  caused  by

lorries  used by contractors. The residents are obliged  to  ask

the  Government to repair such roads for the use of the  people.

But  when  the roads have been repaired, they are again damaged.

It means that the Government is forever



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>

incurring  people's money on these roads. Also for this  reason,

Mr  Speaker, there are many other roads which are in a  similar

state,  like  those which I have mentioned just  now.  Likewise,

Jalan Tebu, Jalan Melayu, Jalan Ladang and other roads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Mr Speaker, is this. I hope, after the Bill is

passed,  that the Minister concerned will see that  the  damaged

roads are repaired for the benefit of the local residents.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, I do not think I need spend much

time in replying to this. The Member is supporting the principle

of  the  Bill, and that is to prevent abuses by contractors  who

use   private  roads  without  consideration.  As  regards   his

suggestion that the Government should spend some more  money  in

repairing roads, that will be looked into by the Urban and Rural

Services Consultative Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the

<div align="center"><b>WILD ANIMALS AND BIRDS BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to re-enact the existing Wild

Animals  and  Birds Ordinance which was enacted as far  back  as

1904,  with  amendments. This Bill consists of  two  parts,  the

first of which concerns the protection and preservation of  wild

life  in  Singapore, while the second part concerns the  import,

transhipment and export of wild animals and birds.  It  is  more

than  half a century since the first Ordinance was enacted,  and

with  rapid  social and economic development,  the  decline  and

reduction  of  wild  life  in  Singapore  has  been  inevitable.

Although wild life is no longer of significant importance in our

State, we should all the same do whatever we can to protect  and

preserve wild animals and birds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of this Bill, Mr Speaker, Sir, is of greater

importance, as Singapore is strategically situated in the region

of  South-East Asia where wild life is abundant. A large  number

of  captured wild animals and birds are being channelled through

Singapore  for  export to distant destinations like  Europe  and

America. Many of the wild birds and animals in this region,  for

example,  the  Orang Utan and the Bird of Paradise,  are  facing

extinction due to indiscriminate hunting and killing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many governments in this region as well as international bodies

concerned  with  the preservation of wild life are  agreed  that

steps must be taken to prevent the extinction of wild life,  and

the Singapore Government has from time to time been requested to

assist  in  the  prevention  of this  illegal  traffic  in  wild



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>



animals  and birds and to discourage indiscriminate hunting  and

killing  of  these  animals in their natural habitat.  Once  the

illegal  traffic  is  conscribed,  it  would  be  difficult  and

unprofitable for those engaged in these pursuits to carry on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government agrees that wild life in this region

should be protected and preserved. However, in the past, it  has

been  difficult to implement any effective measures  to  prevent

and discourage illegal traffic in wild animals and birds due  to

the  lack of sufficient legislative powers and we have not  been

able to assist effectively other governments in this region  and

international  organisations concerned with the preservation  of

wild life. This Bill now provides the Government with the powers

to  remedy this defect and will contribute significantly towards

international efforts in the preservation and protection of wild

life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps, for the information of the Minister, I

had  better make the position quite clear. This again is a  Bill

affected by Article 79 of the Constitution of Malaysia. The Bill

has  lain  in the Assembly for four weeks. It complies with  the

first  part  of  the Section. Now, there are certain  amendments

which   are  proposed  and  those  amendments  appear   in   the

Supplement, and I am satisfied that those amendments are not  of

a substantive nature. They are merely amendments of a minor character perhaps intended to bring out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>



better  the meaning of the clauses without in any way adding  to

or  altering  the  sense of the Bill. Am  I  right  in  that  assumption, Mr Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker, Sir. But I do not propose to

make the amendments to this Bill now.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Oh, you are not? I beg your pardon. I am so

sorry.  That is the Feedstuffs Bill. The only amendment then  to

this  Bill  is  one of leaving out "1964" and inserting  "1965",

which  is  a  matter of course rather than of amendment.  As  no

notice  of  amendment has been received to this Bill and  unless

Members wish to speak on any particular clause, I will take  the

Bill as a whole.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.04 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to control the quality of feeding

stuffs for animals and birds. Not many years ago when our

livestock industry was in its infancy, farmers merely fed their

livestock with whatever feeding materials they could lay their

hands on and mixing and cooking them in the farmyard. Such

methods of feeding were without regard to the nutritional value

of the feeding stuffs, and the farmers did not have the benefit

of scientific techniques of controlled feeding to determine the

growth rate and the quality of the meat produced. But in order

to achieve more efficient production, it is necessary to ensure

that better animal feed rations are prepared on a scientific

basis so that the optimum conversion from food to meat can be

attained. Our farmers have realized this and have gone a long

way in the utilization



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>



of specially prepared animal feedstuffs. A number of our

enterprising citizens have set up factories to produce well

balanced animal feed rations on a scientific basis for sale to

our farmers. The manufacture and supply of feeding stuffs to our

farmers is a flourishing business employing many people. It is

estimated that the amount of animal feeds that are consumed in

Singapore is well over $100 million annually. The time has now

come for some form of Government control to be exercised over

the quality of feedstuffs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without any system of control there is bound to be, in such a

thriving industry, unscrupulous persons who produce animal feeds

which are well below the declared standards, or, what is worse,

which may contain harmful materials that may cause illness and

disease to the animals and birds. There is the possibility that

properly compounded animal feeds may be adulterated during the

process of storage, handling, and transport by distributors or

agents before these feeds are sold to the farmers. There have

been instances where feed-millers as a result of ignorance

included materials in the manufactured feeds which have caused

bad effects on livestock.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore desirable that a system of control should at

this stage be introduced by the Government on the manufacture of

feeding stuffs in order to protect the farmer from frauds and to

guarantee him the availability of good quality products. It is

also necessary to protect feedstuff producers and distributors

against any unscrupulous practices which may upset the normal

conditions of competition. Control of the quality of the

feedstuffs will give the farmer the right to know the precise

quantity, the nature of the ingredients and the type of feeding

stuffs suitable for particular types of livestock.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of this Bill will ensure proper standards of

quality to be prescribed for animal feeds. Stockfeed

manufacturers will then be able to expand their sales by

exporting to overseas markets with the support of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>



official documents provided by the Singapore Government to

certify the standards of their products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has set up an Animal Nutritional Unit to

investigate into the utilisation of locally available animal

feeding materials and to formulate balanced rations for

livestock. The results will be published from time to time for

the benefit of farmers and stockfeed manufacturers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support

the Government for introducing the Feedstuffs Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government can be sure that such a move wins the all-round

support of the farmer population in Singapore, and this goes to

show that the Government has the interests of the farmers at

heart. Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Minister for National

Development has pointed out, the purpose of this Bill is to

control the manufacture of feedstuffs which are locally

manufactured to ensure that, when consumed by poultry or

animals, they will not bring ill-consequences to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, some time ago, when the price of animal feeds

and feed concentrates for the manufacture of feedstuffs shot up

for obvious reasons, some feedstuffs manufacturers attempted to

increase the price of such feeds. This attempt was vigorously resisted by the farmers. Some farmer representatives from my

constituency met me and pointed out that if the proposed price

increase was to be instituted, many of them, if not all, would

go bankrupt. They alleged that they were already suffering from

the decrease in egg price on the market. The slump had brought

about a sharp decrease in the local egg price. Many farmers

alleged that some of our feedstuff manufacturers produced a

poorer quality of feedstuffs when the proposed price increase in

feedstuffs was postponed. Consequently many poultry died, and

also the eggs that were specially selected



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>



for  hatching purposes did not hatch.  They  had  to  be

pushed on to the market. Mr Speaker, Sir, on this point, I seek

the  privilege of this Chamber. With the sharp increase in local

egg production, plus the unhatched eggs on the market, the local

egg   price  has  decreased  sharply,  thereby  threatening  the

livelihood  of many farmers. Fortunately, steps have been  taken

by  the  Government Departments concerned to remedy this serious

situation, and I can proudly say that it has been remedied to  a

certain extent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure that with the subsequent

legislation  of the Feedstuffs Bill, the farmer  population  of

Singapore  can  be sure of being provided with feedstuffs  of  a

suitable quality for their poultry as a whole and they can  have

no   fear  of  their  poultry  perishing  due  to  poor  quality

feedstuffs.  Without  proper control  over  the  manufacture  of

feedstuffs, they may be driven to financial difficulties if  the

feedstuffs manufactured are of poorer quality. Therefore, to sum

up,  I  say  that this Bill is going to benefit each  and  every

farmer in Singapore.



<br><br>4.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, as

this Feedstuffs Bill affects the livelihood of the farmers - and I

am  quite conversant with their conditions - I would like to say

a few words on this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Minister and the Backbencher who spoke just

now, it seems as if this Bill can resolve all the problems

confronting the farmers and can look after the interests of the

farmers. But in my view, the passage of this Bill perhaps may

lead to a situation where the farmers will be burdened with more

problems. In actual fact, the provisions of the Bill do not

clearly provide anything to safeguard the interests of the

farmers. I would like to give my views on these two points. I

hope my views will help the Government to implement something

that will not contribute anything adverse to the farmers. From

my point of view, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P. Government has not done anything good for the farmers of

Singapore. For instance, if this Bill were passed, I hope that

the situation in future can be somewhat better if feedstuff

manufacturers have to get licences for their business and if

there are brands and labels for their products. This process can

be carried out through the Primary Production Department. In

this respect, perhaps the Department concerned may or may not

cause delay or any inconvenience to the farmers concerned. If

there is any inconvenience, then the farmers will have to incur

more expenses. I hope that the passage of this Bill will remove

all anomalies that have existed in the past. For instance, the

Bill provides that there should be certain components to make up

the feedstuffs. But if the Bill provides also for the percentage

of the components of the feedstuffs and the ingredients to be of

a stipulated quality and quantity, then this will be to the

good. And there should also be provisions as to the labelling of

such products. Now, the manufacturers concerned, I think, are

well prepared. They are well aware of the situation. For instance, a few months ago the farmers of Singapore and those in

the business of hatching chickens suffered greatly because of

certain inferior feedstuffs These were adulterated with cotton

seeds, thus leading to the deterioration of the condition of the

chickens. Although there is a high protein content in cotton

seeds, there are poisonous ingredients. So, as a result, when

chickens feed on this, the eggs would not hatch, and the egg

content ---

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Member is, in fact, supporting the

Bill. I think he is trying to make the point that this Bill must

be passed!

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Please press

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Member has any point to make, he

must make it to the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): What I wish to say is that

the Bill will not give any complaint to the farmers. As far as I

know,  cotton  seeds  are  still  being  incorporated  into  the

feedstuffs by some of the present manufacturers. So the  adverse

effect is still there. It is an open secret, because it is quite

a good business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to provide in the Bill a

formula  of  the components of the ingredients of the feedstuffs

and  a  scientific table, and so on, in order to  help.  If  the

Government  can  tabulate  all these  and  give  the  feedstuff

manufacturers  a  certain standard to abide by, stipulating  the

percentages  of  components and ingredients  in  regard  to  the

manufacture   of  feedstuffs,  then  it  will   eradicate   the

malpractices.  This is also good for the chickens,  because  the

protein  content will also be maintained. If the  Government  is

not able to do that, and there are any losses and harm done,  it

is  only  the farmers who will suffer. And if the inspectors  of

the  department concerned are lax in their duty in investigating

the  situation, then the farmers will also suffer. So I hope the

Minister  will look well into this. Do not think  that  by  just

enumerating  a few clauses in the Bill, he can resolve  all  the

problems  and help the farmers. That is my view and I  hope  the

Minister will look well into it.

whole, he agrees that this legislation is to improve the feeding

stuffs  that are manufactured in Singapore, and that it  is  for

the  benefit of the farmers, though, as usual, he always  starts

with the proposition that the

He  starts with the proposition that the P.A.P. has done nothing

for the farmers during the last five years. Since he says he  is

in  close  touch  with the farmers, he should know  that  during

these five years we have not only been breeding chickens for our

own table, but we have also been breeding enough chickens for ex

port.  At the same time, he must know by now that we have enough

stud boars of good quality to give us better quality pork.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Mr Speaker, Sir, in general, he supports the

principle that this Bill should be pushed through, and I have no

other comments to make.

<div align="center"><b>ANIMALS BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



The present powers for the control and prevention of animal

diseases and animal movements in the State are found in the

Quarantine and Prevention of Disease Ordinance which was enacted

in 1939. This Ordinance is administered by two authorities, the

Ministry of Health with regard to human health, and the

Veterinary Division of the Ministry of National Development with

regard to animal diseases. With the growth of livestock

industries in the State over the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>

last  decade  and the increased flow of animal traffic  both  in

number  and frequency through Singapore, the legislative  powers

contained  in the Quarantine and Prevention of Disease Ordinance

are no longer adequate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this inadequacy, the veterinary authorities in

Singapore have to rely on other legislation such as the  Control

of  Imports and Exports Ordinance to carry out measures for  the

control  of  animal  diseases and the movement  of  animals  and

animal  products. However, even this remedy is found  inadequate

to deal with present-day problems of animal movements and animal

diseases.  In  addition,  new subjects such  as  improvement  of

livestocks,  the control of livestock products and  the  use  of

veterinary  drugs  and biologics are matters which  require  new

legislation and the close attention of Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore can take pride in the success and achievements in the

development  of  poultry and pig industries over  the  last  few

years.  It  is  common  knowledge that we  are  not  only

self-sufficient  in pigs, poultry and eggs, but we are also  able  to

produce  and export these items to our neighbouring territories.

We must not, however, be contented with this but should continue

to  find ways and means to lower the cost of production of  meat

and  meat  products in Singapore by improving the efficiency  of

production further. Among the things which we must do  in  order

to  achieve  this  objective is the control and  eradication  of

livestock  diseases.  Livestock  diseases  once  introduced   to

Singapore,  will  do  irreparable damage  to  the  livestock  in

dustries with consequential losses to our farmers. These  powers

provided  in  the  Bill now before the House  are  necessary  to

control and eradicate animal diseases. Regulations will be  made

and enforced to prevent the introduction of exotic diseases from

overseas,  to  control the movements of livestock and  to  treat

livestock diseases through the use of veterinary biologics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The control and eradication of animal diseases is also of

paramount importance to public health, as many such diseases are

communicable from animal to man.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are well aware of the danger of the transmission of rabies

from  dogs  to human beings. However, it is comforting  to  know

that Singapore has been free from rabies for more than 10 years.

We  must  ensure that this will continue, and to do so, constant

vigilance  and  strict enforcement of rules and  regulations  in

respect  of  movements  of  dogs  and  cats  is  required.   The

provisions  in  the  Animals and Birds  Bill  will  provide  the

necessary powers for this work to be carried out effectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prevention of cruelty to animals is at present administered

under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance which is of

1930 vintage. This subject has now been included as part of  the

Animals  and Birds Bill, and the existing Prevention of  Cruelty

to Animals Ordinance will be repealed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is at present, Mr Speaker, Sir, an Animals Ordinance for

the States of Malaya enacted in 1953. The Animals and Birds Bill

follows closely the substance as well as the format of the

Animals Ordinance of the States of Malaya. In the Animals

Ordinance of the States of Malaya, provisions have been made for

the Director of Veterinary Services to issue licences permitting

such licensees to treat animals or birds, to possess live

cultures or vaccines, and to inoculate animals or birds with

such cultures or vaccines. Similar provisions are included in

clauses 68 and 69 of the Animals and Birds Bill. These two

sections provide control over the use of dangerous veterinary

biologics and the registration and licensing of persons who use

them for the treatment of animals and birds. There is at present

no such control, and unscrupulous persons take advantage of the

ignorance of the farmers and with glib sales-talks persuade

these farmers to purchase veterinary biologics at exorbitant

prices for the treatment of diseases in their animals. Such

treatment usually does more harm than good. What is more

dangerous is that some of these veterinary biologies contain

live virus which may themselves cause the spread of diseases

among animals. Every effort must therefore be made to prevent

further exploitation of farmers and to safeguard livestocks and

public health.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The States of Malaya are at present contemplating the enactment

of a Veterinary Surgeons Act which will provide stricter control

over persons who are to engage in the treatment of animals.  The

position in Singapore is somewhat different from that of Malaya.

We have a much smaller number of veterinary surgeons and most of

them  are  in Government Service. The necessity for  a  parallel

Ordinance is not apparent. Clauses 68 and 69 of the Animals  and

Birds  Bill  are  adequate for the present  to  control  persons

treating  animals and birds and the use of veterinary  biologics

until  such  time  when  separate comprehensive  legislation  is

required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the carrying out of statutory functions

under  this  Bill,  the  Government  will  build  a  new  animal

quarantine station costing more than $1 million to be sited next

to  the  proposed new abattoir at Jurong. Details  of  this  new

animal  quarantine station have been finalised and  construction

work  is  expected  to  begin soon. In  addition,  a  veterinary

diagnostic laboratory has beeen planned during the last 2  years

to  conduct tests and examination of animals to be imported into

Singapore,  as  well as to carry out a systematic  programme  of

prevention  and eradication of livestock diseases in the  State.

The  first phase of the veterinary diagnostic laboratory costing

$100,000  has  been  completed  and  the  second  phase   of

development of the laboratory will be included in the next

Five-year Development Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Bill is a comprehnsive Bill for the control of

animals  and  animal diseases to meet the needs of  the  growing

livestock  industry in the State. In Committee, I will  propose,

Mr Speaker, Sir, an amendment to alter the title of the Animals

Bill to the Animals and Birds Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, in

introducing this Bill, as set out by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>



Minister, the Government aims mainly at the prevention of

animal diseases. But can the Government do so? I have great

doubts indeed. In the past, the P.A.P. has been bragging about

its efficiency in controlling diseases and the spread of

diseases. But up to date diseases are not truly under control.

Instead there is a spread of diseases in Singapore, as a result

of which many farmers have gone bankrupt. I think that many

farmers and poultry rearers have gone into bankruptcy mainly

because of the spread of diseases among their livestock on the

one hand, and, on the other hand, because of the marketing

difficulties. The marketing problems are not solved, the

diseases are not controlled, and so the farmers engaged in

poultry farming are gravely affected and they have lost

confidence in this industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of the Bill deals with the import and export

and transhipment of animals. I do not see anything in the second

part to make people believe that the Government is encouraging

the export of pigs and poultry, our pigs, our chickens and eggs

are enough for our own consumption, and there is a surplus for

export as well. That being so, we should find ways and means to

establish our overseas market for our livestock and eggs and

give facilities to the farmers. For example, the pigs and eggs

from the Federation are not enough for their own consumption,

and we can export to the Federation. We understand that

one-third of the production of eggs is exported to the Federation,

but there are difficulties arising that confront the farmers,

and they have to pay one cent on every egg exported to the

Federation. There is also a provision in the Bill to say that if

livestock is exported to the Federation of Malaya, then approval

and consent has to be obtained from the Malayan Veterinary

Authority. This again will give rise to some difficulties. There

is nothing in the Bill to say how the problems relating to

marketing are to be solved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the third part of the Bill, as far as I can see,

the main points are in clauses 19, 21, 22, 23 and 24. From the

contents of this particular



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>



section,  I  gather that its main intention is to authorise  and

empower  the  veterinary officer to conduct an examination  into

any  birds or animals suspected of disease. There should  be  no

dissension to this section, but what will be the effect  of  the

examination  conducted by the veterinary officer?  For  example,

there is one provision in this part to say that if the livestock

of  any farmer is suspected to have any diseases, then it is the

business  of  the  farmer  to send  the  livestock  to  a  place

appointed by the veterinary officer for cure or treatment or any

other necessary examination. On this point, my view is that this

is  not quite proper. For example, if a farmer has 50 pigs among

all  his pigs suffering from or suspected of any diseases,  then

you  will have to carry all the 50 pigs weighing, say, about  50

pounds or 50 katties each to a place appointed by the veterinary

officer. Now, if it is a matter of one or two pigs, it is not so

difficult. But if it comes to 50 pigs, then what about the  cost

of  transportation? Is it to be borne by the farmer  or  by  the

authority  concerned? If there are 50 pigs to be sent, then  at

least  two lorries will be required to convey them to the  place

appointed  by the officer concerned and this will give  rise  to

some difficulties, financially and physically ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Point of clarification, Mr Speaker.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of clarification? The Member will not give

way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I think the Parliamentary

Secretary  will  have time to talk later on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another provision in this Bill to say that exemption

may be granted to a farmer  living  three  miles  beyond  the  limit

and,  by  this exemption,  the  veterinary officer  will  send  an

officer  or somebody else to examine the livestock in question. In my  view,

I wonder whether the Government has given thought to the setting

up of a veterinary station within three miles of any farm in the

State to solve the problems of transporting animals suspected of

disease



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>



to  a  place  appointed by the veterinary officer. I think  more

veterinary centres should be set up to help the farmers. Clauses

21, 22 and 25 of the third part of the Bill relate to the points

I  have  raised. The main aim of those clauses is  that  if  the

veterinary  officer  thinks that any animals  or  livestock  are

found to have any diseases, he can not only examine such animals

but  also take steps to isolate or separate or even condemn them

when  necessary. He has even got the power to burn  the  chicken

runs  and  destroy  the  places in which the  farmer  keeps  the

animals suspected of any disease. The tools and other appliances

used in connection with the feeding of such animals may also  be

destroyed. So under such powers if a farmer comes to  know  that

the  veterinary officer is coming along to destroy his property,

he  is afraid that his own hut may be involved in the process of

destruction  and  so  he  will be deterred  from  reporting  any

disease  of the animals to the authorities concerned. We  cannot

deny  that  some farmers are conservative in their attitude  and

some  have common sense, and they will take their own  steps  to

cure the animals of their diseases instead of reporting them  to

the  authority concerned. All this is because they want to avoid

trouble and difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there is also a provision in the Bill in

connection  with any disease of an animal, but such  things  are

not  specified in the Bill. For example, if we have 50  chickens

among  hundreds of them affected by any disease. I do  not  know

whether  it is necessary for the farmer to send only the  50  or

all the chickens for examination. He may be worried about what

will happen to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 25 of the Bill concerns the infected areas. This clause

provides that animals suspected of any disease are not to  leave

the infected areas. There is no definition of the infected areas

or  boundaries defined for the infected areas. For  example,  in

Punggol,  there is a farmer rearing 3.000 chicks of  which  some

are affected by diseases. Then the rest of the chickens that  he

has  will  not be permitted to leave his place for  sale.  So  I

wonder whether the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>



infected areas include the whole area of Punggol or that

particular area in which the farmer lives. There is no

definition for the term "infected areas". If this term includes

the whole area of Punggol, then if it so happens that in this

particular area of Punggol there is a spread of one disease in

one farmer's family, then the other farmers will be affected in

that their chickens and pigs will not be allowed to leave the

Punggol area for sale in another area. Perhaps this lack of

definition of infected areas is an oversight. But it will give

rise to difficulties and fears on the part of farmers. In fact,

farmers do not know when their animals are affected by any

disease. They do not know under what conditions and circumstances they are not to move their animals out of the area

infected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we have already mentioned this point basically. It

may give rise to some undesirable side effects and they may be

termed the loopholes of this Bill. So how to eradicate and

prevent the diseases of animals? Has the Government given

thought to the employment of more veterinary officers or

surgeons? It is clear that a few veterinary centres are not

enough to carry out the provisions of this Bill. I would suggest

that it should be for the farmers themselves to try and help in

the eradication and prevention of animal diseases. For this

purpose, we must educate the farmers. But now it is too late, as

it appears to me. I can give you an illustration. In the past,

some farmers found that their pigs suffered from certain

diseases. They went to the veterinary centre, but the officer in

charge insisted that the pigs suffering from animal disease

should be sent to the centre for an operation and this operation

might take two days and the farmer might not like the idea,

although the veterinary officer might well be justified.

Supposing in the course of two days the other animals infected

died? What was to happen to them? So because of this the farmers

themselves have lost some confidence in the veterinary centres

and veterinary officers, and so the better way would be for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>



the  Government to educate the farmers on how to treat their own

animals  when  they  are  suffering  from  a  disease.  If   our

veterinary officer is able to educate the farmers and give  them

advice before the disease is spotted, then with the knowledge of

how to treat diseased animals, this will be one step forward  in

the prevention of animal diseases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Minister has also mentioned just now that

certain  clauses  in this Bill are necessary to control  persons

who give treatment to animals

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, just now I

was  touching upon clauses 68 and 69 of the Bill. The Government

has  introduced  this  Bill  with  the  intention  that  private

veterinarians should be prevented from exploiting  the  farmers.

This   shows   that  farmers  do  not  approach  the  Government

veterinary officers for treatment of their livestock,  but  seek

the  services of private veterinarians. Why is this so?  Why  do

they  shy away from Government veterinary officers? What is  the

main  cause  for this phenomenon? All along the Government  have

been  saying  that they are looking after the farmers'  interest

very  well,  taking  good care of them and  looking  into  every

detail concerning the livelihood of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>



farmers.  Why  then  are there farmers  who  want  to  seek  the

services  of  private veterinarians instead of the  services  of

Government veterinary officers? This shows that the Government's

treatment and efforts in respect of veterinary services have not

been adequate in the past, and even up to now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another point about the eradication of diseases of

livestock, the Government will have to depend on the cooperation

of the farmers. The farmers should be educated and taught modern

methods of veterinary science, such as inoculation and treatment

of  animals. They should also be given facilities to enable them

to  treat the diseased animals themselves. This will, I believe,

go  a  long  way  towards helping the farmers and improving  the

situation generally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Minister also touched on the examination of

animals  imported  from foreign countries in  order  to  prevent

animal diseases from spreading to Singapore. The Government has,

on  the other hand, allowed the import of dead pigs and chickens

into  Singapore! For instance, there have been imports of frozen

chickens,   pork,  bacon  and  ham  from  Australia  and   other

countries.  Such  imports  are not  livestock.  Of  course,  the

Government  will  say that such meat has been processed  and  is

free  from any disease. But how can we be sure of that? Have  we

considered the possibility of such imports affecting  our  local

markets in respect of prices for local livestock --- [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it was never the

intention  of  this  Bill  to branch  off  to  the  question  of

marketing.  The Member for Bukit Panjang has earlier on,  before

the tea-break, spoken for quite a long time on marketing matters

and is now coming back to marketing problems.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think up to now the Member has been in order.

Please continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the other point

of  the  Bill  on which the Minister touched just  now  was  the

prevention of cruelty to animals.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>



The Bill also provides that cruelty to animals includes acts  of

cruelty, maltreating them, and the rest of it. I feel that  this

sort  of provision in the Bill is unnecessary. If such livestock

constitutes  the property of the farmers concerned,  of  course,

the  farmers will have no reason to maltreat or be cruel to  it.

The  Government has provision to kill stray animals found on the

road.  So  anyone who is inclined to treat animals with  cruelty

will  not  have  a  free  hand to do so.  This  shows  that  the

Government are not really genuine when they say that  they  wish

to  look  after  the  farmers'  interest  by  providing  various

facilities and benefits. I would say that the whole lot of  them

are really hypocrites.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Did I hear the Member use the word

"hypocrites"? It is for the Member to deny. If he has  used  the

word  "hypocrites", he must withdraw it. I thought the last word

I heard being translated was "hypocrites".



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): What I meant was that they

appear to be concerned with the interest of the farmers, but, in

actual fact, they are not. That was what I meant.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member did use the word "hypocrites", he

must withdraw it unreservedly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I did not use

that  specific  word.  What I said was a  term  describing  that

meaning, as I have said just now.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I definitely heard the word "hypocrites" come over

in the translation. The Member has used it, and he must withdraw

it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, in that case, I

withdraw that word in English.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please withdraw it in English and in Chinese.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. I did not use

that  specific word in Chinese. But if you construe it  to  mean

that, I withdraw the word both in Chinese and in English.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>5.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

after hearing the Member for Bukit Panjang's great speech which

in actual fact was all nonsense, I feel that ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Please withdraw the word "nonsense".



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I do so. Sir, In actual fact,

the  Member's objective is to give a bad impression of us to the

farmers and to create fear among the people, so that the farmers

will  view with much fear and suspicion all Government  measures

to  help  them, and thereby prevent them from coming forward  to

seek help from the Government veterinary officers.



Mr  Speaker,  the Barisan Sosialis have all along  been  saying

that  what they can see in the kampongs and rural areas are only

bankrupt farming communities. If that were so, then it would  be

beneficial  to  the  Barisan Sosialis. Our Government  has  been

implementing  measures to benefit the people,  particularly  the

farmers.  They  are beginning to awaken to the real  truth,  and

they  do  not believe any more in the utterances of the  Barisan

Sosialis.  The  people  appreciate very  much  the  Government's

facilities and services offered to improve their livelihood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we can clearly see that the whole Bill is

designed  to  serve the interests of the farmers. I  cannot  see

anything  in  it that is bad or detrimental to the  farmers,  as

stated  by the Member for Bukit Panjang. For instance,  he  said

that when a farmer has to convey 50 pigs to a veterinary station

which   happens  to  be  far  away,  it  will  cause  him  great

difficulty. I would suggest to the hon. Member that if there  is

any  disease among the animals, then the farmer concerned should

approach the veterinary officers. If he does not do this,  then,

of course, the Barisan Member will be happy because the disease

will spread all round and many farmers will suffer loss. The

Barisan Sosialis will then have more capital for propaganda purposes

to say that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>



the Government is no good and does not look after the farmers'

welfare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to what the Member for Bukit Panjang has said about clauses

in  the Bill preventing private veterinarians from practising in

the  rural  areas,  I  would  say that  most  of  these  private

veterinarians  are not properly trained, and because  they  lack

experience and knowledge, they usually do more harm than good to

the  farmers, in  this respect, therefore, the Government  will

have  to  legislate  to restrict the practice  of  these

under-qualified veterinarians, who may also be inexperienced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also mentioned another point. He says that when

there  is an outbreak of animal disease or chicken disease,  the

Minister  will then abuse his powers under this Bill. In  actual

fact,  the  Minister  has no such intention  at  all.  When  the

Minister  wants  to  declare  a certain  area  infected  with  a

disease,  there  must first be many such cases  of  the  disease

prevailing in that area before he declares it to be infected. In

many  cases, only when the disease is spreading among  the  livestock will the Minister declare a certain area infected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Panjang assumes the existence of bankrupt

rural  farms, and he does not like to see farmers in  the  rural

areas  prosper and progress. He says that he has never  been  to

the  Bukit Panjang rural areas - that is why he is talking through

his  hat! The Barisan Sosialis is trying every means to  make  a

mountain out of a molehill for their propaganda.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what I want to say to the Member for Bukit Panjang who

seems not to have been to his area at all.



<br><br>5.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we have

explained  this  matter very well. We have also  criticised  the

actual  motive and design of this Bill. What I say is  that  the

P.A.P.  Government are not actually concerned with the  interest

of the farmers or are looking after the interest of the farmers.

They  are pretending to do good. Whether their legislation  will

amount to something good or not is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>



another   question,  and  I  will  have  to  clarify  what   the

Parliamentary Secretary has said just now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He accuses us of wanting to spread fear among the farmers, is

it a fact? He alone will know. The law and regulations provide

clearly that if the Director of the Primary Production

Department sees fit, then the Government will have the power to

destroy all the structures, including livestock, in a certain

area, without prescribing any compensation for them. Will this

not cause fear in the hearts of the farmers? How would you feel

if the law provides for such possibilities and power? Of course,

the farmers are afraid and are living in fear and suspense. Yet

the Government turn round and accuse us of wanting to see the

rural farmers becoming bankrupt!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are in a position to help the farmers, we should carry

out our responsibilities to them. We should also look into every

complaint from the farmers. This is our hope, that all the

farmers can live a comfortable life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Parliamentary Secretary has said that certain

veterinarians are not experienced and are under-qualified. This,

I think, is not quite true. Sometimes, I myself treat diseased

animals. Even my neighbour who lives next to me, in order to

save money, also treats his own diseased animals. We also engage

private veterinarians because, in our view, their practice is

effective and is worth the price we pay them. But Government

veterinary officers are not so experienced as private

veterinarians. Just look at what we have experienced ourselves.

Can you say that private veterinarians are not experienced when

they produce better results? How do you explain that? Even a

certain officer of the Primary Production Department is looking

for private veterinarians to help in the rural areas. Certain

officers in high positions and the Chairmen of certain

committees in the relevant trades also have a very high regard

for these private veterinarians. So I say that when once your

deceit is exposed to the people, you will not have any

opportunity to deceive them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>



any more. I hope you will do something good for the farmers.

That is our hope.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to

express my views on the deceptive propaganda put forward by the

Government in relation to the actual conditions in the rural

areas. The Minister for National Development says that the

Government has taken good care of the farmers over the past few

years and that production in the farms has increased

tremendously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, whenever Members on this side raise certain

matters  of actual fact, they are prevented from doing  so.  The

Ministers  do  not  seem to know of such facts,  and  they  just

listen  in  surprise! Certain diseases are widespread among  the

livestock  and the Government is unable to control  them.  As  a

result  of Government's inability to control the diseases,  many

farmers  have  suffered  losses and they have  become  bankrupt.

Their debts are mounting and they are far from being able to  pay

their  debts.  Feedstuffs manufacturers are also unable  to  get

their  money  from the farmers to whom they have supplied  their

feedstuff. The Government has not carried out its duty  properly

and  adequately  to look after the interest of  the  people  and

farmers by trying to solve their everyday difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many cases of disease spreading among the livestock

of  some farmers, and it takes a few days before the officers of

the  Primary Production Department come to look into the matter.

This  delay results in losses. The Government, it is  true,  has

taken  steps  to inoculate animals and poultry,  but  still  the

diseases are not prevented from spreading. In fact, before inoculation,  some  chickens were even fatter, but after inoculation,

they grew thinner day by day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is clear that in spite of the so called medical care

given by the Government, the livestock has not enjoyed any good

health, or better health. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development said a moment ago that the points

raised by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>



my  colleague with regard to the diseases of certain  pigs  were

of,  minor  importance. This is what he said. We  can  see  that

whenever there is a spread of diseases in the livestock of pigs,

this  spread will cause the farmers to convey their animals  and

chickens over a long distance for treatment, even when there  is

only  a  suspicion  of  a few animals or chickens  among  a  few

hundreds  or  thousands.  Now, is  this  not  a  difficulty  and

inconvenience  for the farmers? Will not the farmers  themselves

be put in fear of the troubles? If the Government intends really

effectively to look after the health of livestock in  the  rural

areas,  then  I suggest that it is the business of  the  Primary

Production  Department to instil common medical  knowledge  into

the  farmers  so  that they themselves will be  able  to  detect

diseases and treat minor cases by themselves, instead of  having

to   go  through  the  rigmarole  of  sending  chickens  to  the

veterinary centre.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we have seen

the performance of the Barisan Members in this House. They

try  to get even some votes over the problems of the pigs.  They

have  been most inconsistent in their speeches. As the  Minister

for  National  Development has put it clearly,  because  of  the

inadequacy  of  existing  Ordinances,  the  Government  have  to

introduce  new laws to improve the conditions of the farmers  to

catch  up with time. This is realistic in approach, but  instead

of getting support, we have seen the Barisan Members criticising

the  Government.  When we want to put aside one million  dollars

for the improvement of the farmers' livelihood, they want us  to

put  in  ten million dollars. They are expecting much more  than

realistic things from us, and they do so in order to attract the

farmers to their side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, we can see very clearly from our daily life

that  the Minister for National Development is often seen to  be

discussing  problems with the farmers themselves  to  get  their

views, so that steps will be taken in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>



accordance  with such views and to improve the living  standards

of  the  farmers and to improve the primary production services.

We  have  already  taught the farmers the modern  techniques  in

rearing pigs and other animals, so that their production will be

increased  and their income similarly increased.  This  has  all

along  been our objective and we have been doing pretty well.  I

do  not  see how the Barisan Members can deny this fact, instead

of  talking  about the actual needs of the farmers  at  present.

they have sidetracked and talked about something else.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as the Member for Bukit Panjang has said just

now,  when a pig falls sick, it is not necessary for the  farmer

to  carry  it to the veterinary officer. Instead the  veterinary

officer  must  go to the farmer's house and treat  the  pig.  We

agree  this is a better way if there are enough pigs to  justify

the  visit of the veterinary officer at the farm. But if  it  is

only an individual case, that would be too much trouble and most

uneconomical.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he really mean that the National Development Ministry

should not send out properly trained veterinary officers to look

after  the  diseases  of  the livestock  or  does  he  want  the

Government   to  encourage  the  farmers  to  prefer   untrained

veterinary personnel to trained personnel, resulting in a  great

loss of lives of the animals? All this talk is most unrealistic

and beside the point. If they really desire to help the farmers,

then  they  should study the main points in the  speech  of  the

Minister for National Development. Then they would realise  that

it is the intention of the Government to look after the farmers'

interest in a practical manner.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

we  have  heard  the  Member for Jalan  Besar  saying  that  the

Government  wants to look after the interest of the farmers  and

that is why the Government has introduced this Bill. But this is

a great humbug. The Member for Bukit Panjang has said just now,

very  clearly, that there are many loopholes in this Bill  which

might  give  rise to actual difficulties. But in his  reply  the

Parliamentary Secretary has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>



been  unable  to  give us a clearer picture in relation  to  the

possible difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the performance of the Government over the past

few  years.  Over the radio the Government has said that  it  is

looking  after the interests of the people very well.  You  must

not  ill-treat the dogs, you must not ill-treat the cats,  ducks

and  chickens. And that is what they say, they are looking after

the interests of the farmers. Now if you do not give them actual

help  to  develop  their farm and increase their  production  in

poultry  and in vegetable gardening, what is the actual  use  of

such talk? In fact, there are many farmers in the State who  are

unable  to continue farming because they cannot make ends  meet.

And  it  is  difficult for them to continue farming  or  poultry

rearing. The Government has not been able to give them practical

assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what is the form of assistance that the Government is

supposed  to  give?  The Government is  not  able  to  put  into

practice effective measures to control the spread of diseases or

to prevent the spread of any diseases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the question of marketing land and the

fluctuation of the price in poultry and other primary  products.

All  these  years has the Government been able to put forward  a

comprehensive plan to improve generally the rural areas? Because

of  the absence of any comprehensive plan, the rural economy  is

nearing  bankruptcy.  One  can see that  the  cost  of  eggs  is

decreasing. What is the Government doing to increase  the  price

of  eggs?  Instead  of doing something practical,  it  is  only

trying  to  legislate  to see that better quality  feedstuff  is

available. Then we come to the ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have been very patient. I think the

Member  must really go back to the Animals and Birds Bill.  Will

he come back to the Bill?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, in this Bill

the Government seeks to control the diseases of animals, but the

responsibility  should be shouldered by the farmers  themselves.

because  if  the  Government thinks that there is  a  spread  of

disease  in  a certain area, then the animals will  have  to  be

condemned,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>



and some chicken runs and other structures will have to be

destroyed without any compensation. Do you think the farmers

will report any suspicion of disease to the Government just to

invite such great loss? If such a report is made, then they will

run the risk of having their property destroyed; so they will

not seek the assistance of the Government in trying to detect or

cure any disease in their livestock.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary has tried to say just now that the

Minister would not abuse the powers of this Bill to declare any

place an infected area unnecessarily in any individual cases.

But the fact is that in any section of a place there may be a

spread of a disease and this will give rise to great

inconvenience and trouble in view of the powers given by this

Bill. I think the farmers should be given the liberty to

complain to the Government of any difficulties, otherwise they

will not report any suspicion or actual spread of disease to the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Members on this side have already given their criticism of

the loopholes in this Bill, and the conclusion one can draw is

that the introduction of this Bill reflects the difficulties and

the near bankruptcy of the rural areas. And if this Bill must be

passed, then I urge upon the Government to give some form of

compensation if any structure of the farmer is to be destroyed

on the discovery of any disease. And then the Government should

take practical steps to enlarge the market for poultry and eggs,

otherwise eggs will be falling in price, from six cents to five

cents. Then there should be a comprehensive programme for the

control of diseases among the animals.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

on the subject of the Bill which we are debating now, the

opposition from the Barisan Sosialis Members appears to show

their sympathy to whom they think will give their support to

them at some future time. They obviously are ignorant as to the

best method to be employed to raise the living standards of

poultry rearers in the rural areas. As has been said by the

Opposition Members, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>



cost  of  eggs should be increased. But the Opposition, at  the

same  time, are not aware that in order for the cost of eggs  to

be increased, the quality of the eggs should be improved, if the

eggs  produced are of a lower quality, naturally the prices  are

low,  then the Government is responsible for ensuring that  good

quality  eggs are produced. Thus with the increased  prices  for

these   eggs,   their  standard  of  living   will   be   raised

proportionately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding transport mentioned by the Opposition, if this Bill

is passed, it will cause inconvenience to the farmers to have to

transport  their animals and birds for the purpose of injection.

That  is  up to the farmers. If they want to see their  products

improve  in quality, then it is part of their duty to  transport

their  animals or birds to the veterinary centres. If our  child

is  sick and we want to see it treated, we have to bring  it  to

the  General Hospital even though we may have to travel  a  long

distance. This is an example.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of compensation, what is the rate of

compensation  paid to farmers who have diseased animals  in  our

country?  Of  course, the Government is responsible  for  seeing

that the birds or animals which may be the cause of infection be

destroyed to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. That  is

important for us to consider. Not just by paying compensation to

the poultry farmers. As I have said earlier on, what is the rate

of compensation to be paid to defaulting poultry farmers who are

responsible for spreading diseases so that diseases will not  be

spread  further to the neighbours and so on? It is  one  of  the

responsibilities  of  the Government to see  that  the  rate  of

productivity is increased, which means that it will  be  healthy

to  the State of Singapore. That is all I have to say today, Mr

Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Minister, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, once again I hear Members of

the  Opposition  saying that in the last five years  the  P.A.P.

Government has done nothing for the farmers and that most of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>



farmers  are  bankrupt or are going bankrupt. As to whether  the

farmers are going bankrupt or not, there are facts to show  that

during  the  last  five years, instead of  the  trade  in  eggs,

poultry and pork being reduced, it has increased. From being  an

importer of chickens, eggs and pigs, we are now the exporter. It

what  they say is true, that during the last five years we  have

done  nothing  for the farmers and that they are going  bankrupt

quickly,  their trade would have been dead by now.  This  is  an

instance of where Members of the Opposition are trying to  bluff

the  public. I do not know whether they really have the interest

of  the farmers at heart or they are just here to play politics,

because  if  they really do have the interest of the farmers  at

heart,  they  have  had more than five months  since  the  First

Reading  of this Bill to send in amendments and make suggestions

for  improvement.  On  the one hand, they say,  "Look,  we  must

control diseases." On the other hand, when we bring up this Bill

to  control diseases they say. "This is in no way any aid to the

farmers at all." They say again that our veterinary surgeons and

veterinary  centres are of no assistance at all to the  farmers.

If  they  are of no assistance to the farmers, how  is  it  that

suggestions come from them that we should build more  veterinary

centres? So all in all, Mr Speaker, Sir, they are talking with

their  tongues in their cheeks. Absolutely, they do not  believe

in what they say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is evident that in order to improve our

livestock, some sort of control must be accepted by the  farmers

-  control of disease, control of feedstuffs. And when enforcing

any regulation, of course, there will be difficulties, and it is

always  the  policy of the Government when enforcing regulations

to  see  that  our  officers carry out  our  policy  in  a  very

practical  and  common  sense way. Some  of  the  administrative

difficulties  which  they have brought up will,  of  course,  be

looked into and I can give the farmers every assurance that this

Bill  is  not  there, as the Opposition alleges, to make  things

more  difficult for them. This Bill is to protect  the  property

and to improve the quality and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>



the breed of their pigs, chickens and eggs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment will delete paragraph (m) from the Schedule to be

considered, as paragraph (t) already provides the same powers as

paragraph (m). The latter paragraph, paragraph (m), is therefore

redundant and should be deleted from the Schedule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.3l p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to raise the standard of hygiene in

slaughterhouses  and meat processing factories  to  improve  the

quality  and maintain a high standard in the processing of  meat

and  meat  production. The provisions of this Bill  will  ensure

that  animals are slaughtered in a hygienic manner and that  the

meat  produced  is wholesome, properly handled, and  transported

without  contamination. Illegal slaughtering  and  the  sale  of

diseased  meat  will  be prohibited. At the  same  time,  it  is

intended  that  meat canning and meat processing  factories,  of

which  there  are  at the present a number in Singapore,  should

also  be  brought  within the ambit of the  Bill.  Some  of  our

canners have in the past experienced considerable difficulty  in

exporting  their  products to overseas markets because  hygienic

standards,  manufacturing procedure, and the type of meat  used,

do not satisfy the requirements of the importing countries. This

is  a  stumbling block in the development of our food  and  meat

manufacturing industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions contained in the Bill will overcome these

obstacles by ensuring that the slaughtering of meat, the process

of  manufacture,  the  hygienic conditions  within  the  factory

premises, are of a standard acceptable internationally  and,  in

particular, acceptable to those countries to which our products



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>



are  exported.  Certificates  will  be  issued  by   the

veterinary  authorities to manufacturers of meat  and  meat  products who have obtained the required standards to enable them to

export  their  products.  This  step  will  greatly  assist  our

producers  and  exporters of meat and  meat  products  to  enter

foreign markets and compete on equal terms, thus encouraging the

development  and  expansion of our food and  meat  manufacturing

industries  and thereby providing more employment  opportunities

for our growing population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to carry out effectively the provisions of

this Bill and to encourage the development of the food and meat

industries in Singapore, a new modern abattoir will be built.

Tenders for its construction at Jurong at an estimated cost of

more than $4 million have been accepted, and work will commence

soon. This abattoir will be one of the best and provided with

the most up-to-date slaughtering equipment in this part of the

world. The new abattoir will also have a veterinary public

health laboratory to carry out testing and examination of meat

and the training of personnel in abattoir management, meat

inspection and related aspects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first Part of this Bill dealing with slaughter-houses is

not new, as it is merely a re-enactment of Part V of the local

Government integration Ordinance. 1963. The provisions relating

to meat processing factories are, however, new.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole Assembly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Third time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving the Third Reading of the Housing Developers (Control

and  Licensing) Bill, I wish to inform the House that in  Select

Committee  we  have  considered a number of  representations  in

respect of various provisions of the Bill. I would like  now  to

touch on the main points of these representations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Bill presented earlier, housing development was defined

to  include the financing for development. It has been agreed in

Select  Committee that banks and insurance companies, in so  far

as  they provide money for housing development, will be exempted

from the provisions of the Bill. A suggestion has been made that

the  new  law  should  be made to apply  only  to  houses  under

construction and for sale, and should not apply to houses  built

for   investment  which  should  not  be  construed  as  housing

development  coming within the provisions of the Bill.  To  this

suggestion,  it  must be emphasised that making  provisions  for

such  exemption  would  create loopholes  in  the  Bill  leading

eventually to evasion and defeating the objects of the Bill. The

best  recourse, therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, would  be  that  in

respect  of  the  developer building for investment,  he  should

apply for exemption from the provisions of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is not to stifle private enterprise in

the provision of housing for the middle and higher income

sections of the population. If development is clearly intended

for investment and an application is made



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>



to the Minister, it is unlikely that exemption will be withheld.

But  in  providing  for legislation of this nature  we  have  to

ensure that there should be no loopholes whereby speculators, on

the  pretext  of  building houses ostensibly for investment  but

with  the real purpose of sale, can remain outside the scope  of

this law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Objections have been raised against the penalties imposed under

the  Ordinance,  particularly regarding  a  prison  sentence  in

addition  to a fine. I must emphasise, however, that  in  laying

down  the scale of punishment under the Bill, the main objective

is  to  serve a warning on unscrupulous developers and to  deter

them. Those who carry out their business in accordance with  the

law will have nothing to fear. Hence, where a developer attempts

to  carry out his business without a licence, he deserves to  be

punished by both a fine and imprisonment. If notwithstanding our

efforts  to regulate proper practice a housing developer  defies

the  law, then he does not deserve sympathy and only a  term  of

imprisonment  will  be sufficient to discourage  this.  Although

imprisonment has been laid down in the Bill, the length  of  the

prison  term will be a matter for the court to decide, depending

on the gravity of the offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the sorry plight of so many purchasers having been cheated

without  any  redress  or remedy warrants the  imposition  of  a

prison sentence for any person who undertakes the business of  a

housing  developer without a licence. In other cases of offences

committed  after  a  licence has been issued,  the  imprisonment

sentence is not mandatory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One important point which was raised in the Select Committee,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, was the condition under the  Bill  requiring

that  the company doing housing development must have a  paid-up

capital  of  half a million dollars. It was suggested  that  the

requirement  of  such  a large amount of  capital  would  stifle

development. The Select Committee, after consideration of  their

representation, agreed to reduce this sum to $100,000.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should further like to point out, Mr Speaker, Sir, that

there is provision in the Bill whereby the Minister in his

discretion can waive or vary the amount of the deposit in order

that reputable persons or companies with smaller capital but

desirous of carrying out housing development on a modest scale

may still be able to contribute towards housing development in

the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representations have also been made for appeals against the

decision of the Controller to be referred to the High Court and

not to the Minister as intended in the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee has agreed that appeals against the

decision of the Controller in regard to the grant of a licence

shall be made to the High Court. But if a housing developer is

aggrieved by the decision of the Controller in regard to the

varying or revocation of any existing conditions of the licence,

or impose conditions or additional conditions, such appeals

shall be referred to the Minister whose decision shall be final.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, various minor amendments have also been

incorporated into the Bill. The provision requiring a housing

developer to exhibit his audited accounts, balance sheet and

particulars of officers managing the business in the office, is

substituted by the requirement that the audited accounts shall

be forwarded to the Controller and published in the Gazette

within three months of the close of the financial year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Select Committee, having considered both

the oral and written representations received on this Bill, has

agreed to make the amendments which I have indicated above. The

Bill as now amended is a piece of legislation which at this

stage of Singapore's development is clearly desirable in order

to promote a class of housing developers who besides making a

profit would ensure a square deal for purchasers of housing

accommodation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to ensure that buyers will not be cheated

or forced into one-sided agreements or saddled



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>

with  sub-standard houses. This Bill is also timely  because  of

the  rapid  urbanisation and the re-development of  the  central

areas  of  the City whereby large areas will be re-developed  to

make  way  for  well  planned  and properly  constructed  flats,

housing  estates, business districts complete  with  social  and

public amenities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of large-scale urban redevelopment is a task which

the  Government  cannot  handle adequately  by  itself.  Private

enterprise would be invited or induced to participate. Thus, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, it is desirable that there should be  established

by  licensing  and control a new generation of  private  housing

developers    with    sufficient   financial    resources    and

organisational  ability  to help the  Government  in  urban

re-development to make Singapore a better and more prosperous city.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill, as amended, accordingly read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>SALARY OF SPEAKER</b></div>



<br><br>6.48 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, I

beg to move the motion* standing in my name.



<hr size="2" noshade>

*The motion reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, pursuant to Article 25 of the Constitution of the States

of Singapore, the salary of the Speaker with effect from the

2nd November, 1964, shall be $1,750 a month.

<hr size="2" noshade>



Sir,  may  I explain to the House the procedure under which  the

Speaker's salary has been decided at $1,750? Under the Singapore

Constitution,  the salary and other emoluments  of  the  Speaker

must  be  determined  from  time  to  time  by  the  Legislative

Assembly. Therefore, it is necessary that today we have to  move

this motion to decide on the Speaker's salary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister first approached you, Mr Speaker, to

discuss your appointment as Speaker of the Assembly, and you had

indicated to him that you could only consider the appointment if

you  were allowed to continue your private practice as a  lawyer

and solicitor. The Prime Minister agreed to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>



this  and,  therefore,  it  became  necessary  to  consider  the

question  of  your  salary as Speaker of this  House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full salary of $3,000 payable to the Speaker was fixed on the

basis that  the Speaker would do no other job than that of the Speaker

of the Assembly. It is apparent that if the Speaker were allowed

to continue his private practice, an adjustment would have to be

made to the full salary of the Speaker, which had been fixed  on

a  different  basis. Therefore, it became necessary to  consider

under  these  circumstances what would  constitute  a  fair  and

proper salary for a part-time Speaker. It was, therefore, agreed

between Mr Speaker and the Prime Minister that $1,750 would  be

a  compromise.  In  addition to this salary, the  Speaker  still

enjoys other perquisites in order to maintain the dignity of his

office; for example, a house, a gardener, a car, a chauffeur and

an entertainment vote. The lowering of the salary, therefore, in

no  way is intended to reflect on the duty and the status of the

post of the Speaker, and if a future Speaker should take on this

job on a full-time basis, then, of course, the salary would have

to be reconsidered and possibly the full salary paid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, pursuant to Article 25 of the Constitution of the State

of Singapore, the salary of thc Speaker with effect from the 2nd

November, 1964, shall be $1,750 a month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reclamation will be carried out by the Port Authority on

"LAND  OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 3/65", which is deposited  in

the Land Office, Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the 27th of June, 1962, this House

approved the reclamation by Government of approximately 48 acres

of  foreshore and sea-bed along Upper East Coast Road  from  the

junction  of Bedok Road. This reclamation, which was  undertaken

by the Housing and Development Board as agent of the Government,

has now been completed. The Government now proposes to reclaim a

further  1,000  acres of foreshore and sea-bed  off  East  Coast

Road.  The  extent of this reclamation is shown on  LAND  OFFICE

<div align="center"><b>RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 3/65, a copy of which is in the Assembly</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land, Mr Speaker, Sir, is a very scarce resource in Singapore.

Over the last few years, the Government has embarked on a number

of  swamp  reclamation projects, such as Kallang  Basin,  Sungei

Poyan  and  Sungei  Pandan. The East Coast Road  Reclamation  is

another  major  project to make available more land  for  future

development.  The  reclamation will extend over  a  distance  of

approximately 6 miles from Bedok to Tanjong Rhu and will vary in

width  from  about  900 feet to 2,000 feet,  depending  on  soil

conditions. The project will take about four years and will cost

approximately $53 million. The utilisation of the reclaimed land

has  as  yet not been decided. There is, however, no doubt  that

this  reclamation  will relieve the acute land shortage,  making

available  sites  for  much  needed  community  facilities.   In

addition,  it is also proposed to construct a coastal road  from

the City to Katong, Bedok and Changi.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>

in  the east coast. He said that we must  plan  for  the

future  in  regard to land in view of the increasing population.

He  also was reported to have said that the reclamation  on  the

east  coast was to build a scenic area for Singapore. It is  not

difficult  for the people to see that the reclamation  programme

of the Government is not intended to resolve the difficulties of

the  people  in  their livelihood, but is  intended  for  an  unrealistic  purpose,  because by 1990 there  will  be  4  million

people in Singapore and yet we still allow a lot of land  to  be

occupied  by the British bases. In Siglap and Changi the  people

are faced with problems arising out of land reclamation and they

are  rather uneasy, because by 1990 the population will reach  4

million  and they are more concerned, in fact, with the question

of  resettlement.  People who live on this land  and  depend  on

farming  are not worried about whether there is any scenic  spot

on the island of Singapore. But they are more concerned with the

realistic  aspects of life. But the Minister for Law, in  trying

to  pass  this  motion, will create some realistic problems  for

persons  affected by the land reclamation programme.  Now,  they

are occupying land and paying quit rent of two to three dollars.

But  when they are faced with the problem of resettlement,  they

are worried whether they will be able to pay the rent in Selegie

House  at the rate of $66.50 per month, or whether they will  be

asked  to stay in Aljunied Road Housing Board flats at the  rate

of $55 per month, instead of two to three dollars per month on a

bigger piece of land. These are the problems that the people are

more  concerned with. There are many small shopkeepers  who  are

concerned with the possibility of being evicted out of shops  at

a lower rental, into shops at $500 to $600 rental per month. The

Government is now asking some German architects and engineers to

reclaim  the land. This will cost a lot of money. We  understand

that  the  Government is spending some $53 million on  the  land

reclamation programme. On an average, every acre will cost about

$52,000 to develop. The Government only pays $2,000 per acre  as

compensation to those who will be evicted from the land. If  the

Government can allot only half of the sum



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>



used  on reclamation to these people who are evicted from  their

own  land,  that will be much better than making  them  bankrupt

otherwise. The people evicted have been concerned by the  Government's  unreasonable  compensation. Why  should  the  Government

spend  $53  million of the taxpayer's money on  contractors  and

merchants  from  Germany  and  other  places?  Why  should   the

Government not use this sum of money on the people themselves?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for National Development has also said that the

people  should be taken care of and that the compensation  terms

should be adequate to meet their losses. We are concerned  about

the  fate  and condition and troubles of the evicted people  who

have  been staying on the east coast. The Government has divided

the  rural areas into two classes. One is agricultural area  and

the other is non-agricultural area ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Up till now the Member has been in order. He was

making  the point that the Government could more usefully  spend

its  money on other projects. But I think now he is getting  out

of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the reclamation

programme conducted in the east coast area affects the people

living there and the Government should look after their

difficulties. The people staying in these areas are faced with

bankruptcy. The price of eggs has gone down on the one hand, and

the price of feedstuffs has gone up on the other hand. The

people who are asked to move out from their land incur great

losses. They have spent several thousand dollars or even tens of

thousands of dollars to build up their present business, and yet

the Government is paying compensation of a lesser amount to

people and merchants who are evicted from their land. The

present accommodation allotted by the Government is hired out at

very high rentals. All the measures taken are not reasonable.

Shop houses in Geylang Serai have been demolished and the

compensation has been very inadequate. When they built up their

shophouses in Geylang Serai area, they had to pay thousands of

dollars of tea money ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. This is not a debate on the adequacy or

inadequacy  of  Government compensation. It is a debate  on  the

reclamation of land at Bedok.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the reclamation

programme in the Bedok area will affect the residents and  small

estate  men  in the hundreds of acres in that area.  The  people

living  there  have  accumulated their  wealth  through  several

generations  and have built up their livelihood there  and  they

live  out  of  the  land.  They have  planted  fruit  trees  and

vegetable  crops to maintain their living. The land they  bought

in  the past in this area fetches a different price from that of

before.  A  piece  of land that can fetch tens of  thousands  of

dollars per acre can fetch only $2,000 to $3,000 of compensation

from  the  Government.  Under these  circumstances,  the  living

conditions of the rural people in that area have been  adversely

affected. Small merchants and hawkers are faced with bankruptcy.

That is why the residents, in the face of forced eviction by the

Government, are not willing to remove even when faced with  fire

on their site ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I understand the motion to be on

reclamation of land, not eviction of squatters.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The reclamation of the sea-shore.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Unless I misunderstood the Minister, reclamation

of the seashore does not carry with it eviction of squatters. Am

I right in that, Mr Minister!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> That is right. Only prawns are to be found

there.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Well, if that is so, Mr Poh Ber Liak, please let

us get back to reclamation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Do not read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, on the question of

the  sea  coast  along  the  Bedok area,  the  eviction  of  the

residents  there  is  the first part of  the  reclamation  work.

Unless   the  residents  can  be  chased  out,  the  reclamation

programme cannot be carried out. So



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>



this affects people, including those staying on hillocks and  in

that  area. If the people staying there are affected, then  the

Government  should look into their conditions. So I  suggest  as

follows to the Minister concerned:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Government, in implementing its reclamation programme,

should compensate adequately the residents in the Bedok area and

people  who  stay  in  the Changi area and who  are  engaged  in

agricultural work. The Government should not use any  excuse  or

pretext  to  refuse  adequate  compensation  to  the  residents,

especially the farmers there. It should not use the pretext that

the  houses  built by the farmers there have not been officially

approved  by  the Government. In fact, many of the houses  there

were  built  long ago, and therefore the Government  should  not

group  them into different classes. All the people there  should

he regarded as farmers engaged in agricultural work ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I cannot allow this to go on very much

longer.  I  have  been very tolerant to the  Member,  because  I

thought  that  during the earlier stages of the debate,  he  was

making  the  point that Government could utilise its money  much

better by helping the squatters. He has made his point and  must

get  on with the topic of reclamation. And reclamation does  not

mean eviction of squatters.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, allow me to say

that the eviction of residents is connected with reclamation

work - before the programme can be carried out. So we see

large-scale eviction taking place when the Government implements its

programme of land reclamation. I hope in carrying out the work

of land reclamation, the Government will try to lessen any

adverse effects on the residents concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if your things are destroyed by the Government,

surely you expect the Government to pay you compensation. Many

people in Bedok are worried; particularly those living in the

small hills are affected by the reclamation programme. They

expect the Government to provide them with alternative



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>

pieces  of land in the neighbourhood, so that  they  can

carry  on  with  their farming activities. They  also  expect  a

higher compensation rate from the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Minister for Law has also said just now that

land  is  very  scarce  in Singapore. That  is  why,  after  the

Government  has  chased the squatters out from  where  they  are

without  adequate resettlement or rehousing or without  adequate

compensation terms, the squatters are at a loss where to go,  in

view of the scarcity of land in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is the responsibility of the Government to give

a  special  rent  subsidy to those shopkeepers affected  by  the

reclamation  programme  when  they  are  asked  to  do  business

elsewhere or in Housing Board shops.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the Tampines area, a family was

asked to vacate

its  place,  and it was given only $500 by way of  compensation.

This  family  was actually running a shop in that area  and  for

this shop they only received $500 compensation. This family  was

then  asked to do business in a Housing Board shop at a rent  of

$500  per  month. How can we say that the Government  is  really

looking  after the interests of the poor people? I would suggest

that, in cases where people have been affected by the Government

reclamation  programme, they should be given higher compensation

and  alternative  accommodation or shops  at  a  low  rental.  I

suggest that in the case of shopkeepers affected, the Government

should build ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): No, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is very interested in land reclamation and says

that  it is paying adequate compensation to the shopkeepers  and

squatters affected by the programme, but the fact is that not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>



a  single  cent  has  been  given to  these  people  by  way  of

compensation. In fact, some tenants ---

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, his speech is not relevant. Of the many

shopkeepers affected, how many live near the sea, and  how  many

live  near  the shore that is to be reclaimed? Could the  Member

give this information? There are very many houses in Pulau Brani

---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Member for Bukit Panjang has indicated

to  the  House that certain hills in the vicinity of  Bedok  are

going  to be razed. As a result of razing those hills, it  could

well  be that certain people are going to be de-housed. If  that

is  the  point that the Member is making, then he is  completely

relevant and is in order. Mr Poh Ber Liak.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, perhaps the

Parliamentary Secretary concerned will go to the Bedok area  and

see for himself that there are houses and squatters and shops on

the  hillock in the Bedok area affected by the land reclamation.

If  you  want me to prove this, then the best thing is  for  the

Minister concerned or the Parliamentary Secretary to go  to  the

Bedok area and see for himself that there are provision shops on

the  small  hills  from which earth is removed  to  reclaim  the

shore.  Of course, you do not expect to see any houses or  shops

on the sea-shore. This statement only shows the ignorance of the

Parliamentary  Secretary, and this is most  annoying.  It  shows

that he is a person with no common sense.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the Member please get on with the

debate  and  not  go  into  personal  controversies  with  other

Members?  Mr Poh Ber Liak, please carry on, and do  not  repeat

yourself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I was just trying

to  rebut  the Parliamentary Secretary when he requested  me  to

prove  my  point.  At any rate, allow me to  come  back  to  the

question of land reclamation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, at present, the Government is not doing very much

by  way  of  compensation to the shopkeepers and  the  squatters

affected by the land reclamation, particularly ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member has made that point several times. He

has made it quite often, and I think the House is quite aware of

it. He does not make his point more effective by repeating it 20

or  30 times. If the Member has any other points to raise before

the House, please do so, but not this one.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the points that I

have raised are not repetitious ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The view of the Chair is that it is repetitious.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I bow to your ruling, Mr

Speaker, to show my respect for the Chair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, when the small hills are levelled, the Government

should   give   thought  to  the  question   of   eviction   and

resettlement,  particularly its attitude to  the  small

estate-holders  on  the small hillock in question. What is  the

compensation given to these people? At present, the rate of $3,000 for

each  family is not adequate, when compared with the actual cost

of  the  land. Some pieces of land cost $10,000 to  $20,000  per

acre instead of $3,000 per acre. So the Government would do well

to give adequate compensation to the small-holders in this area,

particularly  in view of the fact that you require some  $50,000

to $60,000 to reclaim one acre of land in that area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, has the Government intended to alleviate the

difficulties of the persons affected? The views expressed by  me

should  receive the Minister's attention and are a real test  of

the  Government's sincerity in trying to improve the  livelihood

of  the  people.  On the one hand, these people do  not  receive

adequate compensation and, on the other hand, they are forced to

stay in another place at a high rental which they cannot afford.

The Government is treating the people as fools if it does so. If

the Government cannot give adequate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>



compensation, then the livelihood of the people affected will be

gravely  threatened.  There are more and more  cases  of  forced

eviction happening in Singapore, and these people affected would

like   the  Government  to  reconsider  the  effects   of   land

reclamation on their livelihood. The people affected by the land

reclamation programme should keep their eyes open.



<br><br>7.27 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, the Member for Tampines, who does

not  live too far away from Bedok, obviously is not fully  aware

of  the facts and circumstances relating to land reclamation  in

Bedok.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know how he came to the conclusion that land values in

Bedok are quite high and therefore he has become a protector  of

the   capitalists  and  land-owning  class,  and  requested  the

Government to compensate them for the real value of their  land.

For  his information, I will say that most of the land there  is

what  we call "open space area" and is valued at about 10  cents

per square foot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, he has some suggestions to make with regard to our plan of

reclaiming 1,000 acres from the sea, and he says that we  should

make  use  of lorries and more use of local labour in  order  to

reclaim this land. Before we went into the reclamation of  these

1,000 acres - it is quite a large project, I believe it is about

the largest in South-East Asia

- we undertook --- Ni put siang sin.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order. Will the Minister please sit down?

If  the  Minister speaks in English, he must confine himself  to

English.  He  cannot  be bilingual. If  he  wants  to  speak  in

Mandarin, then he must speak in Mandarin throughout.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> As I was saying, Mr Speaker, we put a lot of

thought  into  it and we did a trial reclamation  of  40  acres.

During  this reclamation, we found that by using the traditional

methods of getting lorries and using shovels to convey the earth

to  the  sea  for reclamation, a lot of hardship was  caused  to

people  living in the surrounding area. Therefore,  we  came  up

with   the   present   plan  of  using  a  mechanical   conveyor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>



belt, so that there would be minimum disruption to the lives  of

the people living in and around Bedok.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the other point which the Opposition is always harping on

is  that  compensation rates are inadequate. Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

during  the last five years we have made a review of the  compensation  rates,  and for their information, I am glad  to  inform

this  House  that  the people of Singapore  have  accepted  that

Singapore should be redeveloped, that there should be newer  and

better  buildings, and they have accepted our compensation  plan

and  they  are willing to move out on the compensation rates  we

give. In fact, I have received many letters with regard to urban

renewal  as well as resettlement elsewhere. These writers  wrote

to  me and said, "We agree wholeheartedly with your attempts and

with  your  plans for the redevelopment of Singapore.  Will  you

just  see  that in moving us you give us as little inconvenience

as  possible?" We have done that. During the last five years  we

have  been  moving about four to five thousand  people,  and  in

place  of that we have been able to rehouse about three to  four

hundred  thousand people. So, as far as we are  concerned,  they

will keep on harping that compensation rates are not fair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have stated in this House before that legally these squatters

are not entitled to compensation, but as a Government that looks

after  the welfare of the people of this country, we thought  it

fair that these people, when being moved out to make way for new

redevelopment, should not suffer unduly, and we  are  doing  our

very best to see that in moving them out we will cause as little

disruption  to  their  livelihood and their  way  of  living  as

possible.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I do

not  propose to take up too much time of the House to  reply  to

the  Members  opposite, but I would like to remind them  of  the

fact that they must accept a major principle. This principle  is

that  the wealth of the nation should be used on the development

aspect  of  the country. I would like to ask them  to  face  the

realistic problem at present, which is that in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>



Singapore the population is fast increasing. This increased rate

of  population is fantastic. Every year we have some 60,000  new

babies  coming  into  this part of the  world.  So  the  problem

arising  out of the increased population should be tackled  well

ahead by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a responsible Government we should solve this problem in

advance  and  think of the future, quite apart from the  present

day.  In  other  words, you must dig the  well  before  you  are

thirsty,  otherwise it may be too late. This is a practical  and

realistic  proverb. Instead of thinking along those lines  as  I

have   suggested,  the  Barisan  Members  have  failed  to  give

constructive  suggestions to help the Government in implementing

its  projects. Instead they go on harping on the old  tune  that

the Government is not properly looking after the interest of the

people.  One cannot deny that the problems of the future  should

be  tackled  well  in advance. Why should we be  stingy  in  our

energies  in trying to push through this programme?  This  is  a

basic principle. Of course, Mr Speaker, no one can deny that if

a  house is to be built beautifully and properly, the old  house

on  the  same  piece  of  land will be  affected.  Everyone  can

understand, even a child of three years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being so, if you want the nation and the country to

develop  strongly and healthily, then a small  minority  of  the

population   may   suffer  some  losses.  This  is   inevitable,

particularly   in  view  of  the  fact  that  the  redevelopment

programme  is a comprehensive one. But there is one  consolation

in  the  fact that the Government is paying compensation to  the

people  affected, and the compensation adequate for the purposes

intended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Members opposite have said that the

development programme of the Government is intended to  build  a

scenic  spot  in  the  island for the wealthier  capitalists  in

Singapore.  I  would  like to tell them that  if  they  are  not

engaged  in  day-dreams then they should know that Singapore  is

very  beautiful  and  wealthy,  and  well  advanced  in  housing

projects  in the whole of Malaysia. This fact is well  known  to

the world.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past the people thought that Tanjong Rhu belonged to the

rich. Now we have already put up a lot of fiats in this area for

the  poor people. They can go there and see. Whether you  are  a

wage-earner or a labourer or a small businessman, you can go and

live  in  Tanjong Rhu, which was formerly reserved for the  very

rich  in  the  past. This is a fact which cannot be  denied  and

nobody  can  bluff about this. If they do not know  the  way  to

Tanjong Rhu, the housing Board will provide free transport for them

to go there. They can go and see for themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Tampines has also said just now

that the houses built by the Government are let out at very high

rentals,  and  this  is why very few are occupied  by  the  poor

people. This is ridiculous because we cannot build enough houses

to meet the needs of the people. There are more people coming to

the  Housing Board to get fiats, but we cannot build  enough  to

meet the increasing demands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis should be more realistic when they talk of

the needs of the people, instead of talking something intangible

and unrealistic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as the old saying goes, we can reclaim the sea

into  land.  The world is changing all the time.  Some of  the

Members  opposite are graduates of universities.  If  they  keep

their  eyes  open to the facts of life, they will  then  realise

that  the scarcity of land in Singapore will give rise to  great

problems in future. If steps are not taken to reclaim land  now,

then  in future they may be worried about where to stay. If  you

want  the  country  to progress and to advance,  then  you  must

follow  the principle of constant development for the future  as

well as for the present day.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Barker in reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, the hon. Member from Tampines referred

to the eviction of squatters as a result of reclamation. I think

he  did  not make himself clear. There are no squatters directly

affected by this reclamation. But what I think he meant was that

squatters



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>



would  be  indirectly affected by the reclamation, in the  sense

that  fill  for the reclamation will be obtained from about  345

acres   of   land  which  have  been  gazetted  for   compulsory

acquisition.  This land is south of Upper Changi  Road,  between

the  7¼ m.s. to the 8 m.s. Upper Changi Road and the 7¼ m.s.

East Coast Road. He is worried about the question of resettlement

of the  squatters  living in that area. I can assure  hon.  Members

that  we have always dealt very nicely wth our squatters. We  do

not  go  in and throw them out. We have surveys, enquiries,  and

the  usual  procedure will be followed in this  case.  In  fact,

Collector's enquiries under the Land Acquisition Ordinance  have

been  completed and possession of this land which has  not  been

taken  possession  of will be done so shortly.  The  acquisition

itself is estimated to cost the Government about $3½ million.

No cadastral  survey  of  the  area has been  undertaken,  but  the

detailed census of families, improvements and ex-gratia payments

applicable   in   each  case,  which  is   a   prerequisite   to

resettlement, will be undertaken once possession of the land has

been  taken. However, preliminary investigations show that there

are  200 buildings, not in the sea, but in the area of Changi  -

200  buildings consisting of dwellings and shop-houses  on  this

land, and the majority are Chinese.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assure the hon. Member that resettlement will be undertaken

by the Housing and Development Board in accordance with the

normal policy and will be paid according to the progress of the

cutting of fill as and when required. No specific lay-out plans

have been drawn up for the area providing the fill, but once the

hills have been cut, the area will be levelled and will be made

available for various projects, including schools, housing, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I close my speech, Mr Speaker, Sir, I will just touch

shortly on the resettlement policy which is worrying the Member

for Tampines. Briefly, genuine farmers who are affected by any

development project will be compensated in accordance with

various rates, not only for the structures, but the trees and

the plants on their land. In addition, they are given a

rehabilitation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>

grant  of $1,000 per acre for land occupied by them. For

owner-occupiers  of  huts,  full compensation will  be  paid,

and  in addition  they will be eligible for Housing Board accommodation,

plus  a  transport grant of $100 and a disturbance allowance  of

$250. Even sub-tenants will be given Housing Board accommodation

and a transport grant of $50.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have with me, Mr Speaker, two schedules showing the rates

payable.  There are two types of rates, one called "compensation

rates"  and the other "replacement". Replacement rates are  paid

to  persons  occupying  authorised structures  and  compensation

rates are paid to those occupying unauthorised structures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the shortage of time, Mr Speaker, I cannot read all

this,  but  as  a comparison, the first item, the house  with  a

kitchen, concrete floor and drain, compensation rate $1 per  sq.

ft.,  replacement rate $2.50 per sq, ft. If the hon. Member  for

Tampines  is  interested, I will give him copies  of  these  two

rates setting out even the rates for a durian tree which may  be

removed,  $30 a plant, a rambutan tree $20 a plant. We have,  in

fact, the whole lot here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly in accordance with section 4 of the

Foreshores  Ordinance (Chapter 246) approves the reclamation  by

Government  of  that  portion  of  the  foreshore  and   sea-bed

containing  an  area  of  approximately  1,000  acres  from  the

junction  of  Bedok Road and East Coast Road to Tanjong  Rhu  as

delineated on the plan, marked "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO.

3/65", which is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this reclamation, Mr Speaker, Sir, is to

provide  a  suitable site for a sawmill estate. The  reclamation

will  be carried out by the Economic Development Board on behalf

of  the Government. The reclaimed land will be large enough  for

about  37  sawmills.  In allocating the site,  the  Economic  De

velopment  Board will give preference to those sawmill operators

who  are displaced as a result of other public projects, in case

we go into a debate on the eviction of squatter families, may  I

say  that a survey has been made in this area and that there are

only  three  squatter families affected -  two  Malays  and  one

Chinese  who  are  engaged in prawn pond operations.  All  three

families have been resettled elsewhere.

<div align="center"><b>BAN ON STRIKES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the

shortage of time I ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ho, for your information, the Assembly can

carry on till 8.30 p.m.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> It is my intention to focus the attention of

this House on two important aspects of the Central Government to

ban  strikes  which  perhaps might  have  been  missed  by  some

Members. They may not be fully aware of the repercussions of the

total  ban  on strikes on the trade union movement in Singapore.

It  is my contention, Sir, that the unprecedented action of  the

Central Government, apart from paralysing the infant trade union

movement in the Federation, might also cause grave damage to the

interest  of  the working class in Singapore.  Hence  it  is  my

intention,  Sir,  to  analyse in detail the seriousness  of  the

situation and also to bring to the limelight the extent to which

the  Emergency Power possessed by the Central Government can  be

misused to choke healthy trade unionism in Singapore. It  is  my

desire  to seek a solemn assurance from the State Government  in

general,  and the Minister for Labour in particular,  that  they

will  take  all  necessary steps to see  that  our  trade  union

movement,  which was built as a result of a series  of  struggle

commencing  from  the  year  1946  and  which  of  late  clearly

indicated maturity, solidarity and all other essential qualities

of  healthy  trade  unionism, should not  be  subjected  to  the

relentless and systematic persecution by a misguided Central Government  and  an  equally uninformed Malaysian Labour  Minister.

Further ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I shall not permit any debate which touches

on the Central Government. The Member will only debate the

question of how far the ban affects Singapore, what relationship

the ban has on Singapore and nothing more can be debated in

this House which touches upon the powers of the Central

Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I shall confine myself to that, Sir. Further,

can the State Government, which has responsibilities towards its

citizens,  permit  the Central Government to  scrap  the  solemn

Malaysia  Agreement which assures autonomy in labour? Since  the

problem  of  the day involves both the Centre and the  State,  I

wish  to make some general observations in regard to the  strike

ban as this has direct relevance to trade unionism in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government in Kuala Lumpur, Sir, after initiating a series

of anti-labour measures which included the outright rejection of

Ungku  Aziz's award, the refusal to register the M.T.U.C. under

the Trade Union Ordinance and the reluctance ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Ho, I have already mentioned that this

motion on the adjournment must confine itself to the labour  ban

in  so  far as it affects Singapore. What the Federation  Government  does  in the Federation is the business of the Federation,

and  I  will not permit any discussion on that aspect of  it  in

this Assembly. The proper place to raise that is elsewhere,  not

here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker. I will just mention it in

passing  to  make  my  point clear. In any way,  I  shall  avoid

touching  on Federal matters as much as possible. Here  I  would

like  to say that the Malaysian Labour Minister did mention that

even  though  for the present they do not extend the prohibition

on strikes to Singapore, nevertheless they could and might do it

if  the situation warranted such an action. His statement was  a

complete  negation of the autonomy in labour which Singapore  is

supposed  to  enjoy in the new Malaysian setup. But  the  Labour

Minister  claimed  that  the Emergency Powers  can  provide  the

Central  Government  with  a  legal  cloak  to  interfere   with

Singapore's  trade  union  affairs.  We  cannot  for  a   moment

understand  how  the  Centre  can deny  autonomy  in  labour  by

invoking  the Emergency powers. Once it is explicitly  expressed

in  an  agreement that there will be no interference  in  labour

matters   of   the  State,  no  government  which  substantially

subscribed to the letter and spirit of this agreement and  whose

Prime  Minister  attested his signature to the solemn  agreement

can  afford  to ignore completely, make a roundabout  turn,  and

attempt to choke the trade union movement in this country  under

some pretext or other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do sympathise with our brothers across the Causeway for

their shabby treatment from the Central Government. We are  also

determined  to  resist any attempt by the Central Government  to

interfere     in     the     trade     union     affairs      of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>

the  State.  In the past the colonial masters made  unsuccessful

attempts to throttle the trade union movement in Singapore.  The

imperialists  did, of course, reap good dividends which  finally

resulted in the elimination of colonialism in this country.  And

if the Central Government wants to follow in the footstep of the

colonialists,  I  can assure it, on behalf  of  the  workers  of

Singapore, that they will not stand idly by.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we were under the impression that Malaysia is a member of

the I.L.O. and subscribes to the sacred principles of that world

body.  But  the  contradictory policy followed  by  the  Central

Government,  which definitely was not in line  with  the  I.L.O.

Convention,  makes  one  wonder  whether  Malaysia,  like   some

countries   we   know,  is  out  to  breach  its   international

obligation. It is indeed a sad state of affairs that the leaders

of  this  nation, who have expressed the desire to see that  the

country  does  not  fall  prey to Communism,  are  now  creating

conditions which will provide opportunities for exploitation  by

anti-democratic elements. We hope, Sir, that even at  this  late

hour the Central Government will reassess their policy in labour

matters   and  permit  the  trade  union  movement  to  function

efficiently and effectively, and also state in categorical terms

that  they have no intention whatsoever of interfering in  trade

union affairs in Singapore and that they will always uphold  the

Malaysia  Agreement  which guarantees full labour  autonomy  for

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, turning to the State Government, we are quite eager to

know  what  they have done so far to clarify the situation  with

the  Central Government, and also to seek an assurance from  the

Centre  that labour autonomy will not be discarded by  extending

the  Emergency  Powers to Singapore. The State, I  am  sure,  is

fully  aware that today in Singapore there exists a  mature  and

responsible  trade  union  movement  which  definitely  has  the

interest  of  Malaysians at heart. Further, strike for  strike's

sake  has  never been our motto, and every industrial action  we

take  is essentially governed by the necessity to safeguard  the

interests of the workers. The establishment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>



of the Arbitration Court has smoothed relations between

the  employer and the unions, and today industrial relations  in

Singapore  can be favourably compared to those of  some  of  the

more   mature  democracies  elsewhere.  Any  extension  of   the

Emergency  Powers  of the Central Government to  Singapore  wiil

only turn the clock back, frustrate labour and finally strike at

the  very root of healthy unionism in Singapore. Thus it is  the

responsibility of the State Government to see that  the  present

trend continues in this State and that the Central Government is

not  allowed to extend its strong-arm tactics to create  inroads

into the many basic benefits enjoyed by the trade union movement

in  Singapore.  We request the State Government  not  to  remain

indolent but to take this matter up immediately witl1 the Centre

and  acquire  the necessary assurance, so that the workers  here

can   continue  to  build  constructive  and  responsible  trade

unionism  in  peace.  Otherwise we may  have  to  dissipate  our

energies  and  resources to the defence of the basic  rights  of

trade  unionism  which, until now, have not been  challenged  or

endangered.  We  hope and earnestly pray that such  a  situation

will  not  arise. Nevertheless, let me give a strong warning  to

those  who  are  out to destroy trade unionism in Malaysia,  for

ultimately  it is not trade unionism but they who will  get  the

worse of the struggle.



<br><br>8.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Moment of interruption. The motion for

adjournment  has lapsed. Mr Rajaratnam, will you  move  another

motion for adjournment? Thereupon, we can then proceed up to

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the House do now adjourn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Everyone throughout the world knows that all

those  who  wage war against organised labour have  to  retreat,

mauled  and beaten, simply because in all societies the  workers

constitute  the majority of people, and in a democratic  society

the  will  and  interest  of the majority  invariably  prevails.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Jek Yeun Thong, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  am  grateful to the Member for Bras Basah for enabling me  to

have this opportunity to state categorically once again that  we

do   not  allow  the  Central  Government  to  infringe  on  our

autonomous  rights in Labour and Education. We have no  use  for

emergency  powers to deal with our labour problems.  The  Member

for  Bras Basah, who is also the Chairman of the National Trades

Union  Congress, has expressed the concern of workers  over  the

ban  on  strikes  most  forcefully and sincerely.  This  ban  is

totally unwarranted even though the country is facing aggression

from  Indonesia.  That  we have to defend  our  country  no  one

denies.   But   is  the  situation  such  that  the  fundamental

democratic  rights of workers to strike should  be  one  of  the

first  to  be  axed? Even in the darkest days of the  Emergency,

when  the Communists were wrecking havoc throughout the country.

the  colonial government of the time did not see any reason  for

taking such drastic action. Any action which denies the right of

workers to strike uproots the very foundation of a trade  union,

for  without this fundamental right, a trade union might as well

cease  to  exist. The Singapore Government wants it to be  known

that it will seriously uphold what the Constitution says in  the

field of autonomy in Labour and Education. We will therefore not

permit  the  Central Government or anyone else  to  violate  our

constitutional  rights,  emergency  or  no  emergency.  The  two

regulations   promulgated  by  the  Central   Government   apply

throughout Malaysia, which means that the Singapore workers will

be equally affected as their counterparts elsewhere in Malaysia.

If,  however,  these regulations are used by the Central  Government  to  nullify what the Constitution guarantees us,  then  we

will  have  no alternative but to seek the unanimous support  of

this  House  to condemn the Central Government for violation  of

the very Constitution to which it is a party.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I regret to say that we were not consulted

before the essential regulations were promulgated. On the

afternoon of the 13th of May, 1965, a telephone call came

through from the Secretary for Labour, Kuala Lumpur, to my

Permanent Secretary. He was informed that the Central Government

Minister for Labour was about to announce in the next few

minutes at a meeting of employers and trade unionists the

promulgation of these regulations which were to be brought into

force the following day. I immediately contacted the Federal

Minister for Labour by telephone and asked him whether the

regulations applied to Singapore. He assured me that the Central

Government had no intention to interfere with labour matters in

Singapore. To clarify this, I issued a Press statement the next

day to the effect that the Singapore Government did not intend

to resort to Emergency Powers to resolve our labour disputes.

because our present laws were adequate to deal with that

situation. These two regulations were received by us only on the

17th of May, 1965. We then asked our legal officers to study the

implications of these regulations and their conclusions were

that the regulations were applicable to Singapore. On the 21st

of May, 1965, however, my counterpart in the Central Government

stated publicly that though the Central Government had no

intention to interfere with our labour matters, we were legally

bound by the essential regulations. Here we have an apparent

contradiction between the utterances of a Central Government

Minister and the expressed regulations. We do not know how the

intentions of a Minister and legality can be reconciled. If we

are legally bound, then it is the law which must prevail and not

the intention. If the intention is to prevail, then I say it

must be legally spelt out. So to back up their public statement,

the most sensible thing for them to do would be to amend the

regulations to exclude Singapore from the operation of these

regulations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the query by the Member for Brash Basah as to what

we  have  done  to  clarify  the  situation,  we  can  say  that

immediately  after we obtained legal opinion on the regulations,

we  wrote to the Central Government requesting them to amend the

regulations  to  exclude Singapore from the operation  of  these

regulations.  We  are  still awaiting  a  reply  from  them.  We

sincerely hope that they are wise enough to accept our  request.

They have already made a mess of their industrial relations  and

we  do not want them to pull us into the mess. It serves them no

benefit  at  all  to  try to interfere with  labour  matters  in

Singapore. If they persist in doing it, then they will only gain

the  bitterness and hatred of the workers of Singapore, as  they

have already done so in the Federation. I must assure the Member

for  Bras Basah that the Singapore Government will not shirk its

responsibilities to the workers and will ensure that  democratic

trade  unions can always function freely within the  State.  The

Malaysia Constitution clearly states that Labour and Education



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>



are  autonomous.  It  was  on  that  condition  that  we  joined

Malaysia. It was on that condition that we conceded to 15  seats

in  the  Parliament. If they violate that condition,  then  they

cannot  blame us for seeking new arrangements or for asking  for

more  seats in Parliament. There is no need for these  essential

regulations to apply in Singapore and, for that matter,  in  the

whole  of  the  Federation,  because  our  Industrial  Relations

Ordinance,  a  child of labour, employers and  governments,  has

worked successfully in reducing strikes and effecting settlement

of  disputes without banning the right of unions to strike. This

machinery  exists in Singapore, and it is this type of machinery

that will answer the industrial programmes of our times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.
