<div align="center"><b>ORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD FLATS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Married applicants under 21 years of age)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Encik Harun Bin A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Encik Harun Bin A. Ghani</b> asked the Minister for

National  Development (a) how many married couples under  the

age  of  21  have  applied to purchase or  rent  Housing  and

Development Board (HDB) flats from 1998-2000; (b) how many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>



such applications were rejected; and (c) whether the HDB will

relax  its  rules to enable such couples to buy or  rent  the

flats in the future.



<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr John Chen Seow Phun) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the HDB does not allow married couples under

the  age  of 21 to purchase HDB flats on their own.  This  is

because  persons below the age of 21 are deemed not  to  have

the  legal  capacity  to  enter into  any  contract  for  the

purchase  of a flat.  Such couples can consider applying  for

HDB  flats  with their parents as co-applicants,  or  staying

with  their parents until either one of them attains the  age

of 21 years.  HDB does not keep records on the number of flat

applications  that  were rejected due to both  parties  being

underage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, an applicant applying to rent a HDB flat must

be  at  least  21  years old.  Between  1998  and  2000,  HDB

rejected  seven applications to rent HDB flats  from  married

couples who are both below 21 years old.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the legal age of majority in Singapore is still 21

years old, HDB has no plan to lower the minimum age criterion

for the purchase or rental of a HDB flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head L -



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head L - Ministry of Education.

Amendment No. (1), Dr Wang Kai Yuen.



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head L of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the education of our children is a subject close to

our  hearts.  Every parent with a child in our school  system

has  suggestions on how to improve it.  Some of  these  ideas

sound very logical and it is tempting to tweak the system  to

incorporate  them.   For instance, when  pupil  workload  was

identified to be an issue, we reduced the course load.   Sir,

I surmise that step-wise improvements are useful, provided we

are  already  very  happy  with  our  existing  system.   But

sometimes  it  might be better if we perform a  total  review

and, where necessary, implement system-wide changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what we have got today is a very good system,

highly  productive and efficient.  All we have to  do  is  to

look  at the recent 'A' and 'O' level results, and from  that

perspective,  it is a system any education authority  in  the

world would envy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ours is a system designed by systems engineers where

pupils  are  sorted  according to their  learning  abilities.

From  primary 4 onwards, the school children are graded every

two  years, and streamed to different ability streams.  After

'O'  level,  they are channelled into different career  paths

according to their examination results.  Some 20%  go  on  to

universities, another 40% to the polytechnics and the rest to

ITE.   It  is  a  traditional system where rote learning  and

discipline  pay great dividends.  As a result,  we  send  our

children to schools to be educated.  They ended up being on a

treadmill whose speed is being cranked up one notch every  so

often,  because  there is a need to separate the  outstanding

from the merely good.  Stress is high.  And our children  end

up spending most of their time poring



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>



over books and pitifully little time in other activities such

as  sports that school-going children in other countries  are

engaged  in.  Many of our children do not enjoy school,  even

though they score very well in their examinations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is worthwhile for us to note that almost

every  education  system  in the  world  requires  a  12-year

education for the children before they are admitted into  the

university.   This  minimum period seems to  be  a  universal

norm.   Perhaps  it  has something to do  with  the  maturing

process  of the human mind.  However, because of our singular

focus  on knowledge acquisition, at every level of our school

system, our children out-perform their counterparts in  other

countries, in particular, some of the western countries.  But

once  our  young  men  and  women  graduated  from  a  4-year

university  degree programme, I surmise that they  emerge  no

better  than  the graduates from other overseas universities.

So,  the advantage gained in our school system seems, to  me,

to  be  short-term ones.  Therefore, my question is:   is  it

necessary  to  subject  our children to  study  so  much,  be

subject to so much stress prior to entering university  when,

after  graduation, they are almost back to the same level  as

others from a less stressful education system?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I think it is well-known in the university

education  circle  that no matter how we design  the  sorting

system,  be  it examinations or otherwise, it is very  likely

that  the same strong students will always emerge at the top.

Sir,  if  that  is the case, and if we do not have  permanent

long-term advantages, the question then is: why do we put our

children  through a pressure cooker system, so much  so  that

one young girl even took her own life for failing to meet  up

to  her own expectations?  I note that Dr Lily Neo has a  cut

on this subject and I would not go into this further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For years now, the Government has asserted that the

stress  in  the education system is not there as a result  of

any  Government policy.  The Minister has, in fact, responded

on  many occasions that even if he instructed the schools  to

ban all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>



homework,  it  would not have changed the situation  at  all.

The  simple  reason is that the parents would then  step  in,

take  over and hire tutors to ensure that their children stay

on  top.   So,  who  is responsible for  the  stress  in  our

education system  -  the parents or the system itself?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, parents' behaviours are indeed rational and

logical.   They want the best for their children.   They  are

equipping their children for the best jobs in the job market.

I surmise that they are just responding to the way our system

selects  candidates to fill the best jobs in the job  market,

in  particular, when they first graduate from the university.

At  that  stage, because of our transparency and our emphasis

on  meritocracy, individuals are chosen by the civil service,

the  GLCs  and  statutory boards based almost exclusively  on

their academic achievements.  Furthermore, because we have  a

scholarship  system, these candidates are chosen  soon  after

their  'A' level examination results, when most of  them  are

just 18 years old.  For the creme de la creme, good jobs  and

well-smoothened  career  paths  await  the  scholastic   high

achievers.  This is epitomised by the public  service,  which

only picks the very best.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there is no easier way to pick them than to

base  on scholastic achievement at that time.  I believe this

is  what  drives  the  competitive engine  in  our  education

system.  Examinations must be designed to separate the few at

the  apex  from the mere outstanding.  At the last 'A'  level

results, the number of students with 4 As, if you look at the

report,  is in fact very staggering.  Since we can no  longer

separate  the cream from the mere outstanding, we  introduced

the  S  paper into the examinations.  This intensity  to  get

better and better results in the examinations percolates down

the  whole system, from pre-university all the way to primary

school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if we were to address how to improve our

approach  to education, reducing course load to the  students

itself  is  not  enough.  We will still need  to  change  the

culture, starting with changing the selection process for the

best jobs in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>



job  market.  In this area, the Government will have to  take

the  lead if we are indeed committed to changing the culture.

To  start with, we should change the way candidates  for  the

best  jobs in the civil service are selected.  We should  de-emphasise  scholastic achievements and focus on  demonstrated

abilities.   Perhaps  we can learn from the  Singapore  Armed

Forces  how  they  select  the  officers,  where  the   total

capability of the individual is assessed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another possibility is for the Administrative Service to

rely  less on scholars, fresh out of the university,  and  to

tap matured talents from the open job market.  If the rest of

the  GLCs and the statutory boards take the cue, we could  be

on  our way to change the culture.  Once that message is made

loud  and  clear, I am sure the behaviour of the parents  and

students will change accordingly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, changing the culture of the whole society is

not  the  task  of  MOE  alone, but might  require  a  policy

decision  by  the Cabinet.  But change we must in  order  for

Singapore  to  continue  to do well  in  the  knowledge-based

economy.   Creativity and innovation are key  to  the  wealth

creating process in the KBE.  And without change, our current

education system would be found wanting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has given much thought to this issue.

I  think  the House would benefit from his comments  on  this

topic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam):</b> Sir, a common refrain

and  lament  we  hear these days are the heavy  workload  and

stress faced by students and teachers.  Here, I want to  echo

the  GPC  Chairman for Education, Dr Wang Kai  Yuen,  on  the

points he made.  Thus we hear the chorus of complaints  about

the  misgivings  expressed  in the school  ranking,  students

being  streamed into Gifted and Special Assistance Programme,

Express  and Normal streams, class size could be smaller  and

the  declining mental health of our children.  Sir, I believe

the  basic  concern is really the fear of parents that  their

child may not be able to cope and do well in school.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the pace of change has been frantic. So many

things  are happening.  I fear that our children are spending

too  much  time  on  the computers, since the  time  that  we

introduced  IT  in schools.  There are non-academic  subjects

and  healthy  sports  and recreational activities  which  our

children  should be learning and doing, but are  not.   There

are  so many demands, yet the time and resources are limited.

We  have  to  take  stock  of the individual's  capacity  and

capability and help them prioritize accordingly.  We have  to

help  our  children to organise themselves and  manage  their

time better as we adults do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents should know that their children have at least 40

years  of  active  working life ahead of  them.   To  have  a

headstart is to lay a strong foundation.  It requires patient

nurturing.  If the children need more time, we ought to  give

it to them.  We may wish to be quick, but we should not be in

a  hurry,  because  we understand "make haste,  less  speed".

Even  more  important is the inculcation of good  values  and

sound  principles in our young.  Parents themselves must  set

the right and good example for their children.  We seem to be

doing things for our young instead of showing them how.



<br>12.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to accept that our children have different gifts

and talent endowments.  We should not ask the children to  do

courses  and subjects that they are not interested in.   That

is  why  we  see  a  growing number of them dropping  out  of

medicine, legal practice and accountancy after graduation.  A

common  reason offered was that they were doing it for  their

parents.  How sad, they should be doing it for themselves and

be  proud  of it.  Mind you, we are talking about very  noble

professions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education can actively embark on a

comprehensive programme to guide the parents as to  how  they

should   educate   their  children  at  home.    Perhaps   in

partnership between the teachers and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>

parents,  we  can achieve better outcome in the progress  and

overall development of our children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister how he proposes to address the

common concern of heavy workload and stressful schooling  and

the  consequential  effects  on  our  parents,  teachers  and

students?



<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, last year, I spoke

about  the  education system that is mainly  focused  on  the

efficiency of delivery of subjects and lessons and  therefore

we  have  achieved  well  in terms of measures  like  scoring

straight   `A's,  ranking  of  schools  based   on   academic

excellence  and achieving top marks in international  Science

and  Mathematics competition.  The issue therefore is whether

the efficient education system has allowed us to produce good

innovators,  entrepreneurs, artists, sportsmen and  women  of

excellence in non-academic areas.  The real answer is that we

have limited success in these areas.  My main question to the

Minister  is:  what  has  he done in implementing  the  `mass

customisation'  approach in our education  system?   Can  the

Minister  give specifics of what he really means by the  mass

customisation programme and how he plans to implement this in

schools?   To-date, I am still confused as to what  it  means

and  not able to see the concrete examples of implementation.

Are  our  schools set up to allow customisation of  education

for  our  children  of differing abilities  or  are  we  just

categorising  our  children according  to  academic  learning

abilities, like we have been doing in the past?  How  are  we

ensuring that the system we have in place is able to identify

non-academic  talents and groom students of such  talents  to

achieve  their  full  potential?   Does  our  school   system

consider grooming students to achieve excellence in such non-academic  areas as important as those who have done  well  in

academic  areas?  I have to admit that to-date,  I  have  not

been   able  to  see  any  significant  impact  of  the  mass

customisation plans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spoken about streaming of our children at the

Primary  4  level  and I would like to touch  on  this  again

today.  Our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>



children  are so stressed these days, as we have  heard  from

our  previous two speakers, that I do not think many of  them

enjoy  going to school.  How then can we inculcate the  value

of  lifelong  learning  if  they  get  disillusioned  by  our

education  system at such an early age?  I have  seen  in  my

daughter's  school, it was examination period, where  a  girl

was  struggling not to go for her test, and her parents  were

pulling her on one end and the teacher and the principal were

all  encouraging her to go.  It was really a very distracting

sight for the children around her too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we survey all the education systems around the world,

we  are the only country in the world that does streaming  at

such  an  early age.  While the intended outcome is to  allow

every  child to learn at his or her pace, the actual  outcome

is  that  we label them and eliminate them or greatly  reduce

their  chances of getting back to the mainstream  Express  or

Normal  (Academic) streams.  Can the Minister give statistics

of  how many children streamed to the EM3 stream have made it

back  to EM1 or EM2 streams in the primary schools?  And  how

many EM3 students, who went to the Normal (Technical) stream,

made it back to the Normal (Academic) and Express streams?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I attended a function recently organised by CDAC,

MENDAKI and SINDA.  This is called Project Team, and we  have

heard  about  it in this House recently.  The  programme  was

intended  to  bring  children of various  races  and  streams

together in trying to inculcate a sense of community and bond-building  among themselves.  When I actually  asked  some  of

them,  many  of them right from the beginning when  they  got

together, segregated themselves according to the streams that

they came from, and basically treated each other differently.

Those  from  the lower streams seem to be having  self-esteem

issue and those from the higher streams seem to have a `high-class'  feeling issue.  If we start to develop this  kind  of

attitude  at early ages, we will see real problems when  they

grow up as adults in the country.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also curious to find out what programmes have been

put  in place to promote creativity and lifelong learning  in

our  schools.  Particularly, have there been any  changes  in

the  curriculum which develop the creative mind and inculcate

the  value of lifelong learning?  I myself have not seen  any

evidence  of this being done.  In fact, we still continue  to

focus  on  the  academic issues and measures,  and  therefore

there have not been many changes.  And I do not think we will

see  any impact in trying to develop creativity and the issue

of lifelong learning among our children.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, lest we get carried

away  with  the notion that our education system is  full  of

warts and problems, I do want to bring the focus back to  the

point  that,  overall,  we  have  a  good  education  system.

Certainly  that  is the feedback I get from parents  and,  in

general,  observers  both within and  outside  Singapore.   I

think   the  fact  that  we  are  raising  issues  that   are

qualitative in nature suggests that we want to make  it  even

better.  It would be a far greater cause of concern for us if

we  are  complaining about the quality of the instruction  we

get in our schools, or that our students are not measuring up

when we compare them with international standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in part, that is due to the various initiatives

that the Ministry has undertaken over the last few years,  in

particular,  focusing on the hardware in terms  of  improving

facilities, the systems through school evaluation models  and

information technology, and so on.  Also, it has demonstrated

a focus on perhaps the most important element - the teachers,

the  people  who make the system work.  In that  regard,  the

terms of employment for teachers are important.  Salaries and

benefits  are an essential part.  One does not want to  over-emphasise this because I think there is more to a career than

just  the  pay  and the benefits, but this  is  an  essential

element.   And  I would be pleased to know from the  Minister

what initiatives would be taken in that regard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, as importantly, what other initiatives are

being undertaken to enhance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>



the   work   experience  of  our  teachers  in   the   school

environment?  A common complaint is administrative load,  and

that  leading  to  stress.  Are there other measures  we  can

undertake through employment of additional support  staff  or

in terms of providing them with customised IT solutions which

might  minimise  these forms of burden in  the  eyes  of  the

teachers  so that they can concentrate on what they do  best,

which is, teach students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one feedback that we have obtained from the GPC for

Education is that perhaps in our education system, a  certain

prosaic  utilitarian attitude is emerging.  Evidence of  that

would  be  in the form of the choice of subjects our students

seem to be gravitating towards, with a particular emphasis on

the Sciences and Mathematics and away from the softer, harder-to-score subjects like the Humanities.  We have heard that in

some  of  the top schools, due to emphasis among the students

themselves, by choice, there would appear to be a  move  away

from English Literature.  If they must do an Arts subject and

as  required by the schools, they would prefer to do  history

or  geography,  because it is easier  to  score  than  to  do

Literature, which generally, it seems, is a harder subject in

which  to  get an `A' or a distinction.  This is attributable

to   many  causes   -  that  we  over-emphasise  Science  and

Mathematics,  that  schools are too geared towards  achieving

quantitative results, because of the ranking system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, whatever the cause, the question really is: is

this  an  example of market failure perhaps in our  education

system?  In this day and age, when we are emphasising a broad-based  education  where we want to ensure that  our  students

come  out  with the capability to channel their energy  in  a

broad  range of areas of endeavour, because the needs of  the

environment,  the economy, and our society  are  changing  so

fast,  would  it not be important for us to ensure  that  our

students  have  a  broad-based  approach  in  their  attitude

towards education?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1144</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister: is this a cause for

concern at this point?  Is there a marked trend?  If  it  is,

is it a cause for concern?  In particular, is this an example

of  perhaps  a  market failure where some form of  Government

intervention  might be justified?  Just as, for example,  one

could  argue that the choice of mother tongue as an  academic

subject  might  not  be high on the list of  priority  for  a

student  because of the difficulty to score points,  but  the

Government has seen fit to emphasise it as an essential  part

of  education  process.  Could we adopt  a  similar  attitude

towards the humanities?  If we do adopt such an attitude, how

can  we  structure the system to ensure that this becomes  an

essential part of the total education experience our students

have in schools?



<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, our education

system  continues to be a topic that generates what we should

perhaps  simply  describe  as "animated  conversation"  where

anywhere  and  anytime, you find a gathering of  Singaporeans

who are parents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four Members before me have spoken on various

aspects  of  our  education  system  that  cause  stress  and

distress  to parents and children.  Sir, we have  a  dilemma.

The  Ministry's view is that the fundamental problem lies  in

parents'   unrealistic  expectations   of   their   children.

Parents,  on the other hand, are equally convinced  that  the

problem essentially resides in the rigidity of an unforgiving

system.    When  you  analyse  the  stories  and  experiences

recounted,  the  issues  may be grouped  largely  into  three

categories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first relates to the thorny issue of our values - our practice of reducing everything to economics, of

measuring  success and the dollars and cents that  come  with

the  high-paying  jobs  that  come  to  those  with  academic

achievements that drive our parents to drive their children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second set relates to the many individual anecdotes

of  teachers  who are less sensitive and less nurturing  than

what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1145</b></font><br><br>



would  be  considered adequate and satisfactory to guide  and

help our children develop to the best of their abilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third set relates to principals. The Ministry has

on  occasions before pointed out that it has over  the  years

been  responsive  in  reviewing  policies,  for  example,  in

reducing curriculum load.  Therefore, a number of operational

issues,  such as, for example, starting times of  the  school

day,  principals  have  been  given  full  autonomy  to  make

decisions.   It seems, however, that some principals  may  be

over-zealous in pursuing academic results and rankings on the

one  hand,  or possibly not taking advantage of the  autonomy

delegated to them on the other.  However, when you hear  good

stories of good schools, invariably, I think, you will find a

good  principal with initiative, supporting and managing  his

or her staff well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you look at the problem of values, that is

something that the Ministry of Education cannot solve on  its

own  and which takes a long time to evolve and resolve.  When

you  look at the anecdotes that relate to teachers, I  really

do  not  know  how  one  can go about  ensuring  that  25,000

teachers perform consistently up to the standards that we all

want for the instruction of our children.  So it seems to  me

that  the  best  bet  we may have that would  enable  a  more

immediate   better  management  of  parents'  anxieties   and

frustrations  is  to  pull out all stops  and  focus  on  the

identification  and accelerated development of  good  dynamic

principles  to  optimise  the  management  of  resources  and

operation  of  issues  and the insightful  implementation  of

policies  at individual school level.  I recognise that  300-plus  good  principals sound a lot more manageable  a  number

than  25,000  good teachers.  But it is still a  tall  order.

However, by grouping or clustering schools together  and  the

assignment of particularly strong principals so that they may

be  well  distributed  among the  clusters  could  achieve  a

multiplier effect.



<br>1.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one more thing, Sir, that is needed and that is

to be sure that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1146</b></font><br><br>



measures  of  performance must be clear and  consistent  with

policy directions so that principals are not incentivised  to

behave in incongruent ways.  In other words, for example, the

Ministry says that ranking of schools in academic performance

is  not  the  be-all  and the end-all and  other  things  are

important  too, then principals' performance,  appraisal  and

progress in their careers should reflect that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Minister will take my observations into

consideration  as an attempt at a shorter term solution  even

as we grapple with the longer term and even more difficult to

resolve  issues  and  challenges  in  the  education  of  our

children.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, the Ministry of

Education  has  been scoring highly in preparing  Singaporean

children  academically  and is now  endeavouring  to  further

educate and equip them to face the information technology and

new  economy age.  Thus far, MOE has been concentrating  more

on imparting knowledge to the children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, for an ideal education, MOE should treat the

education of our children in a more holistic way.  The  well-being  of  the  children, such as their mental  state,  their

social  requirements and their physical needs, should be  the

concern of all the teachers as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, teachers should not just concentrate on teaching

them  the  academic syllabus.  They are very much in  contact

with  our  children  and are ideally  suited  to  take  added

interest  and  be  concerned with their students  in  a  more

holistic way.  They should also teach and help them cope with

life.  I am not, in any way, suggesting that we diminish  the

responsibilities of parents.  I am suggesting  that  teachers

be  equipped with skills and encouraged to identify  students

with  difficulties, be it social, mental or  even  financial,

and refer them for assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, 2,358 new cases of children aged below 18 were

registered   at  the  Government  psychiatric  clinics.    As

mentioned earlier by Dr Wang Kai Yuen,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>



only  recently, a 12-year old student jumped  to  her  death.

Sir, could stress, maybe due to the heavy school load or  the

unrealistic expectations of parents, be the cause?   Perhaps,

our  children should also be taught how to cope  with  stress

from  young  to  attain their maximum potential.   The  early

detection of those children who are vulnerable to stress will

save them from poor performance and mental breakdown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be effective, schools have no choice but to get

involved  with  some parents.  This area  must  be  expanded.

Often  times,  we  need to solve problems  at  the  root  and

sometimes the parents may have to be advised.  Sir, it  would

also  be  worthwhile for the Ministry of  Education  and  the

schools  to  put in more effort to alleviate the anxiety  and

better  inform  the  parents on issues,  such  as  streaming,

banding, and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A holistic and comprehensive education would be ideal in

helping  parents  with  school-going kids  balance  work  and

family commitments. We may, perhaps, try matching work  hours

with  school hours.  Sir, since we are tending towards single

session  schools, we can have the children stay back  in  the

school  to  do  "homework" or have "remedials"  whilst  their

parents  are still at work.  Another way of helping  parents,

especially  those who are working, is to organise  the  extra

curricular   pursuits  collectively  in  the  schools   after

classes.   This  will  save parents  having  to  ferry  their

children  to and from different places for these hobbies.   I

would like again to plead with the Minister for Education  on

another item.  Would he give the directive for our schools to

start  later so that children do not have to wake up  in  the

wee hours each morning?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge the Minister for Education to look

into  the  above issues favourably.  Sir, can I go on  to  my

next cut on stressful education?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, I doubt many will fault our education

system in Singapore in terms of first rate facilities and  in

terms  of  fantastic  academic results.   But  does  such  an

enviable success status come with a price?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study by Dr Stella Quah of the National University

of  Singapore on the "The Singapore Family" revealed that the

greatest  worry  for  about 45% of  families  came  from  the

problems   associated   with  their   children's   education.

Singaporean parents have also frequently mentioned children's

education  as the contributory factor in opting  for  smaller

families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, is there any possibility in getting the excellent

result without getting "The Singapore Family" so stressed up?

If  so,  what are the steps that must be taken?  In this  new

economy  and information technology age, stressful education,

be  it real or perceived, is a very compelling reason for  us

to  improve  the  teaching  and  learning  processes  of  the

education here.  The past practice of rote learning should be

changed towards emphasis on understanding and application  of

subjects.   I agree with my parliamentary colleague,  Mr  Loh

Meng  See,  that it is time to look into our teaching  method

and  syllabus in our schools.  Sir, the syllabus needs to  be

revamped  to make it less demanding so that the teachers  can

complete  it  and the students can understand what  has  been

taught.   Overloading pupils unnecessarily with homework  and

tests  should  be  minimised.   Worse  still,  we  would   be

expecting  students to master by themselves those  topics  in

certain subjects that cannot be covered in the classes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans, Sir, spend as much as $30 million each

year on their children's tuition.  This is far too much.  Why

is  there such a need for so much tuition?  It will be a good

idea if our schools can provide some sort of tutorial classes

after  normal school hours, not for giving the children extra

work but for helping them cope with their homework.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criteria for the ranking of schools may have to be

expanded to lessen the emphasis on academic achievements  and

grade scores.  More weightage should be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1149</b></font><br><br>



given  for  other  markers relevant  to  the  present  times.

Ranking  should take attainments in developing the potentials

of  students in information technology, in sports and in  the

arts  into  consideration.  Sir, this will ease much  of  the

pressure put upon students, parents as well as teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is every parent's aspiration to see his or her

children  attain  tertiary education.  But not  all  children

have  the  same  capabilities and there  are  certainly  many

variants.  Having flexibility in varsity-entry criteria  will

ease the stress from many students and parents.  Expansion in

this  area will be useful.  Parents can then settle down  and

allow  their children to develop their own unique  potentials

though they may not conform to the norm.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Ministry of Education will consider the

suggestions I have made.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, neighbourhood

schools are the main providers of education for our children.

While  parents  are  not happy with the  standards  of  these

schools, they are horrified of the behaviour of the students.

This   is   generally  how  the  neighbourhood  schools   are

perceived.   We need to correct this perception  for  it  has

serious  repercussion on the community.  If  a  neighbourhood

school  is  perceived as being problematic, good students  in

the community would not want to go there.  Firstly, this will

put  pressures on the good schools and frustrates  successful

students and their parents.  Secondly, by failing to  attract

good  students,  the  quality of  the  student  body  in  the

neighbourhood schools will drop.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that a school with a poor image saps the

self-esteem  and  morale of its students.  The  teachers  and

principals  are probably similarly affected.  Low esteem  and

morale leads to poor behaviour which explains the behavioural

problems of these students.  The situation is aggravated when

the  quality of the student body drops.  It thus goes into  a

vicious cycle with the problems worsening with the years.  We

must break this vicious cycle.  Can the Ministry do more  for

our neighbourhood schools, especially



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1150</b></font><br><br>



those poorly perceived by the community?  Can more resources,

such as teachers, be provided?  With more teachers, the class

size  can  be  smaller so that each student can receive  more

care  and  attention  and help.  This  will  be  particularly

helpful with English Language teachers as the standard of the

language is generally low in neighbourhood schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Ministry to give more attention to our

neighbourhood  schools.   These are  the  main  providers  of

education for our young in the community.  The well-being  of

our  schools  bears  upon  the  quality  of  our  young.   As

neighbourhood schools are an integral part of the  community,

I  also  urge the schools to work with our community leaders.

I  am sure that our community leaders are eager to help build

schools that the community can be proud of.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, our

school  system  has undergone major changes and restructuring

over  the past two to three decades.  Tremendous improvements

have  been  made and great efforts have been put  in  by  the

Ministry  to  prepare our students in recent  years  for  the

challenges of a new knowledge-based economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, the Ministry of Education has devolved

greater  autonomy to some schools, some pre-selected schools,

using basically two schemes.  One is the independent schools,

and  the  other is the autonomous schools.  These are  indeed

steps  in  the  right direction.  With greater  independence,

there  has  been  more  creativity and motivation  among  the

administration  and  teaching staff  to  serve  the  students

better.   Each  effort  has certainly,  in  my  view,  helped

students  perform  better in schools and have  also  nurtured

better all-round development in our students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the next step, I wonder if it is the appropriate

time  to  allow  private organisations to  run  some  of  our

schools.   I  am  saying beyond what is  practised  now,  ie,

Government-aided    schools,   allow    completely    private

organisations  to  run  some of our Government  schools.   In

other words, I wonder if it is feasible to privatise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1151</b></font><br><br>



some of our schools beyond the concept of independence of our

Government-aided schools.  While the Ministry should not  let

go  everything, make it laissez-faire, it should set  certain

preconditions on curriculum, discipline and other basics, and

in  return for some Government funding.  I wonder if it would

be  interesting to evaluate and perhaps set up a pilot scheme

to  allow commercial organisations, particularly, educational

organisations, either local or foreign, to run  some  of  our

schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the concept will not be entirely similar. It is,

in  some  ways,  like what the Government has  done  for  our

university by setting up a private university, the  Singapore

Management  University.   Sir,  the  Ministry  has  begun  to

introduce greater creativity and put less emphasis on content

and  greater enrichment modules have been added to the school

curriculum, allowing the appropriate private operators to run

our schools and produce even more outstanding results in this

direction.  It is certainly worth experimenting this,  and  I

wonder  if  the  Minister  can  give  this  suggestion   some

consideration.



<br>1.15 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, every child in

our  schools is born differently.  Each has his  or  her  own

level  of  intelligence, but our school system  assumes  that

every  child has an IQ of 120.  This is the level of IQ which

every  university  graduate is supposed to  possess,  and  it

imposes  a  heavy  load of school work on them  from  primary

school  onwards and, at the same time, stream them at Primary

4,  and again at Primary 6.  Primary 6 is the level when they

sit for their Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long ago, I read in the papers that parents

complained  of the difficulty of the Mathematics and  English

papers.   They said that even adults did not know how  to  do

those   papers,  how  then  could  the  children  pass  their

examinations based on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1152</b></font><br><br>



those  papers?  Not only parents have complained.  The  Prime

Minister,  Mr Goh Chok Tong, himself commented  that  he  was

shocked  to  see  from Primary 1, the children  are  learning

words which he would not have known until Primary 4 or 5.  It

was reported in the Straits Times of 22nd January.  The Prime

Minister asked the Education Minister, "Is the school  system

too  stressful?"  My view is that, for children  who  do  not

have  particularly high IQ, and for children  who  are  late-developers, the answer, of course, is yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our school system, with a heavy curriculum, is too

stressful, because there are reports in our local press  that

our  primary school kids are being sent by their  parents  to

psychiatrists for treatment.  Parents are worried  for  their

children, because they know that if their children are unable

to  pass  the  PSLE,  they shall be  branded  as  rejects  or

failures  and streamed to the slow-learner Normal stream.   I

think  the  psychological harm done to those children  at  an

early  age  can  have an adverse effect on their  self-worth,

self-esteem,  self-respect and self-confidence.   They  shall

grow  up  forever feeling that way.  It is important  that  a

child  has  self-confidence, otherwise, it  is  going  to  be

difficult for him to succeed when he grows up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to make our school less

stressful by not imposing such a heavy workload on our school

children,  especially  at  the  primary  school   level.    A

committee  should be set up to look into how  to  lessen  the

heavy curriculum in our schools.  It would be a sad day  when

our  children end up as mental patients and who are not  able

to  take charge of their own lives and their own affairs when

they  grow  up.  They shall become a liability to the  state.

Children are our future assets, and we cannot afford to  lose

any one of them, if we can help it.  As it is, our birth rate

is already declining.



<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, over the last two years, the Ministry

has conducted a review of the teaching and learning of mother

tongue in our schools, in particular, on CL, ML and TL.   The

outcome  of the review was an announcement on various changes

to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1153</b></font><br><br>



curriculum and methods of teaching, and that these were to be

implemented over the next few years in a gradual manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of the review were welcomed by many

Singaporean  parents and students as a way  to  differentiate

the  teaching  of mother tongue in our schools, according  to

the abilities and inclinations of our students.  I would just

like  to ask the Minister for an update on the implementation

of  the  recommendations arising from the review, and whether

there  has been any feedback or reason to further refine  the

recommendations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Goh Choon Kang is not here. Mr Low

Thia Khiang.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in

order  to  attain  the IT 2000 objectives, the  Ministry  has

required that a certain amount of time be set aside to  apply

IT  in  the  teaching  of  the  various  subjects,  including

Chinese.  Development of software for the teaching of Chinese

in  Singapore  has  to start from scratch, as  the  softwares

previously developed in Taiwan and China are not suitable for

Singapore  because  of the low level and narrow  syllabus  of

Chinese in the schools in Singapore. Over the last few years,

our  Chinese  teachers have suffered all  kinds  of  torment.

Apart from learning computer and IT knowledge, they have also

to  spend  a  lot of time in the development  and  design  of

software for the teaching of Chinese in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do not know how effective, or whether there

is  any  value-added effect to the teaching of  Chinese  with

these softwares.    First of all, the teaching of language is

different  from  the  teaching of other subjects  because  in

language,  the  main  emphasis  is  on  listening,  speaking,

reading  and  writing, whereas for the  other  subjects,  the

emphasis is on the absorption of knowledge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there are many multimedia softwares in the

teaching  of Chinese. What effects have they on the  teaching

of  Chinese?   Would they really arouse the interest  of  the

students in the learning of Chinese?   I think it is the  way

it is taught



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1154</b></font><br><br>



and the personality of the teachers that make the difference.

A  resourceful  teacher can bring life to the  classroom  and

command the respect and attention of the students.  Only then

can   the   students  find  the  learning  of   the   subject

interesting.   I am not against the use of IT technology  for

the  teaching of Chinese.  What I want to know is whether  or

not  this  computerisation  of  Chinese  teaching  would   be

worthwhile  and  whether or not it has  added  value  to  the

teaching of Chinese in Singapore?  Or is all this fuss  being

kicked up just because the officials concerned are trying  to

fulfill the objectives set down by the Ministry of Education?

I hope that we will review the effects of this IT application

in the teaching of Chinese.



<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I

would like to talk about creative learning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, Mr Chiam lamented on the degree of

difficulties in the Mathematics syllabus and that parents are

not  able  to help their children.  We have now entered  into

the  21st  century,  and we should not  remain  in  the  19th

century.  There are changes in the high technologies  in  the

21st  century.   Our  pupils, I  think,  rank  first  in  the

International Mathematics Competition.  What is important  is

that  students  should  understand  the  subject,  not  their

parents.   When I was young, I could not even read ABC.   But

my  two-year grandson is already able to recognise from A  to

Z.   Therefore, we should not put any restrictions on pupils'

might.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to talk about the language competence among

the  "O"  level  and "A" level students.  I have  found  that

their  writing ability is far from satisfactory.   Therefore,

we  need  to  double  our efforts in  this  aspect.   If  our

students have to spend a lot of time on the learning  of  the

language,  and  yet can only listen and speak in  the  mother

tongue  but not able to write it well, I can understand.  But

when  they  cannot even write properly in the first language,

then  something must be seriously wrong somewhere.  Recently,

I  came  across  many students who could not write  a  proper

letter  to apply for a job.  This reminds me of the so-called

writing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1155</b></font><br><br>



ability  crisis that took place in the US in the 70s.   There

were  23 million Americans who were only semi-literate.  They

could  only  read  simple advertising materials  and  labels.

They  were  not  able to read articles in the newspapers  and

magazines, and university undergraduates could not even write

a proper essay.  A highly-qualified manager could not write a

proper  note.   Many Government officers and scientists  were

therefore  asked to attend crash courses in  writing.   I  am

talking about the crisis in America because I am worried that

the same writing crisis might occur in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now in a very advanced high-tech society.

Watching  TV  and  surfing  the Internet  have  replaced  the

reading  of  newspapers,  and  phone  calls  and  email   are

gradually   replacing  letter-writing.   Going  on   to   the

Internet, we can  communicate to someone thousands  of  miles

away at the click of the mouse.  Jargons and short forms  are

used  unreservedly over the emails, eg, "by the way" is typed

as  "BTW",   "for  your  information" is  "FYI",  etc.   What

worries me is that if our students are not able to use  their

pen  to write, then their writing ability will drop.  You may

say   that  we  have  essay-writing  competitions  among  the

students and their results are good, but this happens only to

those  who  are  the  cream  in the  schools,  the  very  top

students.   Those  students  who  are  not  so  good  in  the

languages  will  never  be selected  to  take  part  in  such

competitions.  Therefore, we cannot measure the  standard  of

the  writing  ability of our students in general  by  looking

just at the results of the essay-writing competitions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I hope that the Ministry could strengthen the

teaching  of writing through creative education.   We  should

encourage  pupils to read and write more, so  that  they  can

write presentable minutes and reports.  The class should read

all  sorts of books, and not just the same old textbook,  and

that  we  should make it a rule that every student must  read

certain articles from the Straits Times and the Lianhe Zaobao

and to comment on them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1156</b></font><br><br>



These  comments or reports would then be marked and  assessed

by  the  teachers.  Only through this method will the writing

ability  of our pupils be raised and satisfaction be  derived

out  of  writing.   I  hope  the  Minister  can  consider  my

suggestion.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Sir,

in  his  National  Day  Rally Speech  last  year,  the  Prime

Minister  said that he was prepared to increase  spending  on

education from 3.6% to perhaps 4.5% of GDP over the next  few

years, provided of course that the funds are put to good use.

This year, the Minister for Finance has indeed increased  the

Ministry  of Education's budget by $480 million, an  increase

of  8%,  and  this  is higher than this year's  expected  GDP

growth  rate  of  5%-7%.   So we  are  moving  in  the  right

direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these additional resources, the Ministry of

Education will be able to implement worthwhile programmes  to

bring us closer to realising our vision of "Thinking Schools,

Learning  Nation"  and  making  an  Ability-Driven  Education

happen,  so  that all our people can receive  a  well-rounded

education and are developed to their full potential.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our priorities this year are in three broad areas.

First,  our  schools; second, post-secondary  and  continuing

education; and, third, the pre-school sector.



<br>1.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our schools, we will see through the major programmes

initiated  in  the  last few years, such as  the  Information

Technology Masterplan; bringing all our schools up to  modern

standards through rebuilding and improvements under PRIME;  a

more  well-rounded  and  creative curriculum;  and  promoting

excellence  both  in  teaching  and  administration  in   our

schools.  But the real focus of my Ministry for schools  this

year  will  be  teachers  - recruiting  and  developing  good

teachers  and making sure that we have enough of them  to  do

all  the good things that we want to do in the coming  years.

Good  teachers are the key to all that we do. They give  life

and reality to all the good things we want to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>



do  in  education, and deliver the quality education  with  a

human touch that our children need.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a strong school system, the other key pieces of the

educational  process  are the pre- and  post-school  sectors.

This year, the Ministry of Education will be putting in place

more  pieces to strengthen the education system at both  ends

of  the  education time continuum.  At the front end  of  the

continuum, my colleague, Dr Aline Wong,  will say more  later

today about what steps we will be taking from now on to raise

the  quality  of  pre-school education  to  provide  a  sound

beginning  for  all our children. At the  other  end  of  the

education  time continuum, Mr Peter Chen will tell  you  more

about  expanding opportunities for further education  in  our

post-secondary   sector,   to   provide   Singaporeans   with

opportunities  to  acquire  and  update  their   skills   and

knowledge for the new economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that as we get down to discuss individual

issues in detail, this broad overview of our priorities  will

help  Members place the discussion on education today  within

the larger context of what we are working to achieve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this segment, I will address Members' questions on

current  initiatives  in our school  system.   Last  year,  I

informed  this House that the Ministry of Education  aims  to

move  towards ability-driven education to develop and harness

the  talents  of  our students.  By customising  learning  to

different needs and abilities, we aim for an education system

that  provides  students of all abilities with  an  education

that maximises their potential.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not there yet, but we are making progress. Mr

Inderjit   Singh   asked  what  we  are   doing   with   mass

customisation.  Mass customisation has been a feature of  our

education  system for many years.  Our streaming system  more

closely  matches  curriculum  and  the  pace  and  method  of

learning with the abilities and aptitudes of our children  so

that  each  student can proceed at his or her own  pace.   Mr

Chiam  was talking about a curriculum which is too heavy  and

which appears to be catering only to the most able students.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1158</b></font><br><br>



I   therefore  assume  that  he  is  a  strong  supporter  of

streaming,   because  streaming  addresses   precisely   this

problem,  ie,  providing  a  differentiated  curriculum   for

students of different abilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a system, streaming is better than requiring every

student  to fit into only one prescribed programme of  study.

Indeed, the more we want education to be customised, what  we

would  end up with are more streams and sub-streams.  Through

streaming  and giving those who need it a lighter  curriculum

or  more  time,  we  have  reduced  educational  wastage  and

successfully  raised  the  educational  attainment   of   our

students.  In 1980, before streaming, only 58% of a Primary 1

cohort  completed secondary school.  By the  year  2000,  the

proportion was 93%.  The alternative to streaming is not that

everyone  will suddenly be able to pass in the top stream  or

Express  stream.  The alternative to streaming is  that  many

children will fail and they will drop out of school and  they

will  not be there in any of the other streams.  That is  the

real  alternative to streaming.  That was where  we  were  in

1980  when  only 58% completed secondary school, compared  to

93% today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh asked how many people actually made

the  transition from one stream to another.  There  are  some

statistics here.  In 1999, 382 Secondary 1 Normal (Technical)

students  transferred  from  Normal  (Technical)  to   Normal

(Academic) stream in Secondary 2, and another 347 Secondary 1

Normal  (Academic)  students  transferred  to  the  secondary

Express  stream.   The system is an open  one.   We  must  be

realistic and give the students the curriculum and  the  time

to be able to learn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, 38% of Normal (Academic) stream students

who  took their "O" level in 1999 entered the polytechnic  or

pre-university  institutions.  If they were  not  given  five

years,  rather than four years, to do their "O" levels,  they

might  not have made it at all.  This is the real alternative

if we want to do away with streaming.  I would ask Members to

think about it carefully.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of this, for mass customisation, we now also have

programmes to cater to students with a range of aptitudes and

abilities who need more support. We have the Gifted Education

Programme  and  elective programmes in  languages,  arts  and

music.    The  Ministry  of  Education  is  also  encouraging

autonomous  schools  to develop niche areas  to  nurture  the

talents  and  abilities of their students.   School  clusters

have  set  up  centres  for music, the arts  and  science  to

provide  enrichment  for  students  with  the  aptitude   and

interest.  We  support the establishment of a  sports  school

under  the  auspices of the Ministry of Community Development

and  Sports.  But whether or not we would have top sportsmen,

as Mr Inderjit Singh hopes and which I hope too, also depends

on  the  talents  we have in our talent pool,  and  also  the

inclination  and desire of students and parents  to  want  to

pursue this line.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo said that schools should look out for weaker

students  and  those  facing problems so  that  they  can  be

assisted.  Other MPs have also spoken about helping kids  who

are  weaker.   Not  all the programmes in mass  customisation

have  an academic focus, not all are examinable, and not  all

are  for the top kids.  Many are simply there to cater to the

interests  of the students to enrich their experiences.   And

we have programmes to support students who need more support.

Last  year,  for example, we introduced the "B" syllabus  for

those  who  have difficulties coping with the  mother  tongue

languages.  And we have the Learning Support Programme, which

has  been  operating for some years now, which is implemented

in  all  our primary schools which help P1 and P2 pupils  who

are  weak  in  English.   There  is  also  the  programme  to

Encourage Achievement and Better Learning (ENABLE) to support

students who are not achieving their potential.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principals and teachers want to do their best for

their  students, and they run many programmes to  help  their

students,  such  as remedial classes for academically  weaker

students, or enrichment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>



programmes and co-curricular activities. The community  helps

too through programmes organised by the self-help groups.   I

do  not  mind parents also helping their children with  work,

sometimes  with tuition too.  Of course, they should  not  go

overboard.  It is not something which the school can entirely

do and it is not something that I can stop if parents want to

do more for their children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents play the most important part in partnering

schools to support, motivate and encourage their children  to

do  the best that they can, and yet, to know when not to push

them  too  far,  or  too  hard.   Parents'  expectations  and

attitudes  have  a  strong  bearing  on  the  stress   levels

experienced by our young and how our young cope with  school.

I  know it is not easy to be a parent, having some experience

myself, and all of us want to do the best that we can for our

children. Schools too want to do the best that they  can  for

their students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents and schools need to work together to bring out

the best from our children, be it streaming, examinations  or

remedial  lessons, or enrichment or CCA, so that  programmes,

which  are  designed to provide a range of opportunities  and

support   to  various  groups  of  students  with   different

abilities  and aptitudes, do not become a source  of  anxiety

for parents and their children. Streaming at Primary 4 is one

example.  There is no point overloading children with  higher

mother tongue in EM1 if they do not have the aptitude or  are

unable to cope.  We should remember that the final choice  of

which  stream  to place their child in after P4  really  lies

with  the  parents.  We have many parents who opt to  do  the

more  demanding EM1 stream for their children, and  very  few

who opt out of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, stress comes from a mismatch between

expectation  and  achievement.   The  education  system,  and

indeed  our society and families, can offer so much  more  to

our  young  people  today - not just  in  school,  but  piano

lessons,  extra  tuition, holidays abroad, computers  -  that

there is just so much on the plate to choose from and compete

for time and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>



attention.   But  the  day and the year have  not  grown  any

longer.  I suppose that psychiatric care for some children is

a  manifestation  of the increased complexity  of  life  that

young  people  today  face.  To deal  with  stress,  schools,

parents and society need to understand that while we want the

best  for  our children, we, all of us, should not push  them

beyond  their  limits.   Children  are  different  in   their

potential  and  their  needs, and we need  to  encourage  and

support them to do the best that they are able to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate the partnership between schools, parents

and the wider community in nurturing and helping our young to

grow,  Parent-Teacher Associations or Parent  Support  Groups

have  been set up in many schools. These provide parents with

an  avenue to work with the school for the benefit  of  their

children's education and welfare.  Parent-teacher conferences

may  also be initiated by the parent or the teacher any  time

during  the  year  to  discuss the  child's  development  and

performance in school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To complement the efforts of schools in building home-school links, an advisory committee called COMPASS,

comprising  representatives from the community  and  parents,

and  chaired by myself, was set up two years ago in 1999. The

role   of   COMPASS   is  to  promote  and   strengthen   the

collaboration between schools, parents and the  community  in

ensuring the wholesome and total development of our children.

We  have distributed to Members the COMPASS booklet on  home,

school  and community partnerships which sets out  the  roles

schools,  parents  and community play in ensuring  the  well-being of our children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to work towards greater collaboration

between  home and school and encourage more open dialogue  to

help  our  children  grow,  and  help  schools,  parents  and

students develop healthy and realistic expectations  of  each

other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang has an interesting observation. He suggested

that  our  education system is too demanding because although

our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1162</b></font><br><br>



children   do   better  in  schools  in   all   international

comparisons, by the time they graduate from university,  they

are no different from other overseas graduates.  So why study

so hard in school?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang mixes up two things. International comparisons

at   the  school  level,  such  as  the  Third  International

Mathematics  and  Science Study where Singapore  Secondary  2

students  emerged first in Mathematics and second in Science,

look  at  the performance of the whole population of students

at  that  level. Dr Wang was comparing, anecdotally, I  might

add,  and  not  based  on  any studies,  between  people  who

graduate  from  the same tertiary institutions,  perhaps  the

same  courses.  The people who graduate from the same courses

in  the same higher education institutions can be expected to

do  no  better nor worse than others who similarly  graduate.

In   fact,  our  students  who  study  at  a  wide  range  of

universities do very well in those universities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is the proper comparison to make? If you look

at the proportion of our students who make it to the tertiary

level,  and the types of courses that they study, and compare

that  against  other countries, it is quite  clear  that  our

school system gives our students a stronger foundation and  a

long  term advantage over their peers in other countries.   I

would  like to quote from a yet unpublished study by Dr  Andy

Green  from  the University of London Institute of Education.

He  compared the whole education from primary school  through

to  post-graduate education in Singapore and the UK, and  the

systems  are very comparable. It is more difficult to compare

the US system because there are differences, levels and types

of  examinations and so forth.  The British  system  and  the

Singapore system are very comparable.



<br>1.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Andy Green concluded that at every level through to

basic degrees, we do better than the UK, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Comparable data on rates of qualification in Singapore

and  England  in  1998  show  that  Singapore  has  a  higher

proportion of young people gaining



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1163</b></font><br><br>



qualification at each level, except post graduate.  Singapore

has  a  larger  proportion  of  the  cohort  entering  higher

education  courses than the UK. In 1998, it can be  estimated

that  over 55% of an age group in Singapore enrol on a higher

education  course at diploma or first degree level.   In  the

UK,  total  entrants to higher education in 1998  represented

about 36% of the 18-20 year old cohort.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statistics show starker differences when we look at

the  numbers  who do Mathematics and Science, in  particular,

Advanced  Mathematics.  Some 20% of each cohort in  Singapore

gained  a  Mathematics A level, compared with 7% in  the  UK.

This  strong grounding in mathematics and science allows  our

students  to  pursue  more  challenging  courses  than  their

counterparts  in the UK.  If we look at the UK  and  the  US,

they  are  lamenting that their own people are  not  studying

engineering.   Their  engineering  schools  are  filled  with

foreigners including Singaporeans.  In contrast, NUS, NTU and

our  polytechnics produce large numbers of people trained  in

engineering and technology.  74% of our polytechnic  students

and  56%  of  NUS/NTU  students do  science  and  engineering

courses.   I quote from Dr Green's study again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Singapore produces a large number of engineering

graduates  relative to its population size.   5%  of  an  age

group   in   Singapore  graduate  from  first  degree   level

engineering courses, compared with just over 2%  in  the  UK,

[ie,  two and a half times on a cohort comparison basis  with

the  UK.]   In addition, large numbers graduate from  diploma

courses  in  engineering  -  twice  as  many  as  achieve  an

HDN/HNC*   certificate  in  engineering  in  the  UK   (whose

population is around 20 times greater).'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the strong foundation that our Singapore children

have  acquired from the hard work that they have  put  in  at

school  carries them through college, and into their careers.

Many  of  their counterparts in the UK and the US  would  not

even  be at the start line in college, because not enough  of

them  had that kind of preparation in school.  Even  in  non-engineering  and  scientific courses, a  strong  quantitative

foundation gives our students an advantage in areas  such  as

accounting, financial engineering,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1164</b></font><br><br>



business  information  processing, and logistics  management.

Our students gain a long term, perhaps a life-long, advantage

over  their  counterparts in other countries who are  not  as

well  prepared.   This solid foundation could  be  even  more

telling  in  future, as a good foundation in mathematics  and

the  sciences  makes it much more easy for  a  person  to  be

trained and retrained in continuing education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Wang is therefore wrong to conclude that our

students  do  not  have to study so hard in  school.   It  is

precisely  because our students are well prepared in  school,

both  academically and in terms of their values and attitudes

to  learning,  that  so  many  of  them  do  well  in  higher

education.   The  strong  work  ethic  and  values  that  our

children imbibe give them an edge over others, and will  help

them to succeed in life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last few years, we have been putting in

place  programmes  and systems so that all  our  schools  are

equipped   to   prepare   our  children   for   the   future.

Enhancements  continue  to be made to school  infrastructure,

school management, and curriculum and assessment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our $2 billion IT master plan is now into its third and

final  phase of implementation.  All teachers are trained  in

IT  and we are already starting to look at the next step,  to

look beyond, to see where we want to go.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $4.5 billion Programme for Rebuilding and Improving

Existing Schools (PRIME) is in its second phase.  By the  end

of  next  year,  46%  of  all schools  would  have  undergone

redevelopment  under PRIME.  These investments make  possible

effective new combinations of people and technology to  raise

standards and extend learning opportunities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of IT, the Ministry of Education develops

and  provides  a  wide range of learning resources.   Mr  Low

asked about what we are doing for the Chinese language.   The

Ministry of Education has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1165</b></font><br><br>



produced  14  CD-ROMs,  21 audio CDs and  77  video  CDs,  to

support  schools  in  the  use of  IT  for  teaching  Chinese

language.   The Ministry has also developed a website  called

"Happy  Town" to support the learning of Chinese language  at

the  upper primary level.  And the Ministry will continue  to

develop and source for suitable materials to support the  use

of IT in our schools, not just in Chinese language but in all

subject areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Tan Boon Wan asked the Ministry to improve the

standing  and  image of neighbourhood schools.  To  encourage

and nurture more good schools, the Ministry of Education has,

over  the years, steadily given more autonomy to schools,  so

that  they can be more innovative and responsive to the needs

of  pupils.   In  1994, autonomous schools  were  introduced.

Last  year,  two more schools  - Xinmin and Dunman   -   have

been accorded autonomous status, bringing the total number to

20.   The Ministry intends to double the number of autonomous

schools  to provide pupils and parents a wider range of  good

schools.   We have also fully implemented the School  Cluster

Scheme,  which facilitates the sharing of resources and  best

practices among schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to these measures, good schools are not limited

to  brand  name  schools.   We have many  good  neighbourhood

schools that add value to their students, so that they do  as

well  or  better than students who had scored better  in  the

PSLE,  carry  themselves with confidence and are well-rounded

individuals.  Our neighbourhood schools have been doing  well

in  both academic and non-academic areas.  Could I ask for  a

table  to  be distributed to hon. Members on value  added  of

some  of  our schools?  [Table distributed to hon.  Members.]

Of  the schools that have received the value-added award  for

academic  performance  each year, about  75%  are,  in  fact,

neighbourhood  schools.  That means they  do  very  well  for

their  students.  Neighbourhood schools like  Rulang  Primary

and  Jurong Primary are known for their IT programmes;  Radin

Mas Primary for its Digital Art programme; and Greenridge



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1166</b></font><br><br>



Primary  for its band.  Five years ago, few would have  heard

of Xinmin, a neighbourhood school in Upper Serangoon.  Today,

it  is a popular autonomous school known for many innovations

and good quality of education.  It is also one of our top  50

schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, we have done much to raise public

awareness  of  the positive developments in our neighbourhood

schools  through both print and broadcast media.  One example

is  the  Ministry of Education's television series  "Learning

Journeys"  aired last year.  Schools on their  own  are  also

encouraged  to actively publicise themselves.  With  a  wider

range  of schools distinguishing themselves in various areas,

we  hope that discerning parents and students will be able to

select schools that best suit their educational needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sinnakaruppan asked whether we could have private

schools.   Although  the  Ministry  of  Education  has  given

schools more autonomy and flexibility, the Government has  no

plans to privatise existing national schools.  Already, about

one  quarter  of  all  our  schools are  Government-aided  or

independent.    The  guiding  principles  for  education   in

Singapore  reflect the fundamental organising  principles  of

Singaporean   society,   such  as   equal   opportunity   and

meritocracy.   Our  schools  provide  a  common   educational

experience  to  build national identity and social  cohesion.

Any child regardless of his socio-economic background can  be

admitted  to any secondary school based solely on merit,  and

he  need  not worry about the fees.  Allowing schools  to  go

private  will introduce the potential for creating a division

within  our school system where admission is based on ability

to  pay rather than merit.  And this has potentially divisive

effects on our society, which I would be reluctant to  embark

upon any time soon or in a hurry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from good school management and infrastructure,

our  students  are receiving a holistic education  through  a

well-rounded  curriculum  that  is  regularly  reviewed   and

updated.   I  informed this House two years ago that  we  are

reducing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1167</b></font><br><br>



content  by  30%  and  we  have  done  so.   Changes  to  the

university  admission  system in the year  2003,  which  will

include  bonus  points for CCA, and this will  reinforce  the

importance  of other measures of ability.  Furthermore,  this

year,  we will be introducing Edusave Awards for Sports,  the

Arts, community service and uniformed groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we continue to introduce changes that focus on the

holistic  development of our young people, bilingualism  will

remain a cornerstone of our education system.  Our young need

to   learn  English  to  prepare  them  for  the  globalised,

knowledge-based  world.   But,  while  the  majority  of  our

students  are competent users of English, I cannot but  agree

with Mr Peh that we should strive for a better standard,  and

we   are  doing  so.   Since  last  year,  the  Ministry  has

introduced  revised  English language syllabuses  which  give

renewed attention to grammar to help our students become more

effective  users of the language.  Many schools have  reading

and  public  speaking  programmes to promote  confidence  and

better usage of the language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will deal with the mother tongue language issues

later  in the session if I have the time.  I would just  like

to conclude here by saying that our education system provides

opportunities  for educational advancement  to  all  students

according  to their aptitudes and abilities.  The changes  in

our  school  system,  the programmes and structures  move  us

closer   to  providing  an  ability-based  education  system.

Students  in  our national schools can benefit  from  a  high

quality of education, so that the vast majority of our people

can stay on the correct side of the global knowledge divide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also glad that several Members have raised the

subject  of  teachers.   This is perhaps  the  most  critical

element in a good education system, and I will speak on  this

a little later today, because I see that several Members will

also  want  to  speak on this subject, and I will  come  back

again when I have heard their suggestions and views.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1168</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I have your permission to

seek clarification from the Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, we have used a lot of money on

IT for schools.  I have asked in my speech whether or not the

Ministry  of  Education has made an assessment  in  terms  of

application of IT in teaching.  In particular, I  would  like

to  know  how  the application of IT has enhanced  and  added

value  to  the quality of teaching.  Secondly, how  does  the

application of IT in teaching of language help students learn

the language?  Was there any study done as to how application

of  IT  in  the teaching of language can achieve  a  specific

teaching objective?



<br>2.00 pm



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, the use of IT in education is

a  relatively new area and there are not very many definitive

studies that have been done on the effects of the use  of  IT

in education.  But we do know that, for example, if you go to

a  language laboratory and you use headphones and  listen  to

tapes, and if you watch Chinese movies, it is likely that you

will gain some benefit.  And if you get the vocabulary, it is

more  interesting and you will be learning something, and  it

probably helps to improve your language ability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what we are also trying with the use of IT for

mother tongue learning.  I believe that the students who  are

using it will probably find it more interesting.  They have a

wider  range  of resources available.  And if they  can  read

books  which  are  animated, I think it is all  very  useful.

Even  looking up the dictionary is a pleasure today  compared

to looking up a dictionary which is non-IT.



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Thank you, Sir, for permitting me to

seek clarification from the Minister.  When I say that we  do

not  have  any long-term advantage, that a university  degree

holder,  say,  from  a USA university,  with  a  Bachelor  of

Science,  and  another student graduating  from  a  Singapore

university  in  the same area and domain, they probably  have

the same



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1169</b></font><br><br>



content  and knowledge at that level.  That is what  I  meant

when I say an individual from the Singapore system, after  he

graduated  from  a four-year degree programme,  compared  to,

say,  a  US  graduate in the same discipline, the  amount  of

knowledge  that  they have is probably  the  same.   In  that

sense, we do not have a long-term advantage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I do not think the Minister has addressed

my  point  that  we  actually learn a lot  in  our  education

system, but in terms of utilisation and creativity, we are no

better off than a graduate from, say, a USA university.  This

is  an  area  that  Mr Inderjit Singh has in  fact  mentioned

earlier.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, I would like to address Dr

Wang's  points  on two levels.  One at the individual  level;

and the other at the society level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the individual level, I have already put up the

statistics to show that many more of our students get to  the

start  line.   When  they get to the finishing  line  at  the

university  and they take a course in Science or  Engineering

in  the United States, or they take Science or Engineering in

NUS  or  NTU, they may be comparable.  But a very much higher

proportion of our students get to the start line and actually

get through, 21/2 times more than in the United Kingdom.   So

at  the  individual level, our students have 21/2 times  more

opportunity  to get through the system and come  out  with  a

Science  or  Engineering degree than a  student  in  the  UK,

because of the strong preparation that they have in school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the society or country level, you can see that a

number  of  these  countries are lamenting  the  shortage  of

engineers and scientists to support the economy.  We  have  a

shortage  too,  but for different reasons - we  do  not  have

enough  people.  But a large proportion of our  students  are

going  through  such  programmes and  they  are  getting  the

benefit of these programmes.  So at the society level, on the

whole people level, we are also doing better and not just at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1170</b></font><br><br>



the individual level.  I am glad also that Dr Wang feels that

our  universities do produce graduates which  are  comparable

with the best in the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards his second question on whether or not we have

moved  away  from  a purely content-based curriculum  to  one

which  encourages creativity, I mentioned that  we  have  cut

back  our  curriculum by some 30% basically to  provide  more

time and opportunity for students to do things which are more

creative.  The graded project work which students now have to

do, which teachers have to supervise, is one such example.  I

am  sure  that many of our students have been very busy  over

this  vacation doing some project work or other.  So this  is

one  example of some of the changes that are taking place  in

our education system.



<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I would like to clarify one

point on the streaming issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point was: do we really have to stream our children

at  such an early age at Primary 4?  We can still achieve the

same desired objective of having our children go into ITE  or

polytechnics  at secondary school level if we  use  the  PSLE

results to do the streaming by having various grades for them

to  go  into various streams.  Streaming at Primary  4  level

creates  unnecessary stress at such an early  age,  and  this

will  basically develop an attitude among children where they

will not enjoy going to school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue the Minister mentioned was that parents

have  a  choice  on streaming at EM1, EM2 or EM3  level.   In

practice, schools really do not allow much choice to parents.

Parents  are told that this is where they have to go  on  the

ground.   While the desired objective is to let our  children

learn  at their own pace, in implementation, I think teachers

dread  taking an EM3 student, when they should actually enjoy

taking  this  EM3  student and make him or her  into  an  EM1

student   through   the   process.    But,   I   think,    in

implementation,  we are spending a lot of time  grooming  our

EM1  children  to  be among the best and  maybe  not  putting

enough



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1171</b></font><br><br>



effort to improve those who are in the lower streams.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, I wish Mr Inderjit Singh were

right, that every EM3 student could be converted into an  EM1

student.  I wish that he was right.  I wish that he was right

that  just  by putting in effort, we could do that  also.   I

have  the same desires as he has.  His heart is in the  right

place.   But  we  have  to face the reality  -  children  are

different.  We have to give them a curriculum which they  can

cope  with.  The reason that we have an EM3 stream is because

some  of  the  children are unable to cope with  Mathematics,

Science and language, which are going on both in the EM1  and

EM2  streams.   If  they are not able to cope  and  they  are

overloaded, they end up not learning anything in Primary 4, 5

and  6, because the load is just too heavy, and they have  to

take  a  reduced curriculum.  They face the same  examination

paper,  and  they are totally disheartened because  they  can

make no headway with that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that being fairer to them than providing them with a

curriculum  which  they  can  handle,  which  they   can   do

reasonably well in, and progress on to secondary schools?  In

secondary schools, if they do well, as I have indicated  just

now  with the figures, they can move on.  If they do well  in

ITE,  they  can move on too to the polytechnic.  If  they  do

well  in the polytechnic, they can move on to the university.

The  doors are not closed.  I am not saying that it is  easy,

but the doors are not closed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has to ask himself whether he really

feels  that  it  is fairer to the students if  we  push  them

through  a  uniform programme which they are unable  to  cope

with  or we try and tailor programmes which the children  are

able to cope with.



<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I agree with that. But my

point  is  that  we  tailor it at a  later  stage.   I  think

tailoring it at Primary 4 probably is just too early.  We can

at a later stage judge them according to their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1172</b></font><br><br>



abilities,   according  to  how  well  they   do   in   their

examinations at PSLE before we stream.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, again, I wish Mr Inderjit

Singh  was  right.  But that is not our experience  operating

the education system.



<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> Sir, thank you for allowing me now to

speak on the teaching profession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, teachers have a daunting task to handle. It is not

easy  these days having to deal with a class of children  who

are  getting  more difficult to control and  discipline,  let

alone other administrative duties.  Should we not have a two-teacher  position in certain difficult classes  to  make  the

work of our teachers more manageable and productive?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers are professionals. We should accord the

respect  and  status  to the teachers in  our  society.   Our

teachers  are well trained and fully competent to  teach  our

children.   I just wonder whether our parents show  the  same

support  for  the teachers who are helping their children  in

school.   Sometimes we hear of parents who  think  that  they

know  better  than  the  teachers  and  interfere  with   the

teacher's relationship with their children in school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides academic qualifications, teachers require

special  attributes.   They must  love  children.   It  is  a

vocation.   In  the  teacher's hands  lie  the  future  of  a

country, a generation of leaders to be educated and nurtured,

and a successful individual who makes the work of the teacher

worthwhile and rewarding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, to attract individuals to take up the teaching

profession  is  in itself a long process.  For  a  start,  it

would  be  sad if the vast majority of children  of  teachers

become  averse  to teaching and not follow the  footsteps  of

their  parents.  Students should be inspired, when young,  to

become  teachers.   They  should be  given  encouragement  to

become  one.   Teaching  is  the sharing  of  knowledge.   In

school,  our  children should be encouraged  to  share  their

knowledge  and  teach  their weaker  classmates.   We  should

actively inculcate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1173</b></font><br><br>



this  attitude of sharing and for the better students to help

their   weaker  classmates  in  understanding  the   lessons.

Individuals  must  have the sense of mission  in  wanting  to

teach,  otherwise they would not persevere and not last  very

long  in  the teaching profession.  I therefore salute  those

teachers who have stayed until their retirement and for  some

who continue even after retirement in different capacities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister whether the Ministry is

recruiting  the  right people to become teachers?   I  wonder

whether  the  Ministry  has,  over  the  years,  varied   the

selection  criteria for those who applied to become teachers.

Is  it  time for a review?  We need to give every support  to

our  teachers, to encourage them to continue in their service

for as long as possible and make valuable contribution to our

young for the future of our nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask the Minister the state of the teaching

service.   Is he happy with the number of teachers  who  have

been  recruited?   How could we improve  and  strengthen  the

overall experience and competency level of our teachers?  How

do we encourage as many of them to develop teaching as a long

term career?



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, let me quote the British

Teachers'  Union leader when he talked about the shortage  of

teachers  in UK recently: "The British government before  the

last  election made a famous war cry, `Education,  education,

education.'   But they should have been thinking:  `Teachers,

teachers,  teachers'."  And I would also like to quote  Kevin

Spacey,  actor of a teacher in the movie "Pay It Forward",  a

very   inspirational  movie  about  the  interaction  between

teachers and students: "It is important that someone suggests

a  way  of  opening  up  your mind.   Great  teaching  is  an

incredible art.  It is not easy at all."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the men and women, who teach our children, hold the

key  to opening up the mind of children.  The speakers before

me  have  already touched on this point.  On their  shoulders

are placed a heavy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1174</b></font><br><br>



responsibility  of  transmitting  knowledge  and  inculcating

values,  and only the committed and dedicated will take  this

on  as  a  lifelong  vocation.  Like many  countries  with  a

vibrant economy, it is very difficult to find qualified young

Singaporeans  to  choose teaching as their  lifelong  career.

MOE currently looks for future teachers among the top 30%  of

each  cohort.  This effectively limits the pool of candidates

for  the teacher training to the university.  Given the  pool

of  other  sectors  of  the economy, we are  just  recruiting

enough  new  teachers  to  fill the  vacancy  resulting  from

retirement and attrition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran has already spoken on the need to address the

issue  of  making  teaching an interesting  career  from  two

aspects, namely, compensation and benefits, and also  equally

important,  the  continuing development  of  teachers  during

their career lifetime.  On this topic, since the Minister has

already  mentioned that in this year's Budget,  it  has  been

given  a  higher budget allocation, would he review  how  the

Ministry can make teaching a more challenging and interesting

career?



<br>2.15 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

according  to  the  figures  released  by  the  Ministry   of

Education, during the last five years, that is, from 1995  to

the  year  2000, approximately 80 Chinese teachers  from  the

primary  and  secondary  schools  and  junior  colleges   had

resigned.   It  was just about 2.4% of the  total  number  of

Chinese teachers, and the number is negligible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at the same time, about 230 Chinese teachers

retired from the service.  In other words, every year we need

to  recruit  300 Chinese teachers.  I do not  know  how  many

Chinese  teachers are being nurtured by the  NIE  each  year.

But  from  the fact that the MOE had been recruiting  Chinese

teachers  from China every year for the past three years,  it

is quite obvious that the local supply is inadequate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, we engaged 33, and another 62 in 1999. During

the first 10 months of last



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>



year, 81 came.  Appropriately, importing foreign talent is  a

good thing. But it must be based on some good plan to attract

and  recruit,  and not as a stop-gap measure.  Otherwise,  it

will lead to many sequelae.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was told that there is yet another batch of Chinese

teachers coming from China.  It is quite obvious that we  are

getting  more  and more Chinese teachers from China.   It  is

good  that  we recruit talented Chinese teachers from  China.

However,  we should treat them well, with proper respect  and

welfare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers are unlike the other professions. In the Tang

Dynasty,  there  was a great scholar, Han Yu,  who  said:  "A

teacher  is one who preaches the doctrine, imparts  knowledge

and  clears  your doubts."  In other words,  teachers  are  a

special breed of people who could teach us and would leave  a

very  long lasting impression on their students.  It  may  be

difficult   for  teachers,  who  are  engaged  on  short-term

contracts  and  who  come  and go,  to  take  on  this  heavy

responsibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to have a very complete solution to resolve this

problem of shortage in Chinese teachers.  This solution would

include expanding the talent pool of Chinese scholars; review

the workload of the Chinese teachers and improve their career

prospects.  As for the foreign teachers, we should also  have

some long-term arrangements to enable them to gradually adapt

to  the  local situation and cultivate in them the  necessary

sense  of  belonging.   We could let them integrate into  our

society and develop a sense of belonging here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expansion of talent pool of Chinese scholars would

involve the issue of eligibility of students to study "Higher

Chinese".   According to the feedback from some  parents  and

secondary school teachers, if a student does not score an  A*

in Chinese or a Distinction in Higher Chinese at the PSLE, he

would not be allowed to take Higher Chinese in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1176</b></font><br><br>



secondary  school. He would also need to  score  an   "A"  in

English in the PSLE before he is allowed to do Higher Chinese

in the secondary school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this, we can see that the Ministry of Education has

imposed  a lot of restrictions on the student's intention  to

do  Higher Chinese.  MOE's intention is that the student must

manage  his English and other subjects well.  This is  beyond

reproach.  However,  by so doing, it is  certainly  going  to

deprive  some  students of the opportunity  to  study  Higher

Chinese, and is tantamount to reducing the source of  Chinese

talents who can be groomed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that such a restriction imposed on the student's

eligibility to do Higher Chinese needs to be reviewed.  Faced

with  the  withering  number  of Chinese  talents,  including

Chinese  teachers,  and coupled with the picking  up  of  the

economy  of  our  Asian neighbour, China, we should  promptly

change  this  practice, and actively nurture a batch  of  new

Chinese  talents as successors to satisfy the  needs  of  the

international situation in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, I feel that the present stringent requirements

should  at least be relaxed to allow more students to have  a

chance of studying Higher Chinese  in the secondary schools.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I am encouraged

by  the  Minister's assurance that securing quality  teaching

resources is one of his top priorities.  In this context,  my

speech is in part a tribute to the teachers whose passion and

dedication  have  motivated me a great deal  when  I  was  at

school,  but  largely  a  call to  the  Minister  to  provide

complementary  avenues to help teachers cope with  increasing

demands and stress in their jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many, including teachers themselves, have observed that,

over  time,  teaching  has shifted from  a  calling  to  just

another  job.   Coupled with the variety of  alternative  job

opportunities,  which  frequently pay better  for  supposedly

less stress, and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1177</b></font><br><br>



increasing  demands that parents and community at large  have

on  our  teachers, there are not as many takers as  we  would

like to have.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, teachers who have been teaching for a long time

usually   find  their  passion  fading  with  all   the   new

challenges,  such  as  IT  training or  frequent  changes  to

curriculum.   Many  regret the lack  of  opportunity  or  the

inability to inculcate values in students.  The role  of  the

teachers has also evolved into more of a facilitator than  an

instructor  per  se.  Also the perception that  many  of  the

older  ones can retire whenever they would like to  does  not

make  for good morale.  Sir, these teachers have been pillars

and  have  painstakingly instilled values alongside  lessons.

It  would  be  a shame to have to lose their passion  because

they feel overwhelmed, or even defeated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the more tech-savvy younger teachers

frequently  find coping with parents, defiant  students,  the

administrative  load or even a promotion difficult  to  bear.

They, too, find their flames waning early into their teaching

career.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whilst I understand that the school and even

cluster leadership is well-placed to counsel teachers who may

feel  a  little overwhelmed, I would like to ask the Minister

to  consider  setting  up an avenue outside  of  this  formal

structure to complement this support.  For example, a pool of

experienced teachers or principals at headquarters itself can

be  made  available  to guide and mentor  young  teachers  on

handling  stress  and  the more experienced  on  coping  with

changes.  Other possibilities can include peer-support groups

for teachers to share common problems and solutions, all done

in such a way as not to undermine the leadership in schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would be a sad day if we lose teachers with

passion to stress and the inability to cope.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, as a member

of  COMPASS  as  well as a parent, I have the opportunity  to

visit  many schools and have also seen teachers who teach  my

children.  I must



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>



say  that I have been very impressed with the commitment  and

dedication  of our teachers.  The recent salary  revision  to

teachers  was  a  right  step in trying  to  remunerate  them

fairly.  However, even with salary revisions, I see that  the

Ministry has not been able to meet recruitment targets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, the shortfall in teaching was about 6,300

teachers.  Last year, the shortfall, according to the Budget,

is  about  4,600 teachers.  Although there is an improvement,

there  is  still  a  shortfall.  The shortfall  seems  to  be

aggravated  by  two other factors.  One  is  that  a  lot  of

experienced  teachers seem to be retiring  in  the  next  few

years.   Another  one is that the teaching service  does  not

seem  to  be  able to get enough males to join  the  teaching

service.   When  you  go round, you see  more  females.   The

question  is:   are there adequate male role  models  in  the

teaching service and what is its impact on our children?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I spoke to the teachers, I asked them, "Well, the

teaching  profession is well paid, why aren't people  joining

in?"   The  feedback I got is, "The workload  is  heavy,  the

stress  is  high."   Then I told them,  "But  I  thought  the

teaching   service  has  now  got  administrators,  operation

managers in schools to help you cope with this workload."   I

was  told  that these are just layers in the hierarchy  which

actually  generate even more work.  So I do not know  whether

it is true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is I also notice that, in this year's

budget,  the  manpower numbers for the teaching service  have

been reduced by 500 places for the next financial year.   Why

is  the number in the teaching service reduced, ie, why do we

need  less teachers?  And what steps are we taking to recruit

more  teachers  to  meet  the  shortfall?   In  addition   to

improving  pay,  developing teachers through education,  etc,

what  are  we  doing  to  enhance the working  conditions  of

teachers?  The next point is that some time ago, there was an

announcement about getting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1179</b></font><br><br>



people  who are already working and have made career  changes

into the teaching profession.  What progress have we made  in

getting  people  from  other professions  to  move  into  the

teaching service?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I do

not  agree with Mr Low Thia Khiang's objection to the use  of

IT  in  teaching.   No  doubt, the  high-tech  method  cannot

replace  the  conventional method  in  the  teaching  of  our

students, but it does help to raise the standard of teaching.

Our  Chinese  teachers in Singapore have, over the  past  few

years,  developed  some fantastic softwares for the  teaching

of  Chinese, based on our Singapore context,  and the results

are   very  remarkable indeed.  Maybe Mr Low is not aware  of

these  softwares,  some  of  which are  multimedia  software.

These softwares have raised the interest of the pupils in the

learning  of  the language.  I recommend that Mr  Low  pay  a

visit to  some of the schools, eg, Raffles Girls' School,  to

observe how these softwares are being used in the teaching of

Chinese.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of education, the Ministry of Education has

made  great  efforts in the past few years and  has  achieved

remarkable results. This is particularly in the provision  of

school buildings and the various educational facilities.  The

achievement  is  clearly there for all  to  see.   While  the

Government  has  invested  a lot in infrastructure,  ie,  the

hardware  part  of it, we must also strengthen  our  software

aspect, ie, the upgrading of our teachers and do our best  to

ensure that we have enough teachers in Singapore,  especially

language  teachers.  It is only with enough language teachers

that  we  will be able to effectively implement our bilingual

policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the median age of our teachers in the various

stages of education is an important data that we should  take

notice.   This  data  will  help us  to  plan  our  need  for

teachers,  so that they may not be a phenomenon of  "the  new

crop  still in the blade and the old ones all consumed".    I

remember  that five years ago, the median age of our  Chinese

teachers  in the primary schools was 47 years old.  In  other

words,  many  Chinese  teachers in the primary  schools  were

older than 47



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>



years  old.  I would like to know what is the median  age  of

the  primary school Chinese teachers now.  I would also  like

to  know whether there is any plan on the part of MOE to make

sure  that  we  have enough Chinese teachers in  the  various

stages  of  our  education system to take  on  the  important

responsibility of teaching the mother tongue language. I know

that  apart  from actively cultivating some  Singaporeans  to

become  Chinese  teachers,  MOE  is  also  importing  Chinese

teachers  from other countries to help alleviate the  problem

of  shortages  in the supply of local Chinese teachers.    As

mentioned  by Mr Goh Choon Kang just now, we have imported  a

lot of Chinese teachers from China.  I would like to know how

many foreign Chinese teachers are there now in Singapore.



<br>2.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a necessity for us to attract more

Singaporeans  to become Chinese teachers, to retain  all  the

existing   teachers  and  to  help  them  to  upgrade   their

professional level.  We should take some measures  to  reduce

the  administrative burden of the teachers so that  they  can

concentrate on teaching.  I am very glad that the Ministry of

Education had introduced the Mother Tongue Language Teachers'

Award  last year.  I would like to ask the Minister how  many

teachers  have  benefited from this  Mother  Tongue  Language

Teachers' Award and whether there are any incentives  by  the

Ministry of Education to encourage our mother tongue teachers

to  further  their  studies  and upgrade  their  professional

level.  At the same time, we should also encourage them to be

released  from  their  heavy  teaching  commitments   at   an

appropriate  time to go for further studies  on  a  full-time

basis to "charge up their batteries".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the Singapore Chinese Teachers Union (SCTU)

is   the  only  trade  union  representing  all  the  Chinese

teachers.  I hope that the Ministry of Education will enhance

its  links  with the SCTU and to improve the welfare  of  the

teachers  through  a tripartite effort to nurture  more  high

quality professionals in the teaching of Chinese.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the issue of class size is one

of  efficient or quality teaching.  Can a teacher  give  more

efficient  teaching  if  the class size  is  large,  say,  50

pupils,  or  when a class size is small, say, 20  pupils?   I

think most people would agree that when a class is smaller in

size,  more  efficient or effective teaching can  be  carried

out.   The  reason is simple.  For a smaller class size,  the

teacher  can  give  more  personal attention  to  the  slower

learners, and it is also easier to control the class  to  get

the  pupils  to  pay  attention to the  teacher  when  he  is

teaching.   There  is  also  less  stress  on  the  teachers.

Feedback, from readers in the Forum page of the Straits Times

recently, favours smaller classes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh Chin Hua cited problems of the inability of

pupils,  after passing out from secondary schools,  to  write

even a proper essay or an application letter and, in the case

of  Dr  Lily  Neo, she says that there is too  much  tuition.

These  problems, I believe, arise because our teachers cannot

give effective teaching.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our class size is too large. The issue of a smaller

class size is not a new one.  I have brought this topic up in

almost every Budget, in the Committee of Supply.  Most of our

schools now have a class size of about 40 pupils.  I had been

a  school teacher myself, Sir, and I can tell you that it  is

difficult  to teach a class of 40 pupils.  I have  suggested,

and I would suggest again, that we reduce our class size to a

compromise  number of 30 pupils.  I say "compromise"  because

30 to a class is still too large.  The ideal, of course, is a

class  size  as small as possible.  The ideal, of course,  is

1:1,  but that is too idealistic.  I would suggest, if it  is

possible,  to bring down our class size to about  30  at  the

moment,  as  a  compromise.  But, the class size,  as  I  was

saying,  we should get it down to as small as possible,  say,

10-15  per  class.  However, from the point of  view  of  our

country's resources, it may be difficult to get a class  down

to 10 or 15 pupils.  I think it is a luxury at the moment, if

we  did  that.   I  would  say  that  we  can  make  a  great

improvement from a class of 40 to a class of 30, and it would

be a great



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>



leap forward for our education system if we achieve that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard that when we reduce the class size, there

is  a  problem of shortage of teachers.  I would say that  we

need  not all at once convert our school system suddenly from

40  to  30  in a class.  The 1/4 reduction shall, of  course,

need   25%  more  teachers.   I  have  been  informed   that,

currently, our teaching strength is about 23,000, which would

mean  that  if  we  reduce our class size by  1/4,  we  would

require about 5,700 more teachers, which is really a very big

number.   To solve the teacher shortage, I would say that  we

slowly  reduce the class size and build more schools  at  the

same time, say, over a period of 10 years building programme.

Sir,  I  am not advocating that we make a sudden or overnight

change.   As long as there is a commitment for change,  I  am

very happy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem cited, Sir, is that when we recruit more

teachers,  the  standard  of the teachers  will  drop.   This

problem  can  be solved by good teacher training  programmes,

together with good pay and incentives to recruit good  people

to  the  teaching profession.  Of course, the quality of  the

teachers  recruited must be good.  But I think also that  the

love for teaching is equally important.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this year the Minister shall be more amenable to

my  suggestion.  Perhaps he may even do an experiment and try

two  schools  first  to see whether it is successful  with  a

smaller class size.



<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, my question to the Minister is: how

much  of  a difference can a smaller class size make  to  the

quality  of  education our children receive?   It  is  not  a

matter  of whether a smaller class size makes a difference  - because, I think, as Mr Chiam has said, and I think that is a

fairly simplistic argument to say, a smaller class size will,

of  its  own accord, make a difference - the question is,  in

the  scheme of things relative to the other factors, how much

of  a  difference  can it make?  Intuitively,  parents  would

argue that a smaller class size is desirable.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1183</b></font><br><br>



But  when  it comes to the allocation of hundreds of millions

of dollars, clearly we have to go beyond intuition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MOE has said that class size is one of a slew of

factors  that  impact  on the quality of  education.   Others

cited  include  motivation  of pupils,  teaching  strategies,

design of curriculum and the like.  The question then is  one

of  an  allocative decision.  The Government has  stated  its

commitment,  and I think the Minister has stated  this  again

today,  that  it  is prepared to spend a considerably  larger

amount  of money on education.  Where should the next hundred

million dollars in education go when we are talking about the

school  system  and  the education within  a  school  system?

Should  it  go  towards more IT?  Should it go  towards  more

teaching  strategy  development and  curriculum  development?

Should  it go towards reducing class size?  That is  where  I

think  the  relative  importance  of  these  factors  becomes

relevant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has cited the fact that, if we try and

lower  class size abruptly, the quality of our teachers  will

fall,  and  that  will have an adverse effect.   Nobody  will

quarrel  with  that argument, and nobody  is  asking  for  an

immediate  or  precipitous change.  But the question  is:  is

there a long-term target that the Ministry is working towards

in  reducing the size of our classes?  The problem of quality

of teachers will have a gradual correction of its own accord.

As  the  Minister himself has said, each cohort is  attaining

higher levels of education.  So, presumably, we can gradually

increase the pool we recruit from within Singapore to augment

our  teaching  resources.  The other avenue,  of  course,  is

tapping of foreign pool as well, for certain content areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the introduction could also be phased in. If we do

not want a wholesale introduction of a smaller class size, we

could perhaps target it at specific areas, whether it is  at,

say,  early primary or even the primary level as a whole,  in

order to ease transition into the school system, and in order

to enhance the early primary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>



education  experience, and we can also target it  at  perhaps

certain  pedagogic groups, where highly interactive learning,

with  the  teacher  actively involved with the  students,  is

necessary and desirable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the establishment of a clear policy direction on

where the class size should  be is an important signal to the

principals  down the line, because the Ministry has  devolved

considerable flexibility and responsibility to principals  on

how  they  manage  at the micro level the relative  sizes  of

their  classes,  and  some  have  channelled  more  resources

towards  slow  learners  and so on.  But,  unless  the  macro

picture is clearly defined, I think there would not be enough

resources  for flexibility at the micro level.   So  I  would

appreciate  some  clarification  from  the  Minister  on  the

Ministry's position on this matter.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, let me now deal with teachers,

an  issue that my Ministry will be focusing on in the  school

sector  this coming year.  Teachers lie at the heart  of  all

that  we  do  in  education, and we need good  teachers,  and

enough  of them, to do all the things that we want to  do  in

education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give a rough picture of where the teaching force

is  today.   We  have  about 25,000 teachers,  but  it  is  a

teaching force which is roughly an M-shape by age.   We  have

many teachers who are in their 50s and older, who joined  the

teaching   service  and  took  us  through  the  trials   and

tribulations  of the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s, and produced  the

good  education  system that we have today.  So  they  really

were  the  ones  who  carried the load over  the  last  three

decades  of nation-building.  But many of them are coming  to

retirement age.  I will lose 3,500 of them over the next five

years.  3,500 is enough to wipe out all the teachers in 10 of

our constituencies completely.  It is about something like 50

schools' worth of teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, we have been able to recruit new teachers,

particularly  over  the last 4-5 years, because  of  the  new

teachers'  schemes  that  have  been  put  in  place  by   my

predecessor, Mr Lee Yock Suan.  And, in the last  few  years,

we have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>



been able to recruit some 5,000 to 6,000 teachers.  So it  is

an M-shape.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years ago, the median age of teachers was 43. That

means,  if  you open the staff room and you look inside,  the

median  age of the teachers is 43 years old.  Today,  if  you

open  a  staff  room and you look inside, the median  age  of

teachers is 38.  In five years' time, when you do that again,

the  median age of the teachers will be 33.  There is a  very

big  shift  going  on in the teaching service.   We  have  to

manage  this  change.   We see it now differentially  in  our

schools.   In  some of the schools that you go to,  half  the

teachers  have less than five years of service,  some  higher

than  that - 60%-70%.  If you went to the same school 6 or  7

years  ago,  you  would probably find  that  70%-80%  of  the

teachers had been there for 15, 20 or 30 years.  This is  the

kind of change that is going on today in the system.  So,  it

is  quite critical for us to be able to make sure that we can

recruit and retain enough teachers, so that many more of them

will  stay with us and become the new bedrock upon which  the

education  system is built, just like our loyal and dedicated

teachers  who are in their 50s and over, who will be retiring

over the next five to 10 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before I do that, let me first discuss the issue of

pupil-teacher  ratios  and class  sizes  which  has  come  up

regularly.   I  can almost predict what Mr  Chiam  will  say.

First of all, pupil-teacher ratio and class sizes are not the

same thing.  Class size is a specific arrangement for putting

a  certain number of students in a specific way in  a  class,

whereas  pupil-teacher ratio is an indication of the teaching

resources  that  we  have available, say,  for  a  particular

school, in relation to the number of students there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shrinking class sizes has an intuitive appeal. Fewer

students mean more attention for each child.  Proponents  say

that  it will raise the quality of education, improve pupils'

performance, and reduce teacher workloads.  And the  Ministry

of  Education is in fact open to all ideas that  can  improve

the  quality  of  education  that our  students  receive  and

improve the working conditions for teachers, including



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>



changing  class sizes and seeing what other methods  that  we

can  use to deal with some of the problems that teachers face

in class, with either large marking loads or students who may

need extra attention and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we are also mindful that the quality of

education is not determined by just a single factor.   It  is

in  fact  multi-factorial.  The factors which  influence  the

quality of education are not limited to class size, but  also

include  curriculum, how it is delivered, school organisation

and  tone.  And whether or not the students behave themselves

in  a school or in a class has a lot of impact on whether  or

not  we can teach in a large class or teach in a small class.

If  we  have 10 students who are disruptive all the time,  we

are not going to be able to get any teaching done.  But if we

have  40 students who are on-task and eager to learn, we  can

get  quite  a lot of teaching done.  That makes a fundamental

difference.   Of course, home support and, finally  and  most

importantly,  teacher quality.  These factors  also  interact

with  one  another.  Good teachers are the key to  everything

that   we   do  because  education  is  a  completely   human

enterprise.   It is about people for people, and  it  happens

through people.  When you put the teacher in a classroom, she

performs,  and  how  she interacts with  students  determines

whether education actually takes place or not.



<br>2.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we lay out the systems and infrastructure

necessary for an ability-based education, we need good people

to  deliver  this  education.  Ideally, we would  have  small

classes, every one of which would be taught by good teachers.

Unfortunately,  the  proportion  of  good  teachers  in   the

Education  Service  and  class  size  is  probably  inversely

related, especially when we look at the issue from the  scale

of the entire education system, and not just one class or one

school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every country faces this problem. In the US and UK,

where  class sizes are small, the big outcry is over  teacher

quality.  In September 1998, the then US Education



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1187</b></font><br><br>



Secretary,  Richard Riley, pointed out that the  US  faced  a

shortage  of high-quality teachers, with shortages developing

in  specific fields of expertise, like Mathematics,  Science,

special education and bilingual education.  He lamented:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too many school districts are sacrificing quality for

quantity to meet the immediate demand of putting a warm  body

in  front  of a classroom. This is a mistake. Even  now,  too

many school districts are issuing emergency licences."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

Emergency  licences are issued to teachers who are not  fully

qualified  to  teach.   School systems that  have  sought  to

radically  reduce class size have found that it has  come  at

the  expense of teacher quality because it forces schools  to

hire  under  qualified teachers, or teachers whom they  would

not otherwise have hired.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A January 2001 Education Week article says, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"California learnt their lesson first-hand when the

state  undertook  its  own  class size  reduction  initiative

beginning in 1996.  In the first year of implementation, more

than  a  fifth of the new teachers hired in that  state  have

only emergency credentials.  Hit hardest were schools serving

poor  and  minority students, and in the hunt for new  space,

administrators  found themselves carving  classrooms  out  of

broom  closets  and erecting portable classrooms  on  top  of

playgrounds."



There  is a real trade-off between quality and quantity,  and

the empirical evidence on the benefits of focusing on cutting

class  sizes  is  inconclusive, because  there  are  so  many

factors at work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chronicle of Higher Education, April 1998, cited a

wide  ranging  survey of the research that has been  done  on

class sizes.  This is the conclusion and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"277 studies have been done on the effects of class

size.   15% have found statistically significant benefits  in

smaller classes, while 13% found that on average, students in

smaller classes perform worse on tests."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doubling the number of teachers or increasing them by

one-third  or one-quarter, to halve our class sizes,  is  not

the  same thing as doubling the number of computers  to  half

the pupil-computer ratio, or even doubling the amount of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>



space  provided in our schools.  Incidentally, we  are  doing

both  of  these.  With computers, you just put in  an  order.

They  will  arrive  next  week. And  most  importantly,  each

computer that comes is of the same quality, or perhaps,  even

more  powerful  than the older models that are  currently  in

service. They might be even cheaper than the current  models.

If you order a lot of computers, you get a bulk discount.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we do that with teachers? Where do I order them

from?   Please tell me. Would we enjoy a bulk discount if  we

hire  more  teachers, and will they be as good as  or  better

than  the  ones  currently  in  service?   If  we  lower  our

standards and increase our intakes, they certainly  will  not

be,  either  in  terms of ability to teach or  motivation  or

aptitude.  The truth is, it is not easy to find good teachers

to do all the things that we want to do.  This is a challenge

that is not unique to Singapore. The choice is not between 40

students taught by a good teacher and two classes of 20, each

taught by a good teacher, but a class of 20 taught by a  good

teacher, and the other class of 20 taught by a teacher who is

perhaps not fit to teach by today's standard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain the approach that we are taking to build

up our teaching force.  We recruit as many teachers as we can

who meet our standards and we have not limited the number  of

teachers   that  we  can  recruit.   Indeed,  the   4,000-odd

vacancies  that Mr Thomas has pointed out pertain  mainly  to

the provision for the recruitment of trainee teachers as they

undergo  training at the National Institute of Education  and

float  posts  to  hold  those on no-pay leave,  study  leave,

professional   development  leave,   scholarships,   training

awards, and so on. We have quite a lot of slack in the number

of  teachers that we can recruit and if we are able  to  find

the teachers, to recruit as many as we want.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we have been expanding our teaching force, we do

so  with  an  eye to quality.  This means that  it  will  not

translate  into dramatically smaller class sizes  across  the

board  any  time  soon. It is also because  of  the  changing

demographics of our whole teaching force.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1189</b></font><br><br>



We  have been able to expand the size of our teaching  force,

especially  in  the  last four years.   But  because  student

enrolments  in our schools have also been rising, the  growth

of  our  teaching service has largely gone into  catering  to

this  increased enrolment.  Nevertheless, in spite  of  that,

there  has,  in  fact, been some improvement of pupil-teacher

ratios.   I  would  ask  the Clerk to distribute  some  data.

[Handout distributed to hon. Members.]  At the primary level,

over the last ten years, enrolment has increased by 19% since

1990  or by some 50,000 students.   This means something like

another 2,000 teachers are required to cater to them.  But in

spite  of needing an additional 2,000 teachers, we have  been

able  to  do  a  little better than that.  Our  pupil-teacher

ratio in the primary schools has improved slightly from 25.8%

to  24.9%.  At the secondary level, enrolment rose by 10%  in

the  last  10  years.  The pupil-teacher ratio improved  from

21.7%  to 18.6%.  This means that in every school, there  are

now  more teachers per student to share the teaching  duties,

compared to, say, five years ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect that student enrolments in our secondary

schools  will  continue to rise by nearly 20%  again  in  the

coming four years.  But because our target is to recruit  our

teachers from the top third of each cohort, there is a  limit

to  how  far  we  can  reduce  pupil-teacher  ratios  without

compromising  on  quality.  There is  also  a  reality  check

needed  to ascertain what proportion of the pool of potential

candidates who have the aptitude and interest and how many we

can  realistically attract to be teachers.  We do,  in  fact,

recruit   teachers  from  a  wide  range   of   sources   and

backgrounds, including non-university graduates,  polytechnic

graduates  and  also  people in their  mid-career.   Not  all

teachers  we  recruit are fresh graduates. Even  so,  we  are

currently   already  recruiting  one  out  of   every   eight

university graduates, which is a very high level. Honestly, I

am  not  confident  that  we  can  do  very  much  more  than

recruiting one out of every eight graduates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran is right that the key is how best do we use

the teaching resources



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1190</b></font><br><br>



that we have.  How do we allocate them to get the most effect

and  the  best  education that we can get for  our  children?

Given these constraints, the Ministry's position on deploying

our  teachers  is to do so where the additional teachers  can

contribute most towards the learning of students.   One  good

example  is the Learning Support Programme (LSP) under  which

P1  and  P2 students with difficulties in basic literacy  are

taught  in  small group sizes of between 8-10 students.   The

LSP  supports 20% of P1 pupils and 10% of P2 pupils  and  the

results  have been quite impressive.  Over a 10-month period,

P1  LSP pupils increase their reading age by 26 months,  thus

narrowing  their  reading  age deficit  by  16  months.   The

classes  are conducted by 214 teachers, whom we call Learning

Support Coordinators, and each of our primary schools has  at

least  one LSC.  This year, 10 primary schools will  get  one

additional teacher each to implement a similar programme  for

Mathematics on a pilot basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we spread these teachers out thinly to help reduce

class sizes across the board, the impact would be negligible.

You  will  not  feel it at all.  But by putting  the  teacher

resources  in  areas that count, we are able to  make  a  big

impact on the students. It is more effective to identify  the

learning needs of the students and to design programmes  that

have high impact on a significant number of students and  use

the  teacher  resources that way, which may  include  smaller

classes  for specific subjects for specific periods  than  to

try to reduce class sizes across the board.  In this way,  we

have been able to cater to the learning needs of students who

deserve more attention, either because they are weaker as  in

the  Learning Support Programme, or because they have special

abilities as in the Gifted Education Programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are able to get more teachers and increase the

teaching force, we will continue to look at how best  we  can

deploy these teachers, what programmes are available and  how

we  can  improve  the  learning outcomes  for  our  students.

Schools  are  also given the flexibility to vary their  class

sizes.  Some schools have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>



bigger  classes.  They have a good teacher who can deliver  a

lecture  well to 80 students.  Some schools decide that  they

want to split their classes for their weaker students into 20

each.   Some  have found that it has been useful,  some  have

found that it has no effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class sizes in the Normal and Express streams generally

range  from about 30-40 students.  In fact, parents  want  to

place  their children in the most popular schools even though

their classes are filled to the brim.  As MPs, you would have

heard that parents always come and make suggestions that, "It

cannot  make that much difference if you squeeze in one  more

chair  and  desk there for my son or my daughter."   We  have

heard  that many times.  If class size is indeed the sole  or

the  major  determinant  of  quality,  parents  would  choose

schools  that  are less heavily subscribed as they  are  most

likely to have vacancies and, therefore, smaller classes. But

they  do  not.   While I started out by saying  that  smaller

class sizes have an intuitive appeal, all parents intuitively

know  and understand that there is more to quality than class

size, and it is indeed a multi-factorial issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh Choon Kang and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked about

foreign Chinese language teachers in our education system.  I

will  address  one or two of the issues, but  not  the  whole

range.  To  help foreign teachers adapt to our  system,  they

participate in induction programmes conducted by the Ministry

before  they  are  deployed to teach.  They  receive  further

support and guidance in their schools and clusters.  So  far,

our   foreign  teachers,  including  Chinese  teachers,  have

generally  performed  well and have adapted  to  our  system.

There  are  a few who do not demonstrate good performance  or

good work and they will not have their contracts renewed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have also asked about employing foreign

teachers.   We  are  recruiting good  quality  teachers  from

overseas.  We  now  have about 400 of them.   They  are  very

useful in specific



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>



areas  but there is a limit to how many we can deploy in  our

system.  There are two constraints.  First, good teachers are

in acute shortage all over the world.  If we want to go to UK

to  recruit  teachers, we must remember that they  just  came

over  last year to recruit our teachers.  I am not  sure  how

much  headway  we can make with that.  The second  reason  is

that  foreign teachers may not be as sensitised to our  norms

and values, such as multi-racialism, and this is why most  of

our foreign teachers are in the secondary schools and not  in

the  primary schools because primary school students are very

impressionable  at a young age, and it is important  that  we

give them good guidance and values.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottomline is that we want more good teachers and we

want  a  good  balance  between quality  and  quantity.   The

correct  focus  is, therefore, on building  up  our  teaching

force,  while maintaining teacher quality.  Our main  efforts

will,  therefore,  be  directed towards recruiting  our  fair

share  of  talent  and retaining outstanding and  experienced

teachers.   The  measures  include  giving  teachers   better

support and recognition.



<br>3.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas asked about what we have done on teacher

workload  and  administrative support.   More  administrative

support  will indeed be provided to teachers.  Last  year,  I

announced  that we will provide one more extra administrative

post  for  every school.  Providing one more  post  to  every

school will incur a budget of $20 million a year.  And indeed

this increases to three the number of administrative posts in

schools,  compared to none just five years ago.  So  we  will

move forward and see how far we can go.  But there is also  a

limit  to how many people we can recruit because, as everyone

knows,  there are also not enough people doing this  kind  of

administrative  work in Singapore.  But we  have  also  given

schools  the flexibility and autonomy to buy support services

to  assist  teachers in administrative duties, by using  this

money.  So the post can be commuted to money, and the schools

can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1193</b></font><br><br>



also  use  their operating funds.  Some schools have  already

done  so.    Instead of employing one person  for  the  whole

year, they can employ four people for three months during the

peak  periods,  if the schools feel that is what  they  need.

Schools  can  also  use  this  fund  to  engage  people  with

specialised  skills, such as music instructors to  help  with

CCA.   The Ministry of Education monitors the usage  of  such

funds and will increase the quantum, if necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also be providing principals, HODs and teachers

with IT support to do their work better.  One example is  the

integrated  IT support system for schools, what  we  call  in

shorthand  "school cockpit", which is being  developed  at  a

cost  of  $35 million.  This is basically something which  is

built around teachers and enables teachers and school leaders

to  have  all  the  necessary information, data,  statistics,

functions  and so on that they need to manage the pupils  and

to work better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also giving beginning teachers more support.

Being  a  teacher is intellectually stimulating but  it  also

requires hard work, and beginning teachers cannot be expected

to  just  go into a school at the deep end and start working.

So  they are mentored and we also provide 80% of the standard

workload only for beginning teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua talked about giving counselling and

support to older teachers, apart from beginning teachers.  In

fact,  we  do  have  a  counselling centre  in  the  teachers

network,  which is outside of the hierarchy of  clusters  and

principals.   So teachers can avail themselves  of  that.   I

think  it  is a good idea and we will see what we can  do  to

improve counselling and so on for our teachers to help them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main initiative that we will be implementing for

teachers this year is reshaping the teaching career, so  that

it can better meet the Ministry of Education's organisational

needs  and the aspirations and talents of our teaching posts.

We want to create a culture of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>



professional  excellence which will attract  and  retain  the

best  teachers and a profession which nurtures the individual

and  motivates all to achieve superior performance.  We began

our  pay  and  career review for teachers in  September  last

year.   The initial broad recommendations include setting  up

the  teacher  and specialists' career tracks, in addition  to

the  current managerial track to HODs and principals, so that

MOE  can  build up a top notch team of professional teachers,

capable  leaders  and  dedicated specialists.   Part  of  the

current  review  also  examines how to  restructure  the  pay

system, but it will look beyond just the tangible rewards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognition for teachers will be reshaped within a total

framework  that  includes  elements  such  as  learning   and

developmental opportunities.  For instance, the Ministry will

spend  more than $1 million a year to fully sponsor  teachers

for  the  National Institute of Education's advanced  diploma

and  advanced post-graduate diploma programmes.  I  will  not

announce details of the review today.  The review is expected

to be completed soon, and I expect to be able to announce the

details  within the next two months.  With these changes,  we

would  have put in place a strong framework for the Education

Service to continue to attract, reward and develop those with

a passion and aptitude required to be teachers, and this will

help  us to have good teachers and enough of them to  do  all

the  good  things  that we want to do in  education  for  our

students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head L (cont.) -



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang:</b> Sir, may I be allowed to make one

clarification?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang:</b> Sir, I hope the Minister can respond

to  the  point  on relaxing the requirement to  study  Higher

Chinese.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, in fact, we have really

relaxed   the   requirements   for   Higher   Chinese   quite

considerably  over  the last few years.   Originally,  Higher

Chinese  could only be studied by those in the  top  10%.   I

believe  it was in 1994 when we opened it up and allowed  the

top  20%,  from 10% to 20%.  And last year, we opened  it  up

further  to  allow  those  from  21st   to  30th  percentile.

Actually, one-third or 30% of the students now are able to do

Higher  Chinese, or higher mother tongue now, which is really

a much broader band.  So it is three times the potential pool

than it used to be.  I hope that answers, to some extent,  Mr

Goh's  desire  for  more students to be  able  to  do  Higher

Chinese.  But we still have a requirement for the students to

be  good in the languages, because we want to make sure  that

in  the  course of doing Higher Chinese, they do not overload

themselves, and find that they are unable to cope with either

the languages or with the other subjects.



<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> May I also seek a clarification from the

Minister  on  the implementation of the recommendations  from

the review of the mother tongue teaching?  I raised it during

my speech.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, mother tongue teaching was

reviewed over the last two years, and we are now implementing

the recommendations.  For Tamil



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1196</b></font><br><br>



language,  the revision of the syllabuses has been  completed

and   will   be  phased  in  from  2002  together  with   new

instructional  materials  and revisions  to  the  examination

format. We are also investing $2 million  in the Umar Pulavar

Tamil  Language Centre, and the upgraded centre will be ready

this  year.  And we have also done similar things  for  Malay

language,  with the new elective programmes and  the  honours

programme  for  Malay language and literature.   And  similar

things  for  Chinese language including another  SAP  school,

another  language elective centre in Nanyang  Junior  College

and one or two other things.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, Parliament last

year passed the Compulsory Education Bill which makes primary

level education mandatory up to PSLE.  The matter came  to  a

conclusion  with  the exemption of three categories,  namely,

madrasah  students,  children  attending  designated  private

schools  and  children  who  are tutored  at  home  by  their

parents.   Although my focus for this cut  is  on  compulsory

education  (CE)  for  children with special  needs,  I  would

appreciate it if the Minister could also provide an update on

new   developments   concerning  compulsory   education   and

madrasahs.   Specifically, I would like to  ask  whether  the

Ministry is convinced that the madrasahs are in a position to

cope with the minimum requirements of PSLE.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to children with special needs, I recall the GPC

Chairman,  Dr  Wang Kai Yuen, raised this  issue  during  the

compulsory education debate last year.  The concern for  this

category  of children still looms when our GPC met  with  the

resource  panel members recently.  There is a strong  feeling

that  such  children should be integrated into  our  national

school  system  as  opposed  to  leaving  them  entirely   to

voluntary welfare organisations to worry about the plight  of

these  children.   The  idea is to  cultivate  awareness  and

compassion  within the wider school system  for  our  not-so-lucky  children who are born with disabilities from  a  young

age.  Without some form of legislation, the education of such

children



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1197</b></font><br><br>



depends  very  much on the VWOs running the special  schools.

In  many cases, places in such schools are limited and a long

waiting list builds up, resulting in some children not  being

able to attend school.  This imposes a burden on the families

and  subsequently  on  the special needs children  themselves

when they become adults without any education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Sir, the current approach of delegating the

educational responsibility of special needs children to  VWOs

without  the  Ministry of Education's supervision  or  direct

intervention  may not be in the spirit of providing  for  the

rights  of  every  child, as embodied in the United  Nations'

Charter of which Singapore is a signatory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understandably, although the number of such children is

not  very  many,  the special requirements and infrastructure

needed to cater to special needs children are varied and,  in

some cases, may be complex.  I would like to propose that the

Ministry of Education conduct a detailed study of the  varied

needs  of  such children and thoroughly assess the situation.

The  findings  of  the study should be made  public  and,  if

necessary, the current policy reviewed on the outcome of  the

study.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also encouraged to note that the Minister for

Education  earlier remarked that the focus  of  his  Ministry

this  year  will be on teachers.  I hope he does  not  forget

also  teachers  who are dealing with special needs  children.

In the meantime, the Ministry of Education or the Ministry of

Community  Development  and Sports should  also  monitor  the

schools  run  by  VWOs  catering to  special  needs  children

closely   and  allocate  additional  resources  to  them   as

required.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Government has decided to

implement  compulsory education.  I would like  to  know  the

following:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the framework set up to monitor parents who

fail  to  register  or send their children to  school,  after

registering their children?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Under what circumstances will the parents be

charged  in  court  for  failing to send  their  children  to

school?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) I would like to know what help the Ministry would

provide for parents who fail to send their children to school

because  they  are having difficulty in coping  with  family,

financial, emotional or psychological problems.  Is there  an

action  plan  worked out by the Ministry to coordinate  other

key  social  service agencies for the purpose of implementing

compulsory education?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) A lot has been reported on this. I understand that

some   quarters  of  the  Malay  community  are   still   not

comfortable with the implementation of compulsory  education.

They  are concerned about how the implementation would affect

the  long-term existence of madrasahs and whether,  with  the

new requirement, it might also dilute the religious character

and  objective of setting up madrasahs.  Would  the  Minister

tell us what he thinks the issues are and how he proposes  to

resolve  the  issues  in  a satisfactory  way  to  allay  the

concerns of the Malay community?



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, MOE is conducting a pilot

programme  on  pre-school education.  In  today's  Singapore,

every  child enrolled in Primary 1 would have taken at  least

two  years of kindergarten.  But not every child has the same

two  years  of experience.  It ranges from private individual

attention   programmes   to   the   more   egalitarian    PCF

kindergartens.   It all depends on the wherewithal  of  their

parents.   Some  parents  even send  their  children  to  two

kindergartens  in one day.  The first one to  Montessori  for

individual  attention  and the second  one  to  PCF  for  the

discipline that they will face when they enrol in Primary  1.

It  is  a fact that some children start Primary 1 much better

prepared than the others.  The Minister in his reply  earlier

has  also  addressed  this matter when he  talked  about  the

Learning Support Programme.  So it is debatable whether  such

headstart  that the children enjoy has any long term  impact.

But  I  think the confidence gained by some of these children

with the headstart could mean an insurmountable gap for their

classmates to catch up.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we pride ourselves in providing an equal

opportunity primary school education to our children so  that

all  children,  rich  or poor, would  be  treated  the  same.

However,  it  is  clear that with widening  income  gap,  our

children  are not starting from the same starting  line  when

they  begin  the formal education in school.  I think  it  is

time now for the Ministry to provide subventions to certified

kindergartens so that more qualified teachers could be  hired

for these kindergartens.



<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, parents need help to navigate through

a  wide  range of options available at the pre-school  level.

Variety occurs in many ways - number of hours taught, type of

curriculum,  pedagogic  method  used,  teacher-pupil   ratio,

relative emphasis on language, second language, and the like.

That being the case, I think it is vitally important that the

Ministry of Education as the recipient of the products of the

pre-primary  system helps parents understand the requirements

and  what  they  ought to be looking for  at  the  pre-school

level,  to ensure that their children go through an effective

but not stressful pre-primary education.  At the same time, I

think the pre-primary education institutions themselves  will

benefit  immensely  from  assistance  from  the  Ministry  of

Education   in  structuring  a  curriculum  that  will   lead

logically and naturally into what is taught at Primary 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Minister announced that there would be

certain  longitudinal studies done to understand  better  the

value and the impact of pre-school education on children.   I

would  like  to  know,  first, what is  the  status  of  this

longitudinal  study; and secondly, in the interim,  while  we

wait  for  the  outcome of the study, what is being  done  to

address some of the needs I have just outlined.



<br><br><!-- Dr Aline K. Wong (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Dr Aline K. Wong):</b> Sir, I would like to address some of the questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on pre-school education (PSE). Last year, I

shared  with  Members  of  this House  MOE's  philosophy  and

approach to reviewing the pre-school education in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1200</b></font><br><br>



Singapore.  Our intention is to improve the quality  of  pre-school  education by focusing on certain areas where MOE  can

have high leverage while retaining its provision in the hands

of the private and people sectors.  MOE would improve the pre-school curriculum, raise teachers' qualifications, set higher

teacher  training  standards and more stringent  regulations.

We  had  also  announced that we would do  a  pilot  research

project  in order to guide our policy decisions.   So  it  is

timely  that  Mr  Iswaran has asked for  an  update  on  this

review.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the announcement that I made last year,

several  key  pieces of the review have been  put  in  place.

For  example, we have delineated the Desired Outcomes of pre-school  education which focus on values, attitudes and skills

rather  than specific academic competencies.  We have already

disseminated  this  set  of Desired Outcomes  widely  to  the

service  providers, and have also devised a set of curriculum

guidelines  based  on  the Desired Outcomes.   These  Desired

Outcomes serve as a timely reminder to educators and  parents

of  the  importance of taking a longer term view to learning.

Over-emphasising academic achievements and preparation for P1

may  yield immediate academic gains in a child, but they  may

be  at the expense of his motivation and love for learning in

the long term.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December last year, my Ministry and the Ministry of

Community  Development and Sports jointly  introduced  a  new

framework  for PSE teacher-training and accreditation.   This

framework  provides a common training path for  professionals

in  both  kindergartens and childcare centres and allows  for

the  upgrading  of existing training programmes.   This  will

help  to  enhance  the  standards  of  teacher-training   and

increase the attractiveness of the entire pre-school  sector.

Under  this  framework, all pre-school  supervisors  will  be

required  to  be  trained to diploma level in  four  to  five

years'  time.   During this transition period,  MOE  and  the

Ministry  of Community Development and Sports will facilitate

as  many  existing  supervisors as  possible  to  attain  the

required diploma qualifications.  As for accreditation, since



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1201</b></font><br><br>



the  announcement  of our accreditation  framework,  we  have

started   to   process  the  applications  of  PSE   training

providers.  They have submitted their curriculum, etc, for us

to accredit their training programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, we have started a pilot research programme,

in collaboration with the National Institute of Education, to

study  the long-term cognitive and non-cognitive benefits  of

pre-school  education.  Establishing the long-term  value  of

PSE  will allow us to make judicious investments in the  pre-school sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 2,000 K1 children from 46 selected pre-school

centres  are now involved in this study.  We have designed  a

new  PSE  curriculum with the Desired Outcomes in  mind,  and

this  new  curriculum will be child-centred,  developmentally

appropriate  and  tailored  to  help  children  acquire   the

critical   foundations  of  learning.    Teachers   who   are

participating  in  this programme have been  trained  to  use

these new materials.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first set of preliminary findings from this research

programme is expected to be ready by the end of this year  or

in about a year's time.  These findings will guide MOE in our

policy  planning  and help us determine  what  would  be  the

optimal  investment in the pre-school sector.  As Mr  Iswaran

asked,  while  we are waiting for the results of  this  pilot

research  programme, we have been disseminating  the  Desired

Outcomes  of PSE, designing the new curriculum, piloting  the

curriculum and training teachers for the pilot programme.  We

are  also accrediting the training programmes which have been

submitted by various training agencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen spoke on the need to provide pre-school

centres,  especially  those that serve the  majority  of  our

population  who  are by no means rich, with more  support  to

employ  better  qualified teachers.   Besides  improving  the

quality  of  the teachers, kindergartens would also  need  to

upgrade their curriculum and facilities in order to raise the

quality  of  education.   We  are aware  that  managing  this

upgrading process can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1202</b></font><br><br>



be a very challenging task, especially for kindergartens that

are not-for-profit.  MOE is therefore looking into how we can

provide  the  not-for-profit kindergartens with resources  to

help  them  manage this upgrading process smoothly and  bring

quality pre-school education to more children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the end of the day, our effectiveness in

improving  pre-school education hinges on how  successful  we

are  in  moving away from the current predominantly  academic

focus  towards  a more balanced and all-round development  of

the  child.   To  achieve this shift,  the  support  of  both

parents and pre-school educators is critical.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me move on to the questions on compulsory

education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Mr Ahmad Magad and Mr Low Thia Khiang have asked

about  the  progress  made so far in  the  implementation  of

compulsory education.  Mr Low, in particular, asked  what  is

the  kind  of  framework that we put in  place  in  order  to

implement  the  Compulsory Education  Act.   As  Members  are

aware, compulsory education will be introduced from the  year

2003  for the age cohort entering Primary 1.  We are  in  the

process  of  putting  in  place the necessary  mechanisms  to

support  this introduction.  For instance, work is  currently

underway to establish the CE Board and gazette the subsidiary

legislation by mid-2002.  Under the CE Board, counselling and

mediation procedures would be put in place to ensure that the

legal enforcement of CE would be taken only as a last resort.



<br>3.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low asked under what circumstances would parents be

brought to court.  In deliberating on the introduction of the

CE  Bill,  we  provided  for legal  sanctions  against  those

parents  who are recalcitrant and do not bring their kids  to

school,  but legal sanctions would be resorted to only  as  a

last  resort.   There would be a process of counselling,  and

assistance  would  be  given to families  particularly  those

encountering financial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1203</b></font><br><br>



problems,  relationship problems, and so forth, so that  they

can send their children to school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, the role of the CE Board would be to

review  cases  of  non-compliance  referred  to  it  by   the

counselling officers and, where necessary, refer the cases to

the  Director-General  of Education, who  can  then  raise  a

complaint  to the Subordinate Courts for legal  action  as  a

last resort.  So between now and the implementation of CE  in

the  year  2003,  we  are  putting  in  place  these  various

mechanisms   and   we  will  be  gazetting   the   subsidiary

legislation by the middle of next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Mr Ahmad Magad and Mr Low also asked about the

response  or  what actions have the Malay community  made  in

order  to adjust to the CE arrangements.  Sir, in making  its

recommendations,  the Committee on Compulsory  Education  had

solicited  feedback and views from the different  groups  and

communities  who would be affected by CE, and  this  included

the  Muslim community.  Specific recommendations, such as the

PSLE benchmark that the madrasahs need to meet, were based on

proposals put up by MUIS, in consultation with the madrasahs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members may recall, this benchmark has been pegged at

the  average PSLE aggregate score of EM1 and EM2 Malay pupils

in  the  six lowest-performing national schools.  We  believe

that the madrasahs are working towards meeting and surpassing

this PSLE benchmark.  After all, they have almost up to eight

years  from  now  till the first cohort of  the  P1  entrants

progresses to the PSLE level.  Or, up to six years  after  CE

is  introduced in 2003.  I believe they are already beginning

to prepare for this requirement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the exemption of special needs children from

the  framework  of CE is concerned, Mr Ahmad Magad  raised  a

couple  of questions.  Sir, exempting these children from  CE

is a decision we have taken after very careful consideration.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>



Currently,  we  have  a multi-tier system  to  cater  to  the

special  needs  children, as Mr Ahmad Magad  is  aware.   For

children  with  mild disabilities, they will continue  to  be

admitted into our national schools.  In fact, we have them in

both  the primary schools and secondary schools.  We  provide

them  with  additional support services as well  as  assisted

devices  to help them cope with integration and to study  the

mainstream curriculum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For children with moderate to severe disabilities, it

would  be prudent to let their parents decide on the type  of

education  and  care  that would best meet  these  children's

needs.   In some cases, the disability of these children  may

be so severe or rare that homes or medical institutions would

offer  them  better  support  and  care.   For  the  greatest

majority  of  children with special needs, they  are  already

enrolled  in  Special  Schools where they  receive  intensive

attention  from specially trained teachers, with the  support

of  specialised equipment and the services of therapists.  It

is better for them to attend these schools where they receive

an education catered to their individual needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the good intention and concern of those who

call  for  CE to include children with special needs.   Under

the  "many helping hands" approach, MOE will continue to work

with  the voluntary welfare organisations, the community  and

parents   to   provide  for  the  needs  of   children   with

disabilities.  Where necessary, more can be and will be done.

Caring  for these children does not mean that we must  extend

CE  to  them, or bring them under the framework  of  CE.   In

fact,  in  doing  so, it may not be in the best  interest  to

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you would recall, we have defined "CE" as education

within  our  national  schools  which  teach  the  mainstream

curriculum.   Even  with CE, the parents  bear  the  ultimate

responsibility  for ensuring that the child  attends  school.

Hence,  the  law  provides  for  penalties  for  recalcitrant

parents who fail to do so.  In extreme cases, the parents may

even be sentenced to jail.  For parents who are already



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>



burdened  with taking care of the child with disabilities,  I

am sure the Member would not like to have them come under the

law in such a manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exemption of children with special needs from

compulsory  education is not a violation of  our  commitments

under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  Although

Article  28.1(a) of the Convention requires States to provide

free  and  compulsory  primary  education  to  all  children,

Singapore  had entered a reservation to this Article  in  our

accession  to  the  Convention.  Singapore is  therefore  not

obliged  to  comply  with  this Article  of  the  Convention.

Nevertheless,  I emphasise that we have been taking  care  of

the needs of the special education children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Magad also asked that MOE should conduct a

study  of the needs of the children and, based on this study,

review  the  provisions for them.  MOE is in fact  constantly

reviewing the needs of these children.  However, their  needs

are very diverse and complex.  A general study would not help

in targeting assistance to where the needs are.  Instead, MOE

has  adopted  a  more targetted approach  for  children  with

specific  types of disabilities.  For example, we collaborate

with  the  Dyslexia Association of Singapore and  the  Autism

Resource  Centre  to  study  the needs  of  these  groups  of

children  and  to  cater to them.  We are also  collaborating

with  a  new society called SPARK to examine how we can  help

children with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder to

see how we can cater to these groups of children also.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me emphasise that our awareness of these conditions

-  autism,  dyselxia,  attention  deficit  and  hyperactivity

disorder  -  has  only grown substantially in  recent  years.

Expertise   and   resources  to  deal  with  these   learning

disabilities  are still lacking, not just in  Singapore,  but

the world over.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for funding for special education children, let me

inform the Member that, indeed, MOE has increased the funding

over the years.  For FY1999, we devoted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1206</b></font><br><br>



$18 million to special education.  This is a capitation grant

for  recurrent expenditure.  We increased that to $24 million

in  FY2000 and we are proposing a $27 million expenditure  in

the next financial year.  MOE has committed itself to provide

up to a cap of 2.5 times the cost of providing primary school

education for special needs children.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Wong, "guillotine" time is 4.10 pm.

We still have quite a lot of speakers.



<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Can I just take one more second on the

waiting  list  because  Mr  Ahmad Magad  mentioned  that  the

waiting  list is long?  There are 18 SPED schools  now  which

cater to about 4,000 children.  Of the 18 SPED schools, eight

have waiting lists.  Six of these eight SPED schools have  an

average  waiting  list of five children  and  they  would  be

admitting  these  children  by  June  this  year.   For   the

remaining  two  schools,  which  have  significantly   longer

waiting  lists,  we  are working with them  to  increase  the

number  of  sessions  so that they can admit  these  children

early.  And for children with autism, these schools are  also

doing some parent education to help the parents cope with the

needs of their children at home before they are admitted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Wang Kai Yuen is not speaking. Dr Tan

Boon Wan.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Sir, before I go into this cut, I wish

to  declare  that  I  teach  at the  National  University  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to note the support that the Government has

given  to  our  universities.  University  places  have  been

increased.  Over the years, our universities have contributed

to  the development of the country, successfully meeting  the

high  level manpower needs of the nation.  Recently, however,

the  tempo  of  change  has speeded  up.   The  pace  can  be

described  as  fast  and furious, the  change  radical.   The

impact would be long term with changes to the culture of  the

institution.  The resultant and intended consequences of  the

changes may not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1207</b></font><br><br>



necessarily  match.  The implementation of  the  changes  can

significantly  influence the result.  It may be  helpful  for

the  Ministry to watch the changes and the impact and  advise

the universities, where appropriate and necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, more of our young seek a university education.

Among  them  are  graduates from our polytechnics.   Although

university places have increased, they are not able  to  meet

the   growing  demand.   If  they  cannot  get   into   local

universities, parents are prepared and will continue at great

sacrifices  to  send their children to overseas universities.

Today, many of our young are studying overseas and the number

is set to increase.  Upon graduation, most will return home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore welcome the move by the Government to set up

a  fourth  university.  Some concerns have been expressed  on

the  quality of this university.  These concerns can be  met,

if  the  establishment of the institution is premised on  our

needs  for its graduates, and the students are being able  to

undertake  a  university education.  The university  can  set

appropriate  entry criteria to make sure that only  qualified

students are admitted.  Next, it must ensure that the content

and  quality of instruction and the output criteria  befit  a

university  degree.  If this is done, we can be confident  of

the  quality  of its graduates and that its degrees  will  be

recognised and accepted.  It does not have to be exactly like

NUS,  NTU  or SMU.  It will find its niche.  It will  not  be

worse  than  the  education that the  students  will  receive

overseas.  An education in the fourth university will be less

demanding and the parents will continue to enjoy the  company

of  their  children  and the latter, the  guidance  of  their

parents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the proposal to set up a fourth

university.



<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> Sir, I will just keep it short. There

is  a  trend  of  professionals leaving the  profession.   It

appears that they have made a mistake in the course of study,

or they do not like the course of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1208</b></font><br><br>



study.   I am just wondering whether the university  and  the

manpower planners are able to manage and respond to this  new

attitude and thinking of our young with regard to the  course

of  study  and the kind of work they want to do.   There  are

talks   about   professional  courses  being  a  postgraduate

qualification.    We  want  a  more  broadened   first-degree

course,  maybe a postgraduate qualification for  professional

courses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also this interview selection process for law

and  medicine.   I wonder whether the selection  process  can

give cognisance to the kind of mix and diversity that we want

the  young  undergraduates to go into these professions,  and

also  whether  we can open up the professional qualifications

through part-time studies for working adults because they  do

not  seem to provide the opportunity for mobility for  people

who have completed university education.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, Dr Tan Boon Wan has mentioned

the  changes that are taking place in our universities.  Yes,

they  are  progressing, and we will advise the  universities,

where appropriate and necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with some other specific issues. Mr Loh

Meng See has asked about the professional qualifications.   I

do not have the figures as to what percentage of students who

have successfully graduated from these programmes, decide  to

take  up  other professions later on.  I certainly will  take

into account the suggestion that he has and pass it on to the

universities in the selection of students.  As you  know,  in

selection  for  medical students, there is an interview  and,

during  that  interview,  they  will  try  to  ascertain  the

aptitude,  the  perseverance and the  real  interest  of  the

students to take medicine.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad:</b> Sir, in response to the

Government's repeated call for life-long learning, many  mid-career  executives and workers are enrolling themselves  into

part-time   and   distance  learning  in  undergraduate   and

postgraduate overseas programmes, to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1209</b></font><br><br>



upgrade  themselves.   As a result, there  appears  to  be  a

sprouting   of   course  providers,  from  universities   and

institutions of various countries, to offer their  programmes

in Singapore to take advantage of the favourable situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While qualification acquisition and personal upgrading

are healthy and should be encouraged, the concern lies in the

quality  of  some  of  the degree programmes  being  offered.

There  appears  to be an increasing number of degree  courses

being offered by non-accredited institutions, which are  just

out  there  to make money.  Competition for student enrolment

is aggressive.  Apart from cheaper course fees, some offer  a

multitude  of  exemptions  and  shorter  time  for  programme

completion  to  woo students.  Unwary people who  enrol  with

such institutions may have to find out the hard way when  the

qualifications they acquire are not recognised by prospective

employers or the Government.  Discontentment may set in  when

these  people are not able to obtain good jobs  in  spite  of

having responded to the Government's call and, more so, after

having invested large sums of money and personal time on such

programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I understand the complexity of monitoring or

supervising standards of such programmes, my concern  is  for

this to become a potential social and political issue in  the

future.  I would like to propose that the Minister consider:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. regulating the admission of degree programmes into

Singapore  and,  wherever possible,  ensure  that  a  certain

academic  standard is satisfied before they are  allowed  in;

and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. having periodic public education programmes, to

increase the awareness of being selective in the enrolment of

external degrees and distance learning programmes and impress

upon them particularly the importance of accreditation of the

universities offering such programmes in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Ministry of

Community Development



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1210</b></font><br><br>



and  Sports, together with the People's Association, has been

encouraging  the  elderly people in  Singapore  to  carry  on

learning  with the slogan "Making a spurt again  at  60".   I

think this is a good campaign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, I did not know that there was an Executive MBA

course  conducted in Chinese by the Business School  of  NUS.

By chance, a friend introduced it to me and I enrolled myself

in  the course.  At that time, I thought I was just embracing

the  attitude  of life-long learning and I hoped  to  set  an

example to the younger generation to cultivate the spirit  of

life-long learning.  I was also hoping that I could  pick  up

some  business  management knowledge  in  a  more  systematic

manner  from the university.  To my surprise, after embarking

on  this  course, I discovered that I have not only learnt  a

lot of new western and oriental business management knowledge

but  have also got acquainted with a lot of friends  who  are

senior executives in the Asia Pacific region.  They come from

China,  Taiwan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore.

We  have  therefore established a valuable regional  business

network  which  is of great help to me to explore  the  Asia-Pacific market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should expand this course so that there would

be  more  students  coming from the Asia  Pacific  region  to

Singapore.  I understand that the Business School of the  NUS

is now ranked first or second in the Asia Pacific region.   I

think,  if more of such courses are conducted, a lot  of  top

executives  in the Asia Pacific region would be attracted  to

come  here  to study, they will have better understanding  of

Singapore,  and thereby building up better relationship  with

Singapore.  This will be of great advantage to us.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, with your indulgence, I will

respond  to  Mr  Ahmad Magad and Mr Peh, and perhaps  ask  Mr

Peter Chen to respond to Dr Tan on the Fourth University when

I have finished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is neither practical nor feasible for MOE to

regulate or restrict the wide



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1211</b></font><br><br>



variety  of  external  degree  programmes  that  students  in

Singapore  may wish to subscribe to.  MOE is also  not  in  a

position to accredit their standards.  These courses can take

many  forms.   They might even be conducted by correspondence

or  over  the Internet.  The more practical approach  is  for

these programmes and their quality to be subject to the  test

of  the  market.  The employer is really in the best position

to  determine  which  courses  and  qualifications  are  most

relevant to his needs, and how much value and recognition  to

give  to  a  person's  qualifications.   At  the  same  time,

prospective  students  enrolling in these  degree  programmes

should  conduct  their  own careful and thorough  evaluation,

just  like  they would for any other investment.   And,  over

time,  students and parents would learn that not all  degrees

are  the  same,  and  employers  would  choose  to  recognise

different degrees and qualifications in different ways.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Mr Peh's suggestion, I will ask the universities

to take that up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Peter Chen):</b> Sir, I would like, first of all, to thank the many

MPs  and  members of the public who have come out  loudly  in

support of the proposal to start a degree programme which  is

industry and practice-oriented, often now referred to as  the

"Fourth University".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Points have been made concerning the quality of the

degree,  especially on the recognition of the  graduates  who

come  out  from  such a university, or who undertake  such  a

programme.   Some Members have asked whom the  university  is

targeting to recruit, if such a university were started.  The

answer must be students who are more at home in the practice-oriented culture than otherwise.  They are likely to  be  the

hands-on  type,  probably  with a polytechnic  diploma  in  a

relevant  field, an "A" level qualification, or  someone  who

has  considerable  work experience in an  appropriate  field.

The  most important quality that the person must have is  the

capacity to be able to benefit from a degree-level education.

He



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1212</b></font><br><br>



could be a full-time or part-time student.  If anything,  for

what  we  have  in mind, a part-time programme  lends  itself

rather  well to an industry and practice-oriented  university

where  real-life  problems,  from  the  student's  workplace,

become a learning experience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concern has also been expressed as to the quality of the

degree, and how the public will view such a degree.  I  think

the  concern  is  understandable.  Many  of  us  will  recall

similar  concerns  when  NTU came  into  being  as  a  second

university.  In Singapore, the authority to award degrees  is

a  jealously-guarded, almost sacred privilege, and I want  to

assure  the  House  that a degree programme,  or  the  fourth

university,  will  have  rigorous  admission  standards   and

criteria  appropriate  for an industry and  practice-oriented

degree.  It must have the support and acceptance of industry.

It  will  be a degree, as Dr Tan Boon Wan has said, different

from  an  NUS  or  NTU degree, but it must  be  a  degree  of

quality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some of the issues the committee (chaired by

me) that has been asked to look into the set up of the degree

programme, will consider carefully.  We will study models  in

the US, UK and Germany for relevant lessons, and we will make

our recommendations in the second half of the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have also been some calls for continuing education

and training, especially that we may make the best use of our

educational  institutions, that we should align the  existing

facilities  there, to enable them to play their role  in  the

provision of continuing education and training.  I would like

to  assure the House that those plans are in hand,  and  both

the   ITE  and  the  polytechnics  will  be  expanding  their

capacity,  from  the  point  of  view  of  the  provision  of

continuing   education   and   training   opportunities   for

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head L of the Main

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Sir, since independence, our Government

has  done a remarkable job in raising the standard of  living

of  most  Singaporeans.  We have been the envy of many  other

countries.   However,  we have paid  a  high  price  for  our

prosperity  and economic success.  If you observe  carefully,

many  Singaporean married couples today have to work and more

often  than  not, both the husband and wife have to  work  to

sustain  their living needs.  Of course, some choose to  work

because they want to be financially independent.  While  most

choose  to work because they have little choice as they  need

to  maintain and sustain their high standard of living,  many

also  want  to provide their children with the best  possible

facilities and benefits.  As a result, many parents have very

little  time because they usually leave their home early  and

come  home late.  Worse still, some even spend their  weekend

working instead of spending quality time with their children,

not  to mention fruitful communications with them.  As  such,

over  time,  children would become detached and  bear  little

feeling  of closeness to their parents.  Many would not  even

want  to  share  with their parents when they  have  personal

problems.  It would have a very serious impact on our  social

life if this trend is not addressed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1214</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in recent times, we notice that a growing number of

children are being looked after by domestic maids.   This  is

not  completely bad, but it does have undesirable effects  on

these  school-going children.  As most schools are still  run

on  a  half-day basis, these children will go home either  to

face  the  four  walls of the house or the maid.   We  cannot

expect  the  maid  to  perform the  role  of  the  mother  in

nurturing the children and supervising them in their studies.

As  a  result,  these  children have so much  time  at  their

disposal  that  they  end up loitering at  shopping  centres,

video arcades or even lazing around the neighbourhood and get

mixed  up with some bad hats and become juvenile delinquents.

This will eventually lead to more social problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has started experimenting with single

session  schools. But I understand that such  single  session

schools  are  mainly independent schools. In  most  of  these

independent schools, the children usually come from  families

with   better   educated   parents  who   are   professionals

themselves.  More often than not, these parents know  how  to

nurture and educate their children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is more on the neighbourhood schools. I

would like to urge the Government to introduce and expand the

single  session  schools  to as many of  these  neighbourhood

schools as possible.  They are schools with children from the

lower-income  families.   Usually,  the  parents   have   low

education  and probably have to spend the whole day  working,

and  have very little time or no time to spare.  Even if they

would  like  to  teach their children, very  often  they  are

limited  by their low education and knowledge, and  they  are

unable   to  be  of  any  help  to  the  children.   So   the

introduction of single session schools will keep the children

occupied with useful and beneficial school activities instead

of indulging in unlawful activities.



<br>4.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools can also use the time available to inculcate the

virtues  of  moral uprightness, respect for the elders,  etc.

Of course, I understand that we are short of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1215</b></font><br><br>



teachers, but I think we can recruit more teachers so that we

can help these students with their studies and their work  by

giving them remedial classes, etc.  But I still hope that the

Ministry  can step up efforts in recruiting and  training  of

teachers.  The schools can also look into the possibility  of

recruiting  part-time tutors to provide proper  guidance  and

conduct  useful activities for these children.  We know  that

if we do not invest in our young now, it will eventually lead

to  more  serious  problems later on.  Of course,  I  am  not

saying  that the parents should push their responsibility  to

the  schools in the education of their children, but  I  know

that  the schools can play an important and critical role  in

educating the children.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in

order  to  attend the graduation ceremony of my  daughter,  I

visited  London  last year,  and I took  the  opportunity  to

study  how  they rank their schools in England.  Over  there,

the ranking of primary and secondary schools is only used for

internal reference by the Ministry of Education to find  ways

and  means to encourage the schools to raise their standards.

They do not announce the ranking openly to the parents.  Only

the university rankings are made public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in Singapore, ever since we implemented ranking of

schools,  it  has caused some very intense competition  among

the schools.  All the schools wish to be ranked in the higher

echelon  and,  therefore, many of these schools  engage  good

principals and teachers and take in only good students.   So,

the  good schools are always good and those teachers who were

sent  to  the  top  50  schools are very happy  and  excited.

However, those who were sent to those schools which  are  not

listed among the top 50 will be disappointed and demoralised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I feel that the Ministry of Education should

review  this  ranking  of schools, and  let  the  schools  be

treated equally as institutions which impart knowledge to the

students and nurture



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1216</b></font><br><br>



their  moral,  intellectual, physical, social  and  aesthetic

qualities.  But, most importantly, the school ranking  should

be  used  only for the internal reference in the Ministry  of

Education as an assessment of the performances of the various

schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this ranking system should be retained, I think MOE

should  consider  the method of banding.  Perhaps,  we  could

rank all the schools into three bands.  First of all, set  up

standard  criteria for the banding, taking into consideration

the academic results, co-curricular activities, general moral

standard of the students in the various schools.  We can rank

them  as distinction, merit, pass, etc.  Those schools  which

attain distinction grades in all the various aspects will  be

classified  as  band "A". Those with merit  grades,  will  be

classified as band "B", while those which score only a  pass,

will be classified as band "C" .



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those schools which are in band "C" we should give

them  more   resources  and  other facilities  to  help  them

improve their performances. If the teachers and students  can

cooperate and uplift the school from band "C" to band "B",  I

think  we should give some commendation to  the teachers  and

principals. This will stimulate the teachers in the band  "C"

schools   to improve the overall standard of the school.    I

hope   that  all  the  primary  and  secondary  schools   can

eventually  reach  an  equally high standard.   I  feel  such

banding system is better than the present ranking system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like the "Cleanest Hawker Centre in Singapore"

competition.   Last  year,  we  only  picked  the  top  three

"Cleanest  Hawker Centres in Singapore".  As a  result,  many

stallholders told me that they did not stand a chance at all,

and  they simply dropped out of the race. Last year, I picked

the top 10 "Cleanest Hawker Centres in Singapore" and many of

these  hawkers  were very positive in participating  in  this

competition.   When the team of judges went to inspect  these

hawker centres, they found that the general standard had gone

up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is our town council. In the earlier

days, the Ministry of National



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>



Development ranked all the town councils from 1 to  16.   But

we  found that the top ones were always at the top and  there

was  only a  difference of 0.1 or 0.2 marks separating  them.

Those  who were ranked lower down were demoralised  and  they

felt that they had done their best but they were still ranked

at  the  bottom.  They  just could not be  bothered  with  it

anymore.   Finally, MND decided to band them into bands  "A",

"B"  and  "C".   As a result, this year when we  conducted  a

survey  among  our  residents, we found  that  all  the  town

councils  had  improved in their performance over  the  year.

This  shows that this banding system for the ranking  of  our

schools  can be feasible and would encourage all the  schools

to  participate  actively  in this competition  by  improving

themselves.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The "guillotine" time for this amendment

is 4.50 pm.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Sir, I will be very

brief although this can be a very long subject to talk about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have always used the word "tolerance" when we

discuss  race  relations.  But tolerance  implies  acceptance

without  questioning  why.  We should  go  beyond  tolerance.

Multi-racialism must never be taken for granted. We must work

hard  at  it through actions and deeds.  To do this, we  must

have  an  appreciation and understanding of  the  lifestyles,

customs  and  habits of each different race.  We  have  taken

steps  to  ensure a good multi-racial mix at our HDB estates,

by  fixing the percentage of each racial group in an  estate.

Then, when we noticed, after the 1984 general elections, that

people  were  voting along racial lines,  we  took  immediate

steps  to  prevent  the  possibility of  having  no  minority

representation in this House.  Can you imagine this House  of

MPs  of Chinese origin, and yet we tell the world that we are

a multi-racial country?  Thus, we introduced the GRC concept,

where a member from the minority race is essential in a slate

of  candidates  to  be elected.  And because  of  the  rising

religious fervour around the region and the world,  we  acted

fast by introducing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>



the  Maintenance  of Religious Harmony Act  to  preserve  the

right  to  practise without fear or favour.  This will  allow

our  multi-religious groups to conduct the practice of  their

faith  in  a free and fair way, as our racial groups practise

different religions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are positive actions that the Government took

because  we  wanted to avoid racial conflict.  Our historical

past  has examples of what can happen if there is a breakdown

in  racial harmony.  These are actions taken after the events

came  to  light. Therefore, the best place that we can  start

our  multi-racial culture is our schools.  Young children  of

different  races play and fight together, without a  care  of

each  other's  race or language.  Being innocent  and  fresh-faced,  they  enjoy  the  warmth and company  of  each  other

without   prejudice.   Thus,  from  young,  we   must   avoid

segregation  of  pupils for administrative  convenience.   We

must, for example, encourage non-Chinese pupils to join China

tours  instead  of taking only Chinese students.   Basketball

should  not  be a sport only for Chinese students.   Teachers

must have a high level of awareness on this subject.  It must

be  internalised  in them so that they can  handle  sensitive

situations  by not offering hamburgers to Malay students,  or

beef  to  Hindu  students.  Also, schools,  such  as  Special

Assistance Schools and madrasah schools, should develop their

own  programmes to allow students to understand  the  way  of

life of other races.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, fundamental to just tolerance is this need to

teach our students each other's culture and social behaviour.

When  our  children  from  young  are  constantly  doing  and

experiencing multi-racial social norms, it will not  just  be

blind  acceptance of racial tolerance.  Multi-racialism  must

be  based on a strong foundation of understanding, knowledge,

action  and deeds in schools that will carry them into  their

workplace and HDB estates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I hope that the Ministry will encourage schools of

their  very  important role of promoting  multi-racialism  in

Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> We have not been able to answer

all the points that Members have raised today.  If Members do

wish  to  pursue these matters with my Ministry,  I  will  be

happy to receive their letters or queries and we will try  to

respond  to them, including those cuts that we were not  able

to take today under the main Head.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to express my deep respect for Dr

Wang.   I  would particularly like to thank him for  all  his

suggestions  and  comments today.  The  reason  that  I  have

responded  to him so fully is because I take his  views  very

seriously,  and I know that many people take his  views  very

seriously and give them a lot of weight.  So, I felt  it  was

important for me to respond to his comments as completely  as

I  could  today,  just to make sure that  there  is  a  clear

understanding on the issues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform Mr Ong Ah Heng that, with the

exception of two secondary schools, whose transition  to  the

single  session system is tied to the completion of  the  new

buildings, all the other 160 secondary schools and three full

schools  are  now  operating single session.   There  are  48

primary  schools operating single session, but most  of  them

are  new  schools, and yet to achieve full  enrolment.   When

they  do,  they probably have to operate on double  sessions.

Either  that  or  they are schools in mature  estates  facing

falling  enrolment,  or  they are primary  sections  of  full

schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The single-session programme is a significant step

forward  for secondary schools and it has allowed schools  to

benefit  from  greater flexibility in the use  of  curriculum

time  and resources.  Our schools can now introduce  a  wider

range  of  enrichment  programmes to  cater  to  students  of

different abilities and family backgrounds.  The Ministry  of

Education  will  consider  whether  to  have  single  session

primary schools when PRIME is closer to completion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, education is a partnership among schools, parents

and the community.  No



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>



matter  how  good a job our schools, our principals  and  our

teachers  do,  they cannot and should not replace  the  love,

concern and support of the home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn now to school ranking. One of the

objectives  of  school ranking is to provide schools  with  a

yardstick  to improve their performance.  This is not  unique

to  Singapore.  I am a little surprised that Mr Ang says that

UK  does  not reveal their ranking data.  As far as  I  know,

they  actually do and also in quite considerable detail.   In

Singapore,  our ranking is really very mild and  gentle.   We

have  something  like  350  schools,  200  primary  and   150

secondary.  We do not rank the primary schools.  Of  the  150

or so secondary schools, we rank 50 of them.  In many places,

including  UK, and in many states in the United States,  they

rank  them from top to bottom.  In some states in the  United

States,  the avowed aim of putting the schools at the  bottom

is to name and to shame them into doing something about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can quite honestly say that in Singapore, I am not

ashamed of any of the schools that I have.  In our system,  a

good education takes place in all of them.  In our system, we

find  it necessary and useful to just rank the top 50.  In  a

sense,  there  is  a band of the top 50 schools  for  Express

stream  and  the  top 40 schools for Normal  stream.  I  have

distributed  the  data earlier on.  In  fact,  my  Ministry's

focus  in the ranking exercise is not on the absolute ranking

of  the schools, but the value-added ranking, because if  the

best  students  go to a particular school, I do  expect  that

that  school  would  turn  up on the  top  with  an  absolute

ranking.  What I am more interested, and what parents  should

be interested in, should be the value-added ranking, which is

to  say,  if a particular school has a student population  of

this  characteristic and this school is able to get more  out

of  these  students  than would have been normally  expected,

then  there is something special about this school.  I  would

ask  parents, Members of this House and members of the public

to  focus  on  the  value-addedness of the  ranking  exercise

rather the usual focus on the absolute ranking.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>



<br>4.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang has suggested that instead of ranking, we should

use  banding  instead.  To introduce a more well-rounded  and

complete  framework for assessment, we introduced the  school

excellence  model  in  1999  that allows  schools  to  assess

themselves on how well they have achieved, both academic  and

non-academic  outcomes.  In addition, the  school  excellence

model  appraises  management processes as  well,  since  good

processes will ensure sustained results.  Mr Ang may be happy

to know that banding of schools is practised under the school

excellence  model.   Depending on  how  the  school  assesses

itself,  to  appraise itself in one of five bands  available,

and  with  the first year's assessment as a base, the  school

will then chart its own progress, self-improvement strategies

and  track its improvements up the band or to the next higher

band  over  time.   The  school excellence  model  will  also

include  other  things  which  are  non-academic  in  nature,

including how they perform in other areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I come now to multi-racialism in schools? I

completely  endorse what Dr Tan  Cheng Bock has said.   There

are many principals and teachers in this House today as well,

and I urge them to take that message away with them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (In Mandarin) :</b> Sir, with our public

transport  system  still in need of further improvement,  the

school  bus  is still a very important service to our  school

children.  But now, in our housing estates, multi-storey  car

parks  are  replacing the parking lots on the  surface.  Many

school  bus  drivers have complained to  me  that  they  were

finding  it increasingly difficult to find places  for  their

school buses at night.  Even the schools do not allow them to

park the school buses overnight in the school compound.   Can

the Minister please help?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Sir, I just want to bring up one

aspect  of  polytechnic education, and this is in  regard  to

bringing   in  of  foreign  students  into  polytechnics   in

Singapore.   I would like to request the Minister  to  review

the current process, because part of it is done by direct



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>



recruitment, which I think is the best and preferred way.  In

some countries, they use intermediaries or agents to bring in

the  students.  When doing this, I would ask the polytechnics

to ensure that there is no profiteering in the process.  Even

if there is no choice and they have to use an agent, we could

work  out  a  scheme  on the scope of  work,  what  they  are

supposed  to  do,  how  much they are  to  charge  for  their

services  and things like that.  Because they not  only  make

money by bringing in the students, but once the students  are

here,  they charge for settling in cost, housing,  etc,   and

for  some of these charges, eg,  for housing, the margins are

more than reasonable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other possibility is for the polytechnics to do this

service themselves.  Maybe the Minister could do a review  of

this matter?



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br>4.35 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad:</b> Sir, student care centres (SCCs)

are primarily operated by voluntary welfare organisations and

non-profit  organisations with funding from the  Ministry  of

Community  Development and Sports.  Some, I  understand,  are

also  operated  privately.   Some feedback  I  received  from

parents  suggests that there is a commitment by the operators

of  these  centres to synchronise their programmes  with  the

school  curriculum.   On  the other  hand,  I  also  received

feedback  from operators indicating that the programme  could

be  more  effective and beneficial for the  children  at  the

centres  if  neighbourhood schools where they  operate  could

directly  cooperate  with them.  They will  be  in  a  better

position  to tailor programmes specific to the needs  of  the

children  if  the respective school teachers  could  directly

interface  with  the SCC operators.  Based on  this  valuable

feedback  from  the operators themselves,  I  would  like  to

suggest that a more coordinated approach be considered by the

Ministry, as we extend this programme to more neighbourhoods.

This could be linked directly with an individual or, for that

matter, a cluster of schools in the neighbourhood where  they

intend to locate.  Programmes developed by these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>



centres  could then be tailored such that they are correlated

with  the individual's co-curriculum.  Such an approach  will

not  only  benefit  the students but also the  SCCs  and  the

participating schools, as it adds greater value for  all  the

three parties involved.



<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M):</b> Sir, thank you for

allowing  me  to  reply to two questions.   Firstly,  on  the

question  of  parking of school buses raised by Mr  Yeo  Guat

Kwang.   Strictly speaking, providing parking facilities  for

school buses is a matter that does not come under the purview

of  the Ministry of Education.  However, we understand and we

are  sympathetic with the problems faced by many bus  drivers

to  find  a place to park their buses.  In fact, since  1983,

the MOE has allowed overnight parking for school buses in our

schools  mainly  to  help  solve the  problem  of  off-street

parking faced by them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position remains the same today. School bus

operators  who  wish  to  park  their  buses  in  any  school

overnight may apply directly to the school concerned.  I hope

they will communicate with the school and find a way to get a

place  to park their vehicles.  Today, about a third  of  our

schools are being used by school bus operators to park  their

buses overnight.  That is the situation today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Ahmad Magad made some suggestions concerning the

student  care centres.  Again, the activities and  programmes

of  the  student care centres are matters that  do  not  come

under the purview of the Ministry of Education.  However,  we

understand the concerns raised by Mr Ahmad Magad  as  to  how

they  could  maximise their programmes to benefit the  school

children  in the areas where the SCCs operate.  One  way  for

the  SCCs to design their programmes to meet the needs of the

children attending the centres, and if the children come from

a  few  schools  around the centres, I suggest the  operators

engage the schools directly,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>



talk to them and see how they can coordinate their programmes

to benefit the students.  I am sure many of the schools would

be  happy  to  do  this.  Today, in fact,  various  voluntary

welfare  organisations  have been  discussing  with  schools.

They  started  it  in  the past and they  have  devised  some

programmes  which are more suited to the children who  attend

the SCCs.  And I hope these people who raised the matter with

Mr  Ahmad  Magad could start a dialogue with the schools  and

come up with some programmes together.



<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peter Chen:</b> Sir, Mr Thomas Thomas has said that the

polytechnics,  in particular, should not use private  agents.

Yes, I agree with him.  They should not, and they do not  use

private agents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the point made here is really not private

agents,  but the concern is that some students may  be  taken

advantage of by certain individuals, and it goes beyond  just

recruitment.   Mr  Thomas also referred to  what  they  might

charge  for  bringing  them in and so  on.   I  think  it  is

extremely  difficult for the polytechnics  really  to  police

this.  It may well be a case for CASE really.  It could  well

be  that.   But  beyond making very clear  to  all  potential

students  that the polytechnics do not use any agents  or  do

not  take  account of any lobbying by anybody for  admission,

and  admission is based strictly on merit, there is not  much

that  we can do beyond that.  However, if Mr Thomas has  some

suggestions,  we  will be very glad to see how  publicity  in

this matter may be followed up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Sir, as a clarification, if the

foreign  students  are already here and they  have  problems,

would there be some sort of apparatus or mechanism to address

some  of  these  problems  and  grievances?   And  would  the

polytechnics help the students to resolve these problems?



<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peter Chen:</b> Sir, every polytechnic indeed has got

personnel  who  will  help students  and  deal  with  student

affairs.  If these problems are brought up to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>



polytechnics, the students will definitely receive  help  and

advice.   But at the end of the day, it may well be something

that  they have to be careful about, and the remedy may  have

to be sought outside the polytechnic system, eg, CASE.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw the

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (3), Mr Inderjit Singh is

not here.  Mr Heng Chiang Meng, please move the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San):</b>Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head L of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code LC 2100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when primary schools are situated in an HDB estate,

the  population  density of the estate  normally  means  that

ballotting  for Primary 1 places will take place under  Phase

2C.  This situation is made worse if the school happens to be

a  better  known  and  popular school,  when  the  estate  is

relatively  new  with many young parents having  children  of

Primary 1 school-going age.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this was the case last year in my ward when Rosythe

School  was  relocated  to Serangoon North  Avenue  4.   Many

parents  in the immediate neighbourhood, some of whom  living

just  a  stone's  throw away from the school, were  extremely

disappointed  when their children could not be accepted  into

the  school,  even  though  they live  well  within  the  one

kilometre  radius.   These unsuccessful  children  were  then

subsequently given places in other schools, many of which are

some distance away from their homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, depending on the luck of the draw,

children  living, say, one kilometre away may be  successful.

The result is that there will be many children travelling  by

buses  every school day to their respective schools.   Surely

this  defeats  the  purpose of having  neighbourhood  schools

which,  presumably, are to have pupils living  close  to  the

schools,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>



so that travelling time for the pupils would be minimised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have had this system for sometime now. While it

has  worked quite well in the past, I believe it needs  fine-tuning now to satisfy the needs of a new breed of parents who

are   now   very  much  more  involved  in  their  children's

education, especially at Primary 1 level.  I would  therefore

like  to suggest to the Minister to review and fine-tune  the

system.   For example, one way could be to rank the  distance

of each household from the school, and the ranking to be used

to  allocate  the  available places based  on  the  household

nearest  to  the  school having the pole position.   In  this

example, though within the one kilometre radius, those nearer

to  the  school will have greater priority than those further

away.  This method, I am sure, will ensure the children could

go  to schools situated next door to their homes.  I am  also

very  sure  that the Ministry could come up with  many  other

ideas.   The point is that the current system needs  refining

and perhaps it is time to do such refinements now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, we agree that the

school  holidays are very important to our teachers.   During

the   holidays,  they  can  do  some  reading  up  to  enrich

themselves  and,  most importantly, they can drop  everything

from  their heavy school commitments, and relax.   I  do  not

want  to  see   more  and  more  of  our  teachers  going  to

Woodbridge Hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But nowadays I discover that many of the teachers have

to  participate in many of the school activities, and this is

becoming an increasing trend, particularly HODs who  have  to

go  to  school every day during the school holidays.  I  hope

MOE  will  review this matter and make sure that our teachers

will have enough time to rest or to recharge themselves.



<br>4.45 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Sir, this point that I am raising on

private  tuition  has been covered by the  Minister  earlier.

But I just want to add on to the points and say that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>



in the normal course of teaching, it should be sufficient for

most  students to learn everything they need to  learn  in  a

classroom  and  then  maybe with a  little  bit  of  remedial

teaching.   But  if  our  students  have  to  have  classroom

teaching,  remedial teaching, private tuition,  in  order  to

cope, then some fundamental questions need to be asked.   Are

we  teaching  the right way or is there something  about  the

delivery  of  knowledge that needs to be  relooked?   Tuition

also  adds on to the stress of students, because I have  come

across  children who say that they are very  busy.   I  asked

them  why,  and they said they have got mother's homework  to

do,  school homework to do and tutor's homework  to  do.   So

they  seem to be always laden with work, work, work.  It  may

be a good way of starting off for their working life by being

hardworking, but I think we should also allow our children to

enjoy the fullness of childhood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I want to make is that many of the less

well-off  parents,  who  may not be able  to  afford  private

tutors,  may be at a disadvantage.  So we should try to  have

an  education  system in which school teaching  and  remedial

classes should be sufficient for all students.



<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Sir, on priority of allocation of

Primary  1  places,  MOE provides sufficient  primary  school

places to accommodate all children.  No child is deprived  of

a  school place and the majority of parents are able to enrol

their children in schools near their homes.  While there  are

sufficient  vacancies for all, my Ministry cannot accommodate

all  requests for any particular schools as vacancies in each

school  are limited.  The existing guidelines have become  an

accepted  means for parents to enrol their children into  the

limited vacancies in popular schools.  Normally, parents  are

able  to  secure places in primary schools without balloting.

But for those schools where the number of registrants exceeds

the  available  places, there has to be an allocation  system

that   takes  into  account  a  number  of  different,  often

contending factors.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the current P1 Registration System, children who

stay nearer to the school do get priority over those who stay

farther  away.  Should the demand for the school  exceed  the

number  of  vacancies in any phase of registration, balloting

will  be  conducted.  Priority will be given first  to  those

children living within one kilometre of the school,  then  to

those  children living within two kilometres of  the  school,

and   finally  to  all  the  other  children  more  than  two

kilometres away from the school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Mr Heng is suggesting is a further or finer

division of priority, so that some children get places at the

expense  of  others  who might get places under  the  present

system.   There is no perfect system, Sir, that  can  satisfy

everyone.   Mr  Heng's  model  of  replacing  balloting  with

registration  by  proximity  also  has  its  drawbacks.   For

example, with such a system, we may have to admit a child who

stays  100 metres away from a school but reject one who stays

101  metres away, for both of whom the school in question  is

the  nearest.  Is such a rejection more acceptable to parents

than  for them to fail in securing a ballot?  I do not  think

so.   What about for children who stay at equal distance away

from  the  school,  say, in the same HDB block?   How  do  we

differentiate  who from that block should get admitted?   For

such cases, we still have to resort to balloting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current system attempts to strike a balance between

various  important  considerations for P1 registration,  from

recognising  the importance of placing siblings in  the  same

school,  to  distance  from home, to  relationship  with  the

school.   MOE  is prepared to consider another  model  of  P1

registration if there is a better model.  However, till  that

better model is found, MOE has no plans to change the current

established  P1  registration  guidelines.   Nevertheless,  I

thank  the Member for speaking about this subject and putting

forth his suggestions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for school holidays, an issue raised by Mr Yeo Guat

Kwang,  our principals are mindful of the fact that  teachers

need  regular breaks in order to recharge themselves for  the

new term or academic year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>



They  do  ensure that all their teachers get  some  time  off

during the school vacation.  Such time-off can take place any

time  during  the  year's school holidays, depending  on  the

school's schedule and the teachers' duties.  All our teachers

should  have  more than two weeks' continuous break,  usually

during  the  December  school vacation.   The  scheduling  of

teachers'  involvement  in activities and  programmes  during

school  vacation is generally worked out by the  school,  and

sometimes by the individual teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intensity and range of activities and duties vary

from  school  to  school, and from teacher to  teacher.   The

principal has an overview of this in his school and will work

as  much  as  possible to balance the load on  the  teachers.

Teachers  can  be  involved in professional  development  and

student  activities, in the areas of remedial enrichment  and

CCA  during  the school holidays.  Our principals  are  aware

that  they  have  to  organise school activities  during  the

holidays  such that teachers have a significant period  where

they can take time off for a short break, and spend time with

their family.  Our principals are already doing so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of tuition, which Mr Thomas briefly touched

on, it is one of those phenomena or intractable problems that

societies  such  as  Japan and other  East  Asian  societies,

including  China,  Hong Kong and Taiwan face,  where  parents

place  a  high premium on their children's academic  success.

Demand  for  tuition  in Singapore is actually  driven  by  a

number of factors.  Among them, the aspiration of parents for

their  children is a main factor.  Where the child's  mastery

of  certain  subjects is weak, I agree with my Minister  that

tuition  and  remedial classes indeed  can  help  the  child.

Remedial  lessons  can help.  In the past,  educated  parents

would  often  coach their own kids after school or  supervise

their  children  in  doing  homework.   Nowadays,  with  many

working  couples, many parents find it difficult to have  the

time  to  do  so  for their children.  There  are  also  some

parents  who  feel  they  have lost  touch  with  the  school

curriculum or are outdated in what they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>



knew  from  their old school days.  These parents would  also

hire  tutors to help their kids with their homework.  I think

that  in  itself should not pose much of a problem,  although

ideally  the parents should still take interest and  continue

to guide their children in their home study.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are also parents who hire tutors in order

that  their kids can improve their grades from, say,  90%  to

95%,  to  98%,  or to obtain advance coaching  ahead  of  the

class,  whether  it  is  by a couple of  advance  lessons  or

sometimes  even by coaching ahead of the next academic  year.

Besides  overloading  the child, this practice  can  actually

cause  the child to lose interest in school and attentiveness

in  class.  The long-term effects on the child can  be  quite

harmful.   I  think giving too much tuition to children  when

they  are  already tired from school is going to add  to  the

stress level for the kids, and even for the parents who often

have  to  cart their children back and forth from one tuition

session to another.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuition takes time away from the child's rest and

recreational needs and eats into the time that the child  has

for reflection and for doing creative things by himself.   It

may reduce the child's sense of self-discipline because it is

best that he takes personal responsibility for completing his

own  homework.  Worse still, it can kill the child's interest

in  school.  Too much tuition would turn the child  off.   As

parents,  we  should  be  mindful  of  the  impact   of   our

expectations on children's learning and stress levels, and be

careful not to overburden them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our schools currently provide adequate time and

attention to students to learn their academic subjects fully.

Teachers  regularly give remedial classes to those  who  need

help  with  their  school work.  At the  primary  level,  the

learning support programme gives additional support to  those

identified to be weak in English and Mathematics.  The ENABLE

(Encouraging Achievement and Better Learning) programme gives

additional  support  to  those who are  not  achieving  their

potential.   Our  curriculum  has  given  more  emphasis   to

critical and creative thinking skills.  At



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>



the  same  time,  we  have reinforced the importance  of  co-curricular activities to enhance core skills and values among

our students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our schools therefore offer a holistic and broad-based

development  of  a  child.  Tuition  cannot  and  should  not

substitute for the education that a child receives at school.

There will always be parents who wish to supplement this with

tuition.  This is a choice for parents to make and,  I  hope,

to make judiciously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, thank you very much for so much time for me to talk

about tuition.  I never expected this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, may I seek some

clarifications.



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> I would like to remind the Senior

Minister  of  State  that  in the example  she  quoted  about

someone living 100 metres may get a place, and someone living

101  metres may not be able to get a place, at least in  that

situation anyone living 101 metres or more away will  not  be

able  to  get  a  place too.  May I ask her whether  this  is

fairer  than the current system where someone next  door  may

not  be  able  to  get  a place, whereas someone  living  one

kilometre away can still get a place, depending on  the  luck

of the draw?



<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> I think he did not hear what I say. For

both  of  these  families,  someone  who  lives  within   one

kilometre  or  next door and someone who lives right  on  the

border  of  this  one  kilometre, or of any  delineation  you

choose  to draw, my point is that for both of them,  this  is

their nearest school.  So is it fairer for the allocation  of

school  to  be  decided by a balloting which is  transparent,

which  everybody  watches, which everybody  knows  about  the

probability  of  success,  than  to  draw  a  ranking  system

according to distance?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Heng, can you withdraw your amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, "guillotine" time is 5.13 pm,

I believe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although it is true that it is all within the one-kilometre radius and it might be nearest to the school for

both  pupils,  surely  if  you are  talking  about  distance,

someone  living next door should have a better priority  than

someone  living  one kilometre away.  In any case,  both  are

equally in the same situation by being nearest to the school,

whichever school it may be, but at least the one next door is

nearer than the other who is  one kilometre away.



<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Sir, I am sure the Member in his meet-the-people sessions has also encountered cases where some

families  pleaded for priority to be admitted on grounds  of,

say, the child's sickness, or that the mother is working  and

is  unable  to  bring  the  child  to  school,  or  that  the

grandparent   cannot  manage  to  take  care   of   so   many

grandchildren.   So  these families are also  in  need  of  a

priority of allocation.  I think whatever system we adopt, we

have  to  draw  a line somewhere.  And when we draw  a  line,

there are always people on the border.  Balloting so far  has

been accepted by the parents as a very established procedure.

So  until we can find a better system, we will stick to  this

one.



<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, I find it difficult to

understand why the Senior Minister of State should  bring  in

other  people's arguments, like people being sick, one parent

looking  after  so  many  children.   We  are  talking  about

distances  away from the school.  Let us not bring  in  other

factors.   But,  in  any case, her mind is already  made  up.

Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head M of the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the topic I would like to talk about is sustainable

environment.   Sir,  there  are many different  environmental

rankings  for  Singapore.  The Political  and  Economic  Risk

Consultancy   Ltd   ranked  Singapore,  among   other   ASEAN

countries,  to  be  the best of the three  out  of  the  five

environmental   factors  under  their   consideration.    The

Greening Industry Network Index (GIN-DEX), with Thailand  and

US  collaborations, tried to link economics and environmental

development  with  the  consideration  of  energy  used   and

pollution control.  Singapore is ranked No. 8 out of  the  36

countries  under  their  ranking.   They  also  plan  to  use

Singapore  as a model to show others how one could deal  with

their environmental pollution while developing their economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is also rated to be one of the 15 top most

liveable  cities in the world.  I would like to ask  why  the

Environmental  Task Force of the Global Leaders  of  Tomorrow

rated us so low in its Environmental Sustainable Index (ESI).

Is  the  way  in computing the index not adequate  enough  to

reflect our environmental friendliness?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sustainable environment is an issue where not many

people  can understand its implication.  In the modern  world

we  live  in, we consume a large quantity of fossil fuel  and

raw  materials,  like iron, copper and  aluminum.   Even  the

environmental  friendly three-way catalytic  convertors  that

reduce  vehicle  pollution, the materials, like  rhodium  and

palladium,  that  are  used are not  sustainable.   In  other

words, once they are consumed, they are almost gone forever.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The environment is not sustainable as far as the

resources, that I have cited, are concerned.  Therefore, when

we  talk  about sustainable environment, besides  encouraging

the  use of renewal energy sources, we are trying to conserve

the  resources and sustain them for as long as possible.  The

concept  is  therefore  not to prevent  consumption,  but  to

minimise  the  consumption with efficient use.   The  way  in

which we should approach the sustainable environment issue is

to do it in the most feasible way of reduction, recycling and

reuse  of  resources.   In the energy issue,  we  should  aim

towards  the  best conversion of the efficiency  from  fossil

fuel  to  electricity  and to make the best  efforts  in  the

conservation   of   energy   at  home,   offices   and   road

transportation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have heard that our Government has introduced

many  of  the  recycled programmes for wood, paper,  aluminum

cans  and  glass bottles.  However, we did not  see  many  of

these  products sold in the local market using  the  recycled

materials.  Where have these recycled materials gone?  Is the

effort  taken by the Government in the promotion of recycling

not  enough  for  us  to  see the  resultant  impact  of  the

recycling movement?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what measures have we taken to promote

environmental   sustainability  on  reusing,  recycling   and

reducing?  What is our policy in environmental sustainability

in road transportation, power generation, energy conservation

for homes, offices, factory buildings and even for the random

demolition of relatively new buildings?



<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, like my GPC

Chairman, I am quite surprised to come across this  study  by

the  Global Leaders for Tomorrow Environmental Task Force  on

the  2001  Environmental  Sustainability  Index  which  rated

Singapore as one of the 10 worst performers in the world.  In

fact,  it ranked Singapore 9 out of 10 worst, below countries

like  Bangladesh,  Nigeria  and  Vietnam.   Although  in  the

detailed  report, Singapore was ranked half way  through  the

bottom  half of the 122 countries assessed, it is still  well

below countries like Sri Lanka, Russia, Fiji and Ghana.  As



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>



environmental  quality is one of the major factors  that  our

investors  consider before they commit their  investments  in

Singapore, such an international study may harm our effort in

attracting international investors.  The study did answer why

Singapore scored so low and insisted that the index indicated

in  the  report was accurate.  Of course, the correctness  of

the indexing methodology used by the task force is debatable.

Nevertheless,  an  international  report  like  this  can  do

Singapore's  image,  as an environmental friendly  nation,  a

great discredit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although many other studies, like my GPC Chairman said,

have  ranked  Singapore very high, we still need  to  clarify

such a well published study.  Therefore, I would like to  ask

the Minister whether they have made any detailed study on the

report  to  find  out  the  actual cause  for  them  to  rate

Singapore so low and to come out with an explanation so as to

put  our  views  across to counter this  seemingly  incorrect

assessment.   It is thus important that this is done  through

international media so as to affirm our commitment to  upkeep

our high environmental standards.



<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, both my GPC Chairman and

Deputy Chairman have already spoken on the Global Leaders  of

Tomorrow  Environmental  Task Force report  called  the  2001

Environmental  Sustainability Index.  What is interesting  is

that  the study used 22 indicators covering issues,  such  as

environmental  systems, stress reduction, human vulnerability

reduction,  social  and  institutional  capacity  and  global

stewardship   in  environmental  management  protection   and

participation to arrive at the index.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Mr Chen has said, 122 countries were indexed on

a  scale  of 0:100 with Finland scoring the highest  with  an

index  of  80.5, and Kuwait with the lowest with an index  of

24.7.   Singapore was ranked 65 to an index of  46.8,  behind

some  Asian  neighbours, such as Japan and Malaysia.   I  use

this  because,  at  about the same time,  there  was  another

report on the quality



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>



of  the  environment  by  the  Political  and  Economic  Risk

Consultancy   Limited.   This  report  covered   only   Asian

countries  and Singapore scored ahead of the other countries,

like  Japan  and Malaysia, as having the best environment  in

Asia, as I have just mentioned earlier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But why the difference? The answer apparently lies in

the  objectives of the two studies.  The first report was  to

measure  the  ability of a country to sustain its environment

as  it  develops further into the future.  The second was  to

measure the quality of a country's environment, as it is now,

at  the prevailing time.  So in other words, I take it  that,

while  the quality of our environment is high now, very good,

the question remains that: can we sustain it and continue  to

keep the quality high in the future as more demands, such  as

population growth and economic development, are made  on  it?

The answer appears to be negative going by the World Economic

Forum Report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is nothing new. There are many disadvantages

we have in this area, such as small land mass, lack of forest

and rural areas, high population density, or relatively large

industrial  base, and the like, work against us in sustaining

a  good environment.  Yet despite these factors, as shown  by

the  PERC  report, we are able to maintain a good environment

now, through the many initiatives that we have taken, such as

tree   planting,  garden  city  concept,  cleaning   of   our

waterways, especially the Singapore River, and also  all  the

other anti-pollution regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, so far, these and many other programmes of the

Ministry have served us well.  However, I would like to  take

the World Economic Forum Report as an early warning signal, a

wake-up  call, so to say.  The question we should  be  asking

ourselves  is:  are we still doing enough?  Are  our  current

philosophy of what we are doing and the policies correct, not

only  for  the short or immediate term, but also in the  long

term?  Do we need to take stock of what we are doing now  and

examine them in the light of environmental sustainability  in

the longer term?  Perhaps, the Acting Minister will enligthen

us on these concerns.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In doing so, I also have a suggestion for him. It is

recognised  that  we  human are the people  who  pollute  our

environment  and, therefore, for long-term sustainability  to

work,  there must be plans to make us pollute less.  So  far,

most  of  the policies to make us pollute less are  based  on

punishment.   I put it forward that they have not  been  very

effective.  Just look at our anti-littering laws and our anti-littering  campaigns.  After so many years, it is  still  not

effective.   Just  take a look at the  place  after  a  major

event,  litter  is  all  over the place.   I  dare  say  that

Singapore is kept litter-free by the street cleaners, and not

because there are no litter bugs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the real long-term solution is to inculcate good

environmental  behaviour as part of  our  habits.   For  such

behaviour to be habit-forming, we must start ingraining  such

behaviour into our children from a very young age by  mothers

at  home  to  be reinforced in kindergartens and  schools  by

teachers.  Sir, I suggest that we start with the mothers.   I

can  assure  the  Acting Minister that  he  will  succeed  in

influencing latter generations to be environmental caring  as

many  of  our social and behavioral values are imparted  from

our mothers.



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, over the last 35 years, Singapore

has    successfully    coped   with   the    challenges    of

industrialisation  and urbanisation and, at  the  same  time,

provided  a  healthy  environment for  Singaporeans.   Today,

Singapore  is  renowned as a Garden City with a well-designed

land-use   plan   and   a  comprehensive  and   sophisticated

environmental infrastructure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May 1992, the Environment Ministry prepared "The

Singapore Green Plan - Towards a Model Green City" to adopt a

fresh  approach towards environmental management.  The  Green

Plan  aims to address global environmental concerns, such  as

global  warming, protection of the ozone layer,  preservation

of  biodiversity  and endangered species  and  prevention  of

pollution  of  the  seas.   The Green  Plan  also  identified

strategic  directions with Action Programmes and targets  for

specific areas and sectors.  In this regard,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>



I  hope the Environment Minister can update the House on  the

targets  achieved so far, and future environmental management

efforts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have the following clarifications to make:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) What is the progress made in "The Singapore Green

Plan"?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Has the Ministry managed to build environmental

consciousness   among  Singaporeans?   What   are   the   key

benchmarks and indicators?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) How many firms have developed corporate

responsibility  towards environmental management?   What  are

the successful programmes or initiatives implemented?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Is there any review to improve the environmental

audit in Singapore?  Has such audit increased business cost?



<br>5.15 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I rise to

speak on the review of the Green Plan and the Rio+10 process.

If I may, though, can my first point be to confess that I was

identified by the World Economic Forum as a Global Leader  of

Tomorrow.  I am a member of the task force that produced  the

environmental  sustainability index that other  Members  have

referred  to.  I joined this task force late and I, too,  was

surprised at its conclusions.  I have given my inputs to  the

committee  by  email but I have been unable to  attend  their

meetings and full deliberations because of other commitments,

including the sitting of this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in that sense, I start off by saying I believe that

Singapore  has  a  generally  good  record  in  environmental

protection.   This  is especially in the  case  of  pollution

control,  the  so-called "brown" issues, which  explains  the

PERC  report  Mr  Heng Chiang Meng referred  to.   In  nature

conservation,  though, on the "green"  issues,  some  believe

there  are  shortcomings, and many of these result  from  the

intensity  of population and land use in Singapore which  are

inescapable, given our size.  In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>



this  sense, my own belief is that some environmental studies

will  always  rank us lower than we think,  because  of  this

question  of  sustainability, the peculiar  circumstances  of

Singapore and its geography, and of population density.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, let me come to my second point. This is that

we  have  to  look  forward to opportunities  to  engage  the

international community, to explain to them our strong points

and,  also,  to  accept  their  criticism  of  some  of   our

shortcomings, and learn to improve.  That is why I  bring  up

the  review of the Green Plan and the Rio+10 process because,

in  the  coming  year, 2002, there will be  an  international

review  of the 1992 Earth Summit that was held in  Rio.   The

new  meeting  will  be held in South Africa.   Singapore  has

agreed  to  a Green Plan and is now coming up to a review  of

that  Plan, and I would like to ask the Acting Minister  what

is the progress of that review.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is that I hope that, against this

background, in undertaking this review, the Government  would

be open and self-critical.  There are some suggestions in the

<br><br>1992&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Plan that have not been fully taken up, and  they

deserve to be considered anew.  There are also areas  we  can

improve  upon.   In  some  cases,  technologies,  like  power

generation,  waste treatment, and alternative energy  sources

like  solar power, have improved considerably in the last  10

years,  and we have to ask if we are making full optimal  use

of these improvements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point is that, in coming up to this review and a

review  of our national Green Plan, I would ask the  Ministry

to make a concerted effort to engage civic groups and experts

in  the process.  Many have already served in drawing up  our

draft  recommendations, but more can  be  involved  when  the

plans  are  openly reviewed, if indeed they  will  be  openly

reviewed.  Consultation and participation are good  ways  not

only  to  get  citizen  feedback,  they  also  help  them  to

understand the constraints and concerns the Government feels.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point, Sir, is that I would ask Singapore to

participate  early and strongly in the global review  of  the

Rio+10  process.   We are a small island  and  vulnerable  to

changes in the environment of our neighbours, or the world as

a whole.  We should, therefore, pay attention not just to our

environmental record here in Singapore, but the world's,  and

play  our  part  as  a  steward of the  common  environmental

heritage  of  the world.  This should involve  not  just  our

Government agencies or civic groups and experts.  Rather,  we

should use this opportunity to reach out to the international

community.   A  national committee can  be  formed  for  this

purpose, and it could serve to communicate and cooperate with

other  countries on these areas of common concern.   I  would

like   to   ask   the  Minister  if  he  would  seize   these

opportunities  to  reach out to explain to the  international

community, and fully participate in the efforts to  make  the

world a better place.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say (Acting Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Swee Say):</b> Sir, first of all, I would like to thank the Members

for addressing the issues of environmental sustainability and

the  Singapore Green Plan.  In my response, I will  touch  on

the broader aspect of sustainability.  I will not go into the

details in some specific areas, so as not to pre-empt Members

who will be speaking on these specific areas in the remaining

cuts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Prof. Low Seow Chay, Mr Kenneth Chen and Mr Heng

Chiang  Meng  mentioned  the  ranking  in  the  Environmental

Sustainability  Index (ESI).  As Mr Heng has said,  Singapore

is  a  city-state, a country with a small land area,  a  city

that  is densely populated, and we live in a highly urbanised

environment.   We see busy traffic every day.  We  also  have

industries  which are highly competitive and export-oriented,

accounting  for more than 20% of our GDP.  Some  people,  who

are  not  familiar  with developments  in  Singapore,  expect

Singapore  to face problems of polluted air, water and  land.

At  the  same time, they expect Singapore to face  a  serious

threat,   of  living  near  the  threshold  of  environmental

disaster.  Indeed, this is the assessment of the ESI,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1241</b></font><br><br>



ranking Singapore as the 9th worst in the world, in terms  of

the  danger  of  living near the threshold  of  environmental

disaster, as mentioned by Mr Kenneth Chen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reality is that today, in Singapore, we still

enjoy  clean  air, water and living environment.   With  100%

modern  sanitation for every household, refuse collected  and

disposed  of  daily, the incidence of food-borne, water-borne

and  vector-borne disease is low.  We are able to  stay  away

from  the  threshold of environmental disaster  because,  all

these   years,  we  have  been  able  to  harness  technology

creatively  and  effectively.  At  the  same  time,  we  have

applied   our  minds  innovatively  to  protect  our   living

environment  with a great sense of commitment, responsibility

and  social discipline.  Take the last 10 years, for example.

As  Dr  Teo  Ho Pin has mentioned, we published the Singapore

Green  Plan  (SGP), and this is our blueprint  for  a  "model

green city".  Dr Teo asked for the progress of the SGP.   Six

working  committees  were formed to implement  six  areas  of

action.   They formulated 133 action programmes,  which  were

published  in  November 1993, and they have been  implemented

over the last 8-9 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, due to time constraints, I will not go into the

details  of  all aspects of progress.  I will just  highlight

some  of  them as an illustration of the kind of progress  we

have  made.   For  example,  in  the  area  of  environmental

education,  we  started  a Council for  the  Environment  for

Tertiary Institutions.  There are now Environmental Clubs and

environmental educational advisors in schools, and the  media

continue to give publicity and coverage to issues relating to

the  environment.   Last  year,  the  Clean  and  Green  Week

received  the support of 28 private sector organisations,  71

GROs, 14 NGOs and more than 125,000 Singaporeans took part in

the   various  activities.   In  the  area  of  environmental

technology,  in  fact,  Singapore has  played  host  to  many

regional  forums, workshops, and exhibitions on environmental

technology.  We send and receive many trade missions.  At the

same time, we have set up the Environmental



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>



Technology  Institute (ETI) at the NTU, to support  and  help

start-up ET companies.  In the area of resource conservation,

we introduced the accelerated depreciation scheme for energy-efficient  technology.  We promoted recyling of  wastes.   At

the same time, our power plant implemented the combined cycle

technology.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of environmental audit, mentioned by Dr Teo

Ho  Pin, I am pleased to say that, of the 930 companies which

have a potential to pollute the environment, in fact, 230  of

them have gained the certification of ISO 14001.  This is  up

from  14  before  1992.  So we see a marked increase  in  the

number  of  companies  putting  in  place  the  environmental

technology   management  system.   In  the  area   of   clean

technology, we saw the additional supply of natural gas  into

Singapore;  the  introduction  of  unleaded  petrol  for  all

vehicles  since July 1998; the introduction of lower  sulphur

diesel  of  0.05% by weight in March 1999; and the tightening

of emission standards for industries and vehicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of nature conservation mentioned by Mr Simon

Tay,  I  believe  the Minister for National  Development  has

mentioned in the Committee of Supply that MND is now studying

the recommendations supported by the focus group.  I think he

also said that nature sites will be preserved for as long  as

they are not needed for development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of noise control, in fact, ENV has

introduced  new regulations to control noise from  industrial

premises.  At the same time, we have implemented a network of

21 stations to monitor ambient noise in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the whole, we have made good progress in the

last  10  years, but we will not stop there.  Next  year,  we

will  be publishing the SGP for the next 10 years.  Mr  Simon

Tay  asked  whether  we will continue to  involve  the  civic

organisations and so on.  I assure him that in the review  of

the  SGP, we will invite the private and public sectors,  and

NGOs,  to be jointly involved in the review of the SGP.   Our

aim



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>



is  to  get  it ready in time for release at the  Rio+10,  so

that,  as  Mr  Simon  Tay  has mentioned,  we  can  keep  the

international community up-to-date on what we  have  done  in

Singapore.  At the same time, to share with them our plan and

vision for the next 10 years and beyond.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay also suggested that Singapore should

participate  actively  in  the  Rio+10  Summit,  and  that  a

national  committee should be formed, to make  sure  that  we

will  come  up with an appropriate response to capitalise  on

the Rio+10 Summit as an opportunity.  Sir, I fully agree with

Mr  Simon Tay.  In fact, we did participate very actively  in

the  1992  Rio Summit, and we intend to continue to  be  very

active  in Rio+10.  Just like what we did for the Rio Summit,

we intend to set up an Inter-Ministerial committee to prepare

for  Rio+10.   At the same time, we will involve the  private

and public sectors and the NGOs in the whole process, so that

by the time of the Rio+10 meeting in South Africa, we will be

able to present a concerted response from Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Heng Chiang Meng and Mr Kenneth Chen asked what

are  ENV's views on the various rankings, and whether we have

sought  clarification  from the  World  Economic  Forum.   As

mentioned by some Members, if we were to look at the issue of

sustainability  from  a  natural  endowment  point  of  view,

obviously, Singapore would be ranked lowly because we  are  a

small country with no natural endowment.  We have conveyed to

ESI  of  the World Economic Forum that the sustainability  of

any  environment  goes  far  beyond  natural  endowment.   We

conveyed to them that with creativity, commitment and the use

of   technology,   we  can  push  back   the   threshold   of

environmental disaster, as in the case of Singapore.  ESI, in

response,  recognised our performance up to  now.   In  their

reply,  they  said that in terms of environmental  regulation

and  management, they rank Singapore as the 5th best  in  the

world.   In  the  area of global cooperation,  activeness  in

participation  in global movements and so on,  they  rank  us

among the top 25% in the world.  In the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>



area of environmental health, they rank us as amongst the top

33%.   In  the first final report published early this  year,

they have reviewed the position of Singapore.  Instead of No.

9  from  the bottom, they have moved us up to 65th  position,

somewhere in the middle.  Obviously, this is not good enough.

We  will continue to work on our strategy for sustainability,

and  continue  to explain to the global community,  including

ESI, so that they can understand better what we have done and

what we will continue to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, our challenge in environmental management

is  to  protect  and enhance our living environment,  not  by

slowing  down  economic growth to reduce energy and  resource

consumption.   If  we do that, we may well  be  living  in  a

cleaner  environment, but we will all be poorer off.  Rather,

we are going to do it by maximising efficiency and minimising

wastage,  as  commented by some Members.  This is  to  ensure

that  our  continued  economic  growth  and  improvement   in

standard  of  living are not achieved at the expense  of  the

environment.  Our twin objectives, basically, are to continue

to  enhance  performance in the short term and, at  the  same

time, strengthen the sustainability for the long term.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low Seow Chay and Mr Heng Chiang Meng asked what

our  strategies  for sustainability are, and whether  we  are

doing enough, have we taken stock and what more will be done.

Sir,  I  am  pleased  to report to the  House  that  we  have

reviewed our current strategies.  We have also met with  many

of  our  partners in the past few months, including  the  GPC

members  who  are  here  today, the Environmental  Management

Association  of  Singapore (EMAS), professional  associations

such   as   SIA   and  IES,  staff  unions,   the   Singapore

Confederation of Industries, the Association of Lorry Owners,

Bus Owners and Travel Agents, the recyclers, the Pest Control

Association of Singapore, the Singapore Sanitary and Plumbing

Association, as well as the GMs of the Town Councils.   After

taking  into account their feedback and suggestions, we  have

updated   the   overall   framework   for   performance   and

sustainability.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have asked the Clerk to distribute a table. I am not

sure  whether you have it.  If not, I will make sure you have

it  after this.  I will highlight some of the key features in

this  particular  table.  Sir, the environment  is  a  closed

loop.   What  goes up must come down, and what goes  in  must

come out.  In the new economy, we talk about end-to-end.   In

the case of environment management, we have decided to go one

step further.  We are not just talking about end-to-end,  but

also  tying the two ends together, what we call "closing  the

environmental loop".  Let me highlight some of  the  concepts

in  the tying of this environmental loop.  Take, for example,

clean air.  We recognise that more energy will be consumed by

factories,  offices and households.  At  the  same  time,  we

recognise that there will be more vehicles on the road.   For

sustainability, we can close the energy loop, and this  means

that we will continue to tighten control on emission but,  at

the  same  time, we also switch faster to cleaner energy  and

step  up energy conservation, a point made by Prof. Low  Seow

Chay.



<br>5.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our long-term target, over the next 10 years at least,

is  to ensure that the air quality in Singapore will continue

to stay within the US EPA and the World Health Organisation's

clean air standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of clean land, based on current trend, we

need  to  build  a new incineration plant every  five  years.

Every  30 years, we need to find a place the size of  Sentosa

Island  for  landfill.  To  achieve sustainability,  we  have

decided  to  close the solid waste loop. This means  that  we

will  ensure the proper collection and disposal of waste but,

at  the  same time, we will pursue the 4Rs more pro-actively,

as  recommended by Prof. Low Seow Chay. These 4Rs are  reuse,

reduce,  recycle  and  recover.  We  will  also  give  higher

priority  to the development of the recycling industry.   Our

aim is to make Singapore a centre of excellence in 4Rs in the

Asia Pacific.  Right now, 40% of the solid waste generated in

Singapore  every  day is being recycled.  Over  the  next  10

years, our target is to increase it to 50%.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On clean water, today we supply about 300 mgd of clean

water for a population of about four million.  In the future,

we will need to supply more clean water to meet the need of a

growing   population  and  a  growing  economy.   To  enhance

sustainability in the supply of clean water, we will continue

to  tap  on  existing  sources of supply,  such  as  rainfall

collection, water from Malaysia and, at the same  time,  look

for  new  supplies,  for  example,  from  Indonesia,  through

desalination and so on.  We will also pursue the core concept

of  closing the water loop.  This means that we will  reclaim

used  water to produce high grade clean water, known  as  the

Newater.   This  is why we have decided to  merge  the  Water

Department,   the  Drainage  Department  and   the   Sewerage

Department to form the new PUB.  This is, of course,  subject

to  legislative approval by this House tomorrow.  Our  target

over  the  next 10 years is to increase the rate of recycling

of  used water from the present 5% to 20% through the use  of

Newater.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of safe food, we are seeing the re-emergence

of diseases that could affect food supply, for example, Nipah

virus,  mad cow disease, foot and mouth disease. At the  same

time,  the world is also facing new uncertainty brought about

by  advances  in  life  sciences,  for  example,  genetically

modified food.  To ensure food safety, we need to monitor and

manage  the  entire food value chain. This  means  having  to

monitor development in external farms and controlling imports

when  necessary.  At the same time, we have to ensure  proper

processing,  handling, storage, distribution and  consumption

of  these  foods in Singapore.  We also need to forge  closer

collaboration between ENV and AVA and relevant agencies.   At

the same time, closer collaboration between Singapore and the

various  regional and international agencies.    Our  target,

over  the  next 10 years, is to avoid any massive  food-borne

disease outbreaks in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of infectious diseases, we see recent

emergence of infectious diseases in other parts of the world,

for  example, Avian flu, Hantavirus and so on.  We  also  see

the re-emergence of diseases



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>



such  as  malaria, dengue and Legionnaires' disease.  Coupled

with  the  greater  cross  border  movement  of  people   for

employment,  holidays, business, etc, we  have  come  to  the

conclusion  that  we could only keep the risk  of  infectious

diseases  low in Singapore, firstly, by upgrading  our  local

capabilities  to deal with these diseases and,  secondly,  to

strengthen  regional cooperation as well as to  forge  closer

international collaboration because diseases know no national

boundary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, we are the World Health Organisation's

Collaborating  Centre for Environmental Epidemiology  in  the

Western  Pacific region.  We are also recognised as a leading

country  in  vector control by the World Health Organisation.

Our  target  over  the next 10 years is to become  a  leading

research  and management centre for communicable  disease  in

the Asia-Pacific.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On living environment, we have kept Singapore clean and

green  by  spending  a lot of money and employing  a  lot  of

cleaners  and, at the same time, issuing a lot of  fines,  as

mentioned  by  one  of  the Members.  Looking  ahead  towards

sustainability, I agree fully with the Member that we  should

strive  to become a country where every citizen and  resident

will play his or her part to care for, and to take pride  in,

our living  environment.  We will step up public education to

instill  civic-mindedness in our people.  We  will  encourage

the  active citizenry and strengthen the 3P partnership - the

people,  public  and  private sector  partnership,  including

mothers, as suggested by Mr Heng Chiang Meng, so as  to  make

"keeping  Singapore  clean and green" our  daily  habit,  our

daily desire and our way of life.  Our target, over the  next

10 years, is that we want to be a clean, green and fine city,

but not a city of fines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve these outcomes in environmental

sustainability, ENV will reinvent itself.  We will  build  on

our current strength and, at the same time, strive to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>



do  even better by being more innovative, more responsive and

better  in  learning in a fast changing world.  Our intention

is  to  restructure  ENV into a Ministry  with  a  very  lean

headquarters,  with  possibly three statutory  boards.  These

are,  firstly, the new PUB, which is effectively the national

water  authority to take charge of clean water.   The  second

statutory  board will be the Environmental Health  Agency  to

take  charge  of safe food, vector control and public  health

relating   to   infectious  diseases.    And   thirdly,   the

Environmental  Protection Agency which will  take  charge  of

clean  air  and clean land.  This will not happen  overnight.

Our aim is to achieve this over the next 18-24 months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I have outlined this evening is a broad

framework,   aimed   at   enhancing   our   performance    in

environmental protection in the short term and, at  the  same

time,  sustaining  our environment to support  the  long-term

development of our economy and society.  This is version 1.0.

This  is  not cast in concrete.  We will continue the process

of  consultation  with the 3P sectors.  We  believe  that  by

putting  our heads together and working together, we can  not

only  protect our environment for today, make it  better  for

tomorrow, but also sustain it for generations to come.



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, point of clarification. I commend

the  Ministry for encouraging the schools to form environment

clubs.   I  understand  that in many of  these  schools,  the

environment  club comprises very small groups of about  30-50

students.   I  wonder whether the Ministry can  provide  more

support  to  help the schools to outreach to more  pupils  to

develop this passion to protect the environment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> I thank Dr Teo Ho Pin for his very

good  suggestion.  My Ministry will see what  we  can  do  by

working closely with the Ministry of Education on this.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, the next topic I would

like to talk about is Newater.  Years ago, I spoke about  the

possibility of recycling some of our domestic used water  for

reuse and suggested that the domestic sewers be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>

separated from the industrial sewers for the purpose of water

recycling without industrial contamination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lately, Members of Parliament were invited by the

Ministry of the Environment to visit the Newater plant  which

recycles water for reuse.  We all note with surprise  that  a

modernised  water factory, producing huge volumes of  crystal

clear  water  has already materialised.  We  were  told  that

large  quantities of water were piped into the  golf  courses

for  watering of the grass and whatever excess from the plant

is thrown into the sea.  What a waste!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask what is the cost and quality of

Newater.  Is it safe for drinking?  What infrastructure do we

need  to  deliver Newater to the end user? Sir, the  idea  of

using  micro-filtration and low pressure reverse osmosis  for

brackish water was heard of many years ago. Is the technology

used  for  the Newater plant considered to be a technological

breakthrough?  If  so,  what is it?   As  we  know  that  the

membrane  technology evolves very rapidly  in  the  past  few

years,  if we invest heavily in this way in producing  water,

how  could  we  be  sure  that  our  water  plant  could   be

evolutionary?  What is the strategy adopted to keep  in  pace

with  water  technology  development  which  is  evolving  so

rapidly?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is importing water from our neighbours. This

Newater  initiative  offers us a means to  reduce  our  water

dependency on outside supply.  Theoretically, if the price is

right,  we should produce as much water as we need.  What  is

the long-term objective, in terms of product quantity and the

applications  of  Newater?  The low pressure reverse  osmosis

for  brackish  water depends on the type of membranes  chosen

and  the  system design.  We are able to obtain  even  higher

quality  of  water than the PUB water that  we  consume  now.

There should be no doubt at all that one day, Newater will be

served as potable water.  I would like to ask, in case  of  a

water shortage emergency, could Newater be consumed as normal

drinking  water?  Are there plans to educate  the  public  to

accept Newater as an alternative to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>



potable  water?   Newater is produced through a high pressure

process, and energy is needed.  The cost of producing Newater

will  be  higher than that of the conventional filtration  of

raw  clean  water.  If we are able to secure  sufficient  raw

water  supplies,  it does not sound very sensible,  from  the

economic  point of view, to put our Newater plant running  at

full  load.  If we could purchase cheaper water elsewhere  in

sufficient  quantities, accept the lower cost in future,  how

do we deal with the excess Newater plant capacity that we are

going to build?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low pressure reverse osmosis for Newater operates at

pressure  of  one-tenth  of that of  the  sea  water  reverse

osmosis.  In other words, the desalination of sea water  will

be  many  times higher in cost as compared with  the  reverse

osmosis  for  the  Newater plant.  If  Newater  is  a  viable

alternative water source, what is the role of the more costly

sea  water  desalination?   Are we  planning  to  shelve  the

desalination  plan which has been under review  for  quite  a

while?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, water is precious.

We  should educate and inculcate in our people the message of

saving  every drop of water and not wasting water.   This  is

because  the  bulk  of water we use in  our  daily  lives  is

dependent  on  the supply from our neighbouring  country.  In

2060, when our water agreement with Malaysia expires, we  may

face  some problems.   Although there are still some 60 years

to  go,  we cannot wait until then before we take any action.

We must be fully prepared.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Government has started the ball rolling. We embarked

on  an  experimental  project on  desalination  and  we  also

commenced  to  recycle our waste water.  I am very  glad  the

Ministry  of the Environment has finally announced  that  our

Newater  project  is  a success.  The  birth  of  Newater  is

exciting  and  this technological breakthrough is  indeed  an

honour  to Singapore.  This may well be the solution and  new

hope  to  our  water  supply  problem,  and  may  reduce  our

dependence on our neighbouring countries for the supply.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1251</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister what is the difference

between the Newater and the desalinated water in terms of the

cost   of  processing.    Secondly,  the  Ministry   of   the

Environment  said  that there is a possibility  that  Newater

could  be potable. Has there been any evidence, so far,  that

this  Newater  could  be used for drinking  and  whether  any

experiment  has been conducted in, say, the zoo or  the  bird

park?   With the advance in technology, will the Ministry  of

the  Environment  consider Prof. Low Seow  Chay's  suggestion

that  this  Newater  be  bottled  and  sold  to  enhance  the

confidence of the people?



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> For the information of Members, the

person chairing the proceedings in the Committee is addressed

as Chairman, and not as Deputy Chairman.



<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, I did address you as

Chairman.   I only once, earlier on, addressed you as  Deputy

Speaker.   Most of the comments I am going to say  have  been

covered by the two earlier speakers.  I just want to add that

I   understand  that  Newater  is  biologically  very  clean.

However,  Newater from the present pilot project is currently

for   non-potable  uses,  such  as  watering  and  for  other

industrial use.  It is a pity, though I must say  that  I  do

understand  why  people are psychologically  apprehensive  of

drinking what was previously water used for flushing toilets.

Perhaps in this respect, the Acting Minister and maybe  other

Government  leaders  should take active steps  in  persuading

Singaporeans to overcome this psychological barrier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Maybe to drink it first!



<br>5.45 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> They take the lead to drink it

first.   Would  you?   I think we should not  wait  until  an

emergency  situation arises, then we persuade others.   Since

it  is  quite clear that this is one of the steps we have  to

take  to  diversify  our  sources of  water  supply,  perhaps

education,  including  taking the  first  step,  in  drinking

Newater should start now.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1252</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as was mentioned earlier, another source of potable

water is from desalination.  The Government, I understand, is

in the midst of planning for a pilot project plant to produce

desalinated water.  May I know when the project  will  be  on

stream, ie, producing water ready for potable use?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was told by some friends, who have had experience

drinking desalinated water in the Middle East, that the taste

will  not be to the liking of Singaporeans, to say the least.

As  I have not drunk desalinated water, I do not know what it

tastes  like. I would like to know whether our water  experts

have  tasted  water  from desalinated  plants.   And  if  the

comments  of  my  friends are true,  what  accounts  for  the

unpalatable taste?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I also ask the Acting Minister how would the

desalinated water or Newater be piped for potable use, if  it

comes  to  that point, especially for Newater?   Will  it  be

piped  directly to the homes from the plants, or will  it  be

mixed  with our traditional sources of potable water?  Surely

if  people are apprehensive of drinking Newater, if they  can

be  mixed  with  our  traditional sources  of  water  in  the

reservoirs,   perhaps  this  will  overcome   some   of   the

psychological barrier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next point I would like to ask is what about

the  other  sources  of  water,  such  as  water  from  other

Malaysian states and Indonesia.  We heard some time ago about

these  plans, but since then we have heard nothing much about

them.  Could the Acting Minister tell us the current status?



<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, at the present moment, we

are  relying quite heavily on water supply from Malaysia,  as

the  Singapore land mass is small and catchment of  rainwater

is  limited  to a few existing reservoirs.  As our population

grows  and  our industries expand, our demand for water  will

keep on increasing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand the Ministry of the Environment has

embarked  on a few initiatives to increase our water  supply,

namely,  the  integration  of  the  Sewerage  Department  and

Drainage Department with the Water Department, deep tunnel



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1253</b></font><br><br>



sewerage systems, water recycling, industrial water,  Newater

and  the desalination of sea water.  With today's technology,

reclaiming  waste water has become a very viable  alternative

source of water supply.  The setting up of our Newater  plant

has  proved that waste water can be recyled to produce  clean

water to the quality even higher than that of the present PUB

standard.   With  the  completion  of  deep  tunnel  sewerage

system,  the  quantity  of  waste  water  collection  can  be

increased  tremendously and therefore our recycled water  can

be increased correspondingly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only today it was reported that the cost of desalination

is  about  one-third of what it was 10 years ago, and  it  is

still falling.  With the setting up of our first desalination

plant  to desalinate sea water into usable water, it is hoped

that  our  reliance on foreign water source would be  greatly

reduced, as we face constant threat of supply being  cut  off

by our neighbour.  I would like to ask the Minister to update

us  on the current as well as the medium term of water supply

situation  when all our initiatives for increasing our  water

supply are realised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite all these additional sources of water

supply,  I  think  we  should not ignore  the  importance  of

limiting water wastage.  Recently, there seems to be a let up

on  the effort made to press home the importance of the  save

water  message  to the public.  As the demand and  supply  of

water  is  interlinked, and while we can  ensure  more  water

supply  in  the future, it is equally important to limit  the

demand  as  much  as we can now.  I would  suggest  that  the

Ministry  not to relent on reminding the general  public  the

importance  of  limiting wastage of  water.   Otherwise,  the

pressure of ever increasing the demand can never be reduced.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, I thank Members for speaking on

this  subject  of  Newater.   I would  like  to  organise  my

response  in  a certain sequence.  Firstly, I would  like  to

address  what is Newater, because Prof. Low Seow  Chay  asked

whether is this a technological breakthrough, is it something

new.   Let  me put it this way.  Right now, we consume  about

300 million



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>



gallons  of water every day.  And we treat every single  drop

of  this  water,  because what goes in  must  come  out.   We

consume  about  300 million gallons every day and  output  is

also 300 million gallons every day, and we treat every single

drop  of this used water.  Today, only 5% of this used  water

is recycled as industrial water.  The other 95% is discharged

into  the  sea.   But  with  the  advances  in  the  membrane

technology, we are saying that instead of discharging it into

the sea, why not reclaim the water, because we can now do  so

very cost effectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how do we do it? Basically, through three stages.

The  first step is to take the water through what we  call  a

process of micro filtration.  In so doing, we remove the very

small  solids  down  to the size of 0.2  micron.   This  will

filter out, for example, bacteria.  After the first stage  of

micro  filtration, we move on to the second  stage  known  as

reverse  osmosis.   This is to remove the remaining  viruses.

These are the smallest living organisms, down to the size  of

1,000th  of  a micron.  After that, we put the water  through

ultraviolet, as a safeguard, to sterilise the water.  And the

output is high grade water which we call Newater.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second aspect is the cost of this Newater resulting

from  technology breakthrough.  Prof. Low Seow Chay, Mr  Heng

Chiang  Meng and Mr Ang Mong Seng asked about the cost.   Let

me clarify.  The membrane technology is not new.  It has been

around  for  a  long,  long time.   In  fact,  this  membrane

technology has been used in the USA, Australia, UK and France

to  reclaim water for years.  So we are not the first in  the

world.   But  what  is new is that today,  this  membrane  is

thinner  and more durable.  In the past, the membrane  needed

to be replaced every three years.  Now, we need to do so only

once  every five years.  Because the membrane is thinner,  we

are  able  to  push through water through the  membrane,  the

process of reverse osmosis, at a much reduced water pressure.

This reduction in water pressure is about 50%, because of the

thinness   of  the  membrane.   As  a  result,   the   energy

requirement has come down.  The cost of Newater is  therefore

much cheaper now.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1255</b></font><br><br>



And  because  of this, it has now become a viable  source  of

clean water supply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the cost of Newater compared to desalination is

very much lower.  Why, you may ask?  After all, they use  the

same  membrane for desalination and Newater.  Why then is  it

cheaper to produce Newater?  This is because used water has a

lower total dissolved solid compared to sea water.  Sea water

has  much  higher  salt content.  So to push  the  sea  water

through  the  membrane, you will need to  apply  much  higher

pressure,  and  pressure  comes from  energy.   That  is  why

desalinated  water  is  much  more  expensive,  compared   to

Newater.   But  on  the  whole, we can  expect  the  cost  of

desalination and Newater to continue to decline, as  membrane

technology continues to improve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the third aspect of the question

raised  by the Members, which is, where are we today.   Prof.

Low  Seow  Chay and Mr Ang Mong Seng asked about the quality,

whether  it  is  safe to drink and whether we have  conducted

tests.   Mr Ang Mong Seng suggested why don't we bottle  this

Newater  and  sell  it as mineral water.  Today,  we  have  a

demonstration  plant producing 10 thousand  cubic  metres  of

Newater every day.  This is equivalent to 2.2 million gallons

of water per day.  This plant was commissioned in May 2000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low Seow Chay wondered why do we supply this water

to  golf courses and throw it away into the sea.  The purpose

of  this  demonstration plant is for us to convince ourselves

that the process does work, and that the quality of the water

does  meet with our expectations.  And I am happy to say that

we  have conducted tests covering the physical, chemical  and

micro  biological  analysis.  So far, the test  results  show

that the standard is well within drinking water standard  set

by the WHO, the USEPA and the EU.  In short, the water indeed

is safe for human consumption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why then are we not drinking it today? Sir, if we were

to look at the overall water



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>



supply  situation,  I  wish to make the  point  that  in  the

foreseeable  future, there is no need for us  to  talk  about

convincing  members  of the public to  consume  the  Newater.

Why?   Because,  at this moment, there is a growing  industry

known  as the wafer fabrication industry.  Over the  next  10

years  or so, our aim is to have 25 wafer fabrication  plants

in  Singapore.  And together, they require about  55  million

gallons per day (mgd) of ultra clean water.  This 55  mgd  is

equivalent  to  15%  of  our  daily  consumption  of   water.

Therefore,  our point here is this:  Even though the  Newater

is  ultra  clean water, there is no need, at this moment,  to

think  about  human consumption, because  there  is  a  ready

market  which is willing to pay good money for this  Newater.

I  think  it  makes a lot of sense, from the  standpoint   of

matching  supply  and demand for us to  take  the  wafer  fab

industry  that  requires high grade water  as  the  immediate

priority for the consumption of Newater.  Indeed this is what

we are doing.  We aim to achieve a 15% consumption of Newater

by  the  year  2010, about 55 mgd.  This will be supplied  to

wafer fab plants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then is our immediate plan? Mr Heng Chiang Meng

asked how we intend to pipe it to the homes.  Sir, as I  have

mentioned,  there  is no need to pipe Newater  to  the  homes

because,  in  the  foreseeable future, we are  talking  about

supplying this water to the wafer fab plants.  It makes a lot

of  sense to supply Newater to wafer fab plants because these

25  wafer  fab  plants are not scattered all over  Singapore.

They  are  located  centrally at three wafer  fab  parks,  at

Woodlands,  Tampines  and  Pasir  Ris,  and  they  are   high

consumption  customers.  As a result,  we  will  be  able  to

supply  this  Newater to these 25  wafer fab  plants  in  the

three wafer fab parks in a highly cost effective manner.   In

fact,  our assessment is that we will be able to supply  this

Newater to them even cheaper than what they are paying  today

for  potable  water.  In a way, this is a win-win  situation,

because we are now able to make full use of the Newater  and,

at  the same time, the industry will be able to achieve  some

kind of cost savings through the use of Newater.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng Chiang Meng asked when are we going to build

these new plants.  Sir, we are now in the process of building

two Newater plants, each with a 5 mgd capacity.  They will be

located  at  Bedok  and Kranji Sewage Treatment  Works.   The

tender  for  consultants  has been called  this  month.   The

tender  for  the supplying of pipeline will be  called  later

this  year.  Our target is to commission both plants  by  the

end of next year.



<br>6.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some Members also asked about our long-term plans,

in  terms  of quantity and application, whether we  will  now

have  a situation of having excess Newater, whether we  still

need to have desalination, whether we still need to buy water

from  Malaysia,  and  so on.  Let me put this  discussion  in

proper perspective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newater is to reclaim used water. The technology of

Newater  cannot  create  water  but  it  can  reclaim  water.

Therefore,  for  the system to work, you look  at  the  water

system in Singapore as a whole system.  If there is no  water

input into the system, Newater cannot work because there will

be  no water to reclaim.  In other words, we need to continue

to   inject  water  into  the  water  system  either  through

collection  of  rainfall  or taking water  from  Malaysia  or

through  desalination, so that water reclamation can continue

to  work.   What we are saying is that over a longer  period,

with a bigger population, we may not be able to secure enough

water  supply on a perpetual basis.  What this means is  that

by  investing  in Newater technology, we are now  applying  a

multiplier factor into the system.  Take, for example, if  we

are  able  to  reclaim 20% of the water  used  in  our  water

system,  we  will  be able to enhance the capacity  of  clean

water by 25%.  If we are able to increase this reclaimed rate

to 40%, we will be able to enhance the capacity by 67%.  What

this  means  is  that  every drop of water  we  collect  from

rainfall,  import  from  Malaysia, maybe  from  Indonesia  or

through desalination, we will be able to use a drop of  water

more than once.  In that way, we make sure that Singapore  in

the long term, not just the next  20, 50



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1258</b></font><br><br>



years, but maybe the next 500, 1,000 years, will continue  to

be  able  to maximise every single drop of water coming  into

the water system to make sure that we will always have enough

water for the economy, the society and the population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen asked what if Malaysia were to cut off

water  supply.  Sir, I do not think this would happen because

there  is  a water agreement honoured by both sides for  many

years.   Water  supply beyond 2061, in  fact,  is  now  being

discussed,  as you have heard from the Minister  for  Foreign

Affairs.  So let me emphasise again that the whole purpose of

Newater  is  to  add  to  the security  of  water  supply  in

Singapore,  but it is not our intention to be self-sufficient

as far as the water supply is concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low also asked how do we intend to keep pace with

the  technology.  What we are doing basically is to  continue

to  work  closely  with the suppliers and  the  other  users,

bearing in mind that we are not the only user in the world of

the  membrane technology.  We will continue to keep in  touch

with  them  and  share experience regarding the  use  of  the

technology.    Whenever  there is a promising  solution,  our

intention is to conduct a pilot project, just like the way we

have  done so with Newater.  In this way, hopefully, we  will

be able to continue to keep ourselves up to date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low also asked whether we have any plan to educate

the  public.   Mr Kenneth Chen also emphasised  the  need  to

continue to promote the message of water conservation.   Yes,

I  agree with both of them.  In fact, we intend to set up the

Newater Visitors Centre at Bedok centre - this would be ready

by  March  next  year  -  so  that  members  of  the  public,

grassroots  members, students, and so on, can be  brought  to

the  plant, so that at least they get to know more about  the

quality of water and the technology that we are deploying.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that, I believe I have addressed most, if not

all, of the concerns raised by Members.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1259</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, on global warming,

carbon  dioxide  is  one  of the most significant  greenhouse

gases  that  causes global warming due to the amount  of  its

emission.   The under-developed and the developing  countries

pointed fingers to the developed countries for causing global

warming  and  asked the developed countries to  pay  for  the

clean-up  and  subsequent  cost  of  the  control  of  future

greenhouse  gas  emission.   Singapore  is  not  one  of  the

signatories of the World Climate Conference and is  also  not

classified  as  a  developed  country.   We  still  have  the

responsibility  to satisfy our conscience  as  a  responsible

world  citizen.   There are many things  we  could  do  as  a

responsible  world  citizen  regarding  the  greenhouse   gas

emission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister about the measures we

are taking to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All carbons containing fuel generate greenhouse gases

after  combustion.  Do we have plans to encourage the use  of

alternate fuel with lower carbon contents?  It is possible to

replace heavy diesel by light diesel, gasoline by methanol or

ethanol,  normal  liquid fuel by LPG and  natural  gas.   The

recent  private  attempt of testing  the  idea  of  replacing

diesel engines in buses by compressed natural gas is a viable

project  towards  the  reduction  of  greenhouse  gas.    The

Government  should  take  action in helping  and  encouraging

this  kind of project.  We should also try to revise some  of

our  rules  and  regulations to make  sure  that  we  do  not

obstruct  greenhouse gas-friendly projects by the  supply  of

greenhouse gas-friendly fuel, vehicles or equipment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improvement of energy conversion efficiency will also

allow  the reduction of greenhouse gases from every  unit  of

energy  which  is generated.  We should try to encourage  the

replacement of certain prime mover engines, power  generators

which have poorer overall energy efficiency.  Purely from the

energy  efficiency point of view, say, for example, a  diesel

car will be more efficient than a gasoline-driven car, though

it may create some unwanted pollutive problems.  An electric



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1260</b></font><br><br>



vehicle  will  be  more  efficient than  a  gasoline  vehicle

because  the power generation plant that supplies  energy  to

the electric vehicle is more efficient than a gasoline engine

running   on  the  road.   Should  the  Government  lay   the

groundwork, like rules and regulations, for the people to try

out  the  various energy efficient vehicles or  cars  on  the

roads?  For example, should we have rules and regulations  or

incentives  for  the  people who try out  electric  vehicles,

newer type of prime movers for vehicles, like the CNG vehicle

which  has not been tried out in Singapore (but it is an  old

technology favourable to the environment), fuel-cell  powered

vehicles which are going to be launched, cylinder or gasoline

injection vehicles which are already in the market?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for all these vehicles, if we have some sort of rules

and  regulations or incentives to encourage the promotion  of

their  use,  certainly we are working towards the improvement

in our effort towards the reduction of greenhouse gases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incineration of solid waste may be a better alternative

than landfills because we are a land scarce nation.  However,

the  incineration  of solid waste leads to  the  emission  of

greenhouse  gases  and without very well utilisation  of  the

heat  generated because of the composition of the wet garbage

and  the combustion process.  We should adopt strategies like

waste  minimisation  so as to allow a  higher  percentage  of

wastes  to  be  recovered and change the people's  habits  of

generating wet garbage.  One of the ways of reducing  garbage

generation is to charge garbage for collection by weight.   I

heard that the Ministry has some proposals sometime ago.  But

did  the  Ministry seriously consider charging collection  of

garbage by weight?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can also educate the people on the use of things like

biodegradable  products,  for  example,  biodegradable  bags,

instead  of using all the PVC products.  The recent  call  by

the NGOs to use less PVC carrying bags for shopping is one of

the  programmes which is worth supporting.  Is the Government

planning



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1261</b></font><br><br>



to   carry   out  an  education  programme  in  schools,   in

conjunction  with the Ministry of Education, to  educate  the

people on waste minimisation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using polyfoam disposable cutlery in canteens and hawker

centres is one of the greenhouse gas-unfriendly policies.  On

the  one  hand, we had launched it many years ago  to  reduce

dependence  on  foreign workers, and  also  it  may  be  more

hygienic  in food handling; on the other hand, the disposable

cutlery  will be eventually incinerated which could  lead  to

the emission of greenhouse gases.  If we still have a choice,

we  should  consider abandoning the idea of using  disposable

cutlery for the sake of reducing greenhouse gases.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, in an effort to initiate a green

revolution of Singapore roads, the Government is offering OMV

rebates and road tax incentives to encourage car owners to go

green.  This kind of encouragement would help to bring  about

greater  conservation of natural resources and  result  in  a

better  living  environment for all of us.  I would  like  to

urge the Ministry of the Environment to go a step further  to

consider  tax  rebates and financial incentives to  encourage

the  use  of  environmentally-friendly technologies  for  the

production of electricity, whether on a wide scale  by  power

stations or locally by some producers of electricity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in the tropics with abundant sunshine. Solar

cell panels are one obvious example that deserves more of our

attention.   We  have heard earlier in the debate  that  such

technology  is costly.  But with greater usage, according  to

some  industry  sources, the capital cost and maintenance  of

the  hardware  and  equipment can be  reduced  substantially.

With  the proper amount of incentives, I believe more  people

will   use   solar  cell  panels  to  supplement  electricity

consumption.  This will in turn encourage more people  to  do

research  to  develop  better and more affordable  equipment.

This  may even lead to technological breakthroughs,  just  as

reported in the Straits Times today on the low radiation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>



mobile phones developed by a Government-funded research  body

here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I rise to ask the Ministry on our

efforts   to  address  future  Indonesian  fires   and   haze

pollution.  I want to make some suggestions on what we  might

do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you would remember that in 1997 and 1998, Singapore

and  the  region experienced a very dense and prolonged  haze

pollution, resulting from fires mostly in Indonesia.  What is

of  more  concern  for the present and future  is  that  some

scientists predict that we will experience another dry spell,

another  El  Nino, in 2001 or perhaps 2002.  I  think  it  is

therefore  timely to ask the Ministry what  steps  have  been

taken since 1997 and 1998, and whether what has been done  is

enough  to  prevent another terrible time of smoke  and  fire

where we can hardly see the sun.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia has agreed to many action plans to address the

issue.  But it is not clear to me whether these actions  have

actually  been  taken or whether they just remain  as  plans.

Action  plans  are  often more plans  than  actions.   Recent

reports are that Indonesian laws are now placing a burden  on

landowners to quell fires.  This is hoped to help prove  that

they  started  the  fire.  But will  the  Minister  give  his

opinion on the chances of successful implementation of  these

plans?   I  ask because there are a few reports of successful

prosecutions  of  fire-starters and the companies  they  work

for.   I  also  ask because I realise the many  problems  the

Indonesians  today face in their country, and that  they  may

lack attention and resources to deal with the problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have three suggestions on what we might do to

help Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I know that we presently offer satellite images.

I  wish  us  to  go  beyond this.  I  wish  us  to  encourage

Indonesia to do more.  First, by working with provincial  and

local  authorities.   Recently, Indonesia  has  passed  wide-reaching laws to devolve more authority in many matters  from

Jakarta to the provinces.  These provinces, however may  lack

the capacity and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1263</b></font><br><br>



attention to problems such as the environment and  fires.   I

would  ask  the  Ministry to look towards working  more  with

them, especially provinces in Riau and Sumatra, which are  so

near us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would ask, now that Indonesia has passed

laws  for  the prevention of fires, whether we could consider

making these laws enforceable in our courts.  Many Indonesian

companies trade through Singapore or have assets and  offices

here.   Many Indonesian businessmen pass through our airport.

It  is  therefore  not impossible that  some  of  the  guilty

parties  come  to or through Singapore.  If we can  therefore

identify  and  prosecute them, we would help  supplement  the

efforts  of  the  Indonesian  government  against  these  law

breakers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would encourage a prudential approach to

lending  and trading from Singapore.  We are a financial  hub

and  a  trading  centre for many of the industries  involved,

including   oil  palm  and  timber.   It  is  the  commercial

undertakings  that  use  fire to clear  land  because  it  is

cheaper.   Would the Ministry advise Singapore-based  lenders

and traders to make due enquiries of their Indonesian clients

and partners?  Where they demonstrably do not cause fires, we

should prefer these Indonesian clients.  Where they have,  on

the  reverse, broken laws against the use of fire, is it  not

incumbent on our lenders and Singapore business community not

to be complicit in these crimes and observe Indonesian law?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I make these suggestions because it is not just

Singapore  that  suffers, but the first  victims  are  indeed

Indonesians  who  live much nearer and amidst  the  fire  and

smoke.   I would therefore ask the Ministry concerned how  we

can  proactively try to avoid the next El Nino occurrence  by

addressing these fundamental commercial causes.



<br>6.15 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Land Transport

Authority (LTA) is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>



tasked with the checking of vehicles which emit black exhaust

smoke,  and  the offenders will be detected by  some  special

gadget used by the LTA and booked for the offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stop an offender and fine him on the spot is the most

convincing  way of establishing the fact that an offence  has

been  committed.  However, this would cause a  delay  in  the

transporting  of  goods  by  the vehicle  involved,  and  may

possibly cause a traffic jam.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rule against emission of black smoke by vehicles is

enforced  by  the  Environment Ministry  officials.    A  new

method is now being used.  A latest  high-tech camera is  now

used to detect the smoke emitted from the moving vehicles  on

the  road.   If  the smoke emitted is in excess  of  what  is

permitted  under the law, the vehicle owner will  be  booked.

How  accurate  can  the camera be in determining  whether  an

offence has been committed? Can the photographs taken by this

camera be admissible as evidence in court?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some drivers told me that the Environment Ministry

officials  would normally hide themselves near a  slope,  and

take  photographs of these vehicles when they  are  ascending

the  slope.   When  a heavy vehicle, such as  a  fully-loaded

lorry,  goes  up the slope, it is natural for the  driver  to

step harder on the accelerator, resulting in more black smoke

being emitted from the exhaust pipe.  Will the Ministry allow

these drivers who have been booked to go to the office of the

Environment  Ministry  to  view these  photographs,  free  of

charge  (I  emphasise: free of charge), to satisfy themselves

that they had indeed committed the offence?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about those foreign vehicles? Many drivers told me

that  the Ministry officials only booked local vehicles,  but

no  enforcement action is taken against heavy vehicles coming

from  other  countries. Is it true that foreign vehicles  are

not dealt with for such similar offences? If so, why?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, as I mentioned earlier, the air

quality in Singapore is good.  We monitor very closely a  few

key



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>



pollutants.   These  are  sulphur dioxide,  carbon  monoxide,

nitrogen oxide, ozone and the particulate matter, both,  what

we  call,  PM  10 and PM 2.5, depending on the  size  of  the

particulates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these air pollutants are well within

international limit for clean air determined by  the  US  EPA

and the World Health Organisation.  My Ministry will continue

to  monitor the quality of the air to make sure that it  will

continue  to stay within this limit.  But having  said  that,

there  are  two  air pollutants which my Ministry  is  paying

extra attention because the level of pollution is on the rise

and  we could reach the limit in the near future.  These  are

SO2 and particulate matter.  Basically, the three sources  of

pollution are - vehicles, industries and power generation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, several Members have touched on the issue of

vehicular pollution.  Prof. Low Seow Chay asked when  are  we

going  to  do  more to put in place rules and regulations  so

that  we can try out more energy efficient vehicles, such  as

the  CNG and the fuel cell vehicles.  Mr Ang Mong Seng  asked

about  enforcement operations, appeal procedures, and so  on,

and  also  enforcement on foreign vehicles, mainly  Malaysian

vehicles.  Sir, vehicular pollution accounts for 50%  of  the

particulate matters.  50% of all the dark smoke, and  so  on,

comes  from  the vehicle.  Our top priority is to reduce  the

emission  of particulate matter, generated mostly  by  diesel

vehicles - buses, taxis, lorries, and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We deploy a set of strategies to contain such emissions.

Firstly,  we  impose very stringent emission standards.   For

example,  we  have upgraded the emission standards  for  SO2,

particulate   matter,  carbon  monoxide   and   the   unburnt

hydrocarbon  regularly.   On  1st  January  this   year,   we

introduced the Euro II emission standards to make sure  that,

over  time, it will get better.  The second strategy we  have

deployed so far is the introduction of low sulphur diesel  to

reduce  both  the SO2 emission and the particulate  emission.

Since  March 1999, which is about two years ago,  sulphur  in

diesel has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>



reduced to 0.05%, in terms of weight, and over time,  we  may

even  look at the ultra-low sulphur diesel which will  be  as

low as 0.01%, when the need arises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our third strategy is very much the point brought

up  by  Mr  Ang  Mong  Seng,  ie, enforcement  against  smoky

vehicles.   There is no point having very stringent standards

if we do not enforce these standards.  As mentioned by Mr Ang

Mong  Seng,  in the past, enforcement on the spot did  create

some  problems for other motor vehicles.  So in August  1999,

my Ministry decided to make use of digital video cameras.  We

sited  these cameras in certain locations.  Each time, if  we

see  a  vehicle emitting black smoke which is highly visible,

we would take a recording.  The recording is then transmitted

back  to  the Ministry headquarters where some of  my  senior

officials  will  sit  in front of the  PC  and  look  at  the

recording.   They will then make a determination  on  whether

that  particular  offender ought to be let off,  or  given  a

warning letter, or indeed given a fine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng asked, firstly, whether these photos

are  reliable.   Sir, these are not photos.  These  are  real

video,  moving pictures.  So you can see a vehicle moving  on

the  road and you see all the black smoke coming out.  So the

reliability  is  not an issue because what you  see  is  what

actually happened on the ground.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng asked whether this evidence is

admissible in court.  Sir, I do not know.  So far,  in  fact,

no  offender, having seen the video, has decided  to  contest

us.   Because when they see the video, they will see all  the

black  smoke coming out, and they put up their hand and  say,

"Yes, I admit I ought to be fined."  So far, we do not have a

single  case in which somebody, after looking at  the  video,

still maintains that he or she is innocent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng asked whether we locate those video

cameras at up slope.  Sir, I can assure him that this is  not

the  case.  Because if you were to look at the video, you can

see  very  clearly whether the car is moving horizontally  or

moving uphill.  I can assure him that there is not a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>



single  case of offence involving a vehicle moving up  slope.

I  am very sure about this because my officials gave me their

assurance  on this.  In fact, when I looked at  some  of  the

videos  myself, I was convinced that the emission was  really

bad.   It was certainly more than 50-70 HSU because the black

smoke was so clearly visible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng made a very good point. He asked

whether we will allow free inspection of these videos.  I  am

happy  to say, yes.  Indeed, this is the practice.   When  an

offender receives a notice of offence from us, he is  welcome

to come to ENV to have a cup of coffee, look at the video and

convince himself whether he wants to contest the case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Ang Mong Seng also asked whether our enforcement

action is applicable to foreign vehicles.  By that, I presume

he  is  referring to Malaysian vehicles.  Let me  share  with

Members  of  the  House  on what we  have  done,  as  far  as

Malaysian  vehicles are concerned.  Malaysian  vehicles  with

black  smoke emission exceeding 70 HSU (Hartridge Smoke Unit)

-  I am told it is the measurement of smoke - are turned back

to Malaysia.  We do not even want to fine them and allow them

to  pollute  our air.  We tell them, "Your case  is  so  bad.

Please make a U-turn and go back."  For those between 50  and

<br><br>70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HSU, yes, it is an offence but not too excessive.  We will

give  them a compounded fine on the spot because, after that,

we would not know where to find them.  For the first offence,

they  are  fined $150; second offence is $300 and  subsequent

offence  is  $500.   Many of them do take  corrective  action

after  the first offence because it is not cheap to pay  $300

and $500 for emission of black smoke.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the enforcement action effective? I think so,

because  the  number of bookings has been on the  rise.   For

Singapore vehicles, five years ago, in 1996, we booked  6,900

cases and, last year, it had gone up to 16,000.  In the  case

of Malaysian vehicles, we see the same



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>



increase from 3,500, five years ago, to 9,100 last year.   So

you  can see that we are serious about enforcement, and as  a

result  of this enforcement action taken by my Ministry,  the

percentage  of smoky vehicles, as a percentage of  the  total

population,  has  come down.  We conduct random  survey.   We

station  officers  at certain locations and  they  count  the

number  of  vehicles  going past and the number  of  vehicles

emitting black smoke and they compute the percentage of smoky

vehicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1996, among the Singapore vehicles, 4% were smoky

vehicles.  Last year, it dropped to 1.1%.  So we are seeing a

significant  drop  of 4% to 1.1%.  In the case  of  Malaysian

vehicles, the decline is even more dramatic, from 16.2%, five

years ago, to 3.9% last year, which means that many vehicles,

both Singaporean vehicles and Malaysian vehicles, are getting

the  message  that we are indeed serious with our enforcement

action  and  that  more vehicles are now not committing  this

offence of emitting black smoke.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the tightening of the emission standards and

enforcement  will  go  some way in  helping  to  ensure  that

vehicular pollution will not get worse or get out of control.

But  we  think at the same time, we ought to look for a  more

sustainable  solution,  which  is  the  conversion  to  green

vehicle.  This is the point brought up by Prof. Low Seow Chay

as  well as a few other Members.  Prof. Low asked what  plans

do  we have to speed up the deployment of CNG and whether  we

have  any  incentive  schemes in place to  encourage  company

owners, and so on, to replace their inefficient vehicles with

vehicles which are more energy efficient.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry has looked at the five types of green

vehicles. These are electric vehicles, liquid petroleum  gas,

fuel  cell  vehicle, hybrid vehicles and  natural  gas.   Our

assessment,  at  this moment, not cast in  concrete  because,

over  time,  things will change - is that the mass deployment

of  electric  vehicles, at least in the short  term,  may  be

limited  by  the recharging mechanism.  This is because  they

need to be charged overnight at a recharging



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>



facility.  I think it will take some time before we can  have

such  a  network  implemented.  So the role of  the  electric

vehicle may be hampered by this lack of infrastructure.



<br>6.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as LPG vehicles are concerned, my Ministry, in

fact, has decided not to promote LPG, because of the risk  of

fire  and  explosion.  So we are not going  to  promote  LPG,

unless there is a breakthrough in the technology.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area mentioned by Prof Low is the fuel cell

vehicle.   I agree with him that the fuel cell vehicle  holds

great  promise.  In fact, of the five types of  vehicle,  the

fuel  cell  vehicle  is the cleanest, from the  environmental

standpoint.   But  because  the  technology  is  still  at  a

developmental stage, what we intend to do is to  continue  to

monitor  the development and, at the right time,  to  conduct

pilot projects and bring them into Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining two are the hybrid vehicles and the

natural  gas vehicles.  At least in the near term, these  two

types  of green vehicle are most relevant, in the context  of

Singapore.  So far, we have introduced incentive schemes  for

electric  and hybrid vehicles, and we will see how  it  goes.

At  the  same  time,  my Ministry is  now  paying  a  lot  of

attention to compact natural gas (CNG) vehicle.  We place CNG

vehicles  high  on our priority list because, firstly,  these

natural gas vehicles emit almost no particulate matter  (PM),

no SO2, very little carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide.  From

the  greenhouse  point of view, they emit 20%-30%  less  CO2,

compared  to  the conventional petrol or diesel vehicle.   In

other  words, a natural gas vehicle is cleaner than a  hybrid

vehicle.   It is more implementable, compared to the electric

vehicle.  At the same time, it is safer than an LPG vehicle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we feel that it makes a lot of sense for us

to  promote natural gas vehicles in a more concerted  manner.

This  is the reason why my Ministry is now working with  SBS,

SembCorp  Gas,  Volvo and Delgro, to try out 30  natural  gas

buses in Jurong by next year.  Our aim is to learn



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1270</b></font><br><br>



from  this pilot implementation and, from there, we can  then

look  into the action plan, to extend the use of CNG vehicles

to  other  diesel vehicles, not just buses, but  also  taxis,

tour buses, maybe lorries, pick-up trucks and so on.  In  the

longer  term,  we  believe that, even for  the  petrol-driven

passenger vehicles, CNG is also a very relevant and promising

technology.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me next move on to industries, because they are also

a  major source of air pollutants.  Prof. Low Seow Chay asked

about  incineration, and whether we could do more to  promote

waste   minimisation,  in  order  to  reduce  the  need   for

incineration.   Sir, I will address that  later  on  when  we

discuss  the issue of solid waste disposal.  But, as  far  as

industries  are concerned, our assessment is that  industries

today  account  for about 40% of SO2 and 20%  of  particulate

matter.  In other words, since SO2 and particulate matter are

at  the top of our list of priorities, we should do something

too  and,  therefore, in the case of industries, our priority

is to continue to reduce SO2 and particulate matter emission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our strategy basically is, firstly, to continue to

promote cleaner fuels for steam and heat generation, eg,  low

sulphur  fuel oil and natural gas, and this will happen  more

and  more,  now  that we have additional natural  gas  supply

coming to Singapore.  Secondly, we are also promoting the use

of  cleaner technologies to reduce the level of emission, eg,

sulphur  recovery, so that instead of disposing  the  sulphur

into the air, we can actually recover the sulphur itself  for

other  applications,  or bag filters for  particulate  matter

removal.   Thirdly, we will continue to tighten the  emission

standards  under  the  Environmental Pollution  Control  (Air

Impurities)  Regulations  for particulate  matters,  nitrogen

oxides and carbon monoxides.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third source of air pollutants is power

generation.   It  accounts  for  60%  of  SO2  and   30%   of

particulate matters.  So our priority again is to reduce both

and, in this area, basically our strategy is to encourage and

facilitate  the  use  of  cleaner fuel,  which  is  basically

natural gas and, at the same time, encourage the use of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1271</b></font><br><br>



cleaner  technology.  For example, many of our  power  plants

are  now  using the combined cycle power generation  process.

We are also working on the flue gas desulphurisation.  As far

as power generation is concerned, we will continue to tighten

emission  standards,  so that companies  will  speed  up  the

adoption of clean energy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to global warming, ie, carbon dioxide

emission.   Prof. Low Seow Chay asked whether any action  has

been taken to reduce emission, and Mr Ong Kian Min also asked

whether  there  is  any  incentive for environmental-friendly

energy, eg, solar energy.  Sir, carbon dioxide emission comes

mainly from the burning of fossil fuels.  At this moment, our

guesstimate is that power generation accounts for 50% of  the

CO2  emission in Singapore, industries 35%, and vehicles 13%.

Given that we are a city-state and highly industrialised,  we

admit  that, in terms of CO2 emission per capita, we  are  on

the  high side, and that it will continue to increase as  our

economy  continues to grow, etc.  While we cannot do much  to

try  to reduce CO2 per capita, there is a lot that we can do,

in  terms of reducing CO2 per-million-dollar GDP.  This means

that, as we grow our GDP, we can find a more efficient way of

reducing  CO2  emission,  basically  through  efficiency  and

energy use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I am happy to inform the House that,

starting from 1st April 2001, the Ministry of the Environment

will take over the chairmanship of the Inter-Agency Committee

on  Energy  Efficiency  (IACEE).  Right  now,  the  IACEE  is

chaired  by  the Ministry of National Development.   Minister

Mah  Bow Tan, a few weeks ago, suggested to me that ENV  take

over  the  chairmanship so that we could  close  this  energy

loop,  and I agreed fully with him.  We are going to continue

to  push for energy efficiency and conservation and,  at  the

same  time, we are going to expand the scope of the Committee

to include the use of cleaner energy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Ong Kian Min suggested that we should introduce

more incentives to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1272</b></font><br><br>



encourage  companies  and  organisations  to  adopt   cleaner

energy,  like  solar,  for  example.   We  do  administer  an

incentive   programme  in  ENV  known  as   the   Accelerated

Depreciation  Scheme  for  capital  expenditure  for  energy-efficient  and  energy-saving equipment to be depreciated  in

one  year, instead of the normal 3-year period.  So  far,  21

applications  have been approved.  But, having said  that,  I

can  assure the House that, under the IACEE, we will continue

to  examine what new incentives and additional programmes  we

should  undertake,  in order to speed up this  conversion  to

cleaner  energy, as well as to improve energy efficiency  and

conservation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me move on to the issue of smoke haze.

Sir, I thank Simon Tay for bringing this up, because it is an

important  issue.  All of us remember that in 1997,  we  went

through  a bad spell of the regional haze.  In the  last  few

years, the weather has turned wetter and, as a result, we did

not  encounter  any serious problem with the  regional  haze.

That  is  the  good news.  The bad news is  that  the  global

climate  is  changing again and, according  to  the  experts,

there  is a 30% chance that, this year, we may see the return

of  El Nino.  What this means is that there is a chance  that

we may see the return of the smoke haze.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What have we been doing in the last few years? We have

been keeping in close touch with our Indonesian counterparts,

to  help  them in whatever way we can.  For example,  in  the

last 2-3 years, we have helped the Indonesian government  and

some  of  their  regional authorities, to implement  the  PSI

system.  They now have a system to measure PSI, and are  able

to  monitor  the  seriousness of the haze situation.   As  Mr

Simon  Tay mentioned, we have also shared with them satellite

images.  In fact, these satellite images are accurate  up  to

20  metres, ie, we are able to pinpoint the location  of  the

fire,  of  the torchhead, all the way down to the nearest  20

metres.   So,  it  is very easy now to be on the  ground,  to

locate where the fire is.  At the same time, we have provided

manpower  training  to  many  of  the  Indonesian  officials,

because  we have a training centre at ENV and, over the  last

few



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1273</b></font><br><br>



years,  we have continued to take in trainees from Indonesia.

Over the last six months, I have met with Dr Sony Keraf,  the

Indonesian  Minister for the Environment,  twice  -  once  in

Singapore,  and  once in Sabah, during the ASEAN  Ministerial

Meeting  on the Environment.  On both occasions, the regional

smoke haze was the No. 1 topic of our discussion.  I think Dr

Keraf  is fully aware of our concern over the situation,  and

has  assured us that he would do whatever he can  to  try  to

address the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Simon Tay has mentioned, the Indonesian government

has  recently  decided to delegate more of the responsibility

and  authority to the provincial governments.  In fact,  just

about  a few weeks ago, I was in Pekan Baru and met with  the

Governor of Riau, Pak Saleh, and we discussed various issues,

including the supply of water from Riau province and  so  on.

One   of   the   issues   discussed  was   collaboration   in

environmental  management.  Pak Saleh Djasit made  a  request

for  us  to,  firstly, help them to enhance  their  technical

expertise in pollution management and control, both  air  and

river pollution.  He has also asked us to continue to provide

information  exchange, so that they can be kept  up  to  date

with  whatever  is  happening.  He has  also  asked  that  we

continue  to supply them with satellite images so  that  they

will  continue to know exactly where the fires are.   At  the

same  time,  they have also asked us to continue  to  provide

manpower  training and this, basically, will be more  at  the

provincial  level.   We  have  responded  positively  to  his

requests.  A technical team from ENV will be in Pekan Baru in

May to work out the entire package of technical collaboration

between  Singapore and the Riau province.  We hope  that,  by

continuing to work closely with the Indonesian government  in

Jakarta,  and with the provincial government in  Pekan  Baru,

hopefully,  we will be able to do a better job together  this

time round, should we, indeed, see the return of El Nino.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay also asked whether we could enforce

Indonesian laws on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1274</b></font><br><br>



prevention  of fire in Singapore courts.  Sir,  I  am  not  a

lawyer, but my understanding is that between nations, we have

to  respect  the  national  sovereignty  of  our  neighbours.

Therefore,  it  is  not appropriate to talk  about  enforcing

Indonesian law in Singapore for offences which take place  in

Indonesia.   But what we will continue to do will  be,  as  I

mentioned  earlier, to work very closely with the  Indonesian

government, as well as with the provincial government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay also asked whether we could do something to

advise   Singapore-based  lenders  and  traders  to  take   a

prudential  approach  towards their  Indonesian  clients  and

partners.   Sir,  this  is  a very  difficult  area  for  the

Government  to  intervene.  As Mr Simon Tay mentioned,  these

are   really  financial  and  commercial  actions  taken   by

commercial  entities.  What we hope is that these  Singapore-based   lenders  and  traders,  being  responsible  corporate

citizens,   will  not  associate  themselves   with   illegal

practices that are detrimental to the regional environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that, I believe I have addressed most of the

issues brought up by Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is almost 6.45 pm. We will stop here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Deputy Speaker left the Chair of the
