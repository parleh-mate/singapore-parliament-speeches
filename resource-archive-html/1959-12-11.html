<div align="center"><b>SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT ESTIMATES FOR 1960</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for consideration in Committee of

Supply [1st Allotted Day].



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>2.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Minister signify the

recommendation of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara before

the  Committee  proceeds with the consideration  of

the Main Estimates and the Development Estimates?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> I

so signify.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Turning to the main estimates. For

the  convenience of hon. Members, I  intend  taking

the  total for each head as it appears in the  last

column of the abstract of estimated expenditure  on

page 31 of Paper Cmd. (New Series) 32 of 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attention of hon. Members is drawn to Heads 1

and 5. In regard to Head 1, Yang di-Pertuan Negara,

the  total  in the last column - Amount to  be  voted

1960 - should be amended to read `$273,660'. This  is

because of an addition of the sum of $42,860  which

appears  as item (1) of subhead 1 at page  35.  The

note on that page numbered (ii) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sum charged on the Consolidated Fund. Monthly

Salary not yet fixed."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the sum has not as yet been charged on

the  Consolidated Fund and therefore it is required

to be voted upon for 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to Head 5, Public Service Commission,

the  total in the last column at page 31 should  be

amended to read `$131,350.' This is because  of  an

addition of the sum of $10 which appears at page 49

as item (4) of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The note against that item numbered (i) also

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sums charged on the Consolidated Fund."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the sum of $10 in item (4) has not as

yet  been  so  charged and therefore  that  sum  is

required to be voted upon for 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These alterations mean that the final total in

the   last  column  of  page  31  should  now  read

'$246,646,260'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dealing now with the heads of expenditure in

respect  of  which amendments stand  on  the  Order

Paper.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><h4>MAIN ESTIMATES, 1960</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1 -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1 be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (1) of  sub-head

1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the main reason for my wishing to move this amendment has, in fact, been cleared to

some extent by you, Sir. Am I to understand that it

is  this meeting that has been called upon  to  fix

the  personal  emoluments of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara? I should have thought that this would  have

been  done  very much earlier rather than  left  to

this last moment. Perhaps another point on which an

explanation  might be given, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  is

the  increase of $10 on the previous 1959 estimates

in  the  total  sum payable to the Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara.  The  third point on which  an  explanation

might  be  given  is whether on  the  total  amount

payable  to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, income  tax

would be paid?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> I would

have preferred, Mr Speaker, Sir, to have been able

to  determine the emoluments of the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara  before  today. Members are aware  that  the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara took office on the  3rd  of

December.  We  were all pre-occupied  with  Loyalty

Week  and there was this other consideration,  that

the  emolument to be fixed was dependent  upon  the

manner  in  which  he  shall  live  after  he   was

installed in office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has, from the evening of the 2nd of December,

moved  into  the  domain which we now  call  Istana

Negara,  but he has expressed to me his desire  not

to  reside in the Istana itself. He has informed me

that he would prefer his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>



private  capacity to be distinct from his  official

capacity.  He  has therefore chosen to  live  in  a

bungalow  inside  the  domain  which  used  to   be

occupied by the former Under-Secretaries. He  will,

however,  discharge the functions  of  his  office - both the ceremonial and the official functions - from

Government  House.  Istana  Negara  will   be   his

official place for State business. This has  to  be

borne  in mind when we decide on the emoluments  to

be  given  him,  because whilst  Istana  Negara  is

maintained  completely  out  of  State  funds,  his

family  and  household commitments in the  bungalow

inside  the  domain  will be on  his  own  personal

account.  Bearing in mind that the former  Governor

received  £5,000 as his salary, and £1,500  as  his

duty allowance, we decided that the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara shall receive the sum shown as the estimated

expenditure in 1960, namely $42,860. Another reason

is  this:  that the order of precedence, which  has

now been settled by the Negara in consultation with

Her Majesty the Queen, establishes the "Negara"  as

first  in  the order of precedence; myself  as  the

Prime Minister second; third the Chief Justice; and

fourth the Speaker. As you know, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

your   emoluments  have  been  determined  by   the

Constitution until June 1960, and I sincerely  hope

that  this  House will have equally charitable  and

generous  considerations in  mind  when  June  1960

comes.  I  am in receipt of $50 more than you,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, and although we originally  intended

to  fix  the  Negara's emoluments at $3,500,  which

will  make it slightly less than £5,000 we  decided

that  there  was no real reason why  our  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara, in view of the fact that he  would

have to maintain his own family and his own private

bungalow, should get less than £5,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point. There is really no mystery

about the increase of $10. If the Member for Farrer

Park will look at the item, he will find, under the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara, Governor - $42,850, and then

the   Yang   di-Pertuan  Negara/   United   Kingdom

Commissioner   $10.  The  Treasury   procedure   of

budgeting  requires a token $10. It was,  in  fact,

$42,860, because the United Kingdom



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>



Commissioner  was  at the same time  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara. The United Kingdom Government  has,

from  the  coming  into force of the  Constitution,

paid  half  the  emoluments,  duty  allowance   and

entertainment  allowance  of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara. Therefore, the Treasury brought $60 down to

$50, put $10 token against the other item - Yang  di-Pertuan Negara/United Kingdom Commissioner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the question of income tax. We have,

after  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara indicated  to  us

that  he would prefer to live in a private bungalow

inside  the  domain  instead of the  Istana  Negara

proper itself, decided that he shall be exempt from

income tax.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is so provided in the law, is it

not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there was a

certain amount of argument as to whether or not  it

is  so  provided in the law. The intention of those

who  went  to the London Conference is supposed  to

have  been  embodied  in the  law.  If  I  remember

correctly, it was our original intention  that  the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara, unlike the Governor in  the

past,  should  not be above the law. Unfortunately,

it  has been so drafted that there may be a measure

of doubt. In any case, we have now decided, because

of  the considerations that I have stated, that  he

will be exempt from income tax.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, in view of the explanation of the

Prime  Minister,  I  beg  leave  to  withdraw   the

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

put  in this amendment for the purpose of eliciting

information from the Prime Minister. Sir, under the

previous    constitution   and    under    Colonial

constitutions,  this allowance of $1,800  has  been

inserted  from time immemorial. This  is  to  allow

payment  to a civil servant who, during the absence

of the Governor from Singapore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>



was  doing the job of Officer  Administering

the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of Yang di-Pertuan Negara, it is

not improbable that he too may have to be away from

Singapore in the discharge of his duties. But I  do

not  think that it will be proper-and I am sure  it

is  not  the  intention of the Government-that  the

Deputy Yang di-Pertuan Negara should be drawn  from

the  Civil Service, or from anywhere else, or  even

that the British Commissioner be allowed to be  the

Acting   or  the  Deputy  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara.

Surely,  when  a  special  Deputy  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara  has  to be appointed during  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara's absence, that allowance of  $1,800

is not enough.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head I be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (16) of sub-head

1.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a subject which is well-known to you, Mr Speaker, Sir, we have determined

that,  in  the event of the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara

being  unable  to  act  either  through  his  being

indisposed,  or  being away for  short  periods,  a

dormant  commission will be issued  which  entitles

you,  Mr  Speaker, to act as the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara.  Should,  however,  it  interfere  with   a

sitting of this Assembly, it is at your pleasure to

opt  out from these duties, in which case the Chief

Justice  would  deputise for  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, whilst I would not belittle the

arduous   duties  of  your  high  office  in   this

Assembly, I should think that, if you move up  from

number  four in the order of precedence  to  number

one,  it surely entitles a token payment to be made

to  signify the august position to which you  would

move  from  time  to  time in the  course  of  your

duties. It has been worked out at about $40 odd per

day  of  actual deputising. I am quite  sure  that,

whilst the Opposition have shown an inclination  to

be  more  generous than we are, you will  certainly

bear  with us if we say that, in view of the frugal

and thrifty habits of this Government, it is not an

expression of disrespect to you.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Free from income tax?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Unlike the question of the

emoluments of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara - I  do  not

think   there  is  any  doubt  about  it   in   the

Constitution itself - it is subject to tax; but if  a

case  can be made out, I am quite sure the Minister

for  Finance  will  give it  his  careful  and  due

consideration!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the light

of  the  explanation given, may I ask for leave  to

withdraw the amendment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $273,660 for Head 1 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 2 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Tun

Lim Yew Hock:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 2 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item (30) of sub-head 1.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, since it is on the same

subject,  I  am  leaving it to  my  colleague,  the

Member for Farrer Park.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 2 be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (30) of sub-head 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-head 1 (30) says "District Judges and

Magistrates, twelve". Could I ask the Minister  for

Law:  How  many  of these posts  are  now  held  by

officers?  How many of the holders have  more  than

three years' experience? How many of them have less

than three years' experience?



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to the

questions from the Member for Farrer Park, I  would

like  to  point  out that there are three  District

Judges  and  nine Magistrates. What  was  the  next

question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> How many years' experience?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> In the case of the Acting District

Judge  and First Magistrate, Mr Eu Cheow Chye,  he

qualified  as a barrister in 1951. In the  case  of

Mr Choor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>



Singh,  he  passed the Bar final in 1950,  and  was

called to the Bar in 1955. In the case of Mr K. T.

Alexander, a District Judge also, he qualified as a

legal officer in Madras in 1932, and as a barrister

in  1952.  In the case of Mr Charlie Foo Chee  Hee

Tung,  a  Magistrate, he was called to the  Bar  in

1953.  In  the  case  of Mr Coomaraswamy,  he  was

called  to the Bar in 1956. In the case of Mr  Goh

Heng  Leong, he was called to the Bar in  1957.  In

the  case of Mr Lim Ewe Huat, he was called to the

Bar  in 1956. In the case of Mr Teo Chan Hong,  he

was called to the Bar in 1958. Mr T. Ariarajah was

called  to  the  Bar in 1958, and Mr  Noel  A.  De

Rozario in 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to experience, Mr Speaker, Sir, you will see

that,  except  for  Mr Eu Cheow  Chye,  Mr  Choor

Singh, Mr K. T. Alexander and Mr Charlie Foo, the

rest  of them, I think, have less than three years'

experience.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I would like to withdraw that

amendment, Sir, with the permission of the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 2 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 1.



<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I have framed the amendment  in

this  way in order that I may be permitted to speak

on   the  Rent  Conciliation  Board,  not  so  much

particularly on items (67), (68), (69) and (70)  as

they  appear  therein, but on the question  of  the

President  of the Rent Conciliation Board  and  the

principle appertaining to such appointments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Rent Control Ordinance, Mr Speaker,

the  provision is that the President  of  the  Rent

Conciliation Board should be a person who could  be

appointed  to be a District Judge under the  Courts

Ordinance. He should have that amount of experience

which  would enable him to be appointed a  District

Court   Judge.   The   practice   appertaining   to

appointment   to   the  post  of  President,   Rent

Conciliation  Board,  has always  been  to  appoint

either a District Judge, or somebody who was not  a

practising member of the Bar. Could the House be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>



informed whether the present President of the  Rent

Conciliation  Board is a practising member  of  the

Bar?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is, "That the sum to

be  allocated  for  Head 2 be  reduced  by  $10  in

respect  of  sub-head 1", and,  as  indicated,  the

debate is confined to the Rent Conciliation Board.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Ong Eng Guan):</b> Mr Speaker, section 8 of the Rent

Control  Ordinance provides for the composition  of

the Board. Section 8 (3) says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The President shall possess the qualifications

required  for a District Judge under the provisions

of  section 56 of the Courts Ordinance,  and  shall

preside at all sessions of the Board."



Mr  Speaker, when the new Government came  in,  we

made   a   careful  analysis  of   the   old   Rent

Conciliation Board and we found that it was  mainly

a  Board  operated in the interest of the  property

and landlord class. We found that of the 15 members

of  the  Board, 10 represented The property  class,

three represented the Singapore Clerical Union  and

two  represented the T.U.C. So we have taken  steps

to   rectify  the  position  in  order   that   the

population  of Singapore can be better  represented

on the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said just now, under the Rent Control

Ordinance, it has been laid down that the President

shall  possess  the qualifications required  for  a

District   Judge.  It  does  not  state  that   the

President should be a District Judge. Mr  Speaker,

we  have checked up with the new President, and  he

possesses   the  qualifications  required   for   a

District Judge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the second point which the Member for Farrer Park has raised is that the President

should  not be a practising lawyer. It is not  laid

down  anywhere in the Ordinance. If it happens that

the  past President was a District Judge,  that  is

because one had been appointed. There is nothing in

the Ordinance to say that the President of the Rent

Conciliation  Board  should  not  be  a  practising

lawyer.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> As far as I understand the Minister's

reply,  though he did not specifically say  so,  it

would  appear, Mr Speaker, Sir, that  the  present

President  of  the Rent Conciliation Board  is,  in

fact,  a  practising member of the Bar. If that  is

accepted,  then  I will proceed on  that  basis.  I

would  suggest to the Minister that  it  is  highly

undesirable for a practising member of the  Bar  to

be   appointed  to  such  a  post.  In  his  normal

practice, he would come into contact with all sorts

of   people - tenants,  landlords   and   owners   of

property.  I do not say that he will be  influenced

by  them - but  a  number of people,  who  might  not

otherwise  have gone to him on matters  other  than

those  appertaining to the Rent Conciliation Board,

might  go  to him and seek his services merely  for

the  reason that when their matters come up  before

him  for consideration as President, they might get

an   added   advantage.  Surely,  Sir,   the   Rent

Conciliation  Board  is a court  of  law.  All  its

proceedings are judicial proceedings. This  is  the

thin  end of the wedge. Is the Government going  to

allow  a  practising member of the Bar to become  a

District Judge? Is the Government going to allow  a

practising member of the Bar to become a High Court

Judge? The President of the Rent Conciliation Board

is  a  judicial officer because the proceedings  of

the Rent Conciliation Board by statute are judicial

proceedings. If I am required to cite  chapter  and

verse, I am prepared to do so, but by virtue of the

Ordinance  itself  all  proceedings  of  the   Rent

Conciliation Board are judicial proceedings. If the

Government  accept the principle that a  practising

member of the Bar could become the President of the

Rent  Conciliation Board, then I think they  should

also  accept the principle that a High Court  Judge

could practise his profession at the same time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, whilst I do not

concede the validity of the argument put forward by

the Member for Farrer Park, I will be the first  to

admit  and  to  uphold the principle  that  he  who

adjudicates  must be above criticism or  suspicion.

This appointment, Sir, was made by my colleague the

Minister  for National Development.  He  is  not  a

lawyer and is therefore not well versed in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>



the  principles of jurisprudence. Not because there

is  any validity in his argument but because of the

general   principle   that  the   dispensation   of

justice - be  it  in  a  judicial  or  quasi-judicial

tribunal - should be above criticism,  I  can  assure

the Member for Farrer Park that the position of the

Rent Conciliation Board will be rectified.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I thank the Prime Minister for his

statement,   and  I  beg  leave  to  withdraw   the

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,598,730 for Head 2 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 4 -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 4 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment is introduced by me with a

view to ascertaining from the Government what their

views  are  on the independence of the  Legislature

staff. It has been the practice elsewhere that  the

Department of the Legislature should be independent

of   the  Executive  and  that  the  staff  of  the

Legislature  should hold loyalty to the Legislature

itself  and  to  each  and  every  Member  of   the

Assembly, irrespective of his Party affiliations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a

hoary  subject. We have had it on and off  for  the

last   four   years.   Just  to   demonstrate   his

flexibility   and  resilience,  the  former   Chief

Minister  now  comes forward as the protagonist  of

the independence of the staff of the Legislature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Sir, that this was one of the

matters  which  you strenuously  pressed  when  the

Constitutional  talks were going on  in  London  in

1956,  again in 1957, and again in 1958. For  three

years  running, we have debated this. We have  gone

over  the arguments forwards and backwards  umpteen

times.  In  theory,  if you  go  according  to  the

principle   of  the  separation  of   powers,   the

Legislature  is  independent of the Executive,  and

the  Executive  has no control over the  Judiciary.

The  Executive  implements the  laws  made  by  the

Legislature. The Judiciary interprets them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>



Then  the logical conclusion one comes to  is  that

the  staff  of  the Legislature must  be  recruited

separately and must be a separate establishment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these arguments having been taken into

consideration,  we  decided that the  opportunities

for advancement in such a small hierarchy in such a

small  establishment  are  so  limited  that   this

Assembly  would  find  it  extremely  difficult  to

attract  suitable recruits. For that  reason,  you,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  had  put  forward  the  rather

ingenious suggestion that there should be  an  open

service in the lower levels but that it should be a

closed  service in the higher levels. We  have  all

seen  the  succession of Clerks  of  this  Assembly

since  1950. In 1950, my friend and colleague,  now

the Minister for Labour and Law, officiated in that

capacity. And so it has been going on. The turnover

has  been fairly rapid. But we all hope that it has

been  stabilised  by the present incumbent  who,  I

hope,  is  sufficiently  strong  and  healthy,  and

dedicated to the intricate and complicated  art  of

Standing Orders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Mr Speaker, Sir, when you pressed this

matter again on our assumption of office, we stated

that  we would rather allow a reasonable period  of

time  to elapse before we review the decision which

we  took  after being pressed on this  issue  three

years running. There were cogent reasons why we did

not accept your views then and why the former Chief

Minister also did not accept your views when he was

in  a position to determine these matters. I should

hate to admit that we made those decisions in haste

and  without due consideration - which we  would,  in

fact,  be doing if we altered our decision so  soon

after the implementation of the Constitution. After

a  decent  and reasonable interval has  elapsed  in

which  we  are  all satisfied that your  compromise

proposal is feasible, workable and sound, we  shall

take necessary steps to implement it. But right  at

this  moment, I give no assurance of any kind  that

the position will be altered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is part of the past that we have inherited.

There is also this other difficulty - that if we  are

to make it a closed service even on the top levels,

the theory



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>



of  not depriving an officer of his expectation  of

further   promotion  must  apply  to  the   present

incumbent,  and therefore he should  be  given  the

option to opt out of the closed service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, you may find

yourself  with  a new Clerk of the Assembly  faster

than  you  would  otherwise  have  found  yourself.

Bearing  all these considerations in mind, I  think

the  position  is that it be best left  alone,  and

that it be considered after we all have had time to

look into the practical merits of the proposal of a

closed  service  for the top positions  inside  the

Legislative establishment.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> This is one occasion when the

Speaker regrets that he cannot debate!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the

first time that we have heard that there have  been

discussions  between you and the Prime Minister  on

this subject. In view of what he has said - that  the

matter  is  in his mind and that he will require  a

decent  and reasonable interval before he can  make

up  his  mind  as to whether or not the Legislature

should be made independent of the Executive - I would

ask leave to withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I explain the procedure? The

procedure is that if a Member gets up to speak

after a request for leave to withdraw is made,

then, of course, a vote must be taken.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> So be it, Mr Speaker. I

would like to make this point. It is important that

one  should  not move from pillar to  post  without

being  reminded which was the last pillar  one  hid

behind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time the Chief Minister took his stand

on the question of a separate establishment for the

Legislature,   he  decided  that  the   scope   for

promotion and the attraction to the service were so

limited  that he would not be able to recruit  good

enough  staff  into the Legislative  establishment.

Therefore, he decided



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>



against  a separate Legislative establishment.  And

we  agreed  with him. It is not just a question  of

our needing a decent interval before we make up our

minds.  We want a decent interval to elapse  before

we  change  our minds. As I have said, Sir,  if  we

conceded  to your compromise proposal,  it  is  not

because  we  change our minds but because  you  had

made  out  a  strong  and  convincing  case  for  a

separate service at the top level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $661,180 for Head 4 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I take it that the Minister for

Finance  will cast his eagle eye on these  figures,

because they seem to be so close to each other that

I might make a mistake!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 7 -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item (9) of sub-head 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I tabled this amendment with a view to

seeking information from the Prime Minister  as  to

whether  or not it was correct that when there  was

an  Information Officer for Singapore in the United

Kingdom,  he  was recalled on the grounds  that  no

useful  purpose could be served by having  such  an

appointment  in  the  United Kingdom.  Perhaps  the

Press report on this was correct.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am not aware, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  of the Press report referred to by the Member

for Cairnhill, but I am quite prepared to state the

facts  in  regard to this Information Officer,  Mr

Yeh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former Chief Minister will recall that when

the Federation of Malaya decided that they would be

separately represented in London, their Information

Officer  who  used  to  discharge  duties  for  the

Singapore   Government  was  no  longer   able   to

discharge these functions. Therefore, as  far  back

as 1957, it was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>



necessary,  if  we  were  to  have  an  Information

Officer in London, to make our own appointment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no such appointment was made until a few

months  before  the  general elections.  My  record

shows  that  Mr Yeh, former Chinese Press  Liaison

Officer  to  the  Chief Minister,  took  office  in

London  three months before the general  elections.

After  the  general elections, and in view  of  the

fact  that  the Minister for Culture, who  is  well

advised  in these matters, considered that  it  was

not  a  judicious appointment, we decided to recall

him.  He  was  recalled. He  returned  on  the  2nd

September  and  was  posted  to  the  Ministry   of

Culture.  On  the  4th  October,  he  tendered  his

resignation, obviously because he did  not  fit  in

with  his  duties  in  the  Department  or  perhaps

because   he   was  not  posted  to  a   Department

sufficiently important enough for him. Be  that  as

it  may,  the  post has been left in the  Estimates

because  it is our intention that, when a  suitable

applicant  has  been found, an Information  Officer

will be sent to London.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I quite agree that it is

important  that  there  should  be  an  Information

Officer in the United Kingdom. But why I brought up

this subject is because of the report of the P.A.P.

in  the Press but I was not going into the question

of  the present holder since he has resigned or  of

the  previous holder of this post. I was just going

to  find  out  whether it was considered  important

enough by the Government that there should be  such

an  Officer  in  the United Kingdom and  the  Prime

Minister has said so. With that information, Sir, I

beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (18) of sub-head 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-head 1 provides for four chauffeurs for the

office  of the Prime Minister. Mr Speaker, if  you

will  be good enough to turn to Head 1, page 36  of

the  Estimates, item (14), you will find there  the

item "Chauffeurs, five". That is for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>



Yang   di-Pertuan  Negara.  May  I  ask  the  Prime

Minister why he needs four chauffeurs when the Yang

di-Pertuan Negara only needs five?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, I do not require

four  chauffeurs. I have got on in the world  quite

peacefully and. I hope, in a safe and business-like

manner  without having had a chauffeur. But  in  my

Office there is protocol, which includes Government

hospitality.  The  four  chauffeurs   shown   there

comprise  three  whom we have  inherited  from  the

former  Chief Secretary; and we have one  more  car

which was used by the former President of the  City

Council.  Therefore,  in the  Government  transport

pool  there  are  at present four  cars  with  four

chauffeurs - a Humber Pullman formerly  used  by  the

Chief  Secretary, and another Humber Pullman  which

is  more  than seven years old used by  the  former

President  of the City Council. There is  a  Humber

Supersnipe  and  a  Humber Hawk.  By  some  curious

scales of salary, the chauffeur in the City Council

is  paid  more than the chauffeur in the Government

service. He has preferred not to be transferred  to

this hospitality pool, and chooses to remain in the

City  Council service. We have therefore to recruit

one more chauffeur to look after the other car. May

I  say  that these cars are used for purely  State,

official,  and  ceremonial purposes  and  are  also

placed at the disposal of visiting dignitaries  who

from time to time pass through Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Member might like to indicate that he

is  interested in the facts and figures of the cost

and  the maintenance. If so, my assiduous assistant

has  worked out the cost per mile to show that  the

expenditure  incurred for ceremonial  and  official

purposes is much less than it was before.  This  is

just  in case the Member for Farrer Park wishes  to

pursue his pet theory, that everything has gone  up

on the ministerial side. I have no reason at all to

burden  this  House  with all  the  cumbersome  and

wearisome  figures, but if he so  wishes,  I  shall

certainly give him a whole bagful of them.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I suppose that can be construed as

intimidation!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have some

knowledge   and   experience   of   how   transport

allowances  work and the cost of a transport  pool,

as  they call it. However, I do not wish to  burden

the  Prime Minister with facts and figures. We  all

know  that  Singapore is famous for her hospitality

and it is not for me to say that the Prime Minister

should  not  keep up the good name of Singapore  by

providing    them   with   such   good   transport,

particularly when they come here as our guests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in view of the explanation of the

Prime  Minister, Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg  leave  to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (19) of sub-head 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item (19) shows a watchman for the Prime

Minister.  It is not for me to say that  the  Prime

Minister  should not be watched; I do not think  he

needs watching but anyway he has got a watchman.  I

have searched throughout the Estimates to find  out

whether  other Ministers have watchmen attached  to

their Ministries, and I have not been able to  find

any  such  specific post. I was intrigued  at  this

completely new "Post approved in 1959 (Warrant  No.

192/59)".



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, this post,

according  to  my brief, was settled  in  September

1959, because we required someone to be outside the

office  in the foyer of the City Hall which  leads,

on  one  side, to my Office, and the other  to  the

Cabinet  Office, which was formerly  the  Committee

Room  of  the City Council. In the evening  and  at

night there are the City Council watchmen who  look

after  the security of the whole building.  But  in

the  daytime  there  is only a  Police  officer  on

formal  duty.  To meet the problem  of  channelling

large numbers of people who from time to time  seek

an  audience  with  Ministers in order  to  present

their grievances, someone has to be found not  only

to  look  after  the premises, but also  to  direct

members  of  the  public who  wish  to  have  their

complaints attended to either in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>



Prime Minister's Office or, more often than not, in

the  other Ministries. Therefore, a post had to  be

created  which  was in keeping with the  duties  of

this   man.  For  some  inexplicable  reason,   the

Establishment people told me that we  could  either

call  him  a  "receptionist" or a  "watchman".  The

present  holder is, in fact, a bit of both.  If  we

call  him a receptionist, his salary will be double

what  it  is,  and if we call him a  watchman,  his

salary  will  be  what is shown.  Therefore,  being

frugal  and thrifty people, and without meaning  in

any way to belittle the incumbent, we called him  a

watchman.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, may I congratulate the Prime

Minister  on  his  sense of  economy?  But  as  the

Minister  for Labour and Law will admit  this  term

"watchman" has most unpleasant associations  and  I

wonder  whether  an  officer who  guides  sometimes

distinguished  visitors into the  Prime  Minister's

Office  should be called a watchman. If  necessary,

why  not called him a receptionist and give  him  a

higher salary and a higher status?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, in view of the explanation, I beg

leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (6) of  sub-head

2.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know whether this

particular item has reference to item (18). I  take

it  this  is the vote which provides for travelling

and other expenses in connection with item (18)  of

sub-head  1.  Or  is  it  an  item  in  respect  of

travelling  allowances  which  might  be  paid   to

officials in his Ministry?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the cost of maintaining

the  four vehicles in the transport pool is set out

in  sub-head  11 "Upkeep of Vehicles, $9,300",  for

repairs,  petrol and other expenses.  This  sum  of

$7,140  [sub-head  2, item (6)] is  in  respect  of

transport  and travelling when Government  officers

in  the  Ministry from time to time have  to  incur

transport charges in the course of their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>



duties.  It  also covers the cost of transport  for

members  of  the Government when they  travel  from

time to time to the Federation on official duty.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am unable to explain, however, how the figure

of  $7,140  is arrived at, and why it is  estimated

that  there should be a reduction of $1,800. But  I

am quite sure that since there is a reduction, as a

result of the vigilant activities of members of the

Treasury,  it is probably because the former  Chief

Minister was considered to have travelled too often

to Kuala Lumpur and it is anticipated that we would

not  require such a high vote as he did.  But  then

that was pure conjecture. My Ministry had put up  a

similar   vote,  but  unfortunately,  the  Treasury

officials  thought  we would be more  careful  with

public money and therefore could do with less money

and get much more out of it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> If the Prime Minister is worried that

the  Opposition will object to his going frequently

to  Kuala Lumpur, he need not be troubled  at  all.

All  he need to do is to ask us for the money  and,

so  far as it is within our power, we will vote  it

for  him. However, in view of the explanation given

by  the  Prime Minister, Sir, may I have  leave  to

withdraw?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the fact that we now have a

multilingual  Assembly, this provision  of  $24,000

for  language facilities for Assemblymen is a  very

wise  one. I would like to seek information  as  to

how  such  facilities are being made  available  to

Members of this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I am sorry that the

item   sometime  in  September.  I  hope   he   has

sufficiently recovered from his misfortunes to make

some  noise  at what he considers the improprieties

of  this  Government. I am glad  to  know  that  he

readily



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>



admitted the wisdom of this course initiated by the

Government. On the 22nd of September, shortly after

the  Supplementary Estimates were  passed  in  this

Assembly,  my  Secretary issued a circular  to  all

Assemblymen  setting out the rules and  regulations

covering  the expenditure of money on learning  any

of  the four languages used in this Assembly. I  am

sorry  if  the one sent to the Member for Cairnhill

has  been  mislaid by whoever has been keeping  his

mail for him. However, I can assure him that I will

immediately cause another copy to be sent  to  him,

and  perhaps he might wish to avail himself of  the

opportunities    for   equipping    himself    more

efficiently in the languages used in this Assembly.

I am quite sure, Mr Speaker, Sir, that he would do

well  to  follow in your footsteps and  master  the

intricacies of Bahasa Kebangsaan. May I say that  I

apologise for the late delivery of the circular  to

you,  Mr  Speaker. My Secretary believed that  the

Speaker, being omniscient, need no further training

in  any  matters. Therefore, I had to disabuse  his

mind after you had indicated to me that you are not

so omniscient. I am glad, Sir, that the Ministry of

Education  has looked after your need to equip  you

with an understanding of what is being said in this

House before it is being translated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 11.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, sub-head II deals with the question of upkeep of vehicles - $9,300. This item, as the

Prime  Minister said, relates to the four  vehicles

driven  by  his four chauffeurs. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

would  you be good enough to turn to page 36,  Head

1,  sub-head  2,  item (7) - Upkeep of  Motor  Cars,

$8,000? The Yang di-Pertuan Negara's cost of upkeep

of  motor cars is $8,000. The Prime Minister's cost

of  upkeep of one vehicle less costs $9,300.  Could

the Prime Minister please explain?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It is rather a sad

explanation, and I hope the Member for Farrer  Park

will  extend  us  his sympathy. At some  convenient

date in the future, we shall put in a supplementary

vote to ensure that the maintenance shall not be so

high because the vehicles are so old. Sir, the Yang

di-Pertuan Negara inherited wellkept and relatively

new  vehicles  with which the former Governors  and

Commanders-in-Chief equipped themselves. He  has  a

Rolls Royce in excellent condition. He has a Humber

Pullman, also in excellent condition. Unfortunately

our vehicles have seen more service, and because of

this, they require a great deal more attention  and

replacement,  from time to time,  of  vital  moving

parts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Humber Pullman formerly used by the Chief

Secretary  is  a 1952 model. The one  used  by  the

former  President  of the City Council  is  a  1949

model. The Snipe is a 1955 model and the Hawk is  a

1955 model. They have gone over 70,000 miles. I was

told  that after 70,000 miles, all moving parts  of

the  engine  must  be changed  and  that  has  been

attended   to.  But  I  regret  to  say  that   our

mechanical  engineers are unable to  restore  these

cars,  the average life of which is over six years,

to  the condition in which they were or ought to be

when  they  were  new.  Hence the  relatively  high

repair charges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other reason is that the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara does not run as big a hospitality roster  as

we  do. Take this morning, for instance. It is  not

for  me  to  inform Members of the  Opposition  how

important these little courtesies are. Not only did

we   extend   transport  facilities   to   visiting

dignitaries  from the Federation at this  morning's

Internal  Security Council meeting,  but  there  is

also  his  staff. Therefore, frequent use of  these

cars  are  made  by  visiting Ministers  and  other

important  officials who from  time  to  time  pass

through  Singapore.  More  of  the  hospitality  is

looked  after by the protocol section of my  office

than that of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I hope I will receive the

support  of the Members of the Opposition when  the

time comes to scrap



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>



these  cars after they have done more than  100,000

miles.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Perhaps, Mr Speaker, the final

explanation  as to why the cost in  his  sector  is

heavier  than that of the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's

sector  may be that his chauffeurs are not as  well

paid  as  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara's chauffeurs.

However,  in view of the explanation given  by  the

Prime   Minister,  I  beg  leave  to  withdraw   my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $471,500 for Head 7 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 8 be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (40) of sub-head 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, item 40, Airport General

Manager  [$1,300 - 40A - 1,420].  The  salary  of   the

Airport General Manager for the year 1959 was  such

that  his  total  emolument was $15,600.  Estimated

emolument  for  1960 is $517.040,  all  increase  of

$1,440. May I ask the Minister why there is such an

increase of salary?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member will find a note at

the foot of the page. Is that the answer?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, the annual increment would not

bring it up to that figure.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, the Airport

General Manager was appointed by the P.S.C. to  act

for six months. The person so appointed was Mr  P.

W.  Ford.  He proceeded on long leave in  May  this

year.  While  he  was away on leave, investigations

were made into the affairs at the Airport, and as a

result  of  these  investigations,  Mr  Ford   was

recalled  from leave. On September this  year,  Mr

Ford  was interdicted from duty. An inquiry is  now

in  progress into these matters, and I can  say  no

more  at  this  stage. Meanwhile, the  Director  of

Civil Aviation himself is supervising the functions

of the Airport division, and the Airport Commercial

Manager's  post is filled in an acting capacity  by

Mr Tessensohn, and the Technical Services Manager,

again in an acting capacity, by Mr Chong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>



Pak  Chow. Of course, both these officers  are  now

called  upon to shoulder additional responsibility.

Mr Ford is not likely to return to duty because he

has applied for retirement under the Malayanisation

scheme. Meanwhile, the Government is looking for  a

suitable  applicant to fill this  post  of  Airport

Manager.  It may well be that we should  recruit  a

man with considerable experience from overseas, and

it  is necessary therefore to have to estimate  his

salary at the top scale of $17,040 a year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> As I understand it, the Deputy Prime

Minister  feels  that this post  can  only  attract

recruits  to  it if the salary at the  top  of  the

scale   is  offered.  Why  does  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister  say  that?  Has he  made  any  effort  to

recruit at a lower point, somewhere between  $1,300

and  $1,220?  Why should he assume that  it  is  so

difficult to fill this post when it has hereto been

filled quite easily?



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, on the advice

which  has been given to me, it seems that for  the

present  at  least,  there are  no  local  officers

available to fill this post. What has been laid  in

the 1960 Estimates is only an estimate, and if on a

future   occasion  we  should  find  a  man   whose

qualification  and experience does not  merit  this

amount  of  salary, then it would be  natural  that

that person will be paid a lower salary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I do ask the Deputy Prime Minister to

make  an  effort to recruit at a lower  point,  and

that  it  is only in the last eventuality  that  he

will  recruit  at the top point.  I  beg  leave  to

withdraw.

Mr Speaker, Sir, could the Minister inform the

category of persons are entitled to live from  time

to time at Richmond Bungalow?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, I have not been

stay at Richmond Bungalow.

the  hon.  Member with the information required  in

due course.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, I have not known

of  any Cabinet Ministers having stayed in Richmond

officials occupying Richmond Bungalow or any  other

Government bungalow?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think I can permit

fishing  questions  of this  nature.  If  the  hon.

Member  has  any  specific information,  he  should

inform  the House of that information and  possibly

the Minister could answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I am sorry, Sir, I took the wrong

line.  Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand that Richmond

Bungalow  and  the other bungalows in the  vicinity

are  sometimes  occupied not only by  Ministers  or

Government servants, but also by people who are not

Ministers or Government servants. People  who  have

happened to be heads of statutory bodies, or people

who  have  been  appointed  by  the  Government  as

Chairmen of certain Boards, are known to have lived

there.  Could the Minister say whether the Chairmen

of  statutory  boards or the Chairman appointed  by

the  Government to any Board is entitled to  go  to

Richmond  Bungalow and push out Government servants

while they are living there?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, as usual, the

Member  for Farrer Park's information, as  we  have

seen  in  the past few months, is mostly  based  on

presumption and presuppositions. It would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>



have  been  better  if  he could  have  brought  in

specific  instances  so that the  Government  would

know perhaps what goes on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richmond Bungalow is not in Singapore Island. It

was built by the past Colonial government, of which

the   Member   for  Farrer  Park   had   got   much

connections,  for the expatriates to go  and  enjoy

the  sublime and cool climate up in Fraser's  Hill.

In this connection, the City Council has also built

bungalows at Fraser's Hill, and perhaps the  Member

for  Farrer  Park during the good old days  in  the

City  Council had also enjoyed the perfect  climate

in  the City Council bungalow which is not far from

Richmond  Bungalow up in Fraser's Hill. Few  people

can  afford to go up to Fraser's Hill, and as  such

perhaps  these bungalows are sometimes left vacant.

When  they  are left vacant, it is better  for  the

Government to let them out to any person who  might

want  to rent them out. I have known occasions when

the  City Council bungalows during the time of  the

Member for Farrer Park, were let out to persons who

were  not City Council staff but who came from  all

the States in the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Since the Minister thinks that it is

necessary for him to touch upon my having  gone  to

Fraser's Hill as relevant to the question I put  to

him,  Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel I should be afforded

an  opportunity of answering him on that point. For

his information, I would like to inform him that  I

had not been to Singapore House during the last ten

years I served on the City Council. So the Minister

should  perhaps  look up his own  facts  before  he

starts. In view of what the Minister has been  able

to say - he has not been able to say very much - and as

it  would  not seem to serve any useful purpose  to

pursue  the matter further with the Minister today,

I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

A. P. Rajah:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 17 be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (58) of sub-head 1.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, the same points arise in

connection  with  this particular matter  as  arose

with  item  (42). So in view of my having withdrawn

my  amendment on item (42), may I be given leave to

withdraw item (58)?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member is not moving?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> No, Sir. Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 17 be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (88) of sub-head 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, item (88) is "Caretaker, Grade

II  [$93-2A-101]" and it comes under  the  head  of

"Hostel  for Members of the Legislative  Assembly."

It   also  says  under  the  remarks  column  "Post

approved in 1959. (Warrant No. 196/59)". Sir, may I

explain  straightaway that I have not been in  this

Hostel, and I have not known about the existence of

this hostel -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker,-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Minister will have an

opportunity to reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> - although vague rumours have reached

me  that  a certain house in Fort Canning has  been

allocated for this purpose. But as it is not  usual

for  me to jump to conclusions without taking  some

precautions   to  find  out  the  facts,   I   made

investigations. I was busy on this when the  Budget

itself  provided the answer to what I  was  looking

for.  Now  there  is a hostel for  Members  of  the

Legislative Assembly, but there are some Members of

the Legislative Assembly who do not even know where

the  hostel is, what it is intended to do, or  what

it  is meant for. A hostel, as I understand it, Mr

Speaker - unless the Minister is going to give  it  a

different  meaning - is some place where a person  is

allowed to take a rest and perhaps sleep, and  food

is  provided  for him too. Has such  a  place  been

provided for Members of the Legislative Assembly? I

might hasten to add that none of my colleagues here

know  anything about this hostel. So that the  only

persons   who   have   enjoyed  this   governmental

provision out of public funds



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>



must   be   high  Government  officials,  including

Cabinet ranking Ministers and Members occupying the

back benches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister tell the House what all this

is  about?  Perhaps some of us in this House  might

also  like  to  go  and partake of  the  Minister's

hospitality.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the question raised by

the Member for Farrer Park, if he wants to know how

many  Members have enjoyed these facilities I  will

say this. We, unlike the Members of the Opposition,

all the Back-benchers of the P.A.P. are responsible

for certain functions in the Government Ministries.

That  is  why the Government has decided to provide

certain  facilities for the Members, so  that  they

will  be  able  to  spend more time  on  Government

affairs. If the Opposition Members are not prepared

to  pay  rent to stay in this hostel, we  will  not

accept them. If they cannot go home because of  the

late  hour,  we will take pleasure in  opening  the

door  for them and providing them with beds to stay

overnight.  If  the  Members  from  the  Opposition

Parties  have credentials, we welcome them and  ask

them to enjoy the facilities provided they pay  the

rent as we do.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, the Member for

Farrer  Park is apparently under the illusion  that

he  is missing something good, and that large  sums

of  money  are being set aside for the  benefit  of

Government  Members of the Assembly. I  assure  him

that  the  Treasury keeps a strict watch  on  these

matters,   and  that  no  extravagance   is   being

incurred.  In fact, the one being used is  the  one

that  was formerly allotted as Government quarters,

and the Government is getting its full share of the

revenue by way of rent from these quarters.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a proposal initiated by I do not know

who,  that  the  hostel  should  be  provided  with

crockery,  cooks  and other comforts  of  life.  We

decided  that Members of the Assembly are  made  of

very stern stuff and that if they want



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>



food  they  can  buy it themselves.  If  they  want

cooked  meals, they can do the cooking  themselves.

So  I  assure the Member for Farrer Park that there

is  no nice and cushy racket from which be is being

excluded. Indeed, my impression was that a circular

on  this  was  issued  quite  some  months  ago.  I

received one. I do not know whether-



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> When was that?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> There must have been a failure

of communication somewhere.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> If it is merely a question of late

hours  that  Assemblymen have got to  keep  in  the

Assembly,  I would say, with respect to the  former

speaker, that eight o'clock is not a very late hour

in   Singapore.  There  is  plenty   of   transport

available  at  that hour to send  Members  back  to

their homes in time. I have still not been given  a

satisfactory  answer,  despite  the  Minister   for

Finance's attempt to do it. He said that a circular

found its way to him but, strangely enough, it  did

not  find  its  way to the Opposition benches.  So,

either  somebody forgot the Opposition benchers  as

Members  of  the  Legislative  Assembly,   or   the

circular went astray in the post. I should hesitate

to  think  that  it could have gone astray  in  the

post,  and, therefore, possibly the only reasonable

conclusion I could come to is that nobody  bothered

to send it to us. However, the Finance Minister has

assured the House that no food is being provided to

P.A.P.  Assemblymen  on  public  account,  and   no

bedding is being provided to P.A.P. Assemblymen  on

public  account. In fact, nothing is being provided

for them on public account. That they are paying an

economic rental, as all Government servants,  I  am

told, pay an economic rental; and, therefore, since

the  Government's scale of rents is being  paid  on

it,  it  is  quite  a business proposition.  May  I

therefore  congratulate  the  Government  on  their

business enterprise and beg leave to withdraw?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it the pleasure of hon. Members

that the amendment be withdrawn?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The answer is no then.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I can assure the

Member for Farrer Park and other Assemblymen on the

opposite benches that a circular was issued to  all

Assemblymen that there will be a hostel at  No.  9,

Fort  Canning Road. There are only 10 beds in three

rooms  and  the  rate  was  $2  per  day  for  each

Assemblyman. Some Assemblymen have moved  into  the

hostel  and  they  are paying a rent  of  $120  per

month, plus charges for electricity, water and gas.

All    these   charges   are   collected   by   the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister  from

the resident members and paid into the Land Office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Government expenditure on this

hostel,  it  is  very  small.  The  Government  has

provided only furniture and is paying for only  one

caretaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I add, Mr Speaker, and as the Member for

Choa  Chu Kang has said, if at any time the Members

from  the opposite benches wish to share beds  with

them, they are welcome.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 17 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>Sir,  even before Malayanisation, the Public  Works

Department had difficulty in getting qualified  and

experienced  engineers and architects.  Now,  with,

Malayanisation I am sure there is an  even  greater

shortage.  In view of the fact that the  Government

is  embarking on a big expansion scheme in building

more  schools and hospitals, I would like to  know,

Sir,  the  present  staffing  position  as  regards

engineers  and  architects, whether the  posts  for

1960 have already been filled, or whether there  is

a  shortage. If there is a shortage, may I know how

they propose to recruit suitable replacements?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, we still have in

Singapore  a  very small section of the  population

who has that fear, consciously or unconsciously  in

their  hearts,  that when the expatriates  go  away

they  cannot  run their own country. I  think,  Mr

Speaker, that basic fear and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>



the  lack of confidence in our own people have been

the  greatest factors which had prompted the Member

for   Cairnhill  to  lay  a:  barrage  against  the

Ministry  of National Development, a barrage  taken

up  later  by  the Member for Mountbatten  and  the

Member  for  Farrer Park. That  is  why,  when  the

Member for Cairnhill was running the government, he

spent  tens  of millions of dollars in paying  off

the  expatriates; and that is why, when the  Member

for  Farrer  Park was running the City Council,  he

ashamedly  put  up  a bill in  order  to  give  $14

million to about 120 expatriates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the People's Action Party is made of a different calibre. When the expatriate engineers

came to see me during the time when we were in  the

City  Council and threatened to resign as early  as

January 1958, I accepted the challenge. I told them

that  if  they wanted to resign and play  politics,

they  were at liberty to do so and I would  welcome

any  challenge. Mr Speaker, our work in  the  City

Council had been thrown open for a decision by  the

people. It was justified in the Kallang by-election

and in the general elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have confidence that our local engineers,

architects and administrators can run this country.

I  am  sure the Member for Farrer Park is not  well

aware  that at present in Singapore there are  many

local engineers and architects who cannot get  jobs

at  all. The first step I took in the first week of

the  new  Government  was to sack  five  expatriate

architects  in the P.W.D., who had been engaged  by

the  old  Government despite the  protests  of  the

local  architects, both in the P.W.D. and  outside.

Not   only  did  the  old  government  engage  five

expatriate  architects on a  contract  basis,  they

even  gave  work  to  outside expatriate  firms  of

architects. Mr Speaker, the expatriate  architects

in   the  P.W.D. in  those  days  and  the   local

architects in the City Council in those days had  a

competition   in   the   Constitution    Exposition

exhibition in which the Lim Yew Hock Government was

trying  to  vie  with  the  P.A.P.-dominated   City

Council  as  to who was capable of putting  up  the

best  show. Mr Speaker, despite the fact that they

put up $600,000 and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>



we  only  spent $100,000, the people  of  Singapore

knew who put up the best show and who put it up  on

the target date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said just now, there

are many engineers and architects who have returned

from   universities  in  Australia,   America   and

England,  and who have found themselves  unable  to

get  jobs  at  present. There  is  no  shortage  of

skilled personnel in this country. For instance, in

the  construction of houses, we took action to sack

all the expatriate architects in the S.I.T. - six of

them - and   we   replaced  them   with   six   local

architects. In the same way, we took action to sack

the five expatriate architects on contract basis in

the  P.W.D. and at present, because of  the  stand

taken  by  the old Government, we are not  able  to

take  positive  steps  to  recruit  the  unemployed

architects  and  engineers hovering  in  Singapore.

However,  the position in the P.W.D. is  very  well

under   control,  and  the  first   step   in   the

reorganisation of this most corrupt department will

soon  start.  The Director of Public Works  was  an

expatriate. He went last month, and a local man has

now  taken  his place, officiating as  Director  of

Public  Works. The Deputy Director of Public  Works

was  also  an expatriate. He also left last  month.

Mr  Speaker, I can assure you that when all  these

expatriates leave, I will never give the  slightest

indication that we need their services any more. We

welcome them to leave if they are not interested in

serving the people of this country. We have a local

man  at present to officiate as Deputy Director  of

Public  Works.  Mr  Speaker,  this  local  man  is

responsible at present for expediting the  drainage

scheme which the previous expatriates in the P.W.D.

took  many  years to carry out. The Chief  Engineer

was also an expatriate and has also left. The Chief

Architect  was also an expatriate and he  has  also

left.  Mr Speaker, we do not attempt to make these

people  stay  because  we feel  that,  in  national

construction  work, only persons who are  dedicated

to  the  service of this country can work  properly

and  efficiently, and the S.I.T.,  which  has  been

thoroughly reorganised, is clear proof of

what we are doing. Six local architects to take the

place of six expatriate architects! Never has there

been  more construction activity in the S.I.T. than

now  and in the future, because by March next year,

we  will be able to have over 6,000 units of  flats

being built at any one time. We prove the great lie

to  the Member for Farrer Park, Mr Speaker, and  I

hope  that  the  sentiments which  the  Member  for

Farrer   Park   has   for  his  old   friends   and

colleagues - the expatriates - in the S.I.T. will  not

overcome his better sense of judgment. That his  10

to   prevent  utterances  of  this  nature.  It  is

Standing Order 31(9), which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The personal conduct of Members of the Assembly

shall  not be referred to except upon a substantive

motion moved for that purpose."



<br><br>So, all these personalities must be ruled out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I am sorry, Mr Speaker. The

position in the P.W.D. is very satisfactory and  we

are  sure  and confident that we will  be  able  to

discharge many of the responsibilities entrusted to

us.  We  have faith in our own people  and  I  feel

sorry  for those persons who have no faith  in  our

local  architects and our local engineers. The  top

posts  will soon be filled by local people  and  we

will try to cut out red tape in our recruitment, so

that   many   of   the  unemployed  engineers   and

architects  who have come back and will  come  back

will  be  able  to play their part in the  national

construction of our time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think we

are  not imputing a lack of faith in our own  local

engineers  and architects. In fact, Sir,  I  was  a

member of the Malayanisation Commission and was one

of  those who recommended Malayanisation. That shows

that we have got faith in our own local people. But

the  point  we wanted to be sure of was whether  we

would have enough of them here to be able to fulfil

our obligations to the public through the P.W.D.

Some  time in the past, aided schools were not able

to  get  their grant because we were told that  the

P.W.D. people had not yet inspected the job. I have

already informed the Minister for Education and  he

is  quite sympathetic. In the case of one school  a

quarter of a million dollars has been paid  to  the

contractors,  but not one dollar of  capital  grant

has  been paid because the P.W.D. has not been able

to  inspect  the job and give it approval.  We  are

glad,   Sir,   that  the  Minister   for   National

Development has given an assurance that there  will

be  no  difficulty in getting replacements  and  we

wish  him success in his enterprise. We, therefore,

look  forward to a building boom not only in regard

to  public  works  but also in  regard  to  private

building  projects, because the S.I.T. has  got  a

great  deal  to  do  with  either  restricting  the

building  projects of the P.W.D. or in  stimulating

and   expediting  such  works.  In  view   of   the

information given, Sir, I beg leave to withdraw the

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $3,245,660 for Head 17 ordered to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 18 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 12.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-head 12, Mr Speaker, reads: "Tax on heavy Oil

Engined  Vehicles  and Road Rollers".  A  reduction

from  $45,600 in last year's estimates  to  $27,000

this  year. Could the House be informed as  to  why

this reduction is being effected? Is it due to  the

fact  that less heavy oil engined vehicles and road

rollers  are  being  employed,  or  whether   other

economies  have  been effected which  have  brought

about the reduction in the amount?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, the reduction from

$45,600  to  $27,000  is  incurred  because  of   a

<br>causing   a  deficit  on  that  of  $67,000,   and,

therefore,   appearing   in   the   estimates    of

expenditure at $67,000. As I understand  the  vote,

it  is  a  vote  which enables  the  Government  to

purchase articles for the use of various Government

departments which eventually will be paid for  from

other sub-heads and other service votes. If that is

the  correct  appreciation of  the  situation,  why

should  there  be  a  deficit of  $67,000  on  that

particular item?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, the $67,000

represents  the  maximum  margin  allowed   between

stores purchased and the issues made. It means that

at any time the stores should not exceed $67,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I do not at all follow what the

Minister  says,  that at any given  moment  in  the

stores  under unallocated heads, there must not  be

stores  to the value greater than $67,000. That  is

not my appreciation of the vote. My appreciation of

the  vote  is  that  the total provision  made  for

purchase of stores by Government is $1,500,000, and

it  is  a  central purchase which will be allocated

throughout  the  different  departments  for  which

apparently the different departments are  going  to

pay  the central store $1,433,000. I also know that

it  is  the  practice of Government that when  they

make  these central purchases, they put a five  per

cent  charge on it, so that they make a profit - they

call it a cost charge - which will help to defray the

cost of centralised storing before they sell it  to

the  other sub-heads. Mr Speaker, Sir,  I  do  not

accept the Minister's explanation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, I have tried to

explain  it  just now in technical language,  as  I

thought the Member for Farrer Park would be able to

understand technical phraseology. The P.W.D. works

as  an  agency on behalf of Government departments,

and  buys stores on their behalf. Stores come  into

the P.W.D. and they are charged to other Government

departments' votes. But this transaction takes some

time and there is always this margin in the past 13

years'  budgets, so that between one year  and  the

other  year  when  the vote is not chargeable,  the

votes  of  the  other departments are not  charged.

There  is  a  vote in the P.W.D. to cover  the  unchargeable stores.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The Minister is an accountant. Figures

are his metier, but still it does not make sense to

me.  I  do  not  understand it, Mr  Speaker,  Sir.

$67,000, as I understand it, appears in the  budget

as  a  debit item against Government. Where is  the

corresponding  income item  to  offset  that?  The

Minister's  explanation is that, in one  particular

year  there  may be a debit of $67.000 towards  the

end  of  that year. He wants to give the impression

that in the following year that debit will become a

credit. Now, if that is so - and it may be so -  could

the  Minister  point to the income  estimate  which

provides the credit?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, I feel it is

better  that  I  try to illustrate  it  by  way  of

example.  Say,  for instance, in December  of  each

year, the P.W.D. buys certain stores for the Health

Ministry,  an order for which has been received  in

June  of that year, but it has not been charged  to

the  Health Ministry's vote as yet. In other words,

the transfer item could not be executed in time for

the  closing  of the P.W.D. budget by the  15th  of

December. So it is necessary for the budget to have

an item to cover such transfer items.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I suggest that this is an item

which   could  suitably  be  looked  into  by   the

Estimates  Committee. I understand the  Member  for

Tanglin is a Member of the Estimates Committee.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, I am not satisfied with

the explanation, but it does not seem to me that

the Minister can take us very much further on this

particular point. In view of that, I beg leave to

withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 18 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 14.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the same point arises in this matter as in the previous matter, and I hope the Minister

might  be able to enlighten us better on this  than

he  was able to on the other one. "Workshop Account

$570,000 - Deduct  Value of Bills recoverable  before

the  end of the year $540,000," Therefore, a  debit

on  the  expenditure of the Government of  $30,000,

but  not  necessarily a loss to Government  over  a

period of years. Could the Minister please indicate

why  there should be a debit of $30,000 when  there

is  a possibility of recovering that amount in  the

following year? This must have been the position in

1958.  If  that was so, there should  have  been  a

corresponding entry in the income column to  offset

the  $30,000 debit this year, as there will  be  in

1960  to  offset  this debit of $30,000  for  1960.

Could  the Minister therefore please indicate  what

was  left  over from 1959 in the estimates  in  the

income column and which will be received in 1960?



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, this question

involves the same principle of accounting entry  as

the previous question. I feel that in this House it

is  quite  difficult for an accountant  to  show  a

lawyer  the  techniques  of accounting  debits  and

credits. But if the Member for Farrer Park has  got

some  time, I shall be delighted to explain to  him

in  more  detail how these accounting  entries  are

being put into the Budget.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Well, accountant-lawyer lawyer-accountant, there is nothing but that. I appear

here   not  as  a  lawyer  and  neither  does   the

Honourable Minister as an accountant. We appear  as

representatives   of  the  people   and   let   us,

therefore, talk the language of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>



people.  It  is  quite  a simple  thing.  He  says,

"Workshop Account, $570,000. Deduct Value of  Bills

recoverable  before  the  end  of  the  year".  The

implication in that statement is some of the  bills

cannot be recoverable during the year and can  only

be recovered in the following year. As the practice

of  Government is that the final accounts  for  the

year  can  only show those amounts received  during

the year, even though the amount may be received in

the  following year - this Budget is framed  in  this

way - therefore, it is obvious that this $30,000, Mr

Speaker,  will appear in the 1961 Estimates  as  an

income  item.  If  it does not,  it  should.  I  am

suggesting  to  the Minister that if  that  is  the

correct  assumption, why does the 1960  Budget  not

show  what  will be received in 1960 in respect  of

unpaid  work  for 1959? It might be $25,000  or  it

might  be  $30,000 - that must be shown in  the  1960

Budget as an income item. I cannot make myself  any

clearer than that.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> As I have indicated, this is

exactly the type of item which could be looked into

in  detail  by the Estimates Committee, because  we

are now in Committee of Supply in a public meeting.

It  might  require inquiry, and  an  item  of  this

nature might require evidence, and I have no  doubt

it   would   require  evidence.  If  the  Estimates

Committee will look into the matter, take evidence,

its  report will probably make the matter clear  to

all honourable Members.

for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>



Health,  his functions and duties, the duration  of

his  duty  hours  each day, and why  it  should  be

necessary  for the Minister for Health  to  have  a

Political Secretary.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, the question put forward

by  the  Member for Tanglin appears  to  have  been

answered  by  the Prime Minister in  this  Assembly

already. However, I would also like to clarify that

the   Personal  Secretary  (Political)  is  a  post

approved in 1959 (Warrant No. 141/59). This is  not

a  new post, but was created in 1959, and as such I

do  not  see why the Member for Tanglin  wishes  to

know  the  functions  and responsibilities  of  the

Personal Secretary (Political).



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I feel I have to ask that

question  because in the public  mind  there  is  a

question  as to whether the Ministry of  Health  is

being run by the Minister or really by the Personal

Secretary  (Political), and  whether  the  Personal

Secretary (Political) is the real power behind  the

throne  and  above the Minister,  or  the  Minister

above    the    Personal   Secretary   (Political).

Otherwise, Sir, the public will begin to have their

doubts  and  all  kinds  of ideas  which  would  be

detrimental to the welfare of the Government.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Sheng Nam Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

perhaps  I might be allowed to answer on behalf  of

the Minister for Health. The Minister is the person

who  holds final responsibility for the running  of

his  Ministry. He has two people to help him,  that

is,  myself and the Personal Secretary (Political).

I   have  said  previously  that  Members  of   the

Opposition  must  not  make  statements  on   false

premises  to frighten the people. This  is  another

instance of an attempt to discredit the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to state here very clearly that the

running  of  the Ministry of Health is  solely  the

responsibility of the Minister himself. In  so  far

as    Mr    Woodhull,   the   Personal   Secretary

(Political),  and I myself are concerned,  we  only

help him in his duties.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I wonder if the Minister

for   Health   could  say  whether  the   Political

Secretary is medically qualified to advise  him  in

his Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

it  seems  that the Member for Tanglin is  speaking

like  a man with an unsound mind. It seems that  he

is  anxious  to  know the position of  my  Personal

Secretary  (Political).  The  position   has   been

explained  by my Parliamentary Secretary just  now,

and  if the Member for Tanglin has good reasons  to

be  dissatisfied  with  the  administration  of  my

Ministry,  I would much prefer that this matter  be

put  to  me  in the form of a written  question  to

enable  me  to  give him a satisfactory  reply.  It

seems  that his question put to me just now is  not

proper.  If  I am not mistaken, I think the  Member

for  Tanglin  cannot understand the term  "Personal

Secretary (Political)". He is still groping in  the

dark  in  spite of the fact that we have given  him

clarification.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not know whether the Minister

or  the interpreter has made me understand that the

Minister has alleged that the Member for Tanglin is

not of sound mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health</b> indicated assent.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. If the Minister has, in

fact,  made  the allegation, I think  he  ought  to

withdraw  it.  I do not think he can say  that  any

Member of the Assembly is of unsound mind.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

what  I  meant was that the nature of the  question

was unhealthy or that the mind was not sober.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Minister mean to suggest

that the Member is drunk?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, my remarks were

not  intended  to be in any way derogatory  to  the

Minister for Health. In fact, our opinion  is  that

there  is  enough  political  wisdom  in  both  the

Minister  and his Parliamentary Secretary  so  that

they  do  not  require any further  advice  from  a

political adviser. Therefore, this post is really

redundant.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

I  still  cannot  understand the intention  of  the

Member for Tanglin. The post mentioned just now was

approved by Warrant No. 141/59 and was created  not

only  in  my Ministry but also in other Ministries.

Why  was  this  question  of Political  Secretaries

levelled  against  me  and not  against  the  other

Ministries?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps in

other  Ministries  the Political Secretary  may  be

necessary.  But  in this particular  Ministry,  the

Parliamentary Secretary is himself a  medical  man,

and I do not think, therefore, that it is necessary

for  another  person, a political  adviser,  to  be

installed in the post.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, all facets of

government  involve  politics,  and  that  includes

health.  For instance, when the City Council  build

clinics, it is politics: when we build clinics  for

the  people, it is people's politics. But when  the

Member  for  Cairnhill built clinics,  he  did  not

build  them  for  the people. He built  only  three

clinics  compared to our fifteen  clinics,  and  he

looked after the interests of the other sections of

the  population,  and,  Mr Speaker,  this  too  is

politics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think the Minister for Health said just

now that the Member for Tanglin is of unsound mind,

because if he had said so, he would have seen to it

that the Member is sent to a proper place. Instead,

the  Member  brought in the Gospels and  the  Bible

yesterday to read his Sermon on the Mount.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Ministers for Health do not have to be doctors, and doctors do not necessarily make

good Ministers for Health. The former Minister  for

Health  was not a doctor; he was a lawyer. In  very

few countries in the world do we have Ministers for

Health who are medical men. As a matter of fact, it

is  better that a Minister for Health knows nothing

about  medical science, because in the  running  of

their ministries they always have experts to depend

on  for professional knowledge. When I construct  a

house,  Mr  Speaker,  I  do  not  have  to  be  an

architect. This holds true with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>



Minister  for Health. The Minister for  Health  has

his  Parliamentary Secretary, who is a  doctor,  to

advise  him on medical matters. He is there to  run

the Ministry on behalf of the P.A.P. Government and

to look after the welfare of the people.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for  Tanglin did not criticise the Minister at all.

He  did  not  say that the Minister  did  not  have

medical  qualifications. He was trying to find  out

from  the  Minister  whether or not  the  Political

Secretary is qualified.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Minister

for  National Development wishes to build  a  house

for  himself. I am so glad for him that he does not

have  to  go  to  an  architect,  and  that  he  is

sufficiently  competent to  plan  it  and  have  it

erected   himself.  When  he   is   in   his   last

extremities - and I pray that that will  not  be  for

some time yet - he will also say, "I do not need  the

assistance of the Minister for Health or any of the

incumbents  of the various doctors'  posts  in  his

Ministry."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Ministers are private individuals and the Minister for Health need not necessarily be

a   doctor.  Not  all  doctors  make  good   Health

Ministers: and not all lawyers make good  Ministers

for  Law, except in exceptional cases, such as  the

one we have in front of us. But the point is: if it

is  accepted  that a layman who is a  Minister  for

Health  must have around him medical advisers,  the

question is, must he also have political scientists

at  his elbow in order to carry out effectively his

medical policies?



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

it  seems  that  the  debate  on  this  subject  of

Personal  Secretary (Political) has got heated  up.

The  Government has taken a decision in this matter

and we have full confidence in the incumbents.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think all

reasonable  persons will agree with the Member  for

Farrer Park that an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>



expert in the field of politics will not be able to

advise the Minister on how best to, say, operate on

a case of acute appendicitis. Indeed, it is not the

business  of  the political adviser to provide  the

Minister  with such technical advice. I  think  the

Member   for   Farrer   Park  has   overlooked   or

underestimated the importance of making  an  impact

upon  the  public  of Government  policies  in  all

Ministries.  It  is important not only  to  provide

services but to make sure that they are provided in

a  manner which the public wants. It is because the

Member for Farrer Park and his colleagues have been

unable  to understand the vital importance of  this

link  between  the Government and the  masses  that

they  met  with  disaster six months  ago.  We  are

trying  to impress upon him that this is  the  most

basic  and  fundamental issue, but I am  afraid  we

have so far met with very little success.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, let me be the first to assure the

Minister  for Finance that I am well aware  that  a

Party  that  is  not rooted in the  masses  of  the

people  has very little chance at the polls.  I  am

the first to admit that, and it is always so in any

democratic institution where the ballot box counts.

Unless  you  get  the confidence of the  masses - and

since the masses count these days - you will not  get

your seat. But what worries some of us and quite  a

lot  of  people outside, Mr Speaker, is this.  The

People's   Action  Party  is  deeply   and   firmly

entrenched  in  the  masses. That,  of  course,  is

accepted  by all of us - there can be no doubt  about

that,  and the Minister for Finance need not repeat

that  since  we accept it. As a corollary  of  that

statement,  since they are the people  who  are  so

deeply  rooted in the masses - and there  are  43  of

them  sitting  in front of us - is it  necessary  for

them to engage the services of six others?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I hate to

refer  the Member for Farrer Park to all  that  has

been  said on this subject. But can I ask  him  one

simple  question? Does he suggest that a Government

is  not entitled to use such resources that it  has

at its disposal to put across the policy of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>



that  Government, so that it can be again  returned

by  the mass support of the people? If that is  the

business   of   government,   and   if   successful

government means not only governing well, but being

able  to  convince the majority of the people  that

what  you  are doing is in their interests  and  so

carry  them  with  you,  is there  anything  either

unethical  or  improper that  a  government  should

spend a minute portion of its resources in order to

equip itself with the necessary personnel?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me put this to the Member for Farrer Park.

Since 1945 the Blood Transfusion Unit has been  run

on the basis of a bottle of beer in exchange for  a

bottle  of  British servicemen's blood. That  is  a

fact;  the doctors will confirm it. The only people

who  have no psychological resistance to losing red

blood  corpuscles are those who consider themselves

to have a jot of it, partly because, having given a

pint  of  blood,  they are thereby discharged  from

their  rather tedious duties for the  rest  of  the

day,  and partly by the consolation of a bottle  of

beer.   That  is  the  way  in  which   the   Blood

Transfusion Unit had been run. And because  we  are

able to put across the message we have now for  the

first  time  got a roster of something  over  6,000

donors  in a short campaign. Our target is  12,000,

and  I think in due course of time we shall achieve

the target. These are simple elementary things.  No

Minister is omniscient and omnipotent. We would  be

the  first  to  admit  it.  But  the  business   of

collective leadership means having at its  disposal

people  whose  energy  and drive  can  be  used  to

advantage  by  the  Government  in  furthering  its

programmes and policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can imagine the Member for Farrer Park not

being happy about these things. In fact, I am  glad

to know that all these little points we are scoring

disturb  him sufficiently to want to make  a  noise

about  Political  Secretaries.  I  think  it  is  a

tribute  to  the Personal Secretary (Political)  to

the Minister for Health that Mr Rajah considers it

worthy of mention.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member for Farrer Park!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Minister for Farrer Park!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Not even Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Not yet. Let me be the first to agree

with  the Prime Minister - that the business of every

government is to see that it is returned again. One

expects  that. The Budget that the Finance Minister

is  presenting;  the millions of dollars  that  the

Government  is budgeting for is intended  to  bring

them back into power when the proper time comes for

them to go to the polls. There can be no doubt that

every  action that the Government takes is intended

to  bring  them back into power; they are not  such

altruists.  When  people go into politics,  as  the

Members on the front Bench have done, they are  not

altruists. They go in in order to seize  power  and

to  keep that power, and nobody can blame them  for

it. Politics is that way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You are that way!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The Government can certainly use

Government machinery in the way it should  be  used

in  order to bring itself back into power. But  the

suspicion  that rests with a large section  of  the

public is this, and this is what the Opposition  is

also complaining of: that the Political Secretaries

have been given jobs merely because at the time  of

the  elections they were not able to compete at the

polls.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a matter

of  fact, it is quite wrong. My Political Secretary

was  not  at  that time unable to  compete  at  the

polls. For divers reasons he did not compete at the

polls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have to deal with people who

are  almost psychopathic in their suspicions of the

motives   of  other  people.  They  project   their

personalities, the things that motivate them, on to

other  people. They read into our completely simple

and  straightforward actions all kinds of  abstruse

and  dishonourable  motives. But  being  honourable

men, we are charitable enough to believe



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>



that in the course of the next five years, we shall

be  able slowly to re-educate them to believe  that

there are people in this world who, whilst they are

not  altruists,  have sufficient political  courage

and conviction in what they believe, to fight for a

cause   even  if  it  is  against  their   personal

advantage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the minds and the thinking of that

generation  that  formed the Progressive  Party.  I

know  them  well.  I  sat near  their  councils.  I

learned  all  about  the elections -  the  way  they

fought.  I was once an election agent! For  one  of

them! I understand their motivations. But what I am

hoping to do in the course of the next few years is

to  bring  home to even dyed-in-the-wool  renegades

the  message, that if self interest is all that you

work upon, and is the only incentive you offer your

society,  then in this revolutionary situation  you

must  fail.  Let  me  explain  the  difference   in

technique which is brought about by a difference in

basic approaches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I came back as a very young man



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> You are not old.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Much younger than now! Sir, I

was  employed by persons who obviously  shared  the

Member  for Farrer Park's philosophy of life -  that

nobody  is  an  altruist. I was  employed  on  this

basis,  "Here  is a good return for money."  Having

employed me for my legal skill, I was then  carried

over  to  the  political  front  to  further  their

political  cause. And being sufficiently  malleable

and  willing  to learn, I went in and  learned  all

about it. That is the reason why we understand them

so  thoroughly.  If you want to  have  an  election

meeting - as  indeed  the  President  or  the   Vice-President of his Party used to hold in places  like

Kampong  Amber, and nobody wanted to go and  listen

because  the  message was not worth the  listening,

you  then arrange a satay party and a joget party.

Then you arrange for $400 to be given to your clerk

who  arranges to give it to a friend of the headman

who,  in  turn,  is  supposed to  give  it  to  the

headman.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>



When you ultimately go to the satay party, you find

that  not $400 worth of satay is being distributed.

Then  you are left with the riddle whether  it  was

because  the  headman did get the $400 but  decided

not to buy so much satay, or whether it was because

along  the  way,  each went and bought  and  ate  a

little  satay before the party itself. Then in  the

midst  of all these festivities you make a  speech.

But not so the P.A.P.



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we hold a meeting, there is a message, and

the   people   come   and   listen.   Last   week's

demonstration is an object lesson to those  on  the

other  side - that if you want to carry the  mass  of

the  people with you, you have to offer  more  than

just your personal interest. True, the business  of

the  whole  expenditure is to further the interests

of  the people of Singapore; hence the way the $300

odd millions being spent next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not give jobs to people who do not deserve

them.  When  we  make  political  appointments,  we

explain  it and carry it openly through. The  whole

thing is simple.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for us, as indeed it must be

for  every  Party  that believes  in  organisation,

effectiveness and efficiency, the yardstick is  the

efficacy  of  the  instruments  you  use.  If  your

instruments are blunt, if you hire a lot  of  duds,

then  you  must  fail.  If you  can  get  effective

weapons   with   which  to  forge  your   policies,

implement  your plans, then you will succeed.  That

is  the  acid  test. And that  is  why  I  say  the

Political  Secretary  to the  Minister  for  Health

deserves  to  be complimented, as he  has  received

special attention from the Member for Farrer  Park.

I hope, in the course of the debate in the next few

days, that there may be other Political Secretaries

who will receive this commendation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I must congratulate the Prime Minister

on  the clever words he used to talk about a simple

issue  before  the House. He has been so  eloquent,

Mr  Speaker,  that most of us have lost  sight  of

what  prompted him to speak. On that I congratulate

him.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, he claims to be a simple man, not only for

himself-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> In objectives and in motives!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> He not only claims to be a simple man,

but he also claims other things besides. Yesterday,

Mr  Speaker, if you remember, he also claimed that

he always places his cards on the table. But he did

not  tell the House whether he places them  upwards

or  downwards. This is yet another classic  example

of  the  Prime  Minister placing his cards  on  the

table - face downwards!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> If I may play it one step

further.  Only  fools place all  their  cards  face

upwards!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Are we still on a game of cards?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad the Prime

Minister said that only fools did that; because

when he did say that, I did not believe that he

could be such a fool!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when we are

playing  a game of cards, as the Member for  Farrer

Park  is  suggesting that we should, you only  show

your  cards after your opponent has put his on  the

table.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.

suspend?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 21 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item (4) of sub-head 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item (4) "Permanent Secretary to Ministry of

Health and Director of Medical Services". Could the

House be informed whether this post is held by an

officer, and, if so, whether he is holding it in an

acting capacity or in a permanent capacity?



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

there   is  no  change  concerning  the   post   or

emolument. The post was vacated by Dr Doraisingham

who  retired  on 31st May, 1959. He went  on  leave

before  retirement  on  1st August,  1959.  At  the

moment,  this  post is held by Dr Ho  Yuen  in  an

acting capacity. Steps have been taken to fill this

vacant post.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> How long has Dr Ho been acting in

this post? As far as I can make out, he has been

acting for four months, Mr Speaker. How long is it

intended that this post should remain an acting

post before it is filled permanently?



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

this post has been vacant for four months. The

Ministry of Health will consider Dr Ho's position.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Does the Minister not think that in

such an important appointment as this, it is highly

desirable,  for  the efficiency of the  Department,

for  the  incumbent of the post to know whether  he

will  be made permanent or not, and that it is  not

in the interest of the efficiency of the Department

to  keep a post filled with acting appointments all

the time?



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

what  is being put forward by the Member for Farrer

Park is within our knowledge, and I agree that  the

administration of the Ministry should be carried on

smoothly. We are taking steps



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>



to  make  the appointment permanent after  we  have

satisfied ourselves with Dr Ho's work. The  matter

will   then   be   referred  to  the   P.S.C. for

determination as to whether the incumbent is fit or

not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Do I understand the Minister to say

that,  at the moment, he is not satisfied that  the

incumbent  in  an  acting capacity  is  capable  of

carrying out the duties of the post as yet?



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): As I said

earlier,  Mr Speaker, Dr Ho Yuen is  new  to  the

post.  When  Dr Marcus was on sick leave,  Dr  Ho

acted  as  Director of Medical Services.  When  Dr

Marcus  returned  from leave, he told  me  that  he

could  not  carry  on  with his  job  as  Permanent

Secretary  because of ill health, and he  suggested

that Dr Ho Yuen who was the Acting Deputy Director

should act in this post. Because of the short space

of  time,  I  cannot  say  definitely  whether  the

present incumbent is fit or not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Since the matter is now receiving the

active  consideration of the Minister, Mr Speaker,

<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

this  post  at  the  moment is held  in  an  acting

towards the end of this year. This matter is  under

my  active consideration, and we will fill the post

in the near future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Do I understand the Minister to say

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I would like to enquire, Mr

Speaker, Sir, whether the Member for Farrer Park is

aware  that  all these acting posts  have  remained

acting  for  many months during the office  of  the

last   Government.  He  has  discussed   with   his

colleagues  in  the  last Government  the  problems

involved  in confirming a whole series of  officers

who  have  received rapid promotion as a result  of

Malayanisation,  before they have  been  tried  and

found   adequate  and  suitable  for   this   rapid

promotion?  The  problem that  this  Government  is

faced with is exactly the same one which faced  the

last  Government. Therefore, it might be  as  well,

before  the Member for Farrer Park appears  as  the

champion  for  the officers who are holding  acting

appointments in the Civil Service, that  he  should

perhaps  be  reminded that this is  not  a  problem

peculiar  to this Government but is one  which  has

existed  for  many  months before  this  Government

assumed office.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Strictly, of course, the Prime

Minister  is  out  of time. We  are  on  item  (10)

"Medical Officers five"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>



not   acting  appointments.  But  we  are  in   the

Committee of Supply. Perhaps I could allow that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Let me hasten to assure the Prime

Minister   that  I  hold  no  brief,  watching   or

otherwise, for the Civil Service. My job, as I  see

it, Mr Speaker, is to bring out in this debate the

actual staffing position of the Medical Department.

There is no malice behind this, and my view is that

it  is important for all of us to know what exactly

is  the  position  in the Medical  Department.  The

answers  to these questions seem to indicate  quite

clearly, Mr Speaker, even at this early stage - and

I  have  not finished with the Ministry  of  Health

yet - that  something is very wrong with the staffing

position  of  doctors - that there is a  shortage  of

doctors. If there are going to be shortages in  the

Medical  Department (and the posts of five  doctors

are  not  among  the  new posts,  Mr  Speaker - they

existed  in 1959, and the Minister says  that  only

one  of these posts has been filled at the moment).

I  entirely sympathise with the Minister on this. I

am  not  criticising him. It is not his fault  that

things have happened this way. The only purpose  of

my   raising  this  question  is  to  persuade  the

Government to do something more vigorous about  the

matter,  either  by  recruiting  locally  or   from

abroad,  because the primary consideration for  any

department  is  to  maintain  its  efficiency   and

efficacy.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps the

hon.  Member for Farrer Park is not aware  that  in

the  Ministry  of  Health, there have  always  been

vacancies unfilled, in fact ever since the last ten

years.  This is not a new feature peculiar  to  the

new Government. All along there have been vacancies

in  the Ministry of Health. We have taken steps  up

to now to try and fill these vacancies. As I stated

yesterday,  we  intend  to  recruit  doctors   from

overseas  on short-term contract. The vacancies,  I

cannot  overemphasise, have been there  all  along.

They are not something that are new.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think we are in danger of getting

out  of  strict procedure. I see that there  is  an

amendment, amendment (32), which seeks  to  move  a

motion that the total sum to be allocated for  Head

21  be  reduced by $100. I think that that  is  the

time when the overall picture could be debated.  We

holds a higher qualification and has some seven  or

eight  years' experience. There are at  present  no

perhaps  if  the  matter could be  looked  into  in

detail  by  the Estimates Committee, and thereafter

the  Estimates Committee could put up  its  report.

Then Members would understand all these by-ways  of

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 21 be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (2) of  sub-head 51.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under sub-head 51, it says, "Daily Rated

Employees,  Wages and Allowances"  and  under  item

(2) - "Donkey-man" $1,920. Could the Minister  please

tell  us  what  manner of man is this  "Donkeyman"?

Whether  he does any human chores in his  Ministry,

or  whether he is put to the use to which a  donkey

might  have been put had the Minister been able  to

obtain one?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did

expect the hon. Member for Farrer Park would make a

wisecrack on this particular item, and therefore  I

have come prepared, having looked up the dictionary

what  "donkeyman" means. A "donkeyman" is a  person

who  looks  after donkey engines. Of  course,  this

does  not give very much explanation as to why  the

word "donkey" should be used. A donkey engine is an

engine that is usually less than one horsepower  in

capacity, and therefore is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>



considered to have only one donkey power. So a  man

who looks after an engine of that capacity has come

to  be  regarded as a donkeyman. We have such small

engines  at  St. John's Island, and the terminology

of  this  particular daily-rated employee  has  not

been  changed despite attempts made by the Ministry

of Health to change it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Rajah, are you satisfied?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I have no doubt in my mind that

it is not beyond the ingenuity of the Parliamentary

Secretary  to the Minister for Health to find  some

other  suitable name for this post. We  have  heard

him  describe  a very difficult situation  in  this

House in the most ingenious words - words which  even

got past the Speaker. So I am sure that this is not

a situation beyond his capacity. Would he therefore

give  consideration to changing the  name  of  this

post    from   "donkeyman"   to   something    more

appropriate?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps you

might  have caught the last words of my  answer.  I

was  saying, despite attempts made by the  Ministry

of  Health, it has not been changed this year. That

was  the  tail-end of my answer to the hon.  Member

for Farrer Park.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Tail-end of the donkey!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, the budget for

1960  is  compiled from facts and figures given  by

the old Government because it takes about a year to

draw  up  the budget. I think the P.A.P. Government

will  take  steps to simplify the phraseology  next

time.  For instance, the word "peons" is,  perhaps,

undesirable. Next time, if we have persons to  look

after engines of over one horse-power, we will  not

call  them "horsemen" but we will call them by some

other name.

reduced by $100*

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The same amendment stood in the names of Mr Thio Chan Bee and Mrs Seow Peck

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some moments ago, the Prime Minister seemed to

want  to  give  an indication that I  had  ulterior

motives for putting these various questions to  the

Minister  for Health. I would hasten to assure  the

Minister  for Health that these questions were  put

not  with  a view to embarrassing him, but  with  a

view  to  eliciting information  in  respect  of  a

Ministry  which  is engaging the attention  of  the

public. There is a feeling amongst the public,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  that this Ministry is understaffed,

and   they  hear  various  reports  about   doctors

resigning for one reason or another which  we  need

not  go into now because it is not relevant to this

particular debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position, as I see it, from the replies given

by  the  Ministry, would appear to be  this:  that,

generally  speaking,  at the lower  levels  of  the

medical professional services, they seem to be  all

right. But in the middle and higher echelons, there

seems to be a lack of officers and, if I may put it

this way, even the Ministry is a bit doubtful about

the  capacity of the medical officers now with them

because  they do not seem to want to confirm  them.

Mr Speaker, Sir, I would have imagined that before

a   person   is   put  in  an  acting  appointment,

sufficient consideration would have been  given  by

the  Ministry  and possibly by the  Public  Service

Commission  as  to whether that  person  is  a  fit

person  to  hold  that particular appointment;  and

normally a two or three months' period is given  in

order  to test him out in that appointment.  If  he

comes  through,  as  he  normally  should,  he   is

confirmed  and, in 99 cases out of 100  all  acting

appointments  are confirmed. Otherwise,  it  merely

means  that  he  should never have acted.  Some  of

these  acting posts have been held for  six  months

and   some  for  nine  months.  I  appreciate   the

difficulties  of  the Ministry of  Health  in  that

Malayanisation  has caught them on the  wrong  foot

with the result that a large number



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 968</b></font><br><br>



of  the senior posts are vacant; the Ministry  also

faces difficulties in promoting from below and  are

not  able  to recruit from abroad for reasons  best

known  only  to  themselves. The service  therefore

suffers.  And  if the service suffers,  it  is  the

public at large that will suffer as a result of the

lack   of  experienced  medical  officers  in   the

Ministry.  These services, Mr Speaker, are  manned

by human beings. With the best intent in the world,

human beings can only work that hard and no harder.

If  you  make  them  work  beyond  their  capacity,

particularly  professional men  or  even  for  that

matter  men  who work physically, or  beyond  their

endurance,  they  will  not  give  that   efficient

service which they could normally have been able to

give  if they had been able to do their work  at  a

pace more in keeping with their profession. As  far

as I can see it, in the Health Ministry, the middle

and  higher echelons of the services concerned  are

being overworked. They can stand this overwork  for

a  period  of time, but if it is made to  last  too

long,  there must be a breakdown in their  physical

capacity to carry on their work. That indeed  would

be tragic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge upon the Ministry to use every

possible   endeavour   to  confirm   these   acting

appointments  already held for several  months;  if

the  Ministry is not satisfied with the ability  of

the    officers,   now   holding    these    acting

appointments, to fill the posts, then the  Ministry

must tell them as firmly as it can that they are no

good,  relieve them of their posts and go elsewhere

for filling these posts. I feel that the main thing

is  that  the efficiency of the Department must  be

maintained. In a service, particularly the  medical

service where the efficiency and the quality of the

service would depend on the type of persons manning

it,  it is important that these doctors should  not

be overworked. The present staffing position is, as

I  see it, Mr Speaker, and as it emerges from  the

replies, that there is a definite shortage  at  the

top levels. And if this shortage continues for some

further time, there is a grave danger of the  whole

of the Medical Services breaking down.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the

answers  to my questions submitted on the  11th  of

November, it was stated that out of 31 doctors  who

have  resigned or have given notice of resignation,

29  doctors  have  been recruited since  1st  June,

1959.  I  have since found out, Sir, that these  29

doctors,  regarded as having been  recruited  since

1st  June,  1959, were already in  the  service  as

house-men; so that the actual position  was  in  no

way  alleviated, but the shortage has remained  the

same.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we understand that negotiations are now

taking place on the basis of the special allowances

that have been offered by the Finance Minister.  In

the midst of these negotiations, Sir, we regret  to

say  that the Press reported that the Minister  for

Health  intends to recruit 60 doctors from  abroad.

Now,  to  some of the doctors in the service  here,

this  is a form of intimidation when they are  just

in  the midst of negotiations. If it is proposed to

recruit 60 doctors from abroad, naturally they must

be offered more attractive terms than those offered

to  local  doctors. That would mean  some  overseas

allowance,  and passages too must be paid.  And  if

extra  expenditure has to be incurred, it seems  to

me  that we may as well offer an inducement to  our

own  local doctors to remain in the service. It  is

no  use  having another form of expatriate officers

coming here on contract and then losing our own. It

is  better  for us to retain those who are  already

here with some experience than to get new ones, and

to  let  them go away and to replace them with  new

ones again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, Sir, if an adequate incentive were

given,  those  who are intending  to  resign  would

remain  and those who have just resigned  and  have

not  taken  up private practice may be  induced  to

come  back.  I  hope that can happen  because  that

would  resolve the situation in a more constructive

way than by just recruiting 60 doctors from abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sympathise with the Minister for Health, Sir,

because  in  the  midst of his  troubles  with  his

doctors,  there  has  also been  trouble  with  his

nurses.  At  this  particular  juncture,  it  seems

somebody gave notice to the nurses that they would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 970</b></font><br><br>



have  to  pay  more  for dwelling  in  the  nurses'

hostel.  That  naturally got  their  goat  because,

having  lost a portion of their pay, they  are  now

being asked to pay more for residing in the hostel.

So  naturally they are now up in arms. I hope, Sir,

the  Minister  will be successful  in  solving  his

troubles  with the doctors and nurses so  that  the

public  will have the service of doctors and nurses

who  are  quite satisfied and will give  them  good

service.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have had a session with donkeys,

and now we are having a session with goats!



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when I

made  a remark yesterday about the cuts in the T.B.

patient  allowance, I was accused  of  having  made

wild allegations without investigations from proper

and reliable sources. I am sure that the statistics

on  the chart at the exhibition during Loyalty Week

are  proper and reliable sources of information.  I

noticed on one of the charts that during the months

of   September  and  October,  the  aids  for  T.B.

patients had gone down by over $30,000 each  month.

That is why I asked the question. The Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Health preferred  not

to  call  the  cutting down of the  maximum  from - I

believe  he said - $300 to $180 a cut, neither  would

he  admit that the cutting off of the high cost  of

living  allowance  was a cut. But  the  fact  still

remains that there have been cuts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I am about to bring up is not an

attempt  to  try  and discredit  the  Minister  for

Health,  but I would like to point out  that  there

could  be  misunderstanding in  the  minds  of  the

public.  In  the Straits Times of 5th December,  it

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Singapore Government intends to recruit

about  60  overseas doctors on short-term contracts

to  relieve the pressure on medical officers in the

understaffed service."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very laudable move, Sir. But unfortunately, as

has  been pointed out before, it has happened at  a

time  when  the  local doctors  are  voicing  their

grievances.  And  just in case it  is  taken  as  a

threat  or  a  warning  to  local  doctors,  I   am

mentioning  this so as to give the  opportunity  to

the Minister for Health



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>



to  confirm his real motive, that he is  trying  to

relieve  the  pressure on medical officers  in  the

understaffed  service,  because  certain   releases

might cause doubt when he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We shall not like to make such a move unless we

are sure that it would not be possible to make this

recruitment from local sources or if doctors to  be

recruited locally are not satisfied with the  terms

on which they are recruited."



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it comes to my mind that if the Minister for

Health  recruits overseas doctors whenever  doctors

here are not satisfied with their terms of service,

what  are trade unions for? Trade unions are  there

to  negotiate in cases of grievances voiced by  the

workers.  That is the proper channel, and  I  think

the Minister should try to settle it with the local

doctors  before  he  tries  to  bring  in  overseas

doctors. Nevertheless, Sir, I would like to confirm

that I do not think that that is the intention. But

it says here:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If doctors to be recruited locally are not

satisfied  with  the  terms  on  which   they   are

recruited...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This might have occurred not only to me but to some

other  people as well, and it would be very  useful

if  the Minister could confirm that that is not his

intention. I would like to point out sincerely that

it might boil down to this: if the Government takes

the  attitude that whenever they have staff who are

not satisfied - they recruit from overseas - the whole

civil   service   will  one  day  or   another   be

dissatisfied over one thing or another and then  we

will find that the whole civil service will consist

of expatriates. If Government adopts this attitude,

which  I  know  they  will not,  they  cannot  stop

commercial firms adopting it and what will  happen?

I  suppose  the one and a half million people  will

soon  have  expatriates replacing them.  Then  what

happens  to  us? Where will it land us? In  foreign

countries I suppose?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Timbuctoo!



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> I know this is not the

intention,   Sir,  because  it  will  destroy   the

principle of trade unionism



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>



and  weaken trade unions. If local doctors are  not

satisfied, I do not know whether expatriate doctors

can  be  satisfied unless they are doctors who  are

unable to earn a living in their own countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other article about 20 specialists,

"More  Doctors  for  Government  Service  and  More

Nurses too", it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Against these, the Singapore Government has

recruited  29  doctors.  They  are  students   from

colleges."

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, when students go on

scholarship,  they have to sign a  bond  that  they

have  to serve Government for five years after they

come  back. These students will no doubt come  back

and  serve five years. But if after five years  the

same  conditions exist and the present  specialists

are  again  dissatisfied, they may resign  if  they

have  a  choice. If this goes on, are we  going  to

have new people every five years, and is the Health

Ministry  to have no officer, doctor or  specialist

with more than five years' experience?



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  it seems that the Opposition Members who have

talked  on  the  Ministry of Health  appear  to  be

dissatisfied with the affairs prevailing therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I must direct my answer to the Member for

Farrer  Park.  It  is  public  knowledge  that  the

Ministry of Health is understaffed. The Member said

that  in the lower echelons the position is not  so

bad  as it is in the higher echelons, and he  asked

the Minister for Health to confirm the position  in

the higher echelons. To the questions raised by the

Members   of  the  Opposition  earlier,   we   have

indicated  that  every step has been  or  is  being

taken to resolve these difficulties.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to be straightforward in my reply to the

Member for Tanglin. I admit that there is a feeling

of  discontent  among  some  of  the  staff  of  my

Ministry.  I  do  not  deny  this.  Therefore,   my

officers  and  advisers are taking  every  possible

step  to  overcome this feeling of discontent.  The

Member  for Tanglin has said that, in reply to  his

question,  I  said  that we had  recruited  29  new

doctors  to replace those doctors who had  resigned

sometime  this  year.  He further  said  that  this

matter  had  also  become public knowledge  in  the

Ministry  of Health. Later, the Member  touched  on

the  Press  release  which I  had  personally  made

stating  that the Ministry of Health would  recruit

60  doctors from abroad. I will be very frank  with

the  Member and also with the other two Members  of

the  Opposition  who  spoke.  I  did  not  do  this

arbitrarily.   This   step  has   been   taken   in

consultation with the Medical and Dental  Officers'

Association and experts. They have agreed with  the

steps and actions that I have taken. In fact,  they

welcome the action that I have taken, because  they

are  of the opinion that the officers in the  lower

echelons  will thus have an opportunity to  advance

their  status  in the medical field. If  we  engage

overseas  doctors  on  a  contract  basis,  we  can

release  our  young  and  capable  doctors  to   go

overseas  and advance their studies in the  medical

field.  I  did not do this arbitrarily. As  I  said

earlier  on, this was done in concurrence with  the

Medical  and  Dental Officers'  Association  in  my

Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin said that I am faced with

many problems and difficulties over the question of

nurses.  He  said that the nurses, who  are  in  my

Ministry, are not very happy with the new scheme of

service  whereby  their pay will  be  deducted  for

hostel  accommodation,  water  charges,  etc.  This

scheme  of  service  was  not  introduced  by   the

Government of the day. This was introduced  by  the

previous Government, and I am quite sure the Member

for  Cairnhill  will not deny this fact.  Also  the

Member  for Geylang Serai in the Chamber here  will

not  deny  this.  This scheme of  service  was  put

forward  by  the previous Government.  The  present

Government is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>



merely  carrying it out. However, at the moment,  I

am  still receiving representations from the Nurses

Union and this matter is under consideration. I  do

not  intend to dwell further on this subject  here,

but  I  will  find ways and means of solving  their

problems and difficulties. As I said earlier on,  I

am sympathetic over this matter. We will wait until

a solution is found.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten talked about T.B.

allowances.  This  will  be  dealt   with   by   my

Parliamentary  Secretary who spoke on  this  matter

yesterday. He will surely give a satisfactory reply

to  her.  As  regards  the  Press  release  of  5th

December  mentioned by the Member  for  Mountbatten

concerning  60  doctors, I have  already  explained

that this matter has been dealt with in concurrence

with  and  is  welcomed  by the  Medical  Officers'

Association.  I think the 20 specialists  who  have

just returned from overseas on scholarships awarded

to them will be serving in the Government, and I do

not  see any possibility, as has been mentioned  by

the  Member for Mountbatten, that when these people

return  they  will be discontented. We should  face

the future together.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon.

Member for Farrer Park expressed much concern about

the unbalanced state of affairs in the Ministry  of

Health.  I do not blame him for not being  able  to

understand the background of the medical  services.

The  higher  posts, the upper ranks of the  medical

service   concerned,  consist  of  two   types   of

personnel  so  far as the Budget is concerned:  (1)

the  administrative medical officers  and  (2)  the

professional  medical officers. I  think  when  the

Member pointed out that the Ministry of Health is

unbalanced   at   the  top,  he   refers   to   the

administrative people, because the various items he

went over just now refer to medical administrators.

In  answer to this shortage, Sir, perhaps I may  be

allowed  to give a little background to the medical

services in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously there were two systems of medical

services  in Singapore which, after the  war,  were

unified  into  one.  During  the  fight  for   this

unification  of medical services, a lot  of  senior

officers left



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>



that  was  just after the Second World War.  Since

then  the  service  was held by  relatively  junior

people.  There  was some degree of  reluctance  all

along  on the part of doctors or graduates  to  get

into   the   administrative  service  because   the

professional service is the more lucrative part  of

medical  practice. Therefore, there was a  shortage

in  the  administrative medical service  which  can

only  now  be remedied slowly. Many of the  medical

officers in acting administrative posts are  rather

new  and  therefore cannot be confirmed in a  short

time.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also said that the top professional

posts  should have been filled by the  Ministry  of

Health. I will now inform him that these posts were

left  vacant  at  the request of  the  Medical  and

Dental   Officers'  Association.  The   Association

contends that if we fill these top posts,  it  will

block  the  young  members  of  the  staff  of  the

profession  from coming up. These posts  were  left

vacant  at  the  request of  the  Association.  The

Member  says that the doctors have been  given  too

much  work.  Perhaps he does not realise  that  all

along  doctors  have been overworked in  Singapore,

and  all along there has been a shortage of medical

staff.  Despite all his fears, which are unfounded,

the  standard of medical care in Singapore has gone

up.  One  cannot  say that one is  not  maintaining

efficiency  when  the standard is still  going  up.

Perhaps  if  the  Member visits some  of  the  free

hospitals,  for  example, Kandang Kerbau  Maternity

Hospital, Trafalgar Home or Woodbridge Hospital, he

will  find  that the standard of medical  care  has

gone up considerably.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin queries the Minister's

written answer to his questions to the effect  that

29   medical  officers  have  been  recruited  from

amongst  house-men and were not fresh recruits.  It

is  perhaps pertinent here, Sir, to say that  there

is  a  basic  difference between a houseman  and  a

medical officer. In fact, for a houseman to  become

a  medical  officer, he must break his service  for

one  day. A houseman's pay is $400 a month,  and  a

medical officer's pay is $820 per



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>



month.   They  are  also  in  a  totally  different

category,  because a houseman is not  qualified  to

practise  unless under supervision.  The  fact  the

Minister's  reply  did not include  the  number  of

house-men who entered the service after 1st June is

because that question was not asked. It is  a  very

simple case here. Twenty-nine officers shifted from

the   housemen  status  to  the  medical  officer's

status.  And  even  more  officers  came  into  the

housemen's status to fill the 29 vacancies  created

by these 29 people who were promoted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Member's concern about the Ministerial

announcement of the 60 recruitments from  overseas,

no  time  could have been more opportune  than  the

present  to make it, because the announcement  came

after  the Minister for Finance had announced  that

our   local  officers  would  be  given  specialist

allowances.  I cannot imagine any other  time  more

opportune than the present to announce that we  are

recruiting these officers. I do not see how it  can

be construed that there is intimidation as a result

of  the  recruitment  of  these  60  officers.  The

recruitment  of  these  60  medical  officers  from

overseas   has  had  the  support  of   the   Staff

Association  itself. It may be said  that  in  many

countries doctors are being paid much less than  in

Singapore  and  therefore no  specialist  or  extra

allowances will be incurred in getting people here.

Perhaps Members of the Opposition already know that

in  India it is possible to employ a doctor for 400

rupees a month, which is only about $250 here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of nurses has been adequately dealt

with by the Minister himself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten also wanted to open up

the  subject  of  T.B. allowance.  I  have  stated

clearly  that the allowance was open to much  abuse

and  people who were not entitled to the  allowance

were getting it. It has been reported in the papers

that people owning five taxis were collecting these

allowances. It is because this Government  is  very

judicious  in the expenditure of public funds  that

such    savings    were    made    after    careful

investigations.  Certainly  the  hon.  Member   for

Mountbatten will not agree that one should get $300



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>



per month just because one has T.B. This amount  is

much  more  than one gets if one goes to work.  The

hon.  Member  for  Mountbatten  again  raised   the

question  of  timing in regard to overseas  medical

recruits.   I  thought  she  was  just  trying   to

emphasise a point. I stress again that this is  the

best time to make such an announcement, because  it

was  made  after  the announcement that  specialist

allowances would be given to these people. And just

to  relieve  her mind of the fear that the  service

would  be  plagued  with expatriate  officers,  the

people  who come to work in Singapore on short-term

contract  will  only  be on short-term  service.  I

stated  yesterday in my speech that in the meantime

we  are  sending some 80 to 120 local  boys  abroad

annually  to study medicine. Those are  the  people

who  will  come  back  and  solve  the  problem  of

shortage  ultimately, and not  the  expatriates  on

short-term contract.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I confess to

a  feeling  of  disgust  when  I  listened  to  the

speeches  of the Member for Tanglin and the  Member

for  Mountbatten.  They  pretended  to  feel  very

concerned over the plight of nurses and doctors.  I

believe   their  feelings  on  this   subject   are

completely bogus-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Hon. the Minister might be

feeling so disgusted that he is forgetting that  he

must still remain parliamentary. Therefore the word

"bogus" must be withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Be that as it may, Mr

Speaker,  I withdraw those remarks, but  I  thought

that  they were tempted quite unnecessarily to shed

crocodile tears. But on this occasion, Mr Speaker,

they  could  not  have chosen a worse  subject  for

discussion. They got their facts wrong - the question

of  charging  hospital accommodation and  fees  for

light  and  water  at the hostel.  The  Member  for

Tanglin  forgot  that this was something  that  was

negotiated in the past. He attacked on these  facts

and got himself into a mess.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the recruiting of overseas doctors,

great play was made that this was an attempt by the

Government  to  intimidate  a  resentful  group  of

doctors.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>



Surely, had the two Members checked the facts, they

would  have discovered that a most cordial  meeting

took  place between representatives of the  Medical

and  Dental Officers' Association and the political

leadership  in  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  the

Ministry  of  Finance. We found  the  doctors  most

responsible  and  understanding in their  attitude,

and  between  ourselves we worked  out  a  sensible

scheme,  both  to  meet  our  long  and  short-term

problems. I do hope that in future, when these  two

Members have occasion to shed crocodile tears, they

should,  in  the first instance, try to  get  their

facts  straight  so  that we  will  be  spared  the

necessity of having to listen to a lot of nonsense.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think it can be

alleged  that Members of this House speak nonsense.

Perhaps the word could be withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I withdraw the word "nonsense"

and   perhaps   substitute  a  more   parliamentary

alternative - make   irresponsible   and    unfounded

allegations.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  rise  only to make a very minor point.  All  the

other  points  have already clearly been  answered.

All the speeches from the Opposition side - from the

Member  for Farrer Park, the Member for Mountbatten

and   the   Member   for  Tanglin - were   like   the

allegations from the Member for Cairnhill. They are

all  trying  to frighten the public and  trying  to

show  to the House that there is a skeleton in  the

Ministry  of Health's cupboard, namely, that  there

is  a  grave  shortage of staff, that everybody  is

dissatisfied,   that  unless  something   is   done

Singapore  will  go down in ruins,  and  that  very

shortly we will be dying. Surely the facts are  not

true.  Not  being medical officers, they appear  to

the medical officers to be championing their cause.

In  this House we have doctors who know more  about

the  subject  than  they do. The hon.  Members  are

trying  to  give  the  impression  to  the  medical

profession   that,  but  for  them,   the   medical

profession  would not have all the  attention  they

are  supposed to have. We all know the difficulties

that  the medical profession is undergoing  at  the

present moment. We also know the hard



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>



work  that the doctors in the hospitals are  doing.

But  we  would  like  to  remind  the  Members  for

Tanglin,  Mountbatten  and  Farrer  Park  that  the

doctors at the present moment are not treated as if

they  are  not  human beings.  No,  Sir.  They  are

treated very well indeed. If the hon. Members  were

to  go to the hostels, they would straightaway  see

what a beautiful mansion the doctors have, to begin

with. When we were students, Sir, we never had such

amenities. We had only tiny rooms to study, and  we

had  the lights out at certain hours. Now they have

everything thrusted on them. May I also say that  I

was  one  of  the doctors working in  the  hospital

before?  Let me remind these people who  talked  so

much  about  hard work that we worked  the  hardest

during the war and we never complained. I can also

assure  you, Sir, that our pay was very much  less. We

only received $75 or $250. Now, of course, they receive $400 or $820 or

even higher.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after all that has been said, it does not mean that we do not appreciate the good work being

done  by  the medical profession in the  hospitals.

What  we want to say is that the medical profession

is only one part of the community in Singapore and,

as  such, as medical officers, they have to try and

look  at  everything as a whole and in  its  proper

perspective.  In addition, Sir, I  would  even  say

that from our side we are all the time thinking  of

our  medical  colleagues outside. We are  bound  by

some  invisible ties which are not seen by  a  non-medical  man. In fact, at the present  moment,  the

medical  doctors are the first to benefit from  the

extra allowance. It can be said they might be worse

off  but for some of our medical colleagues in  the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been

alleged that we the Opposition here, have concocted

our  own  views about the situation in the Ministry

of   Health.  But  then  there  are  always   three

sides - not  just  two - to a question.  There  is  the

Government side, there is the Opposition side,  and

there is the side of the general public. Sir, some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>



doctors  have  approached us  themselves  and  this

shows  that  not all the doctors in the  Government

service-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Well, we are in the Committee

of Supply.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are in the Committee of Supply.

The Prime Minister will have an opportunity.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Not all the doctors in the

Government  service  hold  views  similar  to   the

Government  side. So it shows that  the  Government

must  give  freedom to those who do not agree  with

them to have their voice heard also here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I would like to enquire from

the  Member  for  Tanglin,  if  he  could  help  in

building up the morale and discipline of the  civil

service  by  telling us who the officers  were  who

went and consulted him on these matters.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, the atmosphere in this

State   has  been  such  that  these  people   fear

intimidation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I can assure the Member for

Tanglin  that, far from intimidating  them,  I  can

guarantee   a   completely  impartial  disciplinary

inquiry  carried  out  in the  best  civil  service

tradition.  But  let me explain to the  Member  for

Tanglin  that, whilst he was making such a hue  and

cry  about the integrity of the civil service,  and

how  we  must sustain and nurture its good  points,

one   of   the  fundamental  prerequisites   to   a

disciplined   and   coherent  public   service   is

observance  of  the  General  Orders.  One  of  the

important rules laid down in the General Orders  is

that  a civil servant shall not individually  lobby

to foster his own case. For that reason, I was very

interested to see the Member for Farrer  Park  come

out with a list of 20 odd cases, each and every one

of  which  refers to a specific officer waiting  to

get,  not just the $200 acting allowance,  but  the

full  reward  as  a result of confirmation  of  his

substantive position.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>



I  make  this  point, Sir, because I  think  it  is

necessary  that the Opposition should  be  reminded

that we consider this kind of conduct as aiding and

abetting  the demoralisation of the Civil  Service,

and  a  good Sunday school teacher like the  Member

for   Tanglin  should  be  thoroughly  ashamed   of

himself.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, it is very unfortunate

that I have to mention the case of Mr Rajendra. We

all know what has happened to him. We all know that

he  has  now  been  "banished", as  it  were,  into

exile - to  Jurong. Now, in the face an example  like

that, is it to be wondered that the people who work

in  Government  service are scared of  bringing  up

their cases in the proper way, because of what  has

happened to one of their own leaders?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid

the  Member for Tanglin is unable to reason out his

case logically. If the Civil Service are scared  as

a  result of what has happened to Mr Rajendra, the

last   thing   they  will  do  is  to  invite   the

executioner's  axe by looking for  the  Member  for

Tanglin. It is perhaps because Mr Rajendra's  case

was too leniently dealt with, because the Committee

of Inquiry and the Public Service Commission took a

relatively compassionate and mild view of his case,

because he has suffered only a minor reverse,  that

there  are  miscreants who have sneaked up  to  the

Member for Tanglin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say this to the public service as a whole, that

the  number of queries raised by the Opposition has

led  the  Government to believe  that  some  public

servants  have rather foolishly sought  to  advance

their   own  personal  positions,  and  their   own

personal  causes, by the kind of conduct  to  which

the Member for Tanglin has confessed to have been a

party.  I  say  that the P.A.P. Government  is  not

prepared  to  allow  the  public  service   to   be

subverted  in  this  matter. Their  duty  as  civil

servants  must  be discharged. We are  prepared  to

discharge  our  duty  as  a Government.  Those  who

venture beyond the rules of the Civil Service  must

be prepared not just to be punished by loss



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>



of  increments or stagnations, but to  be  properly

and  suitably  dealt with in a way that  will  give

finality  to  the  man's  career.  This  is  not  a

Government that is going to stand by and watch  the

Civil Service turn on the political leadership.  We

play  fair by the Civil Service. I have seen  these

amendments  and  I know that some  members  of  the

public  service have not played fair.  And  believe

me,  Mr Speaker, let them think in good time.  Let

them consider whether in the long run this kind  of

conduct will invoke in the political leadership the

kind   of   loyalty   to  rules,  obligations   and

principles which we would otherwise extend to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst there may be no General Orders to ensure

adequate  punishment  for elected  Members  of  the

Opposition  who have aided and abetted them,  I  am

sure  we  have  an efficient State Advocate-General

who  will  be able to tell us under what provisions

of  the  Penal Code or the Minor Offences Ordinance

we can get Legislative Assemblymen.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Prime Minister

might punctuate that by saying that that was spoken

in  jest.  We  cannot  have  intimidation  of  hon.

Members of this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Far from being intimidated,

Sir,  you  can see that the Member for  Tanglin  is

extremely  joyful.  However,  I  would  say   this.

Intimidation  implies  the  unlawful  use  of   the

threat. I have no such intention whatsoever. All  I

was  intending  to  say is that the  law  shall  be

inexorably  carried out to its logical  conclusion.

Therefore, I submit that I did not intimidate and I

therefore  submit that whilst I will  withdraw  the

word  "intimidate",  I would tell  the  Member  for

Tanglin  that  if he embarks again  upon  any  such

cause and there is a tittle of evidence about it he

must  be prepared to face the consequences  of  the

law.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the Prime Minister is

forgetting that there is freedom of speech in  this

Assembly, and there cannot be any action  taken  in

respect  of any words spoken in this Assembly.  But

let   the  Prime  Minister  not  debate  with   the

Speaker - it  seems  to me that  that  was  quite  an

improper



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>



thing  to do, and I ask the Prime Minister  not  to

intimidate Members of the Opposition in the way  he

has done.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, I think we are

not  ad idem. I did not intend that the Member  for

Tanglin's  public confession made in  a  privileged

occasion should be used. When I was referring to  a

tittle  of  evidence, I meant evidence which  would

have  been  admissible in a kind of tribunal  which

brings  about  punishment  in  these  matters.  And

therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, it can hardly be  said

that I was intimidating the Member for Tanglin, but

nevertheless, since you have so ruled, for the sake

of  order, propriety and decorum in the proceedings

in this House, I shall withdraw it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is my view that it is improper

to utter words of that nature.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The difficulty with the Prime Minister

is  that  he gets so carried away by his own  words

that he sometimes forgets what he is saying. We had

in  this Assembly a former - not a Prime Minister - but

a  Chief  Minister who also allowed himself  to  be

carried away by his own words with the result  that

eventually  he carried himself out of  politics.  I

should hate to think that that would happen to  the

most  promising Prime Minister that South East Asia

has produced. However, Mr Speaker, Sir, it appears

that because I had filed a number of amendments  to

the personal emoluments list to extract information

already in the mind and on the lips of everybody in

Singapore  interested in the medical  service,  the

Prime Minister comes to the conclusion that someone

from the Medical Department must have come and seen

me   and  given  information  which  led  to  these

questions.  Really, really! Now, does he  not  give

some  consideration to the capacity of  Members  of

the  Opposition  to do these things  on  their  own

account? Does he think that we must always be spoon-fed?  Why does he suggest that I approached medical

officers in the service or they approached me to do

this?  Has he a guilty conscience? What did  he  do

when he was in the Opposition? Did he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>



subvert the civil servants? He did not, did he? Why

should  he  think  that I am subverting  the  civil

servants?  If the House wants an assurance,  I  can

give  it, now. No doctors saw me about this.  These

are  all  amendments from my own head. And  if  the

Prime  Minister thinks that my head is not  capable

of  it, let me assure him that this is not the last

time that I am going to file amendments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Member for Farrer Park

says  that  this is not the last time he will  file

amendments. As if we minded! I suggest to him  that

perhaps there might be the possibility of his being

consulted,  for  his  colleague,  the  Member   for

Tanglin,  did  so  admit  that  he  had   been   in

consultation  with officers of the public  service.

That  was  an  admission,  not  an  allegation.  My

allegation was made after his admission.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not fighting

the  battle for the Member for Tanglin. He can look

after  himself. But the Prime Minister accused  the

Member  for Farrer Park, and the Member for  Farrer

Park  is  not  the  Member for Tanglin,  Mr  Prime

Minister.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I am not called Mr Prime

Minister at the moment. Please address the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> If the Prime Minister can try and

intimidate the Opposition across the table with you

presiding here, Mr Speaker, Sir, what would happen

to the Opposition if there was not a Speaker, or if

we   went  outside  where  we  could  not  get  the

protection of the Speaker?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I thought I had settled that

point.  I  did indicate to the Prime Minister  that

the  utterances he had made should  not  have  been

made  in this Assembly, and I think he accepted  my

ruling.  I think the Member for Farrer Park  should

contain himself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I will so contain myself, Mr Speaker,

Sir. But it is a bit difficult sometimes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, we regret the

shortage  of doctors in this country. But  this  is

not  a  thing which this Government can  be  blamed

for. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>



shortage of doctors - and also the shortage of  other

professional  men - is  part  of  the  old   Colonial

system.  In running a Colony, the ruling power  had

to  build up an apparatus with which it could carry

out   its   policies  of  economic  and   political

exploitation. As such, it had a tendency  to  limit

the  entry of doctors into the medical service,  so

that  those in the medical profession, particularly

those in private practice, would make so much money

that  they  would cling on to the Colonial  system.

Mr  Speaker, we cannot hope, in the course of five

or   six  months  of  the  People's  Action   Party

Government,  to  remedy this state of  affairs.  We

know  that  a  great majority of  the  doctors  are

behind  the new Government. We know that there  are

some doctors who are not behind the Government, and

have  left  to  advance their careers  outside  the

Government service. We faced the same position when

we  were  in  the  City Council  when  the  doctors

quitted.  Other  professional men also  quitted  in

order  to advance themselves outside. But we  hope,

Mr  Speaker, that when colonialism is finally  got

rid  of  and  when  we have trained  more  doctors,

engineers and other professional men, the situation

can  be remedied. Today we are faced with the  same

situation   that  we  faced  when  the   expatriate

electrical  engineers  wanted  to  quit  the   City

Council.  When we went into the City  Council,  the

whole  of  the  Pasir  Panjang  Power  Station  was

controlled by expatriate electrical engineers,  and

there   was  not  one  local  qualified  electrical

engineer  in  the Pasir Panjang Power Station.  The

expatriates had the run of the place. We  were  not

willing  to  give the $14 million which the  Member

for  Farrer  Park wanted to give to them.  So  they

threatened to quit. Mr Speaker, we were left  with

no  choice,  but to try to engage a  few  engineers

either  from  Japan or from India  to  remedy  this

situation. In this instance, we can sympathise with

the position of the Minister for Health because not

long ago I was faced with the same position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, just now the Member for Farrer Park talked about the upper echelons of the medical

service   in   the   Government - the   shortage   of

specialists. If there is ever a shortage, who is to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>



blame?  It is the fault of the Colonial system  and

it  is also the fault of those who have abetted and

who  are  still abetting the Colonial system.  They

have never given our local people a chance to train

themselves in order to become specialists,  or,  as

in  the case of certain professions like engineers,

they  have  never  been given a  chance  to  secure

promotion  themselves. Not long ago, in  June  this

year, after the new Government came into office,  I

entered  the room of a very famous planner  in  the

S.I.T. just  as  a  spot-check.  I  found  a  girl

architect in his room occupying a seat in a  corner

of the room reading novels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if there is a shortage of doctors in Singapore, and if there is a shortage of

specialists  in  the  hospitals,  it  is  not   the

People's  Action Party Government which  is  to  be

blamed.  We are doing everything we can  to  remedy

the situation. The Colonial system and its henchmen

in this country are to blame.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Member

for  Tanglin  suggested  that  the  Government  was

dealing in a very high-handed manner with its local

employees and he asked the House to direct its mind

to  what  had happened to Mr Rajendra. I  think  I

should  follow  up on that and let the  House  know

what did happen to Mr Rajendra.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I remember about two weeks

before  he  was  charged, Mr  Rajendra  sought  an

interview  with me in my office and discussed  with

me  what his position would be in the civil service

if  he  championed  the cause of  the  local  civil

servants. I said to him that it was open to anybody

to   make   his  representations  to   the   proper

authorities in a proper manner, but that he  should

be  careful not to transgress the proper bounds  of

propriety.  I reminded him of my own case.  I  told

him   that  when  we  were  fighting  the  Colonial

authorities here, I got into trouble because I  had

spoken  the  truth. Amongst the things that  I  had

said,  which were considered to be highly  improper

during the Ritson negotiations, was that I did  not

consider that there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>



were  expatriate officers in the civil service then

who   were  capable  of  implementing  the   Ritson

recommendations. I had very many meetings with  the

Governor  over that statement of mine. I  told  him

that that statement was not in any way critical  of

the   Government.  It  was  critical  of   my   own

colleagues - my    expatriate    colleagues.     But,

nevertheless,  it was held that the  statement  was

improper and I was duly censured for it, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rajendra said that he felt it was his mission to champion the cause of the civil servants. He

said  that  he  was troubled by his young  son  and

daughter who were always looking at the papers  and

saying,  "Mama, Papa would be getting into  trouble

for  all this." But nevertheless he felt it was his

duty  to  go  ahead. The next thing  I  saw  was  a

statement attributed to him in the papers.  In  due

course, the Government file came into my hands  and

I  found  that the Prime Minister was  seeking  the

advice of the State Advocate-General on the correct

course  of action to be taken with regard  to  this

matter.  Amongst my other duties, as  the  Minister

for  Law, is my duty to deal with actions that  the

Government  proposes to take  in  regard  to  legal

matters.   These  are  always  sent   to   me   for

consideration  after they have been  considered  by

the  State Advocate-General. It was decided that  a

disciplinary  committee should be set  up  to  look

into   the   statements  of   Mr   Rajendra.   The

disciplinary committee was set up. I took a hand in

the  appointment of that committee. I had seen  the

papers and I knew that Mr Rajendra had maliciously

intended  a personal affront to the Prime Minister.

He  had  seen me and had actually suggested  to  me

that he was determined to do this. Well, I did  not

interfere   in  that  matter.  It  was  within   my

competence  to  go  before the  tribunal  and  give

evidence.  My  evidence would have shown  that  his

statement  was  inspired by malice and  would  have

really prejudiced his defence. I did nothing of the

sort.  We  played fair by him. He made his  defence

and he was found guilty by the tribunal.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I am mentioning all this to the House to

show  that  we are not unreasonable with our  civil

servants. I quite appreciate their difficulties  in

the  new  situation. I have been  a  civil  servant

myself  and have been closely associated with  many

of them for very many years. I have found that many

of them find it very difficult to adjust themselves

to the present situation. I have senior officers in

my  Ministry  who have come up to me  a  number  of

times  and have tendered their written resignations

to  me.  I  have  asked  them to  reconsider  their

action.  I  have torn their letters up,  because  I

know  the difficult times that we are going through

and  it  will take some time before they  can  make

their  adjustments to the new situation. We do  not

in  any way harass them. We are trying our best  to

help them to come along with us in the tasks ahead.

But we must be quite sure about their attitude.  If

we  find that it is not a question of their finding

it  difficult  to make these adjustments-that  they

are out to try and frustrate what we are trying  to

do  for  the people of Singapore (all of us on  the

Government  benches  have made sacrifices  for  the

things that we believe in), if we find that  it  is

something   different   which   is   behind   their

reluctance  to assist the Government in the  things

that  we  are trying to do, then our whole attitude

will  have to be reconsidered. But I hope  that  it

will  never  be  necessary for  us  to  reach  that

decision, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $35,246,030 for Head 21 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 22 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

Thio Chan Bee:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 22 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item (3) of sub-head

1.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since an

item  of a similar nature has been discussed  fully

previously, I beg leave to withdraw this notice  of

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member is not moving.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 22 be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (4) of  sub-head 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I find from reading this budget that it is

the intention of the Minister to create certain new

posts  for  this new Economic Development Division.

There  is  already an Industrial Development  Board

with  a  director,  and  the Minister  has  already

stated  that  he  is  seeking  the  recruitment  of

experts  from  overseas to  help  in  running  this

Industrial Development Board. I fail to  see,  Sir,

why  a  Permanent Secretary is necessary  for  this

particular  division. An Assistant  Secretary,  for

whom  a new post is also to be created, could  take

charge of this division under the direction of  the

Permanent  Secretary in the Treasury division.  The

Minister, Sir, may have abolished one or two  other

Permanent Secretaries in his Ministry and  this  is

just  a  change of name. That I do not know.  I  am

seeking information.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the actual

position  is  that I will be having next  year  one

Permanent  Secretary  less and  not  one  Permanent

Secretary more. The post referred to is a new  post

only  in  a  technical  sense.  There  will  be  no

increase  in bodies because the present  holder  of

the  post is already there. It is really a renaming

of  the  post and it is necessary to create  a  new

post because the old post against which he was held

has been abolished in the Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, in the light of the

explanation, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 22 be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (65) of sub-head

1.*



<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The same amendment also stood in the name of

Mr Thio Chan Bee.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head of Political Study Centre, Grade P2, new

post." Mr Speaker, Sir, I was under the impression

that  the  post  was already in  existence  as  the

Political  Study Centre had already  been  created;

possibly the Centre has a head for this already.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I raise this question to

find out whether this gentleman has been appointed,

and  if so, what his qualifications and duties are,

whether  he  is a member of the civil service,  and

whether the course he proposes to teach is  on  the

side of any particular Party or above Parties?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> First, Mr Speaker, the Member

for Farrer Park. He has rightly observed that it is

a  new post only in a technical sense, because  the

Political  Centre  has been in operation  for  some

time.  It is necessary to create this post  because

the  officer  who  is  doing  the  work  holds  the

position of Director of Information Services  which

has   just   been   abolished  in  the   Estimates.

Therefore, there again, there is no extra  officer.

It  is  a matter of getting an officer who is doing

one job and transferring him to a new function.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, for the Member for Tanglin. Obviously, he

has  not  listened to the broadcast of the Ministry

of  Finance  on its work, which was put over  Radio

Malaya during Loyalty Week.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Radio Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Radio Singapore. The Member

for  Tanglin always suspects the worst. And  indeed

it  may  be a good thing if he could be sent  on  a

course of training at the Centre. I can assure  you

that  the training given is being carried out under

the  direction of a civil servant. It is completely

impartial.  As we explained in the radio broadcast,

we  are  not  attempting  to  brainwash  the  civil

service  or ask them to subscribe to our  ideology,

because  we  rate  the intelligence  of  the  civil

service  high enough to know that such a course  of

action would be foolish and futile.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was the other point? Mr Speaker, may I be-



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps the Member would ask the

question  again if the Minister will  sit  down.  I

suggest the Minister has pencil and paper ready.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the purpose

of  this question is to elicit information.  Unless

information is supplied, how can people-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes. But the Minister is willing to

give the information.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, the Minister imputed a

motive  to me, that I am always suspicious  of  the

other  side.  If  the Opposition has  no  right  to

elicit  information,  then  there  should   be   no

Opposition. Sir, the question asked of the  Finance

Minister  was what are the qualifications  of  this

particular  holder  of  the office - the  information

that  he is a member of the civil service has  been

given.  What are his duties and whether the  course

is on a non-party basis?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I have answered two of the

questions.  As regards the third one - what  are  his

qualifications - the answer is that he is  extremely

well-qualified, holding a degree in social  science

and  having lectured at the University of Liverpool

at  one time on this kind of subject. That is  all,

is it not?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Thio, have your questions been

answered fully?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of

the information supplied, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it the pleasure of hon. Members

that the amendment be withdrawn?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Oh, it is Mr Rajah's amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I am also involved, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes. It is the Member for Farrer

Park's amendment, and not the Member for Tanglin's.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It is both our amendments. Sir, my

colleague, the Member for Cairnhill, whispers to me

that it is Mr

G.  G.  Thomson who is the holder of this post.  If

that  is  the  case, then the other two  amendments

which I have put down, will not be put by me. May I

have  leave to withdraw, in view of the explanation

given by the Finance Minister?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendments stood in the name of Mr

A. P. Rajah:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 22 be

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note:-The two amendments are identical.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I filed this amendment in order to get

information from the Minister as to how it is  that

the  vote  proposed for 1960 is, I  think,  $70,000

more  than the provision for the 1959 budget.  Sir,

there  are  less and less expatriate  officers  and

surely the vote should have been much less, unless,

of  course,  under  this vote, there  are  passages

incurred as a result of scholarships.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The same points were in my mind when I

filed the amendment. I do not wish to add anything

further.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It is true that there is an

increase of $70,000 for 1960 as compared with 1959.

It is estimated that 84 expatriate officers will be

proceeding  on leave prior to retirement  in  1959,

and a major portion of the expenditure incurred  by

these  84  officers,  and  by  officers  going   on

vacation  leave in 1959, is likely to be made  from

the 1960 vote because of delays in submitting bills

by  the booking companies and Crown Agents. A total

of $600,000 is likely to be incurred this year. The

balance of $5 30.000 is required in 1960. But since

there is an O.C.A.R. vote, the sum is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>



not revoted but is shown as a new provision. It is,

however,  quite true that if we take  a  review  of

this  vote  over the last several years, there  has

been  a  steady declining trend. For instance,  the

expenditure of $1.8 million in 1956 went up to $1.9

million in 1957, went down to $1.3 million in  1958

and for 1960 it is just over $1.1 million.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, in view of the

explanation, I now beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 22 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 46.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sub-head 46 has as its title, "Scholarships,

Courses  and Fellowships". Below that,  Sir,  under

establishment there are a number of items which may

be   shifted  to  the  Treasury  Division,  namely,

Chinese  Aided  Schools  Scholarships  and  English

Aided  Schools Scholarships. Sir, after a  year  or

two,  these  two  items will disappear  completely.

What  we are afraid of is that we might go back  to

the position some five or seven years back when  we

had a head of the Education Department who regarded

Government  schools and the children in  Government

schools  as his concern and those not in Government

schools  as not under his care. The main  complaint

before  was about this kind of Cinderella treatment

which has been one of the causes of dissatisfaction

especially among the Chinese-aided schools. We were

given to understand, however, Sir, that in view  of

the  fact that Government money comes from the tax-payers of Singapore, there should not be this  kind

of   discrimination   of   treating   children   in

Government  schools  as  Government  children,  and

children  in  non-Government schools as  not  being

Government children. So it was decided to have some

kind of allocation so that some scholarships should

go  to  the aided English schools and some  to  the

aided  Chinese  schools.  Now,  if  this  were   to

disappear  completely - unless there is an  assurance

that  it  will not - it could well be that in  future

somebody might interpret that all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>



these   scholarships,   courses   and   fellowships

incurring  Government  money  should  only  be  for

Government  organisations. I  hope,  Sir,  that  an

assurance will be given so that we will not go back

to  that  kind  of discriminatory policy  and  that

these scholarships, courses and fellowships will be

available  to  all who deserve them, regardless  of

whether  they  are in Government or  non-Government

organisations.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, the item on

assistance to aided schools - that has been  deleted

from this sub-head, and provision of assistance for

aided schools has quite rightly been transferred to

the  Ministry of Education. The Member for  Tanglin

raises   the  larger  issue  of  scholarships   and

fellowships, and I was not quite clear in  my  mind

what  sort of assurance he was seeking. But  I  can

assure him that the money will be spent to the best

purpose.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I see

here, under Establishment, there is a bracket which

says,  "Now shown under Treasury Division". Looking

up  that section under Treasury Division, I  notice

that  (46)  is  the  item. It  says  "Scholarships,

Courses  and Fellowships". Naturally I took  it  to

mean  that  they have all been included  under  one

general  item. Therefore, the separate identity  of

scholarships  would then be lost and, subsequently,

in other budgets it would never be included.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Has the Minister lost his pencil

again?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I did not quite follow what

the  Member for Tanglin was driving at.  But  there

are  two  matters.  One  is  that  scholarship  and

fellowship  courses have been going  on  for  quite

some  time  and consist really of sending  doctors,

civil servants and so on abroad. That kind of  item

comes  under  this vote. The other matter  concerns

the  aided schools. That is quite a separate issue.

It  is  now the responsibility of the Minister  for

Education.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in that

case, I will raise it when we come to Education.  I

beg leave to withdraw the notice.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Of course, that will only be

possible  if  the  Member has given  notice  of  an

amendment on the appropriate item. He obviously has

not found it at the moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 22 be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (1) of  sub-head 58.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-head 58 is "Singapore Industrial Promotion

Board - Temporary Staff". The point I wish to  raise,

Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  is  in  connection  with  the

Confidential Stenographer who in the year 1959  was

paid  $7,800, but whose salary is now being  raised

from  $7,800  to  $11,700, - quite a  rise,  however

confidential  the  stenographer  may  be.  I   have

searched  throughout the budget  for  the  salaries

which are being paid to-
