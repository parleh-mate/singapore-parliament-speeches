<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the land is about one-third of an acre and it is estimated to

whether and when electricity will be supplied from 9 milestone

Punggol Road to Punggol Point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I answer on behalf of my Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the hon. Member please resume his seat?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> The Urban and Rural Services Consultative

Committee has drawn up a scheme for the supply of electricity by

the Public Utilities Board to the whole of Punggol area. The

scheme covers the following areas:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorong Buang Kok

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kampong Sungei Tengah

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jalan Kampong Tengah

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kampong Serangoon Kechil, and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Punggol Road, 9¾ m.s. to seafront.



<br><br>Some of these areas have already been supplied with

electricity. The stretch of Punggol Road from 9¾ m.s. to the

sea-front will be supplied with electricity as soon as the

sub-station in constructed. Action has already been taken by the

Public Utilities Board to acquire the site for the sub-station

and when construction is completed, electricity mains will be

laid and advertised to supply electricity to houses wanting to

have connections.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> What is the total cost of this

electrification scheme and is there any subsidy granted by the

Government?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> The total cost of this scheme will be

$272,190. The revenue over a period of seven years from the

areas benefitting is estimated to be about $255,484 and a

subsidy of

$16,000, or $42 per house, has been paid by the Government to

enable the scheme to be implemented.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b> asked the Minister for National

Development when will electricity be supplied to the areas

around 11 milestone Yio Chu Kang Road.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Electricity

supplies can be made available in the areas around 11 milestone Yio Chu Kang

Road as soon as a sub-station is constructed, equipped, and commissioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A site was previously allocated for a sub-station, but due

to objections from the Toa Mong Public School authorities, it is

now necessary to negotiate for an alternative site.

<div align="center"><b>LORONG BUANG KOK</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for National

Development when will Lorong Buang Kok, which is a link to Yio

Chu Kang Road, be widened and metalled.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Lorong Buang Kok is about two miles long. The cost of widening and metalling this road will be

very high and there are more urgent claims to the limited funds

available for such development. In view of this high cost, the

Urban and Rural Services Consultative Committee has deferred the

proposal to metal this road which has, however, been made up to

agricultural road standards.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Will the Parliamentary Secretary to the

Minister for National Development consider metalling this track,

Lorong Buang Kok, by sections?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> I have the pleasure to inform the hon.

Member that part of Lorong Buang Kok has been approved for

metalling. This is at the junction of Punggol Road and Lorong

Buang Kok, the section leading to the Soo Teck Chinese School.

<div align="center"><b>REPAIR OF AGRICULTURAL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>ROADS AT 9½ AND 11 M.S.</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>YIO CHU KANG ROAD</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b> asked the Minister for National

Development when will the following unmetalled agricultural

roads be repaired: (a) two of the four roads linking Boh Sua

Tian Road at 9½ milestone Yio Chu Kang Road to Sungei Seletar

Fishing Village; (b) Track 23 between 9½ milestone Yio Chu Kang

Road and Cheng San Road; (c) upper Tong Lee Road between Jalan

Kayu and Boh Sua Tian Road; and (d) Track 22 at 11 milestone Yio

Chu Kang Road.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon (for the Minister for National Development):</b> The

answer to (a) - one proposal for the making up of one track from

Boh Sua Tian resettlement area leading to Sungei Seletar has been

received by the Urban and Rural Services Consultative Committee from

the members of the Citizens Consultative Committee of the area, while

another proposal for the making up of Boh Sua Tian Road leading to

the seaside Malay kampong has been received by the Prime Minister during his

recent tour of the area. Both these proposals are being

considered by the Urban and Rural Services Consultative Com

mittee and, if approved, construction work will commence within

the next few months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to (b) - a proposal for the making up of Track 23 between 9½ milestone Yio Chu Kang Road and Cheng San Road has

been received from the people of the area. It has been deferred

by the Urban and Rural Services Consultative Committee on

account of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>



the high cost. This track is a long one and the area is not

sufficiently developed to justify the expense involved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to (c) - the repair of this road is not on the

priority list for repair of agricultural roads and no request

has been received so far for this repair. The Work Brigade will,

however, be asked to look into the possibility of repairing this

road prior to consideration by the Urban and Rural Services

Consultative Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to (d) - a proposal to make up Track 22 at 11

milestone Yio Chu Kang Road using quarry weights will be

considered by the Urban and Rural Services Committee and, if

approved, construction work will commence within the next few

months.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): On (c), I would like

to put a supplementary question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary has just now said that nobody has made any

application to repair this road, but I would like to point out to him

that when I was in the P.A.P. I had already mentioned it, and especially

when the Prime Minister was touring that area.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member cannot make a speech, but he

can ask a supplementary question arising out of the answer. Mr

Tan Cheng Tong, Question No. 7.

Development whether the Government has any plan to build in the

rural areas more bus-stop shelters at places where there are no

shops or houses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yes, we have plans to

build in rural areas more bus-stops and bus-shelters, and

whenever requests are received from the public, they are

examined and, if approved by the Urban and Rural Services

Consultative Committee, bus-shelters are then erected by the

Public Works Department. It is the normal practice to give

favourable consideration to requests for bus-shelters in places



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>



where there are no shops or houses. Construction of such

bus-shelters is, however, subject to the availability of funds.

these families did not receive compensation from the Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, four families altogether

are affected by the building of the proposed Home for the Aged

in Woodlands. All of them will be paid compensation in accord

ance with the schedule of approved rates. Assessments of

compensation have just been completed and payment of

compensation will be made in the near future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I have a

supplementary question. Of the four families affected, one has

complained to me that there has been no compensation received.

Can the Minister explain?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have just said that

assessments of compensation are just being made. I believe the

hon. Member has asked me whether I am aware that one of the

families affected has not received compensation. None of them

has received compensation. Assessments of compensation are being

made, and when the time comes, they will be paid compensation.

Housing and Development Board adjacent to the school and clinic

in Bukit Ho Swee Estate. This children's playground of about

three-quarters of an acre in area is equipped with swings,

seesaws, a paddling pool, a climbing tower, concrete

play-blocks, etc. Two additional children's playgrounds are being

constructed in the Nile Road and Beo Crescent Estates adjacent

to Bukit Ho Swee. These two playgrounds will be completed in

about a month's time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, there is at least one children's playground

provided in every large housing estate in addition to other

social amenities, such as badminton courts, community centres,

etc. Wherever necessary, additional children's playgrounds will

be provided in new estates.

<div align="center"><b>(1-6-64 - 30-9-64)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b> asked the Minister for Social Affairs

between 1st June, 1964, and 30th September, 1964, (a) how many

of the people who were in receipt of public assistance had had

their assistance stopped; (b) how many had had their assistance

reduced; and (c) what was the total amount involved in each

case.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, because of the increasing

expenditure on public assistance and of reports received that a

large number of public assistance recipients had not been reporting

on their true family circumstances and were thus continuing to draw

public assistance although they were, in fact, not eligible, it was

decided early this year to conduct a systematic review of all public

assistance cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 1st June, 1964, and 30th September, 1964, a total

of 5,982 public assistance cases were reviewed and, as a result,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) 1,112 cases had their public assistance payments stopped;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) 1,285 cases had their public assistance payments reduced;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the total amount involved for the said period in

respect of (a) was $45,030, and in respect of (b), $19,977.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be pointed out that out of a total of 5,982 cases

reviewed during the period in question 3,585 cases (i.e, about

60 per cent) were not affected in any way. Of the 2,397 cases

affected, a total of 315 cases involving $4,191 had their public

assistance restored or increased as a result of appeals made by

them and further investigation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also like to add that the annual expenditure on

public assistance has been steadily rising from year to year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have available the figures of public assistance for the

period 1952 to 1963. The figures are of inordinate length, and

with your permission, Sir, they will be circulated in the

Official Report.

<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Question [2nd

November, 1964], "That the Assembly approves the financial

policy of the Government for the year 1965.". - [The Minister

for Finance]

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> For the convenience of Members, I wish to make

one or two observations so that the debate might be assisted and

proceed without much difficulty. I should like to inform Members

that they will confine their debate to the general principles of

Government policy and administration as set forth by the

Minister for Finance in moving the motion and as indicated in

the main Estimates. Any detailed discussion of the Estimates

will take place tomorrow and the day after that. Today, Members

will please confine themselves to the general principles of

Government policy and administration. For the benefit of the

Members of the Opposition, I draw their attention to Standing

Order No. 82, paragraph (4) which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Thirty minutes before the end of the time permitted on the

allotted day, the Speaker shall, if the debate shall not

previously have been concluded, call upon the Minister who moved

the motion to reply.'



<br><br>So Members of the Opposition will so adjust their speeches that

they will give the Floor to the Minister for Finance at 7.30

p.m.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, the Minister for Finance has already given his Budget

Statement in this House. No matter how much stress he has laid

upon economy, the fact is that his Budget Statement is

invariably made in accordance with the desire of the Party in

power to deal with the present situation. This is a point known

to anybody who has some common sense in politics. This statement

is used as a means of publicity whereby those things in which

the Government can take pride are highlighted in the speech.

Those things that are annoying or are not so glorious will be

mentioned less and less, or even not mentioned at all.

Therefore, in the past, such talk about the increase in the

national income, the rate of progress, prosperity and so on, has

taken up a lot of space in the speech of the Minister for

Finance. But the statement this year shows that his tone is

beginning to change. Although he has made a great effort to say

that there is still economic stability in the State, he has to

admit, whether he likes it or not, that the P.A.P. Government

has to meet for the first time a deficit. The so-called $15

million surplus is no longer in existence. It is time for the

Government, as it says, to think carefully.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, those who have talked so well of Malaysia have

tried their best to describe it as a small New York; that

Malaysia is successful and so on. Just as a mirror reflects the

true image of things, let us look at the facts. There is a great

deal of misery among the people. It is impossible for the Party

in power to cover up the ugly facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I now wish to talk about the effects of

confrontation on our economy. Singapore has all along depended

on the entrepot trade economically. As a result of the

Indonesian confrontation, there are great repercussions,

according to the Minister himself. The Indonesian confrontation

is, however, not 100 per cent successful. There are still a lot

of raw materials coming from a third country into Singapore.

That accounts for the not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>



so great decline in our trade. The so-called not 100 per cent

successful confrontation, in spite of what the Minister says,

has brought great losses in our trade. According to his figures.

for the first half-year, there was a decline of 31 per cent in

our export trade. In respect of imports, the decline was 23 per

cent. In the meantime, about 4,000 people are out of job. The

Minister has also said that the increase in banking and building

construction activities has, to some extent, reduced the effect

of Indonesian confrontation. We do not wish to over-estimate the

effects of the Indonesian confrontation. But we have to face it

all the same.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance, in spite of what he says, has not

been able to sketch to us the full extent of the Indonesian

confrontation affecting our economy. I will tell him that

directly or indirectly the effect of it is very great on the

trade and livelihood of the people. Under normal circumstances,

trade should increase instead of decrease. But now the fact is

that our trade is on the decline. The Minister tries to say that

the decline is only to the extent of 23 per cent in respect of

imports and 31 per cent in respect of exports. He says that only

about 4,000 persons are out of job as a result of confrontation,

but this figure only includes those directly affected by the

confrontation. This figure does not include those who have been

indirectly affected. The Minister should know that, at the

present moment, shops at large have not been doing so well in

their business. Hawkers and retailers are suffering from a trade

recession. Their income has decreased considerably. Why is it

that the Minister has made no mention of these facts? He himself

says that there are some trades which have been affected by

confrontation, such as the entertainment business and so on. If

the people have to worry about their meals, do you think they

can afford to worry about entertainment? At night the shops in

the amusement parks are not doing any business at all. So

under-employment and under-nutrition have put a lot of poor people and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>



small traders in difficulties. So faced with the difficulties

and disasters brought about by the Indonesian confrontation, it

is useless to try to put the blame of our failure on Indonesia

and try to find a scapegoat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pro-Malaysian Parties are duty bound to solve these

problems. Before the problem of Malaysia is solved politically,

the Government should find ways and means to assist the

lightermen and others who are directly or indirectly affected by

this stoppage of barter trade and other trades. Those

businessmen engaged in the barter trade should be given

assistance. But the Government has not tried to shoulder part of

the responsibility. At the present moment, it is trying to

depend too much on the building construction trade to try to

cancel off some of the effects of confrontation. But there will

come a time when the building construction trade will reach

saturation point: then there will be thousands of workers

engaged in this trade who will be thrown out of work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important point is that our present economic

difficulties should be solved basically. The economic solution

is closely connected with the political solution of the

Malaysian dispute. Without the support and sympathy of the

Afro-Asian countries, and without the sustained support of the

people, Malaysia will not be able to stay in existence for a

long time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I wish to go on to the question of

industrialisation and the common market. The P.A.P. Government

at present is attaching great importance to the success of

industrialisation in order to try to solve the mounting

unemployment problem, and to make use of industrialisation as a

means to console the people who are directly or indirectly

affected and afflicted by Indonesian confrontation. At the

present moment, the 47 factories which are said to have gone

into production are able to employ some 2,000 workers. Even when

they go into full production, the maximum number of workers

employed will be only about 6,600. During the five years of its

rule, the P.A.P. Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>



has been talking about industrialisation. The Minister

for Finance has given great publicity to the opening of

factories from time to time. But, in spite of all the great show

put up, the employment opportunities created by this grand

opening amount to only 4,000. This is only a small percentage of

the unemployed people. According to the Minister himself, there

are about 30,000 youths coming into the labour market every

year. Up to the present moment, there are at least thousands and

thousands of youths unemployed. If you add to this figure those

who have become unemployed after confrontation, then the figure

is far too great to be solved. The Minister has not told us of

the contribution made by the new industries to our national

income, whether they are able to cancel off the loss of 8.7 per

cent of the national income brought about by confrontation, and

whether they are able to maintain only

- and not to increase, I stress - the present national income.

On the other hand, the financial powers have largely been

transferred to the Central Government. Even the approval for

certificates of pioneer status is controlled by the Central

Government. The Federation itself is also faced with the problem

of unemployment. It has also got to find a way to solve it. So

do you think the Federation Government will grant pioneer status

to Singapore industrialists? I would like to ask: after

Malaysia, how many factories in Singapore have been awarded

pioneer status by the Federation Government? Under these

circumstances, Mr Speaker, how can you expect a lot of

employment opportunities to be created?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present investment in industries has been taken up

mainly by foreign capital - British, American and Japanese.

These countries have invested considerabl7 in our industries.

They have made large profits too. I do not know whether the

Government has taken any steps to make sure that the profits de

rived from local industrialisation will be ploughed back into

further investment in our own country and not sent out. If you

allow foreign capitalists to invest by means of their worn-out

machinery



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>



in conjunction with local capital, derived from the hard-earned

efforts of our own people, thereby resulting in a great flow of

capital outwards, then can you say that foreign capital

investment is of advantage to us'? The P.A.P. Government is

always good at propaganda and showing oft. If in these problems

the Government is only good at showing off, and nothing more

than that, then I will say that our economic future is rather

bleak. We try to attract foreign capital to our local

industrialisation. We go to foreign capitalists for loans at

interest. But, on the other hand, we invest our own money, to

the extent of some $300 million or more, in foreign countries,

much to their benefit. I suggest that the P.A.P. Government

would do better to invest such funds in our own industries. It

hopes that by the establishment of the common market, local

industry can be developed. There is a list declared of 101 items

of goods to be included in the common market. But has the Gov

ernment noticed that various measures, particularly in the field

of tariff, have been formulated under pressure of foreign

monopolists and capitalists? These measures will invariably lead

to a rise in the price of consumer goods. So in the public

interest, I would say that the common market is a means by which

foreign capitalists and monopolists try to strengthen their own

position in Singapore. The success of such industrialisation

will only lead to a higher cost of living within the next three

to five years. People will suffer all the more. I must also

point out here that the interests of the workers should not be

sacrificed to those of the foreign capitalists. The so-called

collective bargaining is carried out in favour of the

capitalists. So foreign capitalists will be able to exploit with

ease the workers of our own country and make more profits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now go on to the question of the budget deficit.

According to the Estimates, there appears for the first time a

deficit in Singapore to the extent of $20 million. According to

the Minister himself, this is because of increasing expenditure

in the first place; and, in the second place, the necessity to

pay to the Central Government to meet the cost



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>



of public services and national defence. No matter under what

circumstances the deficit has come about, and whatever economic

activities are carried out to sustain public services, it is a

waste of public funds to build things such as the National

Theatre, swimming pools and playgrounds. People are not able to

clothe and feed themselves. So how can we expect them to stroll

in the parks'? It is a waste of money to build houses if people

are not able to live in them. Many houses built by the Housing

and Development Board have been left vacant. It is not that the

people do not want to live in such houses, but because of the

increased expenditure. To the lower income group, this increased

expenditure is beyond their means.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year, because of Malaysia's arrangements, Singapore

has to contribute 40 per cent of its revenue to the Central

Government, amounting to $120 million. On the other hand, we

have to lend about $30 million to North Borneo, thus resulting

in a deficit. This sum of money is not going to be used on

social welfare for the people of Malaya but on defence. Even on

the loan to North Borneo, the Minister has said that the

Government will not just hand out this sum of money. But up to

now, how many workers have been recruited from Singapore by the

Borneo Government? Therefore, the Minister will be quite foolish

to give the loan. The main sources of revenue, such as income

tax, customs, duty on tobacco and petrol and road tax, are all

State revenue. If there is any change in the rates of duty,

Singapore will be affected directly because of the Alliance

Government's military expansion. The Federation Government's

reserve funds have gone down. Therefore, they may increase the

rate of taxation, and the burden on the Singapore people will be

increased accordingly. Not only has Malaysia brought about

unemployment, but because of the continuation of the war in

North Borneo, the people in Singapore have to meet the rising

cost of living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of facts and events after the formation of

Malaysia have exploded the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>



lies of the Party in power. The people of Singapore are no more

subject to any illusion about the great success or the

prosperity of Malaysia. Their immediate problem is to consider

ways and means of how to secede from Malaysia and to overcome

the distress that they are experiencing at present.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. This is a debate on the Government's

financial policy and not on political problems connected with

Malaysia. The Member may touch on them if they affect the

financial situation; but he should not make too much of a point

about them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I was just summing up my

arguments. Because the P.A.P. is intoxicated with power and

relies on foreign capital and aid in order to sustain Malaysia,

the Prime Minister has said that without Malaysia, Singapore

cannot suvive. The Minister for Finance has also threatened the

business community in Singapore by saying that as soon as

Singapore secedes from Malaysia, it will fall into the hands of

the Communists. All these statements will not be of any avail.

What the P.A.P. are concerned with is how to solve their

immediate problems. No matter how they carry out their

propaganda warfare, how the Prime Minister has played with power

and tried to deceive the people, and how the Minister for

Finance has threatened by exerting pressure on small businessmen

in order to make them loyal to Malaysia, all this will not be

able to solve their problems. Singapore businessmen, who are

worldly wise, and the masses of the people have realised that

the only correct policy is neutrality and that they should have

equality and democracy internally. It is better to be like that

than to have a Malaysia which is rotten and spurned by the other

Afro-Asian countries.



<br><br>3.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Legislative

Assembly is being asked by the P.A.P. Government to approve its

financial policy for 1965. Sir, what financial policy are we

asked to approve? Since Malaysia Day on 16th September, 1963,

the Singapore State Government has no more control



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>



over Singapore's financial policy. Page 6 of the White Paper

clearly states that the financial policy is now under the

control of the Federal Government. Page 5 of the White Paper

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In framing the State Budget, due consideration will be

given to the prevailing financial policy of the Federal

Government.'



<br><br>Again, "for budgetary purposes, all housekeeping matters will be

left to the State Government". Page 5 of the White Paper says

that "the Federal Government will retain legislative authority

over all taxes of a national character." Page 5 of the White

Paper says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Control over monetary policy rests with the Federal

Government.'



<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, all these powers are the same powers that the

Federal Government has over all the other States of Malaysia.

Singapore has no financial autonomy. The Singapore Government

has no control whatsoever over Singapore's financial policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Federal Government now has complete control over

Singapore's financial policy. There is no more Currency Board on

which Singapore is a member. The Federal Government will soon

have complete control over Singapore's banks when it amends, at

the end of the year, its Banking Ordinance to apply to Singa

pore. At present, control over Singapore's banks is exercised

through a branch of the Bank Negara in Empress Place. It is only

the Federal Government that can amend the income tax laws and

vary the rates of income tax or customs duties in Singapore. The

Federal Government has control over most of the important powers

of taxation and the collection of fees in Singapore. The

Pan-Malaysian financial policy, the monetary policy, the industrial

policy, determined by the Federal Government, will be applicable

to all the States of Malaysia, including Singapore. The State of

Singapore cannot affect this overall Malaysian financial policy;

similarly neither Kelantan nor Sarawak can do so. The supreme

power over finance in Singapore is held by the Federal Cabinet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as the White Paper has stated, the

Singapore State Government is merely a housekeeper. At the end

of each year the housekeeper will make out his estimates of

income and expenses for the coming year. Only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>



the Federal Minister for Finance, Mr Tan Siew Sin, can decide

the financial policy of the 15 States of Malaysia. He will tell

us what his financial policy is that is applicable to the whole

of Malaysia, which includes Singapore, in the Federal Parliament

some time next month. Now, the Singapore Government is being

allotted $339 million for 1965 for Singapore's housekeeping. The

Singapore Government is required to pay out from this amount for

the maintenance of schools, hospitals, social services, and so

on. The Singapore Government has found out that it is not enough

to meet the necessary expenses. There will be a deficit, I

believe for the first time, in Singapore's history. But

fortunately for the moment, Singapore has some money invested

safely since Sir Stamford Raffles' time - just to meet

contingencies like this. But how long can these grandfather's

property and savings last?

It is difficult to say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, actually what the Assembly is

asked to approve is the 1965 Budget of the Singapore State Government.

The difference between budget and financial policy is this: bud

get is like furniture, financial policy is like a house. A

budget can be a part of a government's financial policy, like

furniture in a house. But a house cannot be inside the

furniture! Mr Speaker, Singapore's income is now almost fixed.

The Singapore Government has no way of increasing its income

either by in-creasing taxes or by borrowing. The Singapore

Government can only make use of its grandfather's savings. The

Assembly can study and debate the expenditure for 1965 - only

the expenditure - recommended by the housekeeper who is

Singapore's Minister for Finance. The position is this: if we

had more meat, we would have less fish. If we wanted more fish,

we would have to take less meat. As a matter of fact, it is not

even as good as that. We are now forced to cut down on both meat

and fish, for although Singapore's population has increased by

about 60,000 a year, the money allotted for Singapore has

decreased. Not only has Singapore no say or control over its own

financial policy, but the Federal Government will make an

estimated $65 million profit from Singapore residents. And this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>



amount will increase year by year - $65 million profit a year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is important for us to bring home to the people of

Singapore the limitations of the powers of the Singapore State

Legislative Assembly and consequently of the powers of the Singapore

State Government. The Singapore State Government has about

the same powers of a Town Council in the United Kingdom or in

the United States. The present Singapore State Government has

only 25 per cent of the powers of the Lim Yew Hock Government in

1955, or 10 per cent of the P.A.P. Government in 1959. This

power will be reduced to 8 per cent if the Federal Government

sets up Peace Committees to replace the Goodwill Committees.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Hong Lim is going a little

too fast, not for those who understand English but for those who

are trying to interpret his speech. So if he will reduce his

speed, perhaps we could get on faster.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you very much, but

this is because of the new Standing Orders which give a Member

only one hour!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this power will be further reduced to 5 per cent if the

Federal Government later decides to abolish the Work Brigade and

community centres, by ruling them out as para-military outfits.

By then the Singapore State Government will not even be as

strong as the P.M.I.P. Kelantan State Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1965 Budget reflects the extent of the powers of the

Singapore State Government. The Minister for Finance himself had

to admit that we are entering a difficult era. The New York of

Malaysia is not Singapore. The New York of Malaysia is Kuala

Lumpur. The golden goose of Malaysia will not lay golden eggs in

Singapore, but in Petaling Jaya or even in Prai. We must not

deceive the people that there will be golden opportunities

ahead, opportunities which will never come. By the end of the

year more shops will be closed down. The Singapore River is now

choked with idlewearing, wasting tongkangs. Business is now

almost at a standstill. Singapore is almost a dead city, with

only three years



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>



and eight months of Japanese occupation to outdo it. It is vital

that the people fully realise the situation and be appraised of

their own personal future in the new setting before they sink

lower and lower. Many shops have incurred more debts, hoping the

situation would improve. This is because of the talk of 8 per

cent loss. Last year, at this time, the only activities left

were buildings and the share market. Now, even these two

activities have stopped. Many houses have been built because the

plans for them had been approved, in the belief that we would be

the New York of Malaysia. But these houses have now no buyers.

The average customer's deposit in the banks is running down, and

the people's savings are now depleted. The future is bleak and

stormy. Everybody is saying that the New York of Malaysia will

be in the heart-land of Malaysia, which is Kuala Lumpur, where

real political and economic power and also future prosperity

shall lie.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Are you going up

there?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> In 1959 as soon as the P.A.P. came to power,

there was a trend of industries, firms and skilled workers

moving up to Kuala Lumpur. We do notice this trend again. Mr

Speaker, Sir, even before Malaysia Day on the 16th of September,

1963, we had often said that if Singapore was to decide on

merger, it must be on a full, complete and equal basis. The

P.A.P. Government tried to twist our arguments by saying that

with complete and equal merger, half of our citizens would lose

their citizenship. This is not true. The entry of Singapore into

Malaysia as a peculiar State has created difficulties of immense

proportions. Never have we experienced a position where the

relationship between the State Government and the Federal

Government has been so tense and acute. The State Government of

Kelantan is run by the P.M.I.P. The Penang and Malacca City

Councils are run by the Socialist Front. The Ipoh City Council

is run by the P.P.P. But there are no apparent difficulties

between them and the Central Government. Singapore is now at the

receiving end.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>



We should now stop deceiving the people. We should tell them the

truth, even at the price of electoral defeat, because in the end

they will understand that we are telling the truth. They will

understand us and they will be our strength. Are the curses of

the people which have been heaped on us, and the long sleepless

nights which have ended with doses of sleeping pills, worth the

electoral victories achieved by lies? Why should the Government

ask the Assembly to approve its financial policy when it has no

financial policy? I ask the Government to move an amendment

itself to delete the words "financial policy" and substitute the

word "budget". I do not want to shame the Government. I want to

respect the Government. The Singapore State Government has

absolutely no control over Singapore's financial policy.

Similarly, it has no control over Singapore's Police, Prisons,

and so on. Of course, this does not mean that the Singapore

State Government cannot make recommendations to the Federal

Government to amend the income tax laws or to state who should

or should not be detained. Whether the Federal Government

accepts such recommendations is left entirely to its discretion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the main instruments of financial policy

are taxation, control of banking, control of rate of interest

and bank overdrafts, public borrowing, stock exchange, currency,

foreign exchange, and so on. All these powers are now vested in

the Federal Government. The Singapore Government is appointed by

the Federal Government to be a collection agent for certain

types of taxes, like income tax and customs duties. The branch

of the Central Bank of the Federal Government established in

Empress Place since Malaysia Day controls the policies of all

the banks in Singapore, and therefore Singapore's monetary

policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, neither has the Singapore Government any genuine

control over Singapore's industrial policy. The control of

industrial policy is also the prerogative of the Central

Government. The key to direct industries to particular States of

Malaysia is the power to issue pioneer certificates. Now, only

the Central Government has the power to issue pioneer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>



certificates. The Singapore Government cannot issue any more

pioneer certificates. It can only make recommendations to the

Federal Government, and, as far as I know, none of its recom

mendations have been accepted. For that matter, every State Gov

ernment in Malaysia can make recommendations, but whether the

recommendations of each particular State Government are to be

accepted or not depends on Kuala Lumpur. If the Central

Government in Kuala Lumpur decides that a certain factory should

go up in Petaling Jaya, or Prai, or Johore Bahru, and not in

Jurong, it can conveniently do so by refusing to accept the

recommendations of the Singapore Government to grant pioneer

status to that factory and offering it pioneer status and

protection if it is set up in the State allotted to it. No

factory entrepreneur wants to throw money away under such

circumstances by setting up a factory in Jurong without a

pioneer status and without assurance of a common market for his

products. The Central Government can conveniently refuse to

grant pioneer certificates to entrepreneurs who want to set up

factories in Jurong on the grounds that they want all the States

of Malaysia to enjoy equal industrial development opportunities.

That is why we have advocated: why not go into Malaysia on equal

terms instead of on peculiar terms? As a matter of fact, Sir, as

far as I know, since Malaysia was formed on 16th September,

1963, no new pioneer certificates have been issued to any

industries to be established in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the common market arrangements are also

another method by which the Central Government can direct

industrial growth in Malaysia. The Singapore Government has very

little say in the deliberations and decisions of the Common

Market Tariff Board which is controlled by the Federal

Government. In short, it will be the Federal Minister of

Commerce and Industry, through the instruments of granting

pioneer status and common market protection, who will decide

whether a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>



factory is to be set up in Jurong, Petaling Jaya, Ipoh, or Prai.

Sir, we all know that the Jurong Industrial Scheme is a flop.

Nowhere in the world has a government spent so much of the tax

payers' money on such an industrial scheme with so little

resources! Several hundred million dollars of the taxpayers'

money have been spent by the Economic Development Board alone,

not to include expenditure by the Public Utilities Board and the

Public Works Department on the Jurong Scheme. What we get is

only employment for several thousands of people after six years

of P.A.P.'s effort and an expenditure of several hundred

millions of dollars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as I say, the Jurong Industrial Scheme is

a complete flop. Hongkong did not require such a scheme, and yet

it has hundreds of times more factories than Singapore. After

six years of half-baked efforts, backed by intensive propaganda

of opening ceremonies, there are now less than 20 factories in

actual operation in the Jurong industrial site, employing only

several thousand people. They are not even able to absorb a

small percentage of the increasing population of 60,000 each

year. What about those affected by confrontation? People who

only read the newspapers and watch on T.V. the daily performance

of laying of foundation stone ceremonies and who have never

visited the Jurong site must think that there are at least 500

factories there. They will be shocked if they take a trip around

the Jurong area and see the pitiful, miserable results after

over $200 million of the taxpayers' money has been spent!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Have you gone there?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I only want to give an example of money

wasted on half-baked schemes. The scrap plant which they call a

steel mill in Jurong has been a failure. A steel mill uses iron

ore as raw material; a scrap plant uses scrap. The production of

the scrap plant threatens to stop. The Government has prohibited

the export of scrap iron - the plant's raw material. This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>



is understood to have led to the unemployment of many hundreds

of people connected with scrap collection. The price of scrap

was forced down because scrap-dealers can only sell to this

scrap plant. The import of steel was restricted to force up the

price of steel. This will eventually affect all house-buyers.

S.I.T. flat-dwellers and contractors. The Government and private

enterprise misled by Government's half-baked efforts have spent

nearly $15 million on this scrap plant, although there is

already another scrap plant in Bukit Timah Road built during the

Lim Yew Hock Government. Only a few million dollars of extra

capital was required to expand the machinery of this other scrap

plant to provide the same employment as the present scrap plant.

But the P.A.P. Government was not prepared to have a scrap plant

built during the Lim Yew Hock Government. It was prepared to let

it close down, and it indeed closed down because there was no

propaganda value. Moreover, there were no opening ceremonies to

be performed. Just imagine how much of the taxpayers' money has

to be spent and how much burden the public must bear so that the

scrap plant in Jurong is not forced to close down, merely for

the sake of propaganda!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the break-through in industrialisation

cannot be achieved by the obsession to perform opening

ceremonies and laying of foundation stone ceremonies for every

firm, shop, factory - big or small, old or new. Even if it is an

old firm, but so long as there is a change of site or of manage

ment, an opening ceremony is performed; even if a factory has

been in production for several years, it is still never too late

for an opening ceremony. As time goes on, and as outstanding

monuments like subways and tailor shops to enshrine one's name

for posterity become fewer and fewer, we might see the day when

every bus-shelter constructed, every road built, every standpipe

erected, goes through a ribbon-clipping ritual with a pair of

golden scissors, the usual flower pots, followed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>



by a set speech which can, be reproduced for such a grand

occasion on a gramophone record.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is perhaps pertinent to note that in all the fields of

activity of the P.A.P. Government's six years of office, all

have failed - and some have failed miserably - except in

housing. Housing is the only sector that the

P.A.P.    Government can boast of. Why has it succeeded in

housing when in all other sectors it has failed? It was just

because by September, 1959 I had completed the reorganisation of

the S.I.T., completed a gigantic housing blue-print, and

developed new organisational techniques in the building of

houses. In October 1959, I announced the plan to build 80,000

housing units in five years, and it was supported by the Prime

Minister who saw the plan.

But later the P.A.P. leadership refused to release the money

earmarked for housing. Instead they immediately appointed a

Commission of Inquiry to look into the building industry with

the sole object of discrediting me and to show that Singapore

did not have the skilled men and available building materials

for such a venture. The Commission of Inquiry's findings were

otherwise, because the evidence was too overwhelmingly

convincing that such a gigantic project was possible. Therefore,

the P.A.P. Government hesitated to publish the findings until

many years later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. leadership was able to put forward a

housing programme which I outlined in 1959 because they retained

the services of the Chief Architect, Mr Teh Chiang Wan. He was

my friend from Australia. I knew at that time that he was an

organising genius, not one from Batu Pahat. His ability was

beyond question. As soon as the P.A.P. came to power in 195g. I

immediately offered him a post in the S.I.T. He quitted his job

in the Penang City Council, and we immediately plunged into a

series of meetings to reorganise the S.I.T. to formulate revolu

tionary techniques in S.I.T. housing never dreamt of before, and

to draw up a housing programme. Sir, Mr Teh Chiang Wan was to

housing in Singapore what Kosygin was to textile



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>



production in Russia. But Stalin unashamedly got the name and

claimed the credit for himself. If the Government appoints a

group of nincompoops in the Housing Board Committee, houses

would still be built at the rate the Government desires - even

if it wants 30,000 units a year - so long as Teh Chiang Wan is

there. We must give credit where credit lies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> L-i-e-s!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Because the nincompoops did not matter.

It is Teh Chiang Wan who matters.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Did I hear somebody say "L-i-e-s"? The

Member must withdraw it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I withdraw.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> We must give credit where credit lies. If

the Federal Government wants to make a success of its housing

programme, it can easily do so by retaining the services of Mr

Teh Chiang Wan. He was the mastermind behind Singapore's housing

success. But when I first appointed him and malayanised the

expatriate architects ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We are not debating Mr, what is his

name?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Mr Teh.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Member for Hong Lim might mention

him in passing as being somebody responsible. But to talk about

him for 10 minutes is beyond the debate on the financial policy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

it is very important because I want to help the Government, if

possible, to find out the faults in its industrial programme. So

when I first appointed Mr Teh and malayanised the expatriate

architects, what I received were curses from the P.A.P.

leadership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government's industrial policies have

failed because, in the first place, there has never been a

clearly formulated plan on the road to industrialisation with a

clear target set on the methods to achieve



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>



it. None of the Ministers in the Government have any real experi

ence in industry or business. Throughout his working life, the

Minister for Finance had been a civil servant completely

sheltered from the hurly-burly of the hard business world and

the fierce competition outside. He is by training a statistician

of the first order

- world class. He will make a great success in the United

Nations computing and analysing national income statistics of

developing nations. Because of his background and training, he

cannot help apply civil service methods to industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when industries are to be run by civil

servants on civil service principles, I am sure the public knows

the results. The Prime Minister himself possesses little

knowledge of finance and economics and industry. He is,

therefore, in no position to make any contribution. The members

of the Economic Development Board are hardworking. But they are

also civil servants long in the service. Much of their time,

Sir, is further wasted in seeking out and organising opening

ceremonies. Again the Government has not been able to recruit

someone like Mr Teh Chiang Wan for its industrialisation

programme. Now that the pioneer certificates and common market

incentives are under the control of the Federal Government, the

future of industrialisation is even more bleak. The vast Jurong

site, barren, with very few factories, looks like a wall without

features. Some time back, the Government blamed the Communists

for their failure in their industrialisation programme. Now they

blame the Indonesians. Very soon they will blame the Federal

Government. But when housing succeeded, it was all the P.A.P.'s

credit! They complimented nobody. The world did not know that it

was Teh Chiang Wan who built all the houses. Because the P.A.P.

Government's industrialisation programme has failed, Singapore

now has the biggest percentage of population unemployed compared

with most of the modern cities of the world. Of course, the

Government can tell us that there is even more acute

unemployment in Jakarta where the people are supposed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>



to eat corn and rats. The hungry, unemployed people and those

depending on public assistance in Singapore get no consolation

from such stories. We have the highest percentage of hawker and

pirate taxi population. If an unemployed person can borrow some

money, he will turn to hawking or to running a pirate taxi to

earn a few dollars a day. Nobody wishes to be a hawker or a

pirate taxi driver and face the threat of prosecution and fines

everyday if he can get a job in a factory. The Government cannot

find jobs for them. It only knows how to arrest them. Or would

the Government prefer that they steal and rob because their

children are hungry? Of course, it is wrong for pirate taxis to

take away passengers from the taxi drivers. But it is the

Government's responsibility to find jobs for the unemployed.

When they go to the Labour Exchange, they are asked to come back

the next day, It is now known that registration of unemployment

in the Labour Exchange is a mere waste of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because of the failure of Government's

industrialisation scheme and because of unfair financial terms,

Singapore has been sold out on entry into Malaysia. Singapore

will, for the first time in history, be facing a deficit.

Singapore has been a rich city since pre-war days. This is

because of its geographical position, being the centre of

South-East Asia trade. Whether it is a colonial government or a

corrupted government, the State coffers had never been empty.

Now the State coffers have started to drain out. In the 1965

Budget, not only Singapore cannot afford to expand its social

services, but in some cases it will have to shrink them. We are

now facing a deficit. But the Assembly is being asked at the

same time to be generous enough to give a S30 million

interest-free loan to Sabah and Sarawak in 1965, and another $90 million

in subsequent years. Mr Speaker, Sir, how can we expect a

surplus budget if we have to pay so much ransom to the Federal

Government each year? The Federal Government did not ask for it.

The P.A.P. Government was trying to be generous.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>



The financial losses to be borne by Singapore each year are

assessed as follows: (1) Payment to the Federal Government of 40

per cent of national revenue, $127 million; (2) Interest on $30

million to Sabah and Sarawak, $2 million. Loss of earnings from

the issue of currency notes, which now goes to the Federation

Government, $11 million; making a total of $140 million. The

Federation Government's expenditure on Government Departments in

Singapore - which it has now taken over from the P.A.P.

Government - is estimated to be only $75 million a year. This is

the bargain the P.A.P. Government has entered into. Singapore

had surrendered to the Federal Government control of the Police,

Armed Services, Prisons, Immigration, Posts, Telephones, Telecom

munications, Vehicle Registration, the Courts, Judges,

Magistrates, the Paya Lebar Airport, Identity Card Registration,

Meteorological Services, control of companies and stock

exchange, control of income taxes and customs, issue of pioneer

certificates, final decision on Singapore citizenship

registration, control of film censorship, and a host of other

subjects. The P.A.P. Government gives all these departments and

power to the Federal Government and pays $140 million a year to

the Federal Government to maintain them. The Federal Government

has only to spend $75 million and makes a clear profit of $65

million. What a bargain the Singapore Government has entered

into. I did not get the figures from nowhere. I got the figures

from the Budget itself. To check the accuracy of my figures, I

got further proof from no less an authority than Singapore's

Minister for Finance. Page 11 of the 1965 Budget, the "Abstract

of Estimated Revenue for the Year 1965" shows that the Federal

Government will receive $137 million a year from taxes paid by

residents in Singapore. This money before September

1963 ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is the Member quoting from the cyclostyled

copy, or is he taking it from the Singapore Budget?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I am quoting from the Singapore Budget.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes. Carry on.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> This money before 16th September, 1963, would

belong to the Singapore Government for it to discharge its

obligation to the people of Singapore. Before Malaysia Day, the

P.A.P. told us that Singapore is required to contribute this

annual sum which would grow bigger and bigger each year, because

the Federal Government after Malaysia Day has to pay for the

departments which have been surrendered to them. At that time

they told us that it was a very good bargain. I remember we were

told that to run these departments would cost much more. We were

given the impression that Tan Siew Sin was not as smart as Goh

Keng Swee. Of course, Sir, ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Dr Goh Keng Swee happens to be the

Minister for Finance. If the Member wants to refer to him in

this House, he must refer to him as the Minister for Finance and

not Goh Keng Swee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in this connection, it

was special because both are Ministers for Finance and the House

might have a wrong impression of these two persons. That is why

I deliberately bring out their names. I am sorry for that. Of

course, to substantiate it, we were given the funny theory that

the elder cousin had inherited the grandparents' fortune and the

younger cousin had not. But as far as I have heard, Tan Cheng

Lock, the father of Tan Siew Sin, had made his millions from

scratch. Of course, whoever is the smarter cousin is of no

concern to us. But now we have solid proof that the elder cousin

had outsmarted the younger cousin. The younger cousin had sold

the people of Singapore down the drain to the tune of $65

million a year. In 1965, the elder cousin will collect $127

million from the younger cousin. Actually the money will be in

the Bank Negara in Empress Place, the bank belonging to the

elder cousin. In 1966, the amount will be more than $127

million, and it will keep on increasing. The elder cousin will

only spend $75 million on the departments in Singapore, which he

took over from his younger cousin and the latter's good friend,

the Singapore Prime Minister. The breakdown of the $75 million

to be spent by the Federal Government on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>



departments taken over is broadly as follows:

making a total of $75 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, after paying $75 million to keep us on

good behaviour, the elder cousin can still pocket a profit of

$52 million. The younger cousin has suddenly woke up. See what

the Singapore Minister for Finance now tells us. In column 131

of the Hansard, Vol. 23, No. 2, in his Budget speech on 2nd

November, 1964, he says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Revenue and expenditure for the current year shows that

the days are over when we can take for granted that each

financial year will end with a surplus of $50 million or more.'



<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is a rich city. Whether it is David

Marshall, Lim Yew Hock or the colonial Government, there will

always be a budget surplus. Now this surplus will be gone

forever, given to the Federation Government by the P.A.P.

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now coming back to the story. The Federal Government

receives $127 million a year and pays out $75 million a year,

making a profit of $52 million. In addition, it will receive an

additional profit of $11 million each year by taking full

control of the issue of currency notes. You know, Mr Speaker,

Sir, printing of currency notes is a very profitable business.

Now if we give Sabah and Sarawak an interest-free loan of $30

million a year, which the Singapore Government has to raise from

the Singapore public, it has to pay $2 million interest each

year. $52 million plus $11 million, plus $2 million equals $65

million. In 1965, therefore, the P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>



Government has sold out the people of Singapore for $65 million.

In 1966 it is likely to be $75 million. In 1967 it is likely to

be $85 million, because the 40 per cent contribution will

increase year after year. As far as I know, for the first time

in Singapore's history, at least since the war, we are going to

have a deficit. The Alliance-controlled Federal Government is

not going to have a two-year truce to allow the

P.A.P.- controlled Singapore Government a breathing space to make use of

Singapore as an economic base - a Cuba - to launch a political

offensive in the Federal elections in 1969. The Federal

Government will make doubly sure that not only will the

P.A.P.- controlled Singapore Government's social services in

Singapore be unable to expand to cope with the increasing popu

lation and growing unemployment, but it will make it further

deteriorate. This is what is actually happening now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. Government has little power

left except to run schools and hospitals. Anybody who wants to

go to the University of Singapore, Nanyang University, the Singa

pore Polytechnic, Ngee Ann College, is required to get a permit

from the Federal Government. Because of the loss of power, the

suppressors of Nan-yang University and Chinese education have

turned to become the defenders of Nanyang University and Chinese

education. The non-communal socialist heroes of years ago have

become the skilled practitioners of communal politics so that

they can gather support from the Chinese. The Communist bogey

has now receded temporarily from the picture, and in its place a

different battle is being fought.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the entire financial arrangements entered

into with the Federal Government were a sell-out. As a matter of

fact, the White Paper was a gigantic fraud perpetrated on the

people of Singapore. We are told that Singapore will be a

special autonomous State within Malaysia. During the dis

turbances in July the whole humbug was exposed. The people saw

with their own eyes that the members of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>



State Government of Singapore, who called themselves the Prime

Minister and Ministers, have completely no power. They are no

better off than the average citizens. They also required curfew

passes issued by the Federal Government to pass through the

streets even in official cars. The story went around that one of

the P.A.P. Ministers

- I am afraid, if the story is true, he had not studied the

White Paper and the Constitution properly - was ordered by the

ordinary soldiers to come down from his official car and show

his curfew pass. I am sure that if Singapore had entered

Malaysia on an equal footing, there would not have been such

problems. There is now no trouble between the

Alliance-controlled Government ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Central Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> - the Central Government and the P.M.I.P.-

controlled Kelantan State Government. Let us not further deceive

the people that half of them would lose their citizenship rights

if Singapore entered Malaysia on an equal footing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, since the Singapore Minister for Finance has

no power at all in deciding the financial policy of

Singapore - as it will be decided by Mr Tan Siew Sin; and Dr Lim Swee Aun,

the Federal Minister for Commerce and Industry, will decide on

Singapore's industrialisation policy - the words "Minister for

Finance" applicable to Dr Goh Keng Swee may slowly have to be

changed. There is no Minister for Finance anywhere in the world

who does not decide on financial policy. In the United Kingdom

or the United States, Dr Goh's post will be called the City

Treasurer or the State Financial Officer or the State Accountant-General. In the epoch of the l960s only in Singapore can you

find people in positions with high-sounding names but no power,

like Emperor Puyi of Manchukuo nearly three decades back.

Actually if the policeman does not want to salute the Prime

Minister of Singapore when he enters the City Hall or the

Assembly House, the latter cannot do anything. I will not be

surprised at all if one day



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>



the Central Government, in order to avoid confusion (I believe

there was some confusion during the first African tour as to

whether the Prime Minister of Singapore controls Malaysia, or

the Prime Minister of Malaysia controls Singapore) amend the

Malaysian Constitution and call the Front-benchers in the

Singapore Assembly, as Mentri Besar, Timbalan Mentri Besar,

State Financial Secretary, Education Secretary, Health

Secretary, Labour Secretary and so on. These names are more ap

propriate with their present powers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, Sir, actually from now onwards we can

expect bigger and bigger deficits each year. All the capital

reserves accumulated by the colonial government and the Tun Lim

Yew Hock Government will be drained away. Sir, they have always

condemned the Tun Lim Yew Hock Government as a decadent,

inefficient and corrupt Government. The P.A.P. has always sung

praises of its own, that is, the Government is a clean

Government, an honest Government and an efficient Government.

Except for housing, where the credit should be given to Teh

Chiang Wan, the master-mind and the genius behind the whole

housing project, six years of P.A.P. rule have done less for the

people than three years of the Lim Yew Hock Government. In the

field of education, the Lim Yew Hock Government built the

Polytechnic and the Teachers' Training College. The P.A.P. have

built none. In the field of health, the Lim Yew Hock Government

built one district hospital in Thomson Road. The P.A.P. have

built none. In the field of industrialisation, six years of

P.A.P. Government and investments of more than $200 million have

not produced more factories for more workers than three years of

the Lim Yew Hock Government with no investments. The difference

is that Lim Yew Hock did not know how to organise opening ceremonies, whether they are for new factories or old factories. He

should have given instructions through his Industrial Promotion

Board to get all factories, established since Sir Stamford

Raffles' time, to be white-washed, and to perform the opening

ceremonies. Of course, in those days, we had no T.V.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, leaving housing aside, there is no field of

activity where six years of P.A.P. Government have surpassed in

its results the three years of the Lim Yew Hock Government. The

P.A.P. Government is not better than the Lim Yew Hock

Government. Sir, the 1965 Budget makes no provision for a

General Hospital. The present General Hospital was built prewar

to cope with only one-third of the present population. We need

to expand the General Hospital to three times its present size

to cope with the present demand. The public is complaining of

the inadequacies of the hospital services. The 1965 Budget

should make provision to expand the present Polytechnic to at

least five times the present size to cope with the demand. It is

very difficult for students to get admission to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1965 Budget did not increase the amount of public

assistance which has stood at about $10 million constantly for

several years. With confrontation and its effects now severely

felt, this amount should be increased to at least $20 million.

Thousands of families are urgently requiring public assistance,

but because of the strict rules, they cannot get aid. Those who

get public assistance cannot afford to pay even the rent of

their cubicles from the $10 or $20 they receive a month. The

people receiving public assistance should be respected like

human beings and not be made to beg for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, due to the fact that most of the Housing

Board dwellers are from the lower income groups, mostly affected

by confrontation, the P.A.P. Government should immediately

reduce S.I.T. rentals by 20 per cent at least to last as long as

Indonesian confrontation -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Why not free?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> This will cost the Government only $4

million a year. The 1965 Budget makes no provision for the

relief of fire victims since outbreaks of fire are now almost a

recurring affair. As in the past few years, we have a big fire

almost each year. There should be an annual provision in the

Budget for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>



relief of fire victims. The Government makes a big profit by

paying prices far below the market price to those owners of land

affected by fires. Such profits should be earmarked as relief

for the fire victims. Because of inadequate provisions, the

recent fire victims of Kampong Pulau Minyak in Lorong 1, Geylang, were not well looked after. I believe they have so far

received only $10 cash each, with no free clothes, no free

blankets and no free food. In the Lorong 3 fire, the fire

victims each received several hundreds of dollars in cash,

unlimited amounts of gifts in goods and a house for each family.

What a contrast if the Government does not care for the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no provision in the 1965 Budget

for the erection of the pre-election time much-publicised

memorial for victims during the Japanese Occupation. After

Malaysia Day and the Singapore general elections, not one word

has been spoken. You will remember the P.A.P. Government made

solemn pledges to the people at a mass rally of 100,000 people

to fight to the very last for Japanese reparations. Now after

nearly 1½ years we have not heard one single word. Not one

single murmur! The organisers have also kept quiet. Very funny!

Before the mass rally, the Singapore Prime Minister broke the

soil for a memorial on a four-acre piece of land near the

Britannia Club. I still cannot see the memorial when I pass by.

Mr Speaker, Sir, what a vote-catching fraud! I also remember

the P.A.P. Government telling the people before the elections

that they were going to introduce free secondary education.

Where is the free secondary education provision in the 1965

Budget? What a vote-catching stunt!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way. He is not giving

way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> He will have his time later. What a

vote-catching stunt!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>



These are only some fine specimens of broken promises. Of

course, the Government's excuse is that we have no more power

over finance. We are facing a deficit. Sir, let us now assume

that the P.A.P. Government had not surrendered the annual sum of

$65 million worth of profit to the Federation Government each

year. What can we do with $65 million each year? Build one

district hospital each year, $5 million; build one polytechnic

each year, $10 million; double the present rate of social

welfare public assistance relief, $10 million; reduce the S.I.T.

rentals by 20 per cent, $4 million; free secondary education for

all, $2 million; reduce taxes, fines and abolish all hawkers'

licence fees, $2 million; abolish all radio and T.V, licences,

$3 million; abolish all night soil and trade refuse collection

charges, $2 million; reduce property tax on all houses, whether

brick or attap by half, since Singapore has one of the highest

property taxes in the world. $27 million; making a total of $65

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Government admit that they have no

more power over their financial policy, I ask them here, of

their own accord, to move an amendment themselves, to substitute

the word "budget" for "financial policy". The Minister's speech

on the Budget dare not touch on Singapore's financial policy. He

has only explained in his speech some of the figures in the

Budget. What he has asked the House to approve is the 1965

Budget on which we have little quarrel with him, because he has

no other way out. In the circumstances, Mr Speaker, Sir, I must

put on record in the House that the Minister for Finance has

done his best.



<br><br>4.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, we are very fortunate people in many respects, because one has

only to look around in South-East Asia and see the difference

- dictatorships, guided democracy, and other political gimmicks

with their attendant economic decay and human suffering are the

order of the times. In our context, let us look back to the

pre-1959 era and the post-1959 era. We will note



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>



that we were in the doldrums in the pre1959 colonial era.

Singapore was lying fallow and everything done was in the

economic interest of the colonial master, but not in the social

interest of the people. The post-1959 era saw the destiny of the

State vested in the hands of its own people. Out of the doldrums

there appeared a new dynamism, a will to improve things for

ourselves. The indifference of the colonialists to social

problems left in our hands the legacy of an expanding population

seeking outlets for employment, housing, education, medical

care. It was found that the only way to create new and expanding

employment opportunities for a fast growing population was to

industrialise. And so started our economic development planning

which has given birth to the vast Jurong Industrial complex and

the smaller estates at Tanglin Halt, Redhill and Kallang. 113

firms have been awarded Pioneer Certificates and 47 are in

production, employing about 4,190 persons currently. This number

is likely to be increased to 6,687 eventually. In addition,

about 120 new non-pioneer firms have gone up this year alone.

The next few years will see an even greater rate of industrial

expansion. Both public and private housing projects are

progressing with undiminished vigour, so much so that the

spectre of housing shortage that faced Singapore before has

disappeared. The spate of building activity is slowly changing

the Singapore skyline, and a further change will occur in the

not too distant future with the rebuilding of the City itself.

We are now in the transitional phase of transforming the State

into an industrial one, which also entails social development on

a large scale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spirit of pioneers, we must proceed with

undiminished vigour so that a firm foundation for a more just

and more equal society can be laid. In this society, it is our

fervent hope that our children will find a place of dignity and

standing, happiness and prosperity. However, certain enemies of

our society, with the aid of their foreign allies, are

attempting to nullify our efforts at building a better future

for our people. To them, progress brought about by democratic

socialism



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>



means their destruction, because the people will see the

hollowness of their political and social philosophy. It is the

duty of all those who believe in the democratic system to work

with dedication and energy towards our economic and social

development, be they employers, workers or professional men.

Trade unions, of course, have a vital role to play in this field

and there is no doubt that they, under the leadership of the

National Trades Union Congress, will bring to the fore their

ingenuity in helping to solve the social problems that face us.

This, of course, means that pure militant trade unionism has no

place in this context -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We are now on the financial policy of

the Finance Minister as stated in his speech. So will the Member

confine himself to the financial policy?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am just trying to bring

up the experience that we have faced in the past in the

implementation of our financial policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying, it requires rational and responsible trade

unionism in the interests of the country. The democratic trade

union movement has, however, consolidated itself in the face of

challenges from the pro-Communist unions and it is now clear

that the pro-Communist elements can be swiftly and effectively

dealt with should they endeavour to denude and destroy our march

forward towards a better life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the democratic trade unions have achieved for the workers

since Malaysia came into being is clearly reflected in the

number of agreements registered in the Industrial Arbitration

Court. Out of a total of 199 agreements registered, 105 were in

respect of unions within the democratic fold, and further out of

233 cases heard in the Court, 165 were in respect of democratic

trade unions. Strikes, slogans, and political intrigues as

practised by the Barisan group of unions had not been shamefully

used by them. They have made use of the Court for the very

purpose that it was set up. The democratic trade union



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>



movement has also a duty to its members and the public to keep

the movement clean and honest.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng (Paya Lebar):</b>

Point of order. (In Mandarin): Mr Speaker, the Parliamentary

Secretary is not debating the financial policy but is making a

report on the labour movement. I hope he will go back to the

financial policy.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary can come

back to the financial policy as quickly as he can. If he is now

touching op the trade union movement merely to make some points

in regard to the financial statement, he is in order. But if he

is dwelling on the trade union movement to tell the House what

the Government has done in respect of such movement, then he is

completely out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as in all

organisations, the democratic trade union movement has also a

duty to its members and the public to keep the movement clean

and honest. As in all organisations, there are some in the trade

union movement who tend to be dishonest. We have recently had

serious allegations made against certain officials of the

Singapore Manual and Mercantile Workers' Union. This has caused

great concern to men of goodwill and honesty.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the Parliamentary Secretary come

back to the financial statement? He is now getting down to

individual unions!



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was not dwelling on

it. I was just mentioning it in passing. But what I am trying to

bring out here is this: just now the Opposition has accused us

by saying that we, the Government, are to be blamed for the

present economic situation, and we are trying to refute the

criticism made by the Opposition on the failure of the

Government's financial policy, i.e, through the trade union

movement -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the Parliamentary Secretary please

proceed? I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>



shall watch him very carefully to see that whatever he says is,

in fact, tied up to the financial statement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> This has caused great concern to men of

goodwill and honesty. Without a clean and an honest trade union

leadership, the whole movement will disintegrate and the

ultimate sufferers will be the workers themselves. Government

has, therefore, appointed a one-man Commission of Inquiry to in

quire into these serious allegations. The Commissioner appointed

is Mr P. Coomaraswamy, an advocate and solicitor, and the terms

of reference - Mr Speaker, Sir, may I beg your indulgence just

to give the brief terms of reference?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> This House is not concerned now with the terms

of reference with regard to a particular union, as I can see no

particular relevance of that Commission to the financial

statement of the Minister for Finance. I rule that it is

completely out of order. And if the Parliamentary Secretary does

not desist from that, I must ask him to sit down.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Barisan have

indicated publicly that they are sympathetic to Indonesia's

cause, and they have all along been trying to nullify our

efforts to improve ourselves. We have managed to conscribe them,

but let us not be bedevilled by dishonesty within our own ranks,

because such dishonesty will only help our enemies to curb our

progress. To us our future is sacred and we will surmount all

difficulties to achieve our goal.



<br><br>4.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, the financial statement delivered by the

Minister for Finance last week is a financial statement which is

delivered one year after the formation of Malaysia. Although the

Finance Minister has made use of all sorts of strategy in order

to cover up many facts which they do not want the people to

know, and to create a false impression in the minds of the

people, we on closer examination are able to find dirty things

in it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me clarify some of the points in the statement.

Firstly, there is a deficit in our budget for next year.

Secondly, there has been a trade decline for the first half of

this year. The volume of imports for the first half of 1964 has

decreased by 23 per cent, and the volume of exports has

decreased by 31 per cent compared with the corresponding period

of last year. Thirdly, when we are faced with economic

difficulties, the Government has agreed to hand over $27 million

to the Federal Government. Fourthly, because of the loopholes in

Indonesian confrontation, Singapore has been able to recover

some of the business in barter trade lost in September last

year. Fifthly, our economic situation has changed for the worse,

although there is a high level of activity in our construction

and manufacturing fields, Sixthly, this Budget Statement can be

termed a useless piece of paper because the financial policy of

the Federation can upset our budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech, the Minister for Finance has admitted that

after the formation of Malaysia, which is contrary to the wishes

of the people, the days of a surplus at the end of each year are

gone. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Revenue and expenditure for the current year shows that

the days are over when we can take for granted that each

financial year will end with a surplus of $50 million or more.

This fact will have to be faced.'



<br><br>This is the first deficit the P.A.P. Government has to face. In

order to boast that it is a sound Government, it deducted and

tried to save money on expenditure, with the result that there

was a surplus every year. The Government made use of this

surplus to deceive the people. Today it has to admit that there

would not be any surplus any more. What are the reasons for

this? The main reason is that the revenue for the State

Government has decreased. Why should we have this deficit?

Obviously this is closely related to our trade suspension with

Indonesia. As everybody is aware, the entrepot trade has all

along been our economic sinews and that trade between Singapore

and Indonesia has some prominence.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has also admitted that as a result of

confrontation our economy has been affected, and the worst effect

is centred on Singapore after the suspension of trade

between Indonesia and Singapore. No matter what views people may

hold, nobody can deny that this calamity has been brought about

by the formation of Malaysia. If we had no Malaysia, we would

not have such a calamity. If the upper clique of the P.A.P.

could give up their self-seeking motives and listen to the views

of the people, the masses of the people here in Singapore will

not have to face such great difficulty and our economy will not

face such a crisis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past one year there has been a serious recession in

our trade. According to the Minister for Finance, for the first

half of this year there has been a decrease of 23 per cent in

our imports and in exports there has been a decrease of 31 per

cent, and the rapid recession of trade last year was the direct

outcome of confrontation. As a result of trade recession, we

have this economic deterioration, and those directly affected

are the transport workers, lightermen, import and export firms,

rubber workers, rattan workers, small businessmen, hawkers and

farmers. All these people are now faced with difficulties. They

have left their jobs and the cost of living has gone up.

Taxation has gone up, and some workers are even faced with

starvation. Yet the Prime Minister's clique has been talking of

prosperity and happiness.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Prime Minister's clique. Will the Member

refrain from using the word "clique" and withdraw it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

The Minister for Finance has also tried to cover all these

brutal facts.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The word "clique" must be withdrawn because it

can only refer to the Cabinet - the Prime Minister's clique.

Will the word "clique" be withdrawn, please?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I now withdraw it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has said in his speech that his prediction in the past

was too pessimistic. He has also said that the economy of Singapore

is stable and that we have not been affected by confrontation. The

Minister is trying to gloss over our difficulties by such remarks,

if the Government continues to be irresponsible, it will one day find

that our situation will be so grave that it cannot be redeemed any more.

The first victims would be the masses of the people in this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how honeyed the words the Minister may use, we

are able to find many contradictions in his speech. On the one

hand, he has said that our economy has not been affected by con

frontation. On the other hand, he has said that as a result of

confrontation our trade and business have suffered a great blow.

On the one hand, he has said we are not affected by con

frontation. But, on the other hand, the statistics show that

there has been a great recession in our trade. On the one hand,

he has said that the country which is suffering from

confrontation is Indonesia. On the other hand, he has said that

Singapore can restore some of the barter trade it lost before

September last year. All these contradictions appear in the

Minister for Finance's speech. Which side of the picture shall

we ask the people to believe'? We are not going to listen to the

smear and the abuse of language delivered by the Minister. The

1.7 million people in Singapore have got every right to know the

true state of affairs and how they are going to go on living.

They will not be deceived by the Prime Minister when he says

that in 1967 we will be able to see the results and that 20

years from now we will be able to lead a happy life. What we are

concerned with is not the hollow talk of 20 years from now. What

we are concerned with is our economic problem which needs

immediate solution. I feel that whether the P.A.P. can continue

to rule us, whether Mr Lee Kuan Yew can still be our Prime

Minister ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Some ear-phones have not been switched

off on the Opposition Bench. They are interfering with the

proceedings. Could Members on the Opposition side please see

that their ear-phones are cut out when they leave their seats?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): What matters most is the

livelihood of the 1.7 million people in Singapore, and the

future of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me reveal the true state of affairs to the people. Has

not the Prime Minister always said that his Party comes from the

people and that it will go back to the people? I ask him to be

honest and let the people know the true state of affairs. They

should seek the solution from the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another matter in the Budget speech which deserves our

attention. We have to contribute $127 million to the Central

Government. The Minister says that out of $339 million in

revenue, 40 per cent of it will be handed over to the Central

Government; that is to say, $127 million. This is 40 per cent of

the State revenue. Mr Speaker, Sir, this is one of the greatest

losses which have come about as a result of Malaysia. In order

to save their own fate and in order to please the Tunku, they

have now tried to hand over our financial rights to the Central

Government. In the past, when the upper group of the P.A.P. were

trying to form a phoney merger, we had already warned them that

this was a sort of a sell-out -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The phrase "phoney merger" has already

been ruled upon in this House. So it should not be used. Will

the Member please withdraw it? Merger was approved by the

Flouse, and the phrase "phoney merger" must not be used in

reference to merger.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, I mentioned this phrase because I was

referring to what had happened before merger.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The phrase must be withdrawn before the

Member can proceed with the speech. I wonder whether he

understood what I said. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>



phrase "phoney merger" must be withdrawn. After that the Member

can proceed with his speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I will follow your

directions. I will abide by - [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not need any help from Members of

the House. Will the Member please withdraw the phrase "phoney

merger"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I withdraw it.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we had

warned them in the beginning. We had hoped that the money earned

by the people could be used by them on social welfare for the

benefit of the people and in order to build a better society.

But what is the situation now? The result of Malaysia with

regard to the financial arrangements is that the Prime Minister

has given away large sums of our money to the Tunku's

Government. Thus, in addition to divesting our people of most of

their rights, a large part of our money has been used for

purposes contrary to the interest of the people. It has been

used to suppress the people. It has enabled the Anglo-American

imperialists to buy armaments and force our people here to

become cannon fodder in North Borneo.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is now faced with a financial

deficit. The position of the people is made difficult after the

severance of trade with Indonesia. The people are experiencing

unemployment and economic difficulties. Most of the trade and

commerce has stopped. Moreover, the people of Singapore will

have to tighten their belts in order to hand over more money to

the Federation. This is to maintain the oligarchy of the P.A.P.

Such arrangements were made during the Singapore and Federation

merger talks. Without this neocolonialist Malaysia, trade would

not have been severed. There would have been no need to hand

over this sum of money as a present to the Tunku's Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> On a point of

order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You have ruled that the phrase "phoney

merger" is out of order. Following the same line of argument,

should the Chair also not rule that "neo-colonialist Malaysia"

is similarly out of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is not a point of order. It is a matter of

opinion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

If there had been no neo-colonialist Malaysia, then Singapore

would not have incurred any deficit in its Budget. In the past,

the Minister has claimed Budget surpluses. If there had been no

Malaysia, then the State Government would not have to levy more

tax on the people. The rate of postage will now have to be

increased. Since the P.A.P, came to power, there have been in

creases of taxes, causing difficulties to the people. There have

even been taxes on minor items such as parking in car

parks-[Laughter] Is it not true? There will be more taxes to come.

All these have been the ill-consequences brought about by

Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has stressed that Singapore is closely linked

with Malaysia. Without Malaysia, Singapore cannot exist. Singapore

is now faced with a situation in which she will have

to contribute money for the defence and security of the whole of

Malaysia. I ask the Government whether they now regret having

agreed to hand over such a large sum of money to the Federation.

The Minister for Finance has claimed that because of increased

activity in the industrial and construction fields, the effects

of confrontation have been countered to a great extent. I say

that they have some effect on this. But it is not quite

significant. The Minister for Finance has also claimed that

there have been no effects as a result of severance of trade. Is

it not contradictory to what he has just said?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us talk about another subject, namely, housing

development. Superficially, the whole picture looks



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>



nice and appears as though it is beneficial to the people. There

are periodic economic crises happening in all capitalist

countries, in such a situation, the Government will usually

resort to public construction in order to divert the economy

into this field to resolve the situation, to promote our

commercial activities. But it is an abnormal phenomenon. Once it

reaches saturation point, the serious consequences will then

appear. If our economy is not solved by resorting to measures

which are beneficial to the welfare and interest of the people

and the State, then there will be even more serious crises in

future. The measure to resolve the present crisis in order to

solve the problem of livelihood of the people is not a proper

one. I now ask the Government to adopt a method which will meet

with the national interest. Thus nobody will be able to exploit

the situation and make money out of building houses. For

instance, there are areas where there have been fires and the

victims of the fires have suffered, and yet house developers

have been able to exploit the situation. This is not the way to

resolve the problem facing us in respect of the livelihood of

the people. So, housing development is not the only way to

resolve the present situation. It will not solve entirely the

unemployment problem. I would like to ask, since new factories

are opened almost every day, how many unemployed workers have

been employed, and whether there is any solution to the economic

crisis? I would like to tell the Government that, in fact, in

countries such as Britain and America, there are many advanced

industries and yet the unemployment situation there is more

serious than in other countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, today the industrial development in

Singapore is entirely in keeping with the imperialist economic

policy and meets the interest of foreign monopolist capital.

This is a fact that cannot be covered up. This will only benefit

the foreign capitalists. To speak the truth, such an industrial

policy will only throw our door open to foreign capitalists,

thus making our workers continue to be exploited by foreign



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>



monopolist capital and is not in keeping with the true interests

of our nation and our people. In order to make the Ministers

understand more, I would like to point out that because the

licences extended to pioneer industries are in respect of

manufactured products which are under the control of foreign

capitalists, the prices of these products will increase.

Therefore, it is entirely in keeping with the neo-imperialist

economic policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has claimed increased industrial activity.

But this cannot gloss over the fact that many people are unemployed

and the conditions of service of the workers are not suitable. The

Government should not allow such exploitation by foreign capitalists

to continue, and try to legalise such exploitation. Everyone can

see the present industrial situation.

The Minister for Finance also knows that the actual effect of

this is not beneficial to the people. The Minister in one of his

speeches has also said that many workers have been given 50

cents or $1 by the employers. It appears as though the measure

was justified, but the workers affected, especially those

engaged in the garment trade, suffered the most. I will now give

an example. In the countryside, there is a textile mill. New

workers' wages are 50 cents to $1 each. But they have to pay a

deposit of $10 first and their wages can be changed by the

employers. If there are more orders, then the employers can give

wages according to the daily rate. If not, then it will be on a

piece rate. The working conditions are also not ideal. In the

Jurong Industrial site, the mobile nature of the workers will

bring the picture up to date as to what is the situation i1i

relation to pioneer industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, under the present economic policy, industrial

development will lead to further poverty of the people and our

national capitalists will no longer be able to raise their heads

and Unemployment will increase. We have to sort these problems

political Party and we have to present the views of the people

before the Government. I hope that the upper group of the P.A.P.

will not be angry and turn round to smear us. They should

seriously consider the views of the people in the interests of

the people and the State.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

The Budget for next year shows that most of the money will be

spent on medicine, health and education. This proves that this

Budget is the most progressive one in the whole of South-East

Asia. Of the amount of $339 million in respect of expenditure

for next year, a sum of $221 million will be spent on social

services. In other words, more than two-thirds of the Government

revenue will be spent on the construction and welfare of our

society. In the Development Estimates, we have a total figure of

$293 million, of which $24 million will be spent on education,

$3.5 million on health, and $125 million on national development

in respect of the construction of roads, bridges and drains. So

whether it is in the Annual Estimates or the Development

Estimates, one can see the reflection of a special feature, and

that is, the Government regards the improvement of the

livelihood of the people as more important than anything else.

This is precisely the principle of socialism, of obtaining money

from society and using it on society. In other countries, the

greater part of the national revenue is used for the purchase of

aeroplanes, guns and military expansion, or on the construction

of such white elephants as a national stadium and luxurious

hotels, while the people there have to live in great

difficulties.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Financial Statement of the Minister for Finance has

given a comprehensive analysis of the economic situation in

Singapore. In his conclusion, he says, in the next few years our

economic future is rather bleak. But, he continues, if we carry

out with determination our industrialisation programme, then we

shall be able to overcome the temporary difficulties and go on

our way to nationhood and national construction. The way of

industrialisation is the correct way. It is the way any new

emergent nation should take towards economic independence. Just

now, the Member for Jalan Kayu has said: What is the use of this

present industrialisation programme? Although in America and

Britain, industry is well developed, a lot of people are still

unemployed. My reply is that this argument is tainted with

Marxism and Communism which denies the achievement of

industrialisation. According to his logic, we should not resort

to any industrialisation; we should not open up any factories or

do any business! That is a very negative way of thinking. The

stand of the Communists is that this should be so in their

struggle, because if they can bring all industries to a

standstill, then the people will be unemployed and there will be

discontent among them. The Communists can then take advantage of

this position in accordance with their so-called "revolutionary

activities". But if you take the history of the world in

general, you will see that in every country where there is a

genuine desire to build up its economy, an industrialisation

programme is a must; it is inevitable that such a programme

should be carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not to be denied that, as a result of the last one

year of Indonesian confrontation and the two occasions of

disturbances in Singapore, there has been some decline in

commerce and trade. Merchants and businessmen will tell you that

times now are not so good as they were before. Now what are we

going to do about it? Mr Speaker, we must first find out the

causes that have brought about this situation, and then we can

prescribe the medicine or find a remedy for them. Members of the

Barisan Sosialis have said that all these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>



difficulties have been brought about as a result of the

formation of Malaysia. On the face of it, this may be sp; but I

say that the matter is not so simple as they make it out to be.

Malaysia, basically speaking, is a healthy scheme which is

accepted and supported by the people of the four countries and

by many countries in the world. How can the Barisan Sosialis say

that the scheme to form Malaysia has brought about difficulties

is that the Indonesians are giving is trouble and, sad to say

the Barisan Sosialis are helping them to give us more trouble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, Malaysia and Indonesian should not interfere with

each other. Indonesia's economic bankruptcy shows up the

inability of their leaders. The economic prosperity of Malaysia,

on the other hand, is a blessing that we should be proud of. But

because the belligerent elements in Indonesia desire to swallow

us up and make use of Malaysia as an excuse, like West Irian, to

divert the attention of the Indonesian people from their

economic embarrassment and difficulties, they have therefore

resorted to giving us a great deal of trouble. Because of all

these factors that I have just mentioned, the Indonesian

belligerent elements, who are burning with ambition and who are

trying to put the blame for their economics bankruptcy on

others, have found a scape-goat in Malaysia, such difficulties

would still have befallen us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another factor is that the economy of Singapore is

dependent o the entrepot trade - it is an entrepot economy

basically speaking. As the Barisan Sosialis Members have said,

we have to live on an entrepot economy has its weaknesses.

Generally speaking, entrepot trade is doomed to decline in

South-East Asia, with or without the establishment of Malaysia. It is

only a matter of time when such a decline will come about. Mr

Speaker, Sir the first weakness of an entrepot economy is that

it is unable to maintain the livelihood of many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>



people. In a thinly-populated country, it may bring about an

ephemeral prosperity; but in a country where the population is

fast increasing, this kind of economy will not be able to

maintain its population, and there will be general unemployment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hong Kong is one of the famous entrepot ports in Asia, but

it is not only the entrepot trade that maintains the livelihood

of the majority of its workers but also the industries that have

been established there after the war.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the second weakness of an entrepot economy is that

it must necessarily depend on neighbouring countries. We cannot

have a big say or any say at all, as ours is an economy which is

dependent on others, If the economy of our neighbouring

countries is getting prosperous, then they will try to do away

with having to pay commissions to middlemen in entrepot ports;

entrepot ports will not be welcome by them. On the other hand,

if the economy of our neighbouring countries is on the decline

or even on the brink of bankruptcy, then their purchasing power

will be very much weakened and this again will bring about a

decline in our entrepot trade. So it cuts both ways. Furthermore

if our neighbouring countries are hostile, then it goes without

saying that we will lose all our entrepot trade with such

neighbours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one condition under which entrepot trade can

flourish and that is if all our neighbouring countries arc

colonies, so that we will be able to make a profit. This goes to

show that in this respect we can have no say. We have to depend

on our neighbouring countries to earn our livelihood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the last War, the entrepot trade in Singapore has

been declining. This is not because we have made enemies of our

neighbours who do not come to do any more business with us. It

is because after the War, many colonies, one after another,

became independent countries, and they want to maintain their

economic rights and do away with their dependency on foreign

entrepot ports. Even in the case of Malaya, before the formation

of Malaysia, it spent a large sum of money on the development of

its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>



own port - Port Swettenham - so that its dependency on the port

of Singapore may be reduced in spite of the better facilities

that we are able to offer it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, one can see clearly that every country thinks in terms

of its own interests. Every country tries to export its own

produce directly to foreign markets and also to buy directly

from such markets the consumer goods that they want, so that it

does not have to pay any commission at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, no country in the world will allow the

life-stream of its economy to be in the hands of foreign traders and

businessmen. So, even without the formation of Malaysia, it

would have been a matter of time when we would have to give up

our dependency on entrepot trade with Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the greater part of our trade with

Indonesia lies in barter trade. Actually, barter trade is a

euphemism for "smuggling". Even many years before confrontation

started, the Indonesian Government had asked us to stop this

kind of smuggling trade or business, because they had discovered

that it had contributed to their economic bankruptcy. The

Indonesian Government blamed the smugglers for their failure and

losses in the economic field. They felt that smuggling had

brought about big losses to the Indonesian economy. Indonesian

rubber in great bulk came into Singapore in this way and

Indonesia was therefore unable to earn any foreign exchange. Now

what has happened to the money that was earned'? The building of

the Indonesian Consulate in Singapore - the building which the

Prime Minister has referred to as "the building with a golden

roof" - cost about $2 or $3 million. Now, where did they get the

money to erect this building? Did the money come from the

Indonesian Government? No, because they have been in a state of

poverty as a result of inflation. How then could they have

afforded to pay hard cash to build such a glamorous and

wonderful Indonesian Consulate in Singapore? The money came from

Indonesian businessmen. Now, where did they get the money? Of

course,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>



wool comes from sheep; so, needless to say, the money came from

the sale of Indonesian local produce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From all this, one can see a number of anomalies. Indonesia

produces and sells rubber and yet it is in a state of poverty

and even on the brink of economic bankruptcy, so much so that

its people have to live on rats and corn. On the other hand, we

are only an entrepot centre and yet we enjoy economic prosperity

and even had a surplus from year to year. Of course, this annoys

Indonesia. So with or without Malaysia, in the event of

Indonesia trying to reshuffle its economic affairs, it must

necessarily try to stop this kind of business and trade. After

the formation of Malaysia, they found an excuse to stop all

trade with us over-night. In my view, even without Malaysia,

Indonesia would have severed trade relations with us step by

step.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Mr Speaker, is the general and inevitable economic

trend in South-East Asia. It is in the interest of every nation

to establish economic independence. So, how can one say that all

the present difficulties we are facing have been brought about

by Malaysia alone? The question now is whether we should have an

economy dependent on others or find another way to support

ourselves by our own means. If that is the question, then I say

that Malaysia's industrialisation programme, coupled with the

common market, is the one and only solution. As a result of the

failure of their businesses, some people think that Singapore

should withdraw from Malaysia and do business with Indonesia as

a neutral State. I say that this is impossible. If we withdraw

from Malaysia, irrespective of whether how long we can do

business with Indonesia, where do we actually stand? Assuming

that we did not join Malaysia, where would we be standing now?

Our country is too small to be independent. Even if we should

become independent, we would still have to depend on the

protection of foreign bases to survive and from being swallowed

up by our bigger neighbours. Foreign bases would still remain in

Singapore and they would continue to be an eye-sore, as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>



far as Indonesia is concerned. So confrontation again would be

inevitable and there would not be any business done between

Singapore and Indonesia. If, on the other hand, we did away with

all the foreign bases, then at once we would be swallowed up by

Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, whether military bases are here or not, we will be at a

disadvantage. Now if we do not emerge as an independent nation,

then in what form can Singapore emerge'! Bearing in mind that

Singapore is only a sniall island, are we going back to the

colonial days and living under the umbrella of British

colonialists? No, this will be putting back the clock. Are we

going to maintain neutrality? in that event, we shall be

sandwiched between two big neighbours, namely, Indonesia and

Malaysia. Now, have we got the power and the strength to stand

between two such neighbours?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is, strategically speaking, a very important

place, in the event of Malaysia and Indonesia struggling with

each other. So, either of these two will try to swallow us up.

In such an event, we would rather be with Malaysia than with

Indonesia, because we know the kind of life the Indonesians are

living. This is a difficult way towards nation building. These

are the difficulties we have to experience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has coined a slogan in his statement

which is very clear and short, i.e., through industrialisation

and a common market, we must lead our people Out of their present

economic difficulties. Our present task is two-fold. On the one hand,

we have to spend on social reforms within our revenue and lay the

foundation of a welfare State, so that the seeds of socialism may be

sown widely in the whole of Malaysia. On the other hand, we have

to try to tide over the present economic difficulties and withstand

Indonesian confrontation. This task is not easy, Mr Speaker, but we will

try our best to accomplish it. We are prepared to sink or swim

with the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the greatness of a nation or a people does not

lie in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>



military strength. I would say it lies in this - how the people

can accept the challenge of the day; how the people can

withstand the test of time. We shall not bow to our enemies and

we shall not succumb to our difficulties. Only in this way can

we stand in this world.



<br><br>5.52 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Dr Fong Kim Heng) in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I predict that the next

financial year will be more bleak and worse than this year's.

This year we have already had a $23 million deficit. I believe

that next year's deficit will exceed it. This is my

understanding on reading the Financial Statement and after

making an analysis of the Malaysia situation. No matter how the

Minister for Finance tries to negate the repercussions of'

Indonesian confrontation, the facts which cannot be covered up

are that we have had a trade recession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me make a comparison of the trade before and after

Indonesian confrontation. According to my data, for the first

quarter of this year, the export trade of Singapore was in the

region of $3,376.9 million in terms of value. But the figure for

the corresponding period of last year was $4,703.8 million.

Thus, there was a difference of $1,389 million. In exports, the

figure for the first quarter of this year was $881 million, and

the figure for the corresponding period of last year was $396

million. Thus, the increase was 31 per cent. According to

official statistics, before the Indonesian confrontation, the

total value of trade between Singapore and Indonesia was $90

million, 70 per cent of which was from Indonesia. The exports

from Singapore to Indonesia were 30 per cent. Taking an average

of $90 million a month, in one year the annual trade between

Singapore and Indonesia was in the region of $1,080 million.

Assuming that our businessmen could make a 15 per cent profit

out of it, there would be $162 million for our national income.

The loss of $16 million in our national income could only be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>



felt by the taxi-drivers and small businessmen and hawkers,

because they were directly hit by the trade severance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of our trade with Indonesia has stopped, apart from

some trade between Singapore and Hong Kong. According to my

estimate, the taxi-drivers have suffered a 40 per cent loss of

their income, and some hawkers have pulled down their pitches.

Some workers have not yet been able to find alternative jobs.

Businessmen have not been able to find alternative openings for

their capital. Throughout the whole island people are talking

about thrift. They want to be frugal in their food, clothing and

other daily necessities. They even want to be thrifty on enter

tainment. They have cut down their smoking, which has resulted

in a decrease in our revenue from entertainment and tobacco. All

this has been brought about by Indonesian confrontation. It has

also been brought about by the so-called happiness and

prosperity resulting from Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To restore trade between Singapore and Indonesia would be

beneficial to our people. All trade throughout the world is

based on mutual interest and mutual benefit. Without any

political strings, I believe that trade between Indonesia and

Singapore can be reestablished. The only obstacle in the way of

restoration of trade between Indonesia and Singapore is the neo

colonialist Malaysia and the sabotage carried out by the

Alliance Government and the P.A.P. Government. Unless the

Alliance Government and the P.A.P. Government correct their

mistakes, trade between Indonesia and Singapore will not be

restored. Our Government always abuse the Indonesian people by

saying that they eat rats and corn. This abusive language will

not help to solve our economic problem. The people of Singapore

will not derive any happiness from the fact that the Indonesian

people are eating rats. I feel that this is political

propaganda, to create a feeling of hostility towards the

Indonesian people. It is similar to the propaganda put out by

the Lim Yew Hock regime and the P.A.P. Government when they say

that the Chinese people on the Chinese



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>



mainland are eating the bark of trees and straws. Such cynical

propaganda will not help us anymore. What we are concerned about

is that trade between Singapore and Indonesia should be res

tored. According to the Minister for Finance, trade relations

between Singapore and Indonesia will not be solved next year.

Malaysia is now trying to arm itself by embarking on armament.

There are only two ways open to us. First, to seek a solution in

order to restore our trade; and secondly to make use of

armaments for mutual suicide. If we are asked to make a choice,

we will unhesitatingly choose the first one. I believe the

P.A.P. Government and the Alliance Government are not prepared

to do such things, because that would not be beneficial to them

as they are afraid to embark on this course. It will also not be

beneficial to the Anglo-American imperialists. The Party in

power is not going to solve our trade problems by a political

solution and abandoning the lines of Anglo-American imperialism

to change our foreign policy to implement inner democracy. I

believe that these are the things that we should do. We should

re-establish friendly relations between these two countries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Fong Kim Heng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> What is the Member's point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> This has nothing to do with the Budget

itself.



<br><br><!-- Dr Fong Kim Heng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Will the Member proceed with his speech

and stick to the financial policy of the Government?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

this is the only way to be free from the control of the big

Powers. It is not the way by which we should sell our country.

The Indonesian economic confrontation and its effects on our

people cannot be covered up. Lt is a brutal fact and a reality

and the Minister has tried to cover it up, because if it is made

known to the people, then they will rise up against him.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>



It also shows that the Party in power is not willing to solve

our problem. In his financial speech the Minister has talked

about the failure of Indonesian confrontation. But may I ask,

who is the victor'! It is a fraud on the people to say that we

have not been affected by Indonesian confrontation. To say that

we are the victor, what have we won'! On the contrary, we have

lost trade amounting to millions of dollars. Workers, hawkers

and taxi-drivers have suffered hardships. Can you term this as a

victory'! Now, when the P.A.P. talks about victory, it means

that the people are suffering. Therefore, we cannot deny that

the severance of trade between Singapore and Indonesia has done

greater harm to the people of Singapore. The Government should

find ways and means to solve this problem. It should pay

attention to this problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with the Budget. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

according to this year's Budget, there is a deficit of $23

million. The P.A.P. is forced to admit that this has been brought

about by Malaysia. The Minister for Finance may be anxious to

get two sums of money from the Central Government. The first sum

of money is the contribution by the Central Government to the

University of Singapore, namely, $12 million; and the other sum

of money is the profits of the Currency Board prior to the 31st

August, 1963. These two sums total $23 million. Even if these

sums of money were handed to Singapore, we would still incur a

deficit of $7 million, and it is doubtful whether the Central

Government will hand over these two sums of money to Singapore.

Moreover, we have to contribute 40 per cent of our State revenue

to the Central Government, amounting to $127 million. In the

past, the Minister boasted of a $50 million surplus, but from

this year onwards we will incur a $23 million deficit. Plus

these two sums, it means there is a deficit of $73 million. The

Minister has cautioned that we should be more careful in our

expenditure. This only shows that expenditure has increased so

much that revenue cannot catch up with it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, our contributions to the Central Government in

the fields of defence and other services have been too much. Mr

Deputy Speaker, Sir, the so-called too much expenditure and too

little revenue is not a very good pretext. Does the Minister

mean that certain revenues are being spent on unnecessary and

unworthy things? I feel that the reason is not merely that, but

that it is because we have been paying too much to the Central

Government. The Minister says that there has been a rapid

increase of expenditure. In fact, this should not occur. In

comparing the 1965 Budget with the 1964 Budget, there is an

increase of $13.7 million in expenditure. The expenditure for

1962 was $392.4 million. This figure, when compared with this

year's $326 million, shows an increase of $66 million, and is

$53 million more than that of next year. This shows that our

economy is retrograding and is not getting better. I will give

Hong Kong as an example. From 1951 to 1961 the Budget has

increased from $170 million to $1,010 million, an average of $90

million increase every year. According to our figures, we should

have increased by $40 million per year, but our estimate for

next year is $53 million less than that for 1962. How can the

Party in power explain this fact? One thing which we should

bear in mind is that our contribution to the Central Government

in respect of defence and other Federal Departments will cause a

bigger deficiency in our Budget. The results of the Alliance

Government's expansion in armament will naturally bring more bur

den to the people. The people of Singapore have no obligation to

share this burden, because they do not have equal citizenship

rights and cannot participate in decisions such as defence and

cannot attack the Central Government on any policy in this

field. In the event of war, I feel that it is not right for the

people of Singapore to shoulder such a responsibility to

contribute to the Federal Government. If the Federal Government

were to ask the people of Singapore to shoulder such an extra

burden, then the people of Singapore would have to tighten their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>



belts and there would be more suffering. Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, although the Minister for Finance has said that we should

contribute towards the defence of the Central Government, I do

not know whether it has been stipulated in the 40 per cent White

Paper arrangement. Perhaps it is over and above that. I want to

reiterate what the Minister has said to prove one fact. He has

mentioned in his Budget Speech that the main revenues are from

income tax, taxes on liquor, petroleum and tobacco, road tax and

estate tax - all this revenue belongs to the Central Government.

Therefore, any change in the rates of taxes by the Central

Government will have an influence and effect on our revenue.

Now it is very interesting to talk about the discretion to

change the rates of taxes. It also means that there will be a

change of 60 versus 40 per cent distribution of taxes. According

to the Central Government's economic plan, it is really to cut

the fat from the people of Singapore. As a result of changes in

the rates of taxes exercised by the Central Government,

Singapore's contribution will be increased from 40 per cent to

50 per cent. Thus the P.A.P. will have to explain to the people

such a sell-out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the P.A.P. whether next year the Central Government

will try to change the rates of taxes pertaining to Federal

revenue and whether, because of expenditure on armament, the

reserve fund of the Central Government has decreased. They are

talking about increasing taxes. Even trunk-call taxes will be

raised. And the Minister for Finance pretends that he does not

know anything about it! He says that at this stage we do not

know anything about the Federal Government's plan to change the

rate of taxation. Our revenue estimates have been based on our

assumption of the Federal decision on taxes. Does the Minister

mean that he does not know anything about the changes by the

Federal Government in respect of taxes? Does he mean that it is

a unilateral action exercisable by the Federation Government

alone, and that the P.A.P. Government does not know anything

about it? This only shows that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>



the P.A.P. is shirking its responsibility to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next year, our revenue will decrease by $1.7

million. According to what the Minister has said, it is because

currency profits and port dues have gone over to the Central

Bank. Now, this is concrete proof of the P.A.P.'s sell-out.

Perhaps next year there will be more factories asking the Min

ister to officiate at their opening ceremonies! But the main

economy of Singapore depends on entrepot trade, and such a

situation cannot be changed overnight to an industrial one.

Therefore, the reduction of entrepot trade would naturally

seriously affect the economy of Singapore. Yet the Party in

power, to cover up its weaknesses, is still claiming that

several factories will be opened every week. I should say that

the industrialisation policy should be coupled with the

reduction of those unemployed. The reduction in exports and the

increase in imports have caused an unfavourable economic balance

and have caused suffering to the workers. If the people allow a

large amount of foreign capital to come into Singapore, then

Singapore will only become a great factory for the foreign

capitalists and the workers will have to sell their labour to

such capitalists for very poor wages. The situation is already

clear at the Jurong industrial site. Their wages compared with

those for workers in other fields are very poor indeed. My

colleague has just mentioned that their wages range from fifty

cents to one dollar per day. Their situation is very difficult.

To use a phrase, they are in a state of semi-starvation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance has said

that the next financial year will be quite bleak. We can also

see that, because it is full of pessimism and we do not have any

optimistic evaluation of the situation. Perhaps the situation

may even get worse, much worse than what the Minister for

Finance has envisaged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want also to mention the hopes of the people of

Singapore. They hope that they can resume trade relations with

Indonesia as soon as possible. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>



Party in power should help local capitalists to industrialize.

In fact, the livelihood and living standards of the hawkers,

taxi-drivers, Government officers and teachers and farmers

should be raised. The Government should help them. It should

adopt a non-aligned policy, have close and friendly relation

ships with Afro-Asian countries, expand our trade, and establish

good neighbourliness with our neighbours. Thus there will be

hope for industrialisation in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

should like to congratulate the Minister for Finance on

presenting a Budget which appears to reflect the optimistic

outlook of the State and her readiness to overcome the economic

effects of Indonesia's confrontation. At the outset, the

Minister for Finance has understandably stressed the magnitude

of confrontation and the impact it has on the economy of Singa

pore. Nevertheless, he has also maintained that the economy

during the initial stages was able to recover from the after

effects of Indonesian confrontation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the Opposition Party, we do not deny that

confrontation has resulted in additional men and women being

thrown out of employment. We are fully aware of the fact that we

have to live with confrontation and, as such, the economy, to a

certain extent, has to be re-orientated in such a manner that we

can stand on our own feet and not depend on Indonesian trade

alone. Unlike the Barisan who want us to be slaves to trade with

Indonesia, we cannot afford to be a vassal of another foreign

country for the sake of trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have our own national dignity, prestige and pride

to be a part of an independent nation, that is, Malaysia. That

being the case, even though the curtailment of the trade between

our country and Indonesia has resulted in severe setbacks to the

economy, such offsets to the economy are only temporary in

nature and, as such, ways and means have to be found to overcome

them. I do not, for a moment, minimise the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>



significance of the adverse effects on the economy arising out

of the Indonesian economic blockade. We have to live with

confrontation and at the same time we must find ways and means

to reorientate our economy on a sound footing. In this

connection, Sir, the Malaysian common market which appears to be

still in the offing and which has not been fully implemented up

to now, should necessarily take effect immediately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Central Government, which has agreed to a Malaysian

common market, must honour its pledge specially at this juncture

when Singapore is badly in need of a catalyst to accelerate the

pace of economic activity, not only to recover from the economic

offsets but also to carry on the positive programme of in

dustrialisation. The Government at Kuala Lumpur should extend

its full co-operation to the State and permit the State's

economy to recover from its recent offsets. The Malaysian common

market, as far as Singapore is concerned, is a necessity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jurong Industrial complex will have no meaning at all

unless a market is assured for most of them in the Malaysian

region. In this connection, it is heartening to observe that the

industrialisation programme at the Jurong industrial estate and

the other measures taken by the Government to absorb the

unemployed have borne fruit. Nevertheless, I feel it is

essential that, before we plan our future and put our economy on

a sound footing or take measures on industrialisation

programmes, we should necessarily be aware of the prevailing

situation and the not too bright employment situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a representative of the people, Sir, practically every

week during the meet-the-people sessions, I am facing unemployed

youths who approach me with a hungry look and a pathetic

expression on their faces. I feel so unhappy, Sir. Since I am

not the Minister for Finance, I cannot quote a few figures to

convince them that the situation after all is not so bad. Unless

the State implements policies with an eye to employment op

portunities, these unemployed youngsters are bound to fall prey

to Communist propaganda, and we in turn are indirectly

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>



rendering a helping hand to recruit more youths to the Marxist

doctrine. Sir, this is indeed a grave situation and only a crash

programme will solve the unemployment situation. The State's

entire economy should be placed on a war footing, and no efforts

should be spared to see that the Government's programme for

industrialisation, with emphasis on a labour intensive approach,

should be implemented with the minimum of delay. I can observe

the shadow of Communism appearing on the Opposition benches of

the Barisan Sosialis, ready to grab our youths and make use of

them as guinea pigs to propagate ideals which are contrary to

our democratic principles.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Ministry of Culture's tirades against Communism will

not be effective unless they are supplemented by challenging

economic policies so that, in the eventual analysis, it will be

realised by the public at large that the Government's economic

measures have really resulted in a solution to the unemployment

situation prevailing in the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, when analysing the Budget in detail, I

find that, unlike previous years, this year's Budget appears on

the deficit side, but the days are gone when those who believed

in Gladstonian economy would applaud the Minister when he

submitted a surplus Budget. When public projects have to be

financed and when welfare economics gets more prominence, a

deficit Budget only reflects the amount of economic activity

that is going on in the State. As such, I would rather applaud

the Minister for Finance for presenting a bold Budget which

essentially caters for the interests of the common man in

Singapore. It also reflects the Government's determination to

utilise the resources of the country in such a manner that the

have-nots will eventually benefit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall not want to go further in detail since all of

us are in possession of a copy of the Budget speech, but a

thorough analysis makes one think for a moment that the

Government is going



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>



ahead with its gigantic programme for industrialisation and

reduction of unemployment. It is its intention to provide more

social services and also to ensure that children of school-going

age get the facilities to continue their studies. We must

understand that in this particular year, the State Government

has been subjected to additional strain. Still it is determined

to make an effort to establish a socialist pattern of society

within the framework of democracy. All-right thinking men inside

this Assembly as well as outside it should give their

unqualified support to the measures taken by the Government to

put the economy on a sound footing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Huan Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Huan Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to

speak only shortly on the direct factors causing the present

difficulties in our economic field. The 1965 Budget generally

says that the financial year shows that the recurrent $50

million surplus has gone. It says, with a note of despondency,

that the P.A.P. Government is not only unable to balance our

economy but also that there has been a deficit of some $20

million. The Minister for Finance, in sketching the picture,

says that the situation is rather severe, because in the short

space of one year after the formation of Malaysia, the Singapore

Government has to come from a state of surplus to that of a

deficit. Mr Speaker. Sir, the economic changes are drastic and

severe. Why should that be so? The Minister for Finance has not

dealt with the real causes, but it is not difficult for us to

find out what they are. First, there has been a decline in the

export and import trade. For the first half-year the import

total came to only $1,362 million. There was a difference of

$427 million. The export figures for the first half year show

that it was $881 million. Compared with the figure for last

year, there was a difference of some $396 million. This figure,

Mr Speaker, Sir, was only 31 per cent of last year's. It was

below some $823 million compared to the figures in the period

before Malaysia. This drop actually has been brought about by

Malaysia. That is the first point.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, Mr Speaker, Sir, is this. We have been

making -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Huan Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Huan Boon:</b> I will not give way because time is

running short. I have very little time left.[Interruption]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): We have been making too much contribution to

the Central Government. The contributions that we have to make

to the Central Government include the sum of $120 million which

we would not have to give away without Malaysia, and which we

could have used for our own people if Malaysia had not been

formed. Therefore, on the side of expenditure we would not have

to be so cautious as the Minister for Finance has suggested that

we should be. Thirdly, Mr Speaker, Sir, another factor of the

present economic difficulties is this. We have been rather weak

in the face of the Central Government. I can give you one clear

example to illustrate this point. The Minister for Finance in

his statement mentions that the severance of trade between

Singapore and Indonesia is a great blow to Singapore as far as

we are concerned, but he has not got the courage to suggest to

the Central Government to re-establish trade, and the barter

trade in particular, with Indonesia. When the Central Government

imposed this ban on barter trade, the people affected were very

unhappy and wanted the Central Government and the Singapore

Government to find a solution. According to estimates, there are

some 200,000 persons directly or indirectly affected by this ban

on barter trade. For the sake of our economic future, I urge the

Government to review the Malaysia scheme and break away from

foreign control before we can really solve our own problems.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, in his Budget

Statement the Minister for Finance says that tile present

economic situation is very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>



stable in spite of Indonesian confrontation, that it has not

affected us very gravely. I wish to show with facts that his

statement is only good-looking superficially. The people of

Singapore know that in the famous amusement parks like the Great

World and Happy World, business was very good at night. But in

the space of one year of Malaysia's formation, our so-called

prosperity has made the amusement parks rather quiet and

deserted. In one of the amusement parks, admission is now free,

but in spite of that, visitors are very few in number. Shops in

this amusement park have no business to do; some of them have

closed down. In the case of the Gay World, formerly known as the

Happy World, we can see that shops which were very busy in the

past have to close down and have to auction their furniture.

This is a good illustration to show the falsehood that our

economy is stable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, now we come to examine the extent of the

so-called stability of our economy. If you go to South Bridge

Road, you will see that there is one shop known as One Million

which was very flourishing and prosperous in the past, before

Malaysia. But after one year of Malaysia, in spite of the

so-called economic stability, this shop has to close down and some

of the goods have to be auctioned on the five-foot way. There

are other businessmen and merchants who have had to do less

business. They tried to recover their bad debts and do a minimum

of business. The business done this year has not been enough to

keep the shops going. They have to continue the wholesale

business in order to try to recover their old debts. We know

that in the business world of the Chinese community, it is a

matter of trust, and business is done on credit. The wholesalers

will give goods on credit to the retailers, so they have to

maintain a minimum wholesale business in order to try to recover

their debts from the retailers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us take a look at the rubber factories. What is the

situation! The Minister for Finance should let us know



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>



that there is widespread retrenchment in the

factories. He should tell the world how many workers have been

retrenched. In the past, business generally was quite brisk. But

there is now an anomaly. Instead of the shops doing good

business, we have more and more pasar malam. A lot of hawkers do

business in pasar malam. This should not be taken as a

reflection on the prosperity of the business world. On the

contrary, it shows that the shops and industries in Singapore

are on a trade decline. There are more and more hawkers in pasar

malam. Why should that be so? It is because many workers have to

leave their factories, and in order to earn a minimum

livelihood, they have no alternative but to buy some goods and

sell them at the pasar malam. Or some of the shopkeepers,

because of business failure, have to sell their goods on tri

cycles in the night markets. As a result of this, there are more

and more hawkers in the pasar malam and less and less

shopkeepers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, night in Singapore was full of life - busy,

with a lot of people going out to enjoy themselves. In fact, in

those prosperous days one could hardly distinguish between day

and night as far as activity and enjoyment were concerned. But

what is the present situation now'! Buses are not full, a lot of

taxi-drivers are without passengers, and less and less people go

out at night. So the so-called prosperity, in spite of In

donesian confrontation, is not as good as what the Minister for

Finance wants others to think.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about industrialisation, it is not in a position to

solve our economic ills. Can industrialisation enable

businessmen and investors to recover their capital? To what

extent is it beneficial to the workers? Can our local products

be competitive in price with foreign goods, whatever the source

of raw materials'! Where is the market for our local produce? At

a time when we have foreign bases in our country and when we are

making enemies with the world at large, how are we able to

expand our market for local produce? The Minister for Finance is

not able to give any answers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot deny that there are more and more houses in

Singapore. But, on the other hand, there are more and more

people losing their homes in fires. The lower income group is

not able to occupy beautiful flats. The building industry is not

in a position to create more employment opportunities for the

poor people. So the poor people cannot afford the rent to stay

in flats. They would rather stay in attap huts, because they can

only afford a low rent. So the construction programme is of no

benefit to the poor people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about overhead bridges and parking lots, these

measures are to some extent helpful to traffic. But this is of

minor importance, because we must first fill our stomach with

food. The multistorey car park is of no use to a starving

population. The people cannot fill their stomach with the

beautiful overhead bridges, like the Bailey bridge at Clifford

Pier. So we feel that the failure of the Government to give a

reasonable means of livelihood to the people is attributed in a

large measure to the loss of our entrepot trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a new People's Government is not established, and so

long as the present Government is still under the control of the

British, it is no use talking about industrialisation when we

are not politically independent. The port of Singapore is coming

to the end of its prosperity. If we do not scrap all the pacts

that we have signed with foreign countries, and if we do not toe

the line of the non-aligned Afro-Asian countries, then whatever

plans you may have for industrialisation you cannot carry them

out because you do not have sufficient raw materials and a big

market for your products. Malaya and our neighbours will not

help us to expand our market for local manufactures, and even if

Malaya is prepared to give us some market, do you think that it

can accommodate all the produce that we can manufacture here?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present moment, the question of a common market has been

highlighted by the Singapore and the Federation Governments.

They think that the common market will provide a good outlet for

our manufactured



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>



products. I say that so long as neocolonialism is not done away

with, a common market is of no help to the poor people.

Merchants in Singapore will, with the advent of the common

market, lose a lot of business in entrepot trade. More and more

people will have to pay higher prices for consumer goods, and

foreign goods at competitive prices will be blocked by the

common market. So if you want to enjoy cheap and good products,

you have to pay more, otherwise you will be forced to buy local

produce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If industrialisation can really solve the problems of the

people, then we will give it our support. But the future of

industrialisation is very bleak. How many merchants and workers

can the industrialisation programme accommodate - all these

people who have been affected adversely by Indonesian con

frontation'! To solve the problem of the people of Singapore, I

feel that it is important that we should come to a certain

understanding with the nations in South-East Asia. We must shake

away from the influence of the British and the Americans, and we

must establish friendship with nations of South-East Asia. We

must re-establish the trade ties that existed before Malaysia.

This is the only concrete way.



<br><br>6.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one expects the Opposition

at Budget time to make the most of its opportunity to paint the

worst possible picture of the health of the country. And at the

end of it all - if it is a democratic and constructive Opposition

- one should hear how things could be made better, why some of

the things that we have been doing have not been enough, and how

they can be improved upon. From our Barisan opponents, we get

one consistent refrain - Malaysia is a neo-colonialist scheme;

Malaysia has brought disaster to the people; nothing will

resolve our problems: not the common market, not this capitalist

way in which more money will be made by big business. They play

only the neutral line: that the dissolution of Malaysia, somehow



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>



or the other, will become a chung li kuo chia (neutral), that

all will be well, and that the Indonesians will leave us alone

if we start trade with them. Ultimately, according to the Member

for Tampines, who hinted the way to do it is to have a real

Communist economy where there will be no unemployment and where

everybody will be put to work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the other Member of the Opposition, the Member for

Hong Lim, there is the usual opportunist tailism. He harks back

with nostalgia to colonial days when all was well. When we were

in charge of the Police, the policeman saluted the Prime

Minister, and even the Mayor. But now all the powers are gone.

We have been emasculated. We have been robbed. The country is

going to the dogs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me try to put, not just to the

Opposition but to Singapore at large, what were the two extremes - the best we could have had for Singapore and the worst which

may yet come about if we do not watch out. Paradise for

Singapore would have meant a common market, no charges for water

supply, full trade with Indonesia, with Malaya and the rest of

the world, the continuance of our bases, and independence

guaranteed by some mutual or multi-lateral defence pact. That

would have provided us with the ideal - paradise. No need for

defence commitments; we just keep one Infantry Battalion for

ceremonial purposes. In the colonial days we did not even have

to do that. We got the British to pay for all that. They

defended us because it was their territory. But, unfortunately,

the world does not owe Singapore a living. The Indonesians do

not have to trade with us. And we knew as early as 1959 that it

was their intention, at the first convenient opportunity, to cut

off their trade with us. And every year our man in Jakarta gave

us regular reports of their plans to cut off this trade sooner

or later. Hence the importance in all those years of finding a

more permanent and stable basis of survival.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tell the Members opposite what would have happened if we

did not take the precautionary measures that we did if we did

not get a common

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>



market. If we had zig-zagged in the reckless and dangerous

fashion of politics in Singapore of the 1950s, not only would we

have confrontation with no trade with the Indonesians, but worse - we might have "double confrontation" with no trade with Malaya

or Sabah or Sarawak, no common market, and with water problems.

And to cap it all, if we were to follow the wishes of the

Barisan Sosialis and abolish British bases, it would mean that

one-quarter of the whole economy would be gone. There would be

50,000 unemployed tomorrow. Then we would really hit rock

bottom. I am not suggesting that one year after Malaysia we are

bouncing with prosperity. We are realists. When confrontation

came, we worked out the figures. The total amount of trade we

did with Indonesia was 20 per cent of our total entrepot trade.

I was curious to ask the Member for Bukit Merah where he got his

figures from, because immediately after confrontation, we

decided to publish no further figures in order that we should

not help the Indonesians to know how much of their rubber or

copra still comes back, either by barter traders in small craft

or via Hongkong and Japan. Definitely for the last year, as can

be seen from the revenue, they did not knock us out for the full

20 per cent of the entrepot trade. How much they did knock us by

is their guess-work, because we have not published our figures.

But definitely not by 20 per cent. If today we were still a

self-governing Singapore, without a common market, we would be facing

a much more acute situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us be quite frank about this, Mr Speaker, Sir,I have

said this once publicly - it has not been picked up in some of

the Press - that feelers have been sent out to me that the In

donesians would resume trade if we backed out of Malaysia. They

have sent all kinds of feelers, and this is one of them. I ask

the Members opposite, and I ask the people at large, to

calculate. Where does our long-term interest lie? Not just the

day after tomorrow. Five years hence, ten years hence, 20 years!

Suppose we are out of Malaysia the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>



day after tomorrow; so the trading craft come back; so we are

all friends again. Is that the end of the story! For the last

seven years, the Indonesian Consul-General and his Consulate

staff here have spent a great deal of effort in setting up

little nests of support, not for a flourishing independent

Singapore, but for the kind of movement which they prematurely

triggered off last year, before their plans were fully matured.

I sent back an answer to that feeler. I said, "Do you object to

British bases in Singapore?" There was no answer. Tile line is

the official line. "Why are we against Malaysia! Because it is a

neocolonialist plot which threatens Indonesia." "How is

Indonesia threatened?" "Because the British bases are in Singapore." Now, these bases in Singapore will be objectionable

whether we are in Malaysia or whether we are out of Malaysia.

Simple, is it not? So we move out of Malaysia. So the bases are

still as objectionable. Then what happens?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I congratulate the Barisan Sosialis on being

consistent, which the Member for Hong Lim never has been. They

want Malaysia scrapped. They are against it, lock, stock and

barrel. There will be paradise only when this whole

neo-colonialist society is scrapped and they build afresh their

Communist millennium. Yes. Let us be frank about it. The Member

for Hong Lim knows that he is in trouble in that situation. He

has got no chance of running around with wild men. He can only

talk wild. But these people can act wildly. That is the big

difference. And he knows it makes more sense with merger. But he

says, "Merger on equal terms." That is a new one, Mr Speaker,

Sir. "No power," says he. "All gone." I thought we went through

all that very carefully. What he intended last time was what the

Barisan Sosialis asked for - complete merger, in toto. Today we

would not even be spending one whole day debating a budget of

$350 million. Education in the Central Government, Health in the

Central Government, Fire Brigade, the whole works. We need only

spend half an hour, Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Town Council of

Singapore. It is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>



as simple as that. And we get a capitation grant for one year of

$10 million from the Central Government to run this. So we may

even have to reduce the allowance of Members of this Assembly.

It will be very sad indeed. The Member for Hong Lim knows the

stark realities, that in this wider framework of Malaysia, there

is no longer the possibility of what I would call the lunatic

fringe in politics coming up on top. There is more balance.

There is more body generally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me pick up some of the points made by the Member

for Hong Lim, because he has a flair for torturing any truth

into an untruth. He said, "Everything fails under the P.A.P.

except housing." This is because of his great genius in

discovering the man for this job, who can even build 30,000

flats a year. No trouble at all. He said that our

industrialisation programme at Jurong was all a matter of

opening ceremonies. Mr Speaker, Sir, - this is also in answer

to the Barisan Sosialis - nearly 150 pioneer certificates have

been issued in the short time after the merger referendum and

Malaysia Day. Just over one year! The hulk of it was in that

area, where people would calculate on the basis of a market of

over 10 million people. That is why the Member for Hong Lim is

right. There have been no new pioneer certificates because

everybody took them out straightaway. But there are still 45 now

being processed. They are putting up their details to see

whether they qualify for pioneer treatment. In production today

are 43 factories holding pioneer certificates with a total

employment capacity of 6,687. Under construction with pioneer

certificates already granted are 54 factories. Staff complement

in full production will be 9,331. Non-pioneers now in the

pipe-line process, 11. Total employment capacity at total production.

4,000. The 45 pioneers now being processed - I have mentioned

that - have another capacity of 7,000. So there is a total

employability capacity of 27,000. All this would not have

happened, Mr Speaker, Sir, without Malaysia. Let us be quite

frank about it. We did not go in because we owed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>



anybody anything. We went in because we wanted something for

ourselves. The world did not owe us a living. We did not owe

Malaya a living. Neither did they owe us a living. But they

either kill themselves trying to crush Singapore, or we kill

ourselves trying to undermine them, or we try and make a go of

it together with Sabah and Sarawak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me sum up the long-term position in this way. We may

have to go through a fairly difficult period before we emerge

from the doldrums. It is something like the early 1959, 1960,

1961 periods. The effects of the common market cannot be felt

for at least four to five years. If we do not succeed; if, in

fact, the arrangements within Malaysia are not worked out in a

fair and equitable way, as was suggested by the Member for Hong

Lim, then we shall have to face a new situation. Let us be the

first to acknowledge to the Barisan Sosialis that the day

Singapore turns sour within Malaysia, that day they have won;

because from that day onwards, if Singapore really goes out, Mr

Speaker. Sir, and it really says, "Out with Malaysia," and there

is a popular demonstration for that, then for the first time the

Indonesians have a hook on Malaysia. Then for the first time, if

they are really helping to liberate the people, they can sell

it. And that is the beginning of the end for Malaysia and for

the lot of us. We are hoping that logic, reason and common sense

will prevail. That nobody can afford to allow this to fail for

their own self-interest. That this thing must be worked out in

an equitable and just way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one good point made in the whole of this afternoon's

debate was the one that, in fact, by giving 40 per cent of our

national taxes, we are giving more than just paying for the Federal Departments in Singapore. That is correct. We calculated

that the right amount - the quantum was 27 per cent

plus our share of External Affairs (Parliament,

negligible), might make it up to 30 per cent. We went in on the

basis of good faith. And there is a proviso - it is part of the

Constitution - that every two years it will be reviewed,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>



and if no agreement is reached between the Singapore Government

and the Central Government, the World Bank will send an

arbitrator. We have deliberately not brought this into the

foreground of our Budget debate because we have no desire to

have more bones of contention between the Central Government and

Singapore. Let us try to make this thing work. I am quite sure

that if there comes a time when we cannot agree, we will have to

go to arbitration with the World Bank. But that one valid point

was completely obliterated by a heap of malice and untruths. I

need only take one simple example. It is fatuous and yet it is

surprising how - if one allows these lies to be repeated

constantly - people may actually believe it. "The iron and steel

mill in Jurong was a flop," said the Member for Hong Lim. It is

only a scrap mill and we had to stop scrap iron from being

exported. So people lost jobs. Then we banned the import of

steel bars in order that they can sell. But first, Mr Speaker,

Sir, any businessman who has been following the stock market

will know that the production of this steel mill, which was one

of the first projects in Jurong to get started, was unable to

satisfy demand, and it makes hefty profits. In order to satisfy

its customers, it enlisted the support of the Government to give

it the right to buy scrap iron at market prices, whatever our

dealers could get on export, plus 10 per cent, in order that it

shall have this raw material. They have now started construction

on the second furnace. But if one were to listen to the Member

for Hong Lim, the whole world is crashing. It is all wrong. His

politics consist of the big give and the big lie. Said he, we

have given away $70 million to the Federation. It is nothing

like that, Mr Speaker, Sir. We can work out the figures very

carefully. I am not saying the sum is negligible. In fact, it

will be quite an important factor in our discussions with the

Centre, beginning from the first half of next year as the review

comes in. But he would just shower largesse all round. Do away

with licence fees, up the personal assistance for unemployment

from $10

million to $20 million, build more hospitals, build more

polytechnics, do all the wonderful things in life, do away with

radio licences, taxi licences and the whole world. That is how

he runs politics. That is how we had to do a rescue operation

very quickly before there was a run on the bank. But I suggest

to the House and the country that we are somewhere between

Utopia and Hell. The Utopia I have already outlined, where the

world owes us a living, Mr Speaker, Sir. The British keep their

bases here and tail it off gently over 30, 40, 50 years, to keep

our economy boosted up, common market, trade with Indonesia,

trade with Malaya, trade with the whole world, all bouncing.

Real perdition - failure of the common market, break-up of

Malaysia, confrontation, double confrontation also with Malaya,

to mutual harm, and the final abolition of British bases as part

of this general collapse of the region. These are things which,

as of this given moment, are fanciful. But if we allow such men

a free run and they are really allowed to do what they want to

do, that is where we will all end up - down at the bottom of the

cesspit. All that has happened at this moment is that we have

lost part of tile 20 per cent entrepot trade, part of 8.7 per

cent of our national income, and of the given rate of growth

that we were having before Malaysia, over 4 per cent per annum.

In two years we make it up; and we may yet make it up. It may

yet be the privilege of the Minister for Finance to announce to

the House in next year's Budget that we have got back to the

1963 position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest to the country at large that our first job now is

to make the best of this given situation. We keep what we get

and consolidate on it and build up. If there is more reckless

talk, if investors really believe that the Barisan can succeed

in making Singapore go sour on Malaysia, then that is the end.

What is the point of the common market? What is the point of

building factories?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was enchanted as I listened to the Member for Tampines.

He was so carried away with wanting to denounce us for the

present that he forgot that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>



the picture of the happy days he painted when the Happy World

was humming with music, the Great World was humming with people

and not as of now, well, those happy days were just a couple of

years ago under a PAP. Government, which he was merrily de

nouncing and hoping to bring the House down with it. He has

forgotten all that. This is not confrontation. This is one of

the side effects of confrontation. The riots that took place,

communal disturbances. Let me tell the Member for Tampines to

calculate, to revaluate his chances of survival. Without the

British bases here, without any other major power able to send

their navy into the region to help him, and with the Indonesians

with a pipeline on large pockets of our own population, having a

riot every other week, which would be construed to the whole

world as the desire of the oppressed people, the indigenous

peoples of the region seeking freedom, bringing upon us a

liberation army from our neighbours - that is where he will end

up. But, unfortunately, Mr Speaker, Sir, if we allow that to

happen, that is also where we will land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I commend to the House the realistic policies that have

been pursued by the Finance Minister in trying to get the best

berth to Utopia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young (Thomson)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Koo Young, you have just five minutes.



<br><br>7.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime

Minister just now has been venting himself exceedingly. Because

they thought up this Malaysia as a kind of fancy, so far up till

now, it has been one year. He says that the things that we have

talked about are irrelevant to the issue, for saying that

Malaysia has been useless. He points out that even if Malaysia

were not established, Indonesia would continue with

confrontation. They have thought of another explanation. They

say that they want to go through with industrialisation and the

common



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>



market in order to get rid of the dependence of the entrepot

trade economy on other things. If the Party in power want to get

rid of such an economy and change Singapore's economy and in

dustrialise, then we will agree. But how do they go about it!

They say, get rid of such an economy. But, in fact, they have

entered into the economic trap of the capitalist countries. Can

the Minister for Finance resolve this situation in which

Singapore's economy is dependent on foreign countries?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Minister for Labour has said, "Look at Hong

Kong. It is one of the largest entrepots in SouthEast Asia and

it is supporting itself by industrialisation." But I would point

out to him that this example is irrelevant. If Hong Kong is a

relevant example, then Singapore is also a colonial economy. How

can you compare Singapore with Hong Kong? Hong Kong is a colony.

Therefore, that is something which is not correct. I would like

to ask him whether the Members on the P.A.P. side have studied

the actual industrialisation process of Hong Kong? It has

suffered from the exploitation of foreign capitalists. The

British Labour Government, once they have assumed power, have

immediately put up a 15 per cent surcharge and the Hong Kong

industrialists have suffered most. If Singapore were to follow

Hong Kong's example, then our industrialisation policy would not

achieve its purpose and would fail. So our policy should be

according to the desires of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the present P.A.P.'s pioneer industries. Whom

do they help to make money? They can only help the foreign

capitalists, providing them with facilities to enable them to

invest here, to exploit Singapore's workers, to seize the

profits in this region - [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If the Prime Minister keeps on

uttering irrelevant remarks, then I have to ask the Speaker to

extend my time --- [Laughter] You do not have to laugh.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>



Is the Minister for Finance willing to give me five more

minutes?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It is the Prime Minister who is

laughing, not "you" who are laughing. The Member must refer to

him as the "Prime Minister".



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If we were to go according to

the present industrialisation policy of the P.A.P., then the

objective of getting rid of our economic dependency will never

be realised. Countries formerly under ---



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the Member please resume his seat?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Goh, in reply, in accordance with

paragraph (4) of Standing Order No. 82.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, first, may I meet the point made by several Members of the

Barisan Sosialis that the P.A.P. Government has been trying to

conceal from the public the effects of confrontation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my Budget Speech in Hansard of 2nd November, at

column 126, I gave the full facts up to date of the recorded

decline in trade, and I am very pleased to hear that two Members

of the Barisan Sosialis have quoted from the figures that I

gave, without however reminding the House of the proviso that

these figures do not include the unrecorded trade in the barter

boats or through third countries. Last year, I gave details of

the expected decline of trade resulting from confrontation and

of our total trade and national income from Indonesia. There has

been no attempt by us to bluff tile public, because in an open

society such as ours, truth will emerge. And it is because we

have taken the precaution, well before confrontation took place,

of trying to forecast its effects that we were able to mount the

countermeasures which had reduced the severity of confrontation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, three Members of the Barisan Sosialis made the point

that our industrialisation programme is not in the interests of

the country, because it enables foreign monopolistic capital to

intensify the exploitation of local workers. This is a very

familiar phrase. Mr Speaker, Sir, if you read Marx and Lenin on

"Imperialism, the Last Phase of Capitalism", you will find all

these phrases. So the policy of the

P.A.P. Government is to intensify the exploitation of our

workers by the introduction and encouragement of foreign

monopolists and capitalists!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as the workers are concerned, the fact that there

are now 4,600 workers in Jurong - both in factories and in

construction work  - means nothing to the Barisan Sosialis. The

fact that these 4,600 workers might otherwise be unemployed is

meaningless to them. The fact that these factories are run by

private enterprises means, by definition, that workers have been

exploited! Now, it is in fact a Marxist dogma that, by

definition, the mere fact that an employer uses workmen means

that the workers are being exploited, regardless of whether they

are being paid a fair wage, the market wage, or not. I do not

think you will find this sort of dogma popular, except in

Russia. But what is more to the point is that the Barisan

Sosialis - not Mr Ong Eng Guan, who knows the facts - say that it is -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Hong Lim.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I beg your pardon; I meant the Member for Hong

Lim. He knows. As an accountant, he has been studying the

prospectuses of new companies and so on, and he knows that the

majority of capital ownership in the pioneer industries is in

local hands and that, in fact, overseas capital forms a minority

section of capital ownership in our new industries. Therefore,

the allegation by the Barisan Sosialis that we are allowing

foreign capitalists to exploit our workers or to make large

profits which they remit out of the country is completely base

less. It is no use making and repeating



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>



such slogans, that foreign monopolistic capital is being allowed

to mount a stranglehold on our economy. What are the facts and

figures? Let me have their list - pioneer industries,

ownership of foreign capital. Only then, on that basis, can they

substantiate their allegation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Jurong - I can assure you, Mr Speaker,

Sir, that he is going to lose at the next election in Jurong.

That is absolutely certain. I can assure you that 5,000 to

10,000 workers at Jurong will have listened to what he has said

and will vote him Out of office. [Laughter] Now, he says, "Do

not let these people take their proceeds or profits on their

investment abroad." As I said, first of all, the majority of

capital ownership in pioneer industries belongs to our local

businessmen or what they call "national capitalists" to

distinguish them from "foreign monopoly capitalists". Minority

participation is from overseas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): On a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I should like to ask the Minister

for Finance whether he can give us the exact figures to prove

his point.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am speaking from memory on the proportional

rights, but in terms of equity-ownership, that is, ownership of

share capital, my recollection is something like 55 per cent

local, and 45 per cent foreign. In terms of total capital

investment, both loans and working capital, the proportion may

be something like 60 to 40. But the Member for Hong Lim has

asked for a detailed list - which will take some time to prepare

- of each pioneer industry, where they are located, who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>



owns them, how much is foreign capital, how much is local

capital, what they are producing, how many people are employed.

where they are sited - a whole lot of information; and he is

going to get quite a thick volume. I will not on that occasion

read out the whole list, but these are facts open to

examination. We are not in the habit, like the Member for Hong

Lim, of telling fibs. We are a responsible Government, and it is

not our policy to fib.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis Member for Bukit Panjang says there is

an easy way out of the economic problem, if only we will find a

peaceful solution with Indonesia. Come to terms with them, and

we will do trade and we will all be prosperous and happy again;

and he thinks that is a better way, a better alternative to the

warlike approach. First of all, Mr Speaker, let us get this

clear. Who is waging war on whom? Are Malaysia and Singapore

waging war on Indonesia? Are we sending our soldiers, our

troops, across the Straits of Malacca to massacre the

Indonesians, or is it the other way round? Who is waging war?

We are being attacked. Bombs have been exploded in Singapore.

Troops have been sent across to Johore, Malacca. Indonesian

troops are crossing the borders of Sabah and Sarawak. Why does

not the Member for Bukit Panjang condemn the Indonesians for

their aggression?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Shame!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Instead he is saying that it is the P.A.P.

Government in Singapore and the Alliance Government in Kuala

Lumpur who are taking a warlike attitude in this matter. Where

are the facts? Are they speaking on behalf of President

Soekarno? [Laughter]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was having discussions with Indonesian Foreign

Office officials twice in Bangkok, and once in Tokyo, even they

did not have the effrontery to suggest that Malaysia is taking a

warlike attitude towards Indonesia, that we are waging war

against them. In the United Nations in New York they say: "Yes,

of course, we are sending our paratroopers into Malaysia, and it

is right to do so." Even the Indonesians do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>



dare to go as far as the Member for -Bukit Panjang in

suggesting that it is we who want to wage war against the

Indonesians, and not the Indonesians who are actually waging war

against us. So he says: "Let us have a peaceful solution."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already mentioned a few days ago - last week, in

fact - that it is easy to come to terms with Indonesia, and that

is to surrender. Quite easy. It goes on this basis - to disarm,

no troops, they will do trade with you, the Consul-General will

come here. Then when you are absolutely defenceless, the

Indonesian Army crosses the Straits of Malacca, occupy the

place, then what happens? Is that the sort of thing he wants?

Does he welcome the occupation of Singapore by the Indonesian

Army? Or does he think that if we are completely defenceless,

the Indonesian Army will not come across?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, two and a half years ago, we invited no

less than General Nasution to dinner at Sri Temasek and he was

quite taken in by the appointments, the rather elegant decor of

Sri Temasek, the large spacious grounds he viewed around the

Istana. And he asked us: "How many troops have you got?"

[Laughter] Of course, at that time we had only one

battalion - 750 men. I thought there was quite a look in his eye -

of a man making a very quick calculation. The result, of

course, was that

we decided to have another battalion.[Laughter]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim has got the capacity for making

reckless statements, which he knows are completely untrue. The

Prime Minister has nailed a few untruths. I propose to deal with

a few more in order that his reputation as a reckless purveyor

of falsehoods will never be forgotten. A few minor points.

First, he says in the last year or so bank deposits have gone

down. The reverse has happened. Bank deposits have gone up. He

says that private housing construction has gone down. The

reverse is true. Private housing construction has gone up. He

says we spent hundreds of millions of dollars on Jurong - it was

a flop. We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>



have not spent hundreds of millions of dollars on Jurong. We

spent $54 million on Jurong. Then he says that after six years

of effort only 20 factories are in production in Jurong. The

fact is that the first factory in Jurong went into production on

1st January this year. And the others have gone into production

in the 9 or 10 months intervening. Then he says that, as a

result of our revision of export of scrap, hundreds of people

have been unemployed. Nobody has been unemployed. The scrap busi

ness has increased in prosperity for two reasons. One, the steel

mill, which he says is a bankrupt outfit, is buying more scrap

than the dealers can supply. Two, they are paying a higher price

than they could have got by exporting it to Japan. Then he says

there is a rolling-mill in Bukit Timah which, if expanded at

very small cost, would have achieved the capacity of the

National Iron and Steel Mill in Jurong. The Member for Hong Lim

has neither been to the Bukit Timah Steel Mill nor the Jurong

site. If he had, he would not have made this completely idiotic

assertion. These are two different categories.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> And loans to Sabah and Sarawak!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, loans to Sabah and Sarawak. One is a

hand-operated re-rolling mill where you cut strips from

ship-breaking plates, and do it the cumbersome way. The other one is

a fully automatic rolling mill with a 20-ton capacity electric

furnace; and another fully automatic re-rolling mill. Total

re-rolling and rolling capacity in the Jurong Steel Mill is

something in the region of 90,000 to 100,000 tons. The Bukit

Timah mill cannot handle more than 10 per cent - rather less

than 10 per cent of that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, loans to Sabah. Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Jurong

said, paying all these monies, how many workers have been sent

there? $30 million loan. The answer is quite simple. That pay

ment has not been made because the terms of workers going to

Sabah have not been settled. So there will be a quid pro quo.

Surely, Mr Speaker, Sir, when a wealthy nation like the United

States



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>



of America, or, if the Barisan do not like America, then a

powerful industrial power like the Soviet Union, lends money,

they get something for it; either politically, in the case of

the Soviet Union, or in business, in the case of the Americans.

If you get my loans, then you do not buy other people's goods.

And these are not interest-free loans. These are loans where you

pay interest. So when we extend interest-free loans to Sabah and

Sarawak, it is only a fair condition that they must help us to

resolve our unemployment problem. And now I am happy to say

that discussions are being held between officials of the

Singapore Government, the Central Government, and the Govern

ments of Sabah and Sarawak to work out the details of this

arrangement. I hope that before long, satisfactory solutions

acceptable to all parties will be reached.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim says, in making his calculation of

how much by way of 40 per cent contribution from national taxes,

that the interest-free loan costs us $2 million. He has made a

mistake - a simple error of calculation. You will remember that

he said that the imputed interest on a $30 million interest-free

loan is $2 million, which means that he will have to charge a

rate of interest of something like 6½ per cent on $30 million,

which will give you $2 million; whereas the market rate of

interest for long-term Government loans is of the order of 5½

per cent. I just make this point in passing. Anyway, from his

calculations, he stated that the Federation of Malaya is making

a profit of $65 million. Well, this contribution is to meet two

elenients in the expenditure of the Central Government. One, non-

defence expenditure, such as the Foreign Office, the Parliament;

that sort of thing. It does not cost much. And the other one is

defence expenditure. As the Prime Minister has said, when we

agreed to 40 per cent of national taxes, it was our view that

that figure was too high. From our computations then, we thought

that a lower percentage would be a fair discharge of Singapore's

responsibilities



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>



towards certain expenditures which every State of Malaysia must

bear. The Federal Government's representatives thought that it

should be 60 per cent, and then the figure of 40 per cent was

arrived at as a compromise between the two starting positions.

Now, of course, the figure may be too high, as we think it is,

or it may be too low, as Kuala Lumpur think it is. But we can

only decide after the actual expenditure on Malaysian defence is

known, and it will be known after the end of this year. Then it

would be far more easy for us to have some idea of what would be

a fair contribution, or it would certainly be easier for an

arbitrator to arrive at a percentage after hearing both sides of

the case. The trouble about the premerger financial negotiations

was this. The Federal Government were working on a long-term

projection of an increase in defence expenditure. Expenditure

had not been incurred and there was some doubt as to the actual

amount that would be incurred; but after the end of this year,

there will be no doubt as regards the quantum. And a fair

division of the proportion of our contribution can then be

arrived at. Because of this, it is certainly untrue and com

pletely malicious for the Member for Hong Lim to suggest that

the amount contributed must go up from $65 million in 1965 to

$75 million in 1966, to $85 million in 1967. On this matter, I

suggest, with respect, that the Member for Hong Lim has been

talking through his hat in the same way as he has suggested that

the present business and economic conditions are hardly better

than those during the Japanese occupation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Mr Speaker, Sir, I have replied to most of the

important points raised by Members of the Opposition, except, I

think, for various curious points made by the Member for Bukit

Panjang. He deplores what he calls our abuse of tile

Indonesians, their great friend, Soekarno, the great leader of

Indonesian confrontation. He says it is wrong for us to say that

Indonesians are eating rats and corn. It is not we, the P.A.P.

or Malaysians, who say that they are eating rats and corn. It is

President Soekarno who urges every Indonesians to eat corn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>



And it is Aidit, the Secretary-General of the Indonesian

Communist Party, who said that every patriotic Indonesian should

eat rats. And President Soekarno went so far as to say - and

this is on record, Mr Speaker, Sir - "If I were to tell the

Indonesian people to eat stones, they would eat stones." Sir,

this is not our propaganda. The Member for Bukit Panjang likens

these statements of ours to what Mr Lim Yew Hock said about the

Chinese people. It is completely different. We are just quoting

what the Indonesian leaders asked their own people to do.

Perhaps if confrontation lasts long enough, the Indonesian

people may yet have to follow President Soekarno's injunction to

them to eat



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>



stones. When that time is reached, I am quite sure that the

Barisan Sosialis will be more chastened than they are now.
