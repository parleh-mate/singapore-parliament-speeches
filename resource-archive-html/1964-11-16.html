<div align="center"><b>BUS SERVICE FOR JALAN BAHAR</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister whether he

is  aware that there is no bus route along Jalan Bahar off Jurong

Road  13½  milestone and whether a bus service can be authorised

to serve that area.



<br><br><!-- Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid (Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister (Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid) (for the Deputy Prime Minister)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the competent authority for the licensing of

bus  services  is the Omnibus Services Licensing Authority.  This

Authority  is  established under the Omnibus  Services  Licensing

Authority  Ordinance, 1956, and is charged with the  function  of

considering  applications  from bus  companies  for  licences  to

operate  bus services within the State of Singapore. It has  full

discretion in granting or refusing to grant a licence in  respect

of  any  bus route. In exercising its discretion, it is  required

under the Ordinance to take into account, among other things, the

suitability of the route on which a service is to be provided and

the  extent  to which the proposed services are necessary  or  desirable in the public interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, Jurong Road is served by the Green Bus Co., Ltd.

operating from its town terminus at Queen Street, up to the  18th

milestone,  Jurong.  No  application has  been  received  by  the

<div align="center"><b>QUARTERS FOR PUBLIC DAILY-RATED EMPLOYEES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs C. V. Devan Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mrs C. V. Devan Nair</b> asked the Minister for Finance (a)

whether  he  is aware of the undertaking given by the Government,

contained  in a collective agreement with the Public Daily  Rated

Employees'  Unions  Federation in 1961, that  quarters  would  be

built  for public daily-rated employees every year; (b) how  many

such quarters have been built by the Government over the last two

years;  and  (c) what the Government proposes to do in  order  to

implement the undertaking.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Government is aware of the

undertaking  to  build  quarters for the  daily-rated  employees.

Quarters  have  been  built  for the daily-rated  employees.  For

instance, the P.W.D. will complete, towards the end of this year,

30  quarters  costing $120,000 for daily-rated employees  at  Ulu

Pandan Sewerage Works. The Minister for Health will construct  20

quarters  next year at Choa Chu Kang Burial Grounds. The  project

costs $89,000. The Government has implemented the undertaking and

will continue to implement it.

<div align="center"><b>SCHOOL IN BULIM VILLAGE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b> asked the Minister for Education whether

the  Government  has any plans to establish  a  school  in  Bulim

Village  at 12 milestone Jurong Road, and what language  will  be

the medium of instruction in this school.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no plan to

establish a school at 12 milestone Jurong Road. However, a  rural

type  primary school is being built in Resettlement Area 5A,  off

13½  milestone  Choa  Chu  Kang Road,  where  Bulim  Village  is

situated. This is a 10-classroom school. This school is  expected

to be ready for occupation at the commencement of the next school

year. The media of instruction will be decided



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>



on the basis of actual demand. In view of  the  large

Chinese population here, it is safe to presume that Chinese  will

be one of the media of instruction.

<div align="center"><b>REPAIR OF TRACKS IN JURONG</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b> asked the Minister for National Development

whether he is aware that the following tracks in the Jurong  area

are  in  a  state of disrepair and whether he will take steps  to

have  them repaired: (i) Tuas Road; (ii) Track 37 (Lokyang Road);

(iii) Track 18.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Sir, (i) a proposal to metal Jalan Tuas has been

approved  by the Urban and Rural Services Consultative Committee.

Metalling  of  this road from Jurong Road to the  Chinese  temple

will be carried out by the Singapore Work Brigade soon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) A proposal to repair Track 37 (Lokyang Road) was

considered   by   the  Urban  and  Rural  Services   Consultative

Committee.  The  Urban and Rural Services Consultative  Committee

visited  Jalan Tuas and Lokyang Road on the 13th of  June,  1964,

following  which proposals for their improvement  were  approved.

Track  37  (Lokyang Road) was repaired and railings were provided

at two bridges along the road some time ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Members of the Citizens Consultative Committee have

asked for Track 18, Jurong, to be repaired. A proposal to make up

this  road  to agricultural road standard is being considered  by

the Urban and Rural Services Consultative Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh (Jurong)</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chia Thye Poh, a supplementary

question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh:</b> Yes. (In Mandarin) I would like to ask the

Minister  concerned whether he knows that Lokyang Road, in  spite

of  certain repairs having been carried out to it, is again in  a

state  of disrepair; and whether the Government considers  to  re

repair it? When can the repair be done



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>



to  Track  18  because  the  road is now  in  a  state  of  utter

disrepair?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, regarding Lokyang Road and

Track 18, the Urban and Rural Services Consultative Committee

will look into them, and if the repair is necessary, of course,

it will be considered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0402 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0402 be reduced

by $100.*

<hr size="2" noshade>

*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Lim Huan Boon

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is not a new issue, it is because the

Government  has never resolved the problem that it  is  necessary

for  me to raise it again in this House today. At present, people

who  are  staying on private land, if they have to remove  or  to

rebuild their houses, are still faced with difficulties. Also  it

takes  a  long  time for their applications to be considered  and

approved  in  order  to  rebuild their houses.  According  to  my

information,  there  are certain people whose  applications  have

taken  six  months  before  they have been  looked  into  by  the

authorities concerned, thus causing them great inconvenience. Perhaps,  this  delay  has  something to do  with  the  relationship

between  the authorities and the applicants. Perhaps it also  has

something to do with the landowners concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last Assembly sitting, the Prime Minister, in answer to

my  question,  said that the Government cannot  allow  people  to

build chicken runs or pig sties on any piece of ground they like,

so  as  to  extend their structures; because when the  Government

wants  them to remove, it will then have to pay more compensation

to them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the same principle is applied to applicants who

want  to extend their houses. In the case of occupiers of  houses

who  are  on good terms with the landlord and who have  paid  him

some  tea  money, they will usually get his permission to  extend

their   houses.  But  the  situation  is  different  with   other

occupiers. When the landlord refuses their applications, they are

faced with great inconvenience and difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have just mentioned that there are certain people who have

wanted  to  apply  for an extension of their  houses,  but  their

landlord  has  asked them to apply to the Building Survey  Department  and  the Department has asked the applicants  to  submit  a

detailed plan. In certain cases the applications have taken about

six months to be considered and approved. I would like to ask the

Minister whether it is a good thing for the authorities concerned

to delay the approval of such applications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing is the alteration of houses. Normally houses have

the  kitchen separated from the hall and the bedrooms.  When  the

occupiers ask for approval to separate the kitchen from the hall,

they have to seek the approval of the landlord concerned. Without

their   approval,  the  applicants  cannot  even  apply  to   the

authorities  concerned  to  have such  alteration  to  the  house

approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, about removal from one place to another within the same

mukim  - not more than 10 feet - the purpose of which is  normally

to improve the situation of the house.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such improvements or alterations to the building structure have

also to be approved by the landlord. I hope the Minister can give

an explanation to my questions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Huan Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Huan Boon (Bukit Merah):</b> I am not speaking on my

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Very well. The amendment is now open to debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  I would like to assure the Opposition that if there is  any

application  to  improve the plan or siting of a house,  we  will

always  try  to  expedite  it.  The  Member's  difficulty,  as  I

understand  him, is that he feels that landlords  are  trying  to

hinder  applicants in their requests for permission to repair  or

enlarge  the house. Mr Speaker, Sir, I think we all  agree  that

ownership  of  land in Singapore confers upon the  owner  certain

rights.  Therefore,  whether the owner is willing  to  allow  the

tenant to extend or repair the house is a matter between him  and

the tenant. It is something which the Government cannot force the

owner to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Member's allegation that we are always making it

difficult for people who want to repair their house, I would like

to  ask, what are the difficulties which they encounter with  the

Chief  Building Surveyor's Department? Because if the application

does come in with the permission of the owner, and if it conforms

to  building regulations, we will always pass it with  as  little

delay as possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  would  like to get the understanding of the Minister  on  this

question.  When the Government tries to evict farmers, it  builds

cheap and simple houses for them in order to resettle them. These

simple and cheap houses ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> On a point of order. We are debating the Chief

Building Surveyor's Department, which has to do with the  passing

of  plans, buildings, and repairs. But the Member for Jalan  Kayu

is  talking about resettlement. I do not think the Chief Building

Surveyor's Department covers that at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I was watching the Member. I was thinking that

perhaps  he was introducing his speech by saying that people  who

are displaced in those circumstances should possibly be helped by

the  Chief  Building Surveyor's Department. If he proceeds  along

those  lines,  he is in order. But if he proceeds on  some  other

line,  then  he could he completely out of order. I  am  watching

him.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I was saying

that the Government build cheap and simple houses for the

farmers, and whether the farmers can get approval for this type

of house from the Building Surveyor's Department. This Department

approves certain plans of houses which are a bit complicated and

which involve a building cost running into a few thousand

dollars. But the houses allotted to the farmers cost only about

$1,000 in the resettlement area. I wonder whether the Department

concerned can approve the applications by the farmers to build

such houses for themselves, and whether the plans for these

simple houses can be approved by the Building Surveyor's

Department so that the farmers themselves can build the houses on

the same lines and pattern.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in our resettlement

programme,  we  have  certain standard houses  which  cost  about

$1,000 to build. If it is really required, I see no difficulty in

churning out these plans for standard-type houses for farmers  if

they so wish to build themselves.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that

the  Minister  has not given a full reply to my questions  raised

just  now.  The  question  is  not whether  the  applicants  have

followed the regulations or not. In fact, they have. There is  no

ambiguity about that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am talking about is this: after they have complied with

all  the  regulations  and yet are faced with  difficulties,  the

power  to  approve  their  applications  lies  either  with   the

landowners themselves or with the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is about the alteration to the plans of a

house.  The Minister has not given a full reply to this question.

As regards the conferment of certain rights on the landowners,  I

do  not  deny  such rights. But the landowners'  rights  are  not

absolute.  It  is not correct to get approval from the  landowner

whenever a tenant wants to alter his house. If his house is in  a

poor state, of course, he has to repair it. If the landowners  in

other areas also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>



have  the  same  right  to  deny the  tenants'  applications  for

alteration of houses, then they will not be able to find  another

place for resettlement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the extension of houses, there are certain

enlightened landowners who demand that if tenants agree to pay  a

higher  rental, then, of course, they will approve. This is  also

one of the rights of landowners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the construction and alteration of houses, if the

landowners  do not give their approval for them, then  what  will

happen to the tenants?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just now I have said that the

law  of the land respects the rights of ownership, and the  owner

of  land has certain rights. One of the rights is that the tenant

must get permission from the owner of the land for any alteration

or  repairs. And if the Member does not like the law,  I  suggest

that he move a motion here to change the law.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the

issue is very clear. If a tenant rents a piece of land, say,  for

30 or 50 years, he may want to repair his house but does not want

to extend it; so that it may be in a habitable condition.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member for Bukit Panjang was talking about

extensions and alterations, and not repairs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has

just now talked about the reconstruction of houses, and that  the

right  lies  with the landowner. If that is the case,  then  many

people  will  be faced with the problem of not knowing  where  to

live.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a democratic socialist Government, they should not ask the

Opposition to move a motion to amend the relevant laws.  This  is

irresponsible.  What we want is that the P.A.P. should  consider

their  problem of housing in a sympathetic light and should treat

this question as a simple issue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think we have in the past

treated all what we call unauthorised repairs with sympathy,  and

we are treating them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>



with  sympathy now. What the Member meant was that normally if  a

tenant  has  a  broken roof and repairs it, we do  not  take  any

action if there is no extension or alteration to the house. I  do

like  him to bring up any case where a tenant with a broken attap

roof  has repaired it and the Department has taken action against

him.  I do not remember any case of such a nature at all. We have

been most sympathetic wherever we can.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I want to know whether the

landowners have the right to prevent tenants from repairing their

houses or reconstructing them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, I am not a lawyer, otherwise I

will quote him chapter and verse and give him a verbatim report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in reply to his question, I would say, yes, the landlord has

every right; and the tenant has got to ask his permission for any

repairs or alterations under the existing law.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that

the  reply given by the Minister refers to cases of repair  where

the  landowner has the right to interfere. But if a house is  not

being  extended,  but is being repaired only, will  the  Building

Surveyor's Department approve such an application?



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has said that maybe there were certain houses which

were not authorised. I want to know about the case of tenants  of houses

who  want to apply for repairs and who have  been  paying

rent  regularly to the landowners. There have been cases of delay

of  up  to  six months. This is a very thorny problem. The  reply

given by the Minister does not seem to solve this problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Regarding the repair and

extension  of  houses, if a house is in a state of disrepair  and

cannot  be  habitable any more, then the tenant should  negotiate

with  the  landowner.  There is a form  in  the  Building  Survey

Department which provides



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>



that the landowner can approve by putting his signature. But  the

plan  of such a house should be submitted to the Building  Survey

Department.  After  receiving this  form,  the  Building  Survey

Department will despatch an inspector there to investigate.  Once

it is approved, the tenant concerned can carry out his repair and

this repair should be in accordance with the plans submitted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Opposition Party exaggerates by saying that there has been a

delay of up to six months. For the past few days, they have  been

telling  falsehoods. For example, they have said that the  Government has forced farmers to live in Housing Board flats. All these

accusations  are  groundless. This is only one example  of  their

falsehoods which they have uttered in this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I feel that the Parliamentary

Secretary  to the Minister for National Development is not  being

responsible.  He  says that we have exaggerated  by  saying  that

there have been certain cases of delay of up to six months. I  am

speaking  from actual facts. If the Parliamentary Secretary  does

not  believe me, he can refer to his files in his office. He will

then understand. Maybe he has not referred to his files. That  is

why he has accused us of having exaggerated the case.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Let us go on to the subject in question. Let us

not  get to the files or indulge in personal accusations. Let  us

try to get on to repairs, alterations and additions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard

to  what  the  Member for Bukit Panjang has said  about  the  six

months'  delay, I have just now said that the best thing for  him

to  do is to give us concrete examples, so that we can study  and

investigate  them. I would also like to point out another  thing.

In  case  of such delay, it might well be that the applicant  has

not  submitted the plan which is necessary to the Building Survey

Department,  and  perhaps  the  landlord  has  not  approved  the

application by countersigning the form. Thus the delay  has  been

caused  by this. If the applicant does not produce the  plan  for

repairs at the time,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>



of course, there will be a delay in the approval.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Parliamentary Secretary has

once again asked me to give a concrete example. I have already

replied to him by asking him to look into his own files and see

whether there is such a case of an applicant who has submitted

his application and for six months nothing has been done. There

is one by the name of Mr Ho Pak Toh. Up to now, his application

has not been approved, and during this time there have already

been two changes in the head of the Building Survey Department.

The Parliamentary Secretary should refer to his files and should

not accuse me of uttering falsehoods.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> I would like the Opposition Member to single

out  one case. What is the house number and where is it situated?

I can then find out all the facts for him and what is wrong about

the case.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That seems to me to be a very fair request.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If the Parliamentary Secretary

wants  an example, he is sure to find it in the file. I will  let

him know the name of the area in which this incident happened.  I

am  afraid  I  cannot  remember the  number  of  the  house.  The

applicant is living at Bukit Panjang, 10 milestone. The  name  of

the  street is Jalan Kon Kuan. The name of the applicant is  Yang

Lian Seng. If he wants to refer to the file now, he can easily do

so. There is such an incident.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> We have thousands of files in the Chief

Building Survey Department. If the Member is really interested in

this  particular case, I am also interested in it, because if  he

had  seen  the  Chief  Building  Surveyor  three  times  and   no

satisfactory explanation was given to him as to why it took  more

than  six months to get a plan approved, then I am interested  in

the  case myself. Therefore, if he can give me the number of  the

application,  that  is the only way we can  find  out.  From  the

number of the application we can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>



trace  the applicant, and I will be very interested to  find  out

why it took such a long time. There must be very good reasons. As

it is, the Member for Jalan Kayu just says that there is a delay.

If  he  had seen the C.B.S. three times, I think the C.B.S. must

have explained to him why the delay occurred.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, what I am

concerned  with is not this particular case. What I am  concerned

with is the policy of the Government. Is it not the policy of the

Government to afford convenience to the people? If the Government

is  concerned  with  the interest of the landlords,  the  problem

would  be  whether it has made provisions to rebuild without  the

approval of the landlord. If the Government does not protect  the

people,  then they will not be able to rebuild their houses.  The

Minister  says  that  the landowner has to sign  the  application

first.  But  if  the landlord does not want to  sign,  what  will

happen?  There will be a lot of difficulties. If such things  continue,  then  conditions  will  become  worse.  The  houses  will

collapse. We have seen with our eyes houses collapsing. We  would

like  the  Government to amend the law to enable  the  people  to

rebuild with convenience.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there was an allegation that

the  Government  has delayed for six months,  or  more  than  six

months, and that they have difficulty with the C.B.S. But when we

asked for a specific instance, it was not forthcoming.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Member's other point, I have been trying to

explain  that  the landlord has certain rights  of  ownership.  I

think it is the same law almost thoughout the world. I do not see

how we can change it so that any Tom, Dick and Harry who wants to

have  a  house  built  on anybody's land  can  just  send  in  an

application  without getting permission from the landlord.  I  do

not think there is any law anywhere of that nature.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ong Lian Teng, do you wish to proceed to a

vote?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would like to have a vote.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Huan Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Huan Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to he allocated for Head 0403 he reduced by the

whole sum in respect of subhead 1001.*



<hr size="2" noshade>

*The same amendment also stood in the name if Mr Koo Young.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time when the Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill

was  passed,  the  Minister concerned said  that  the  Government

intended to reconsider the Master Plan and re-delineate the plan,

and  to  start  with the development of the rural  areas  and  to

rebuild  the city. The legislation that has been passed seems  to

give the Minister too extensive powers, because he can decide  at

his discretion which area should be developed.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member is out of order. He can use the

provisions  of that Bill to base his speech on, but  he  may  not

criticise  the  provisions of that Bill or the  passing  of  that

Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Huan Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Huan Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Yes. Mr Speaker, Sir. The

Minister can, at his own discretion, decide whether certain areas

should  be  developed  or  not. I would  like  to  ask  him  what

criterion  is  applied  when  he decides  which  area  should  be

developed  or  which area should not be developed. I  raise  this

question not because I do not have confidence in him. What  I  am

concerned  with is that there may be landlords who  may  want  to

make  use  of any possible chances to achieve their own  personal

ends. That is why I now wish to stress that if any site is to  be

developed,  there  should  be a certain  suitable  criterion.  It

should  be  according to stipulated conditions. Otherwise,  there

will  be cause for ill-feelings and sentiments. That is why I  am

putting forward my suggestion under this Head.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly the Government should - and I stress the word "should" -

control  land  prices. There should also be a  fair  and  just

standard,  otherwise the green belt areas after development  will

become  developed  areas  and the price of  land  will  increase.

Superficially,  the  rural areas may look  developed.  There  are

skyscrapers everywhere, but the houses are at prices that  cannot

be  bought by the people. The people have lost their land to  the

landlords  as  a  result  of  which they  are  faced  with  great

difficulties   in  earning  their  livelihood.  Undoubtedly   the

consequences  will  be construed to mean that the  Government  is

benefiting  from the landlords; this runs contrary  to  socialist

principles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green belt areas are mostly areas where the poorer people

live.  Every  year, they have to pay rentals, and  after  certain

expenses  they can start their agricultural activities and  build

their  huts  and  homes on the sites to maintain themselves.  But

once these green belt areas are developed, then these people will

meet with difficulties. Even if they want to take up residence in

cheap  Government flats, they will find it difficult  to  do  so,

because  there  are  considerations  like  making  their  living.

Therefore, before the Minister decides on the green belts  to  be

developed,  he  should take proper steps to  consult  the  people

concerned   and  ensure  the  protection  of  their   livelihood,

otherwise the superficial development and prosperity will not  be

in keeping with socialist principles.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Government has the

interest  of every section of the public at heart. We see  to  it

that  in  our  efforts  to  bring about  a  more  democratic  and

prosperous  society in any development programme, no  section  of

the public suffers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the Member for Bukit Merah that the last thing I

want  to see is the private developers making large sums of money

out  of  our development. I think he is quite aware that  we  did

introduce the Planning (Amendment)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>



Bill  where development charges  will  be  levied  on

private  developers. This is just to ensure that whatever  profit

the  developers  may make, a part of it will be returned  to  the

public through development charges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am thankful that the hon. Member has said that he has

confidence  in me, and I can assure him that his confidence  will

not  be  misplaced,  because I am not the only  one  who  decides

whether  an area should be developed or not; it is decided  by  a

team  of  experts - experts in traffic and experts in

planning  - and  all  of  them are technicians who are able to plan

for  the increase in population that we envisage in 1990. Before we decide

whether a green belt should remain so or whether there should  be

a  change  of  use,  the  effect that the precinctal  development

aspects  will have on our livelihood, traffic problem  and  total

development will be taken into consideration. So I do  not  think

that  the decision to change the use of any place will depend  on

the  decision of one man. It will have to be thoroughly discussed

by a team of experts. Moreover, when the Master Plan is

revised - and  it  will  be  revised  at  the  beginning  of  next

year  - representations  from the public will be received  before  it  is

finally  approved. Therefore, on that score,  I  think  the  hon.

Member can set his qualms at rest. It is not the decision of  one

man, and therefore he cannot be influenced or bought over by  any

large land-owner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is the aim of this Government to raise the

standard  of living of our people. I will say that we  will  have

succeeded to some extent if we can plan our industrialisation  so

that  the  present so-called farmers who are eking out  a  living

from  the land will be able to change to a new way of life  which

will  give  him a better return. I am sure hon. Members  opposite

will  not like to see the same living conditions under which  the

farmers  are  eking  out  a living in the  open  green  space  to

continue. I think they will like to see that the farmers  have  a

higher standard of living. As it is now, seeing the way they  are

living in spite



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>



of  our efforts to increase production by expert advice from  the

Primary Production Department, I do not think that their standard

of living is something which we should allow to continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Member for Bukit Merah wish for a vote

or withdraw the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Huan Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Huan Boon:</b> I withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0404 be reduced by

$l00.*

<hr size="2" noshade>

*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Lim Huan Boon.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have a few doubts about the Public Works

Department, and I hope I will get explanations from the Minister

concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question is, as the Minister has hinted that the road

engineers have not taken care of Yio Chu Kang Road 9 m.s. to  12½

m.s. - at the junction of Thomson Road - has the Government hinted

that  no reconstruction, remetalling or widening of this road  is

necessary to make it more level and smoother?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is, on the 12th of this month, the Minister,

through  his Parliamentary Secretary, replied that no electricity

can  be  supplied to Yio Chu Kang Road 12 m.s., as the site  occupied  by  a  primary school there could not be obtained  for  the

installation  of  an electricity plant. In this respect,  I  feel

that  there  must be some anomalies in the routine  work  of  the

Department  concerned; otherwise it could be  the  fault  of  the

P.A.P. Government. I think the site for an electricity plant  can

be  obtained because there are organisations, such as  the  Urban

and  Rural Services Consultative Committee, which can try to find

a  suitable locality. Yet the Minister said on the 12th  of  this

month that electricity supply could not be provided for that area

because  no  site  was available. There seems  to  be  some

mal-administration as the school is on a piece of land  that  belongs

to the P.W.D.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I feel that this Department is not functioning

efficiently to show quick results. For instance, the  project  at

Braddell Road from Tampines Road 10 m.s. to Thomson Road  4  m.s.

has been going on for a long time - for almost two years - and it

is  not  finished  yet. What is the reason? At the  rate  we  are

going, if our country is as large and extensive as China, a  road

from  the  north  to the south will take thousands  of  years  to

complete!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the question of metalling of roads. I would like to

know how long the metalling of a road can last before remetalling

is  necessary. To my knowledge, the newly laid layer of metalling

of  certain roads in my constituency from Upper Serangoon 6  m.s.

to  9  m.s. has come off after a period of only three months.  The

top  and  lower layers are exposed after several weeks  of  heavy

rainfall; the roads are in bad condition. I do not understand why

this is so. Perhaps the Minister can explain.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and the P.A.P. are jointly in control of public funds. I hope

they will manage the money of the people carefully and not try to

waste it unnecessarily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, I would like to ask the Minister whether he is aware

that  the  drains and bridges are normally subjected to  flooding

after  heavy rains. Not only will this cause loss and  damage  to

agricultural  produce, but traffic is also  obstructed.  I  would

like  to  ask  the  Minister  whether  the  Government  has   any

comprehensive plan to investigate the whole situation so  that  a

remedial  plan can be formulated. Because the farmers  and  other

people  feel  that such bridges and drains are of  great  use  to

them, they should not be subjected to the bad effects of constant

flooding  after heavy rains. I hope the Urban and Rural  Services

Consultative Committee can also pay atention to this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad the Member for

Jalan Kayu has taken such an interest in the work



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>



of  the  P.W.D. I am at one with him there in trying to speed  up

work  in  the P.W.D. it is a large organisation and  I  think  it

takes  some time to wake them up. But I can say this: during  the

last  year,  there  has been a quickening in the  pulse  of  the

workers in the P.W.D. and I hope to be able to keep it up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on the question of roads. I think the Government here is

doing its very best to give us very good roads. In fact, some  of

the roads that we see in Singapore are about the best that we can

find  in  South-East Asia. Knowing that we are going  to  have  a

population of 4 million by 1990 and that the number of cars  that

will be using our roads will be trebled or more by that time,  we

are  very  conscious of the inadequacy of our  roads.  Therefore,

everytime,  wherever we can, we are trying to enlarge  our  roads

and make them better and better as we go on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of widening Thomson Road has been exercising our

minds,  for quite some time. The only reason which has  prevented

us  from starting on it is the large number of squatters on  both

sides  of the road. It is because of our feeling for them, it  is

because  we  want to try to see in what way we can resettle  them

without much disturbance to their livelihood, that we are going a

bit  slow on that project. But I can assure him that it is always

in our minds to build as good roads as we can in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second point is that we have no heart in supplying

electricity  to the 11th milestone Yio Chu Kang because  we  have

said that we could not get a site for a substation as the site we

have  chosen is within the compounds of a Chinese Primary  School

and that there were objections. I think in the reply given by  my

Parliamentary Secretary to him on the 12th, we did  say  that  we

were  on  the lookout for another site. The moment we can  get  a

site, we will see to it that that area gets electricity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one thing which must be clear in the minds of Members

of  the  Opposition. We never differentiate. There is no question

of  not  doing it in your area and only doing it for  the  P.A.P.

boys. In fact, the bulk of our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>



Development Estimates amounting to $54 million is to be spent  in

an area which is represented by one of the Opposition Members - I

am   referring  to  the  Member  for  Jurong.  The  bulk  of  our

development expenditure is to be spent to improve his  area.  Not

anyone here ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh:</b> We are paying the taxes!



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Yes, they are paying the taxes. But the

priority is given there. We will bring prosperity there and  that

is something which he may not like ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh:</b> All over Singapore, you know!



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> He says the work is very slow. I quite

agree.  The  tempo could be increased. He sees no results  -  two

years,  three years, the building of the road is still going  on.

That  thing  exercises my mind too, Mr Speaker. I was wondering,

why  does  the P.W.D. take months or years to do a road?  I  have

looked  into  it. We have hastened the tempo. But  there  is  one

technical point. In building a road, one must allow time for  the

ground  to  consolidate.  The Member did  say  that  at  the  9th

milestone  Upper Serangoon Road, the top layer peeled  off  after

rain  and after a week. That exactly is the reason. That  is  why

there  must be a minimum time to allow for consolidation.  But  I

agree  with  him.  We  could increase the  tempo,  the  speed  of

completion by the P.W.D. That I agree with him

heartily, and I will chase them up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not understand his last point about bridges and drains.

We  are  doing  our best. We have spent millions  of  dollars  to

alleviate flooding. In fact, I think during the last two years we

have  seen that, in spite of heavy rain, the flooding was not  as

bad as it would have been if we had not done all the work.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I want

to clarify one point. I was saying that the road is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>



from  the  9  to  12½ milestone Yio Chu Kang Road,  linking  with

Thomson Road. Construction of this road was begun during the  Lim

Yew  Hock regime, and it has been going on for five or six  years

now,  and  yet  it  has not been completed. Not only  the  people

around there are asking for it to be completed, but the people in

Upper  Serangoon Road and people who want to go to the Federation

have  to  pass  through it. Some of the plans  for  bridges  were

drafted by the old Government, and yet they have not started work

on them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many housewives have told me that at the 9 milestone, there is

a maternity hospital which looks after their health. They have to

go  through  that road. Because buses pass over  that  road  very

fast, it is very inconvenient for the housewives there to walk on

it  and  also  because it is not level. What I want  to  know  is

whether the Government can expedite the work here and complete it

in time so as to make it comfortable to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the substation for the electricity, now that the

School  Management Committee has given permission for a piece  of

land  to  be  used as a site for the substation,  the  Government

should not shirk its responsibility. Electricity mains were  laid

before  the elections. The work has been completed over  a  year,

and yet there is no supply of electricity to that area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.W.D. is entrusted with building bridges in the rural

areas.  But these bridges have not been made with good  material.

After  a  few years, these wooden bridges have rotted, and  motor

vehicles  cannot  pass  over  them.  That  shows  the  Department

concerned  has  not looked after them carefully. When  the  roads

have been completed, the Government should send someone there  to

inspect and maintain them so that traffic will not be held up. In

many  rural  areas, the drains have been blocked  up  by  floods.

Since there are many members of the Work Brigade, why should  the

Government not send them there to repair the drains, so that they

will not be flooded during the rainy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>



season, and not keep the Work Brigade idle? That is what I am

concerned about.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, after

listening to the Member for Jalan Kayu for 20 minutes,  it  seems

as  if  he  is the saviour of the people. Had he not aired  these

views, then the Government would not have done those things ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. That is the Member's right. Mr Ho, will you

please proceed to answer the Member?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am sorry, Mr Speaker. I

want   to  quote  one  example.  The  Urban  and  Rural  Services

Consultative  Committee in the past 10 months have  spent  about

$60,000  on  improving  roads, bridges,  drains  for  Jalan  Kayu

constituency, etc. All these requests have not been made  by  the

Member for Jalan Kayu. They have been made by the Citizenship Committees of those areas. He has talked about bridges having fallen

into disrepair, but he has not made any petition to the Urban and

Rural  Services Consultative Committee. He should write to  them.

In  fact, he has not done so. But today, he has seen fit to carry

out  propaganda here so as to impress the people that he has been

doing something for them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the reply given

by  the  Parliamentary Secretary is not satisfactory.  If  he  is

sincere  in his concern about the welfare of the people, then  it

is  his  duty  to  carry out this work. But to say  that  we  the

Opposition  Members  have not looked after the  interest  of  the

people, is not correct.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he will look into the files of the Urban and Rural Services

Consultative  Committee,  he will know  that  I  have  made  many

requests  to  improve  the  rural areas.  If  the  Government  is

prepared to investigate and find out what can be done, I will  be

satisfied.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that all this will not be construed as a gift to the

people,  because in a democratic society, since  the  people  are

obliged  to pay rates and taxes, they have a right to  all  these

benefits   and   amenities.  The  Ministers   and   Parliamentary

Secretaries are paid thousands of dollars a month, and  they  are

duty  bound  to  serve  the people. This is  not  a  gift  to  be

conferred  by  the Government. The people are entitled  to  these

benefits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the structures in rural areas, if these schemes are

approved  by the Urban and Rural Services Consultative Committee,

they  cannot be regarded as something bestowed by the  P.A.P.  In

every  P.A.P. constituency, if a road is constructed, the  Member

of  that constituency will invariably go there to announce it.  I

do  not know what the motive is, but it seems that the roads  are

constructed by the P.A.P. and not the Government. I hope that  in

future,  the  work that is carried out by the Government  is  not

heralded  by P.A.P branch members. The people pay rates and  taxes

and, therefore, they are entitled to these constructions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about metalling of roads and the roads becoming

inundated, the reply given was that the foundations had not  been

consolidated. There is a contractor in my constituency who has  a

gang  of  workers  to carry out road work. They  have  a  lot  of

experience  in making roads in that area. They asked me  why  the

metalling of roads wore out in such a short time. The reason,  of

course,  is  that  the  roads had not been properly  constructed.

There have been irregularities and malpractices. If a road is properly  metalled, even a heavy steamroller cannot break it  up.  I

want to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that since  the

Government looks after public funds, they cannot misuse them.  It

is  not a question of the foundations not being consolidated, but

a question of malpractices where poor materials have been used.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> On a point of clarification. Mr Speaker, Sir,

I never said "foundations". I said "consolidation".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, if there

are  malpractices in the road building programme  of  the  Public

Works  Department, I am concerned that public money has been  wasted.  Not only roads in the Jalan Kayu constituency have not been

completed  for a long time, but there are also similar  instances

in  other constituencies. These roads are in different degrees of

repair, and some of them are even in a worse condition than  they

were originally. When these roads become worn out, the stones are

exposed. This shows how easily they can deteriorate. Has the  Government  been  guilty of using public funds  to  please  its  own

members?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some foreign firms which have tendered $3 per

square  foot.  I  believe  that some local  contractors  who  are

somewhat related to the P.A.P. got these tenders easily.  Whether

these  successful  tenderers constructed the roads  according  to

regulations, I am in doubt. But according to usual practice, road

construction  cannot be carried out during rainy days.  But  such

things  have  been  going on. I believe that  the  materials  are

specified  in  the contracts; the widths and the  depths  of  the

materials are specified. I understand that a big company which is

somehow  related  to  the  P.A.P. has been  guilty  of  such  malpractices.  [Interruption] These are your  own  affairs.  If  the

Minister  concerned wants to investigate this, he can  set  up  a

Commission of Inquiry. If he wants me to give names and facts,  I

think  he  had  better  not become the Minister.  The  Government

should  be in a better position than Opposition Members to  understand, because all the files are in their hands. You can set up a

Commission of Inquiry to look into such matters. But I would like

to ask whether, if there is any doubt about any irregularity, the

Minister will set up a Commission of Inquiry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, after hearing

the speeches from the Party in power, I feel I must say something

on the expenditure in regard to this Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now my colleagues, the Member for Jalan Kayu and

others, have suggested many things to the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>



But  these  suggestions  have been  ignored  by  them.  We  hope,

however,  that  they  will pay attention  to  them  in  order  to

expedite the improvements for the benefit of the people. When  we

put  forward  our suggestions, the Party in power counter  us  by

saying  that  we are merely carrying out publicity work  and  propaganda, when in actual fact we are trying to be constructive  by

putting  forward  our suggestions. They term our suggestions  and

good intentions as "propaganda". I still urge the Government that

it  should properly look into the use of public funds and not try

to  gain  publicity  for  itself. Who has  been  guilty  of  this

publicity? I think it is the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Prime Minister toured the constituencies, the P.A.P.

members  and  branches drew up programmes indicating which  areas

should  have  roads, standpipes, etc. They submitted  them  as  a

request to the Prime Minister during his tours. For instance, the

Prime  Minister  had  to go along certain roads  or  paths  in  a

certain  constituency. The P.A.P. immediately went to investigate

before  the Prime Minister arrived there, and purposely  improved

the  general appearance of the roads and paths through  which  he

had  to  pass.  They did this in advance of the Prime  Minister's

tour.  But  in  other  areas, they did  nothing  to  improve  the

condition  of  the  roads.  Even in my  constituency,  there  are

certain roads which are in a very bad condition. The farmers have

to  go along such roads, and in rainy days it is even worse! When

they  asked  for  repairs  to be carried  out,  the  Ministry  of

National   Development   and  the  Urban   and   Rural   Services

Consultative  Committee paid no heed to their request.  They  are

merely interested in improving roads or paths in areas where  the

Prime Minister will be touring. Mr Speaker, I would like to give

some examples. In ancient Chinese history, there lived an Emperor

called  Sui Yang. Before he toured the country, a road was  built

for  him.  He was very notorious. So it is the same with  present

day  Singapore. Before the Prime Minister goes on a tour, a  road

is built specially for this purpose.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Minister for National Development has said that

everything  they do is fair. The Jurong area, he said,  benefited

most  from  the  Development Estimates. The  Industrial  Site  in

Jurong  is  quite good and it is looked after by the  Government.

But  when the Government spends money on the Jurong project, that

should not be construed as benefiting the people of Jurong. As  a

result  of  development  there, the people  have  been  asked  to

remove.  Before they can even get any benefits, they are  already

suffering inconveniences, difficulties and financial loss!



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will not try to talk irrelevantly and claim

that  the Jurong project has benefited most of them. I would like

clarification on this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know whether the

Member  for Bukit Panjang realises it or not, but he has  made  a

serious  allegation. I challenge him to repeat  it  outside  this

House. He says that contracts have been given to contractors  who

have  something to do with the P.A.P. If it is so  -  he  is  now

under privilege in this House - he can name one contractor. Or if

it is more than one, he can name them. I will find out whether it

is  so  or not. I do not know whether he realises it or  not.  We

have been able to bring - at least when I was in the Housing  and

Development Board - the cost of building down much lower than  it

ever was before, and there was no question of corruption anywhere

at  all. But his allegation is very serious. I challenge  him  to

repeat  it outside this House. I do not know when the Member  for

Jalan  Kayu has become an expert on roads. He says that the roads

are  broken  up, and all that. By what standards  has  he  judged

them?  Does he know that when roads are made, there is a  certain

period  during which they are under observation what we call  the

"maintenance  period"? if they break up within  that  time,  they

have to be done up again. There was no question of corruption. He

spoke about malpractices.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>



Since  the  P.A.P. Government came to power, it  has  been  our

objective  to  stop  all malpractices, and if  he  knows  of  any

malpractice  within my Department or within any other Department,

it  is  his duty to bring it up and give instances. We  will  see

that there is a stop made to it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

already  challenged the P.A.P. I have said, first  and  foremost,

that these roads can get into a state of disrepair very

easily  - whether  there  have been any malpractices or  irregularities

or not. If the Minister thinks that it is impossible or if he thinks

otherwise,  then  the  best thing he  can  do  is  to  set  up  a

Commission of Inquiry to see whether proper materials  have  been

used in the building of roads and bridges. It should compare  the

result  of the work with the terms of the contract. Is  this  the

duty  which Members of the Opposition have to do? It is obviously

something which the Party in power should carry out. They are responsible  for it. Perhaps they are afraid, and that is  why  they

have thrown the challenge back to us!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Member for Bukit

Panjang  had  been following the history of Singapore, he  would

have known that the P.A.P. is the last Party to be afraid of  any

Commission  of Inquiry. We know what our duties are, and  we  are

not  going  to waste our time setting up a Commission of  Inquiry

when we cannot be sure that there is something to investigate.  I

am  not  going to spend my time running around looking  up  specifications  to see whether the roads are made up to specification,

unless  I have some suspicion that it is not so. As  far  as  my

technical staff are concerned, we have a certain standard to work

on.  I believe that members of the public are now quite conscious

of  what  is  going on. We have had letters in  the  Press  about

unlicensed dogs roaming in Singapore, flies all over the place. I

am  sure  that among the public of Singapore, there are  quite  a

number  of engineers who, if they were sure, or had any suspicion

that the roads which were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>



made  up  were  not up to specification and that  there  was  any

malpractice with regard to specifications, would have sent me the

information,  and  I would have set up a Commission  of  Inquiry.

There is no question about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing Members can be sure of: we are not afraid of a

Commission of Inquiry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $8,032,690 for Head 0404 ordered to stand part of the

whole sum in respect of subhead 1201.*

<hr size="2" noshade>

*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Lim Huan Boon.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this refers to the Outpatient Services

Department.  In the past, patients in the outpatient departments,

whether  in  the  General  Hospital  or  elsewhere,  were   given

treatment  free of charge. Since the formation of  Malaysia,  the

Minister for Health has announced that there will be a charge for

outpatient  services. Each patient will be charged 50  cents.  Of

course,  this  amount is nothing to a well-off person.  To  those

Ministers  who receive $2,500 a month, that is but a  small  sum.

But to a poor man, 50 cents is not a small sum.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member talks about the sum being too big for

certain  people. But unless the Member tells the House  what  the

sum is, Members will not be able to follow him intelligently.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I was talking

about the 50 cents charge for an out-patient. Originally, it  was

free  of  charge.  But  recently, a levy of  50  cents  has  been

imposed.  Is  it  true that the Government wishes  to  make  this

collection to supplement the national income? Is this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>



one  of  the  ways by which the Government intends  to  get  more

revenue? Is this going to be a temporary or a permanent charge?

+Amendment (2) , which also stood in the name of Mr Lim Huan Boon,

reads as follows:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0502 be reduced by the whole

sum in respect of subhead 1371.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think perhaps we had better keep it separate.

One is "Maternity" and the other is "Outpatient Services".



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

first  of  all,  I  would like to say that the statement  by  the

Member for Thomson that outpatient services were previously  free

services is not true, because, before the reorganisation. 12  out

of  the  26 outpatient dispensaries were charging 50 cents.  With

the  reorganisation from 1st of August this year, it was  made  a

standard  charge for all the 26. In other words, where previously

14  outpatient dispensaries were free, they came in line with the

remaining  12  outpatient dispensaries, so that all  the  26  out

patient  dispensaries were levying what I would  call  a  nominal

charge  of  50  cents. In introducing this nominal charge  of  50

cents for all the 26 dispensaries, certain classes of people were

exempted  from this nominal charge. This was made  known  to  the

public over a period of at least one month, that those who are in

receipt  of  social welfare assistance would be exempt  from  the

charge. It is quite easy to apply this, because those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>



in  receipt of social welfare assistance need only produce  their

social welfare assistance cards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second category of people who are exempt from this nominal

charge  are  those  who  need prolonged medical  treatment  after

discharge  from  the  hospital.  They  include  people  with  the

following diseases: diabetes, which is a long running disease and

which requires, I think, daily injections; diseases like leprosy;

mental  disorder - a great number of them; those  suffering  from

tuberculosis   and  receiving  injections, and   even   venereal

diseases, so as not to spread this disease to innocent victims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third large category who are also exempted from this nominal

charge  are Government servants and their families; this is  part

of  their  employment privileges. I might say that it  is  nearly

four  months  now since the reorganised Outpatient services  have

been  running  and that about 25 per cent of those attending  the

dispensaries belong to these exempted classes.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is not true, firstly, that because of Malaysia, the charge

was introduced, because Malaysia took place more than a year ago.

I  am most grateful to you, Mr Speaker, for drawing attention to

the  fact  that  perhaps we should know what the amount  is.  The

amount  is this nominal sum of 50 cents. I do not think  that  50

cents is a very heavy charge for anyone who is seriously ill.  We

know  of  cases when it was free in certain dispensaries,  and  a

good  number of those who were not really ill, but pretending  to

be  ill  and wanting to get a medical certificate, blocked  those

who  were  really ill and who wanted attention. So much  so  that

there was serious congestion in the Outpatients Department of the

General  Hospital, where something like 2,000 to  3,000  persons

turned  up  daily, and although they got free service,  yet  they

might  have  to wait for five or six hours because of  the  large

crowds there which prevented them from getting medical



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>



attention   quickly.   But  now  with  the   reorganisation   and

decentralisation into 26 outpatient dispensaries  throughout  the

island,  it is possible for anyone who is ill, by just paying  50

cents,  to get treatment within 15 minutes and not wait for  five

or  six  hours without any treatment. From objective  reports,  I

think  the public are very satisfied with the reorganisation.  It

is  also  satisfactory from the point of view of the  doctors  in

service.  In  the  past,  they had very little  time  to  examine

patients  to find out what was really wrong with them.  They  had

only a very cursory glance at patients before they prescribed the

medicine.  But now there is less harassment by crowds waiting  to

be  examined by doctors. Doctors are very much happier, and  that

includes  the nursing staff and the technicians as  well  as  the

dispenser, because each dispensary is now well able to look after

those  who turn up. So much so that doctors can spend about  five

minutes  to examine each patient. So doctors are happy,  patients

are   happy,   and   our  staff  are  happy   in   this   general

reorganisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the Member's last question, whether this 50 cents

charge will be a permanent charge or a temporary one, I think  it

is a little too early for me to make a pronouncement, because, at

the  moment,  the medical services unfortunately  are  very  much

understaffed.  We  have  26 outpatients dispensaries.  For  ideal

staffing of them, we should have 70 doctors. But, at the  moment,

we have only 44. So until I am able to have a full establishment,

that is to say, 70 doctors in charge of my 26 dispensaries, I  am

not  in  a position now to make a statement. So I prefer to  just

leave it open for the time being.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, concerning this

outpatient  charge,  the  reasons, according  to  the  Minister's

reply,  gave me the impression that the charge cannot be reduced.

If  that is so, it is not logical. He gave an example that  there

were  people  who,  because of certain  reasons,  wanted  medical

certificates. They went to the outpatients department to see  the

doctor. It could be that these people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>



did  not  want  to go to work. But these were but a  few  of  the

patients.   If  there  are  people  who  want  to   get   medical

certificates  in order to stay away from work, then  the  medical

officer  should  examine them carefully before deciding  to  give

them  two or five days' leave. But if these people are well,  the

medical  officer  should not give them medical  certificates.  If

such  is  the case, I cannot see how, by charging a nominal  sum,

there  will  be  less  patients, so  that  medical  officers  and

patients  will be happy. The Minister says the patients  will  be

happy  because  they will not have to wait too  long.  I  believe

there  will not be people who pretend to be sick and  go  to  the

Outpatients Department to see the doctor. I know that in the past

there were certain departments which charged a certain fee. These

were  run  by  the  City Council, like the  maternity  and  child

clinic.  If the Government wanted to standardise things,  why  do

they  not  standardise and not collect this 50 cents? Would  that

not  be  better?  I  would  like  to  know  also  whether,  after

implementing this plan of collecting 50 cents, the Government has

calculated  to see how much could be obtained within a  year?  If

the Minister can give me a rough estimate, I will be happy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I think the hon. Member for Thomson would

like  to  know the reasons why a nominal charge of 50  cents  was

introduced to bring all the other dispensaries in line  with  the

12  outpatient dispensaries that were already charging this rate.

They  were eight of the former City Council dispensaries and four

of  the  new  Government dispensaries. One reason was  to  reduce

attendances. I think he is much too naive to think that  lots  of

people will not turn up when the dispensary is free and just  ask

for  medical certificates. But that is the true situation. It was

in  order to stop the congestion at the General Hospital and  get

the public to go to the 26 outpatient dispensaries that this move

was  made.  Because,  at  the same time  as  we  reorganised  the

outpatient services, we established an emergency admission unit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>



at  the General Hospital, which previously was cluttered up  with

all the thousands who turned up daily for colds and stomach aches

and  so  on. You could not tell the difference between a  serious

case  and a mild case. Now it is possible with anyone turning  up

at  the  emergency unit of the General Hospital, and this is  400

per  day  -  200 on the average, from casualties arising  out  of

accidents,  another  200  serious medical  cases  recommended  by

doctors  whether  in Government or in private  practice  are  now

receiving  immediate medical attention when they  arrive  at  the

General  Hospital.  I  think these are  the  people  who  deserve

priority  in  attention to others who have very  simple  ailments

which  can be attended to at the outpatient dispensaries.  It  is

true  that  in the maternal and child health centres the  service

continues to be free.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has asked what will be the rough estimate

of  the revenue that will be obtained with the reorganisation  in

August  of the outpatient services. I have already said  that  in

the  past there were 12 outpatient dispensaries which charged the

50  cents rate and, on the average per annum, the income was over

$200,000. Now with the nominal charge of 50 cents applying to all

the  26  outpatient dispensaries, we believe that  for  one  full

year,  the  revenue would be around three-quarters of  a  million

dollars, or an increase of half a million dollars per annum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, because the

Government has in the Outpatient Department been levying a charge

of 50 cents, I would like to know whether this charge has already

been levied in the Kandang Kerbau Hospital.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The Member

for Jalan Kayu, I think, is anticipating the next question, Mr

Speaker. From outpatient dispensaries to the maternity hospital

at Kandang Kerbau! If he will hold his horses, I will give him

the answer ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You have probably already given him that answer,

Mr Yong, have you not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Most probably he wants more detailed

information. He will probably send one of the patients there.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, it is about

this  Outpatients Department. They have levied a charge.  It  has

been said that the charge is just 50 cents. But I would like  to

emphasise  that  the  majority  of  the  people  who  go  to  the

Outpatients Department are poor. They are poor people coming from

poor villages. Because they are poor, they cannot afford to go to

private  practitioners. They are not like the Ministers who  have

got  their  own  consultants to look after  them  and  give  them

injections. These poor patients, when they feel unwell,  have  to

go to the Outpatients Department where the charge is low.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Government has now decided to increase the charge. This

is  a  big burden on the poor people. I do not wish to touch  any

more  on  the circumstances of Malaysia, but will only  say  that

these  people in the lower income group have heavy burdens.  They

now  have less income, and because of the rising cost of  living,

this  charge  of 50 cents for medical services is  an  additional

burden on them.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

it  is often said that the best things in life are free. But here

in  a  realistic  world where you want to get  medical  services,

somebody has got to pay for them. Nothing is free. If the patient

does not pay for it, then somebody has to pay, because doctors do

not  give free services, nurses have to be paid for, and medicine

must be bought and paid for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite untrue to say that the imposition of the small

charge  of  50  cents  is the result of Malaysia.  The  resulting

income is quite trifling. The real reason is that when things are

free, you get all sorts of people with minor stomach



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>



aches or headaches jamming up the clinics and preventing the real

patients from  getting sufficient medical attention.  In,  say,

socialist countries both of the European Scandinavian type and of

the Russian East European type, these services are not free. They

have  to  be  paid for. There is a deduction from  the  workers'

wages  every week. A certain amount is deducted and put into  the

medical  fund  that  goes  to pay for the  medical  services.  In

England,  for instance, if I recollect correctly, the  deduction

for  health  services is something like $3 or $4  per  week  per

worker.  That  amount is deductible and is put  into  the  social

insurance  fund to pay for the medical services.  So  nothing  in

this  world  is  free, Mr Speaker, Sir, except  to  people  like

President Soekarno who can go to Vienna at State expense  to  get

an operation on whatever is wrong with his inside.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would like to tell Members of the Opposition

that  they have up to 4.50 p.m. on Hospitals Division,  and  they

have yet to debate the Maternity side of the Health services.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I want to be brief

in my comments on what the Minister for Finance has said. We know

very well that this counter argument has always been the way  the

P.A.P. will  explain  their own deeds.  They  will  always  cite

examples  of  foreign  countries to make  a  comparison  in  this

context. This is irrelevant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has claimed that no medical services are

given free, even in Communist countries. I understand  this. But after

the deduction, if the workers are ill, as mentioned  by

the  Minister for Finance, they are being looked after  properly.

But are the same conditions of treatment obtained here?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the number of people visiting the outpatient clinics,

these  people are themselves taxpayers, and therefore the medical

services  are a right to which they are entitled. Is the Minister

trying  to say that it is proper to levy a further charge  of  50

cents  on  these people in addition to the taxes which  they  are

already paying?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0502 be reduced by the

whole sum in respect of subhead 1371.*

<hr size="2" noshade>

*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Lim Huan Boon.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question is of the same nature, although the Minister will

not  acknowledge  it as a consequence of Malaysia,  resulting  in

increases  in  all  charges. Just now we were talking  about  the

charge  of 50 cents for outpatient services. Now, in respect  of

Kandang Kerbau Hospital services, the patients have to pay  more.

They have to pay a head tax of $10 per head for new-born babies.

For  non-citizens, the charge is $50. Perhaps the Government  may

claim  that  the charge is made for them to provide  certain  services. But the question does not just end there. Many people want

to go to Kandang Kerbau Hospital to deliver their babies, because

if  they  were to go to private maternity hospitals,  they  would

have  to  pay $50 to $60 for delivery charges. That is  why  they

prefer  to  go to Kandang Kerbau Hospital because they are  poor.

Thus  an increase of $10 will cause a greater burden on them,  as

they  might not have calculated their budget in advance, and they

now  might  have to squeeze other resources to meet the  expenses

for the newborn baby.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know how much is the charge, but just now there was a

mention  of 50 cents for outpatient services, which would  amount

to $750,000 per year in revenue. Now, for this item under Kandang

Kerbau Hospital charges, I think the total charges cannot be less

than  that figure, but much more. So perhaps the Minister can  enlighten

us and say how much the revenue will be for this charge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking of this charge of 50 cents for outpatient services, the

Minister  has  not replied whether it will be made permanent.  So

may  I  ask  whether this additional charge will be permanent  or

temporary?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, once again I have to begin

by saying that the Member for Thomson is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>



wrong  when he says that "C" class patients at the Kandang Kerbau

Hospital receive free attention. They have to pay $3 for the cost

of sanitary towels and toilet paper when they get admitted to the

hospital. The proposed new all-in charge of $10 will be effective

from  the  first of next month - a fortnight from now - and  will

really mean an increase of $7.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But again there are exemptions, Sir, - exemptions for those in

receipt  of  social  welfare assistance and those  in  Government

service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons for this are the same as in the case of introducing

the  nominal  charge of 50 cents for outpatient dispensaries,  to

cut down on the numbers turning up at the Kandang Kerbau Hospital

for delivery. Because the establishment of doctors and nurses  is

such  that the hospital is grossly understaffed to cope with  the

large  numbers  that turn up each year to deliver  their  babies.

There  are as many as 40,000 babies per annum, or one baby  every

ten minutes. Kandang Kerbau certainly has the reputation of being

the largest maternity hospital in the world. We would be proud to

have  this appellation, but for the fact that our staff  are  not

able  to  cope  with it without great cost to  their  health  and

efficiency. Some doctors have had to be on duty for more than  30

hours, which is very inhuman and unreasonable. As Minister, it is

my duty to see that such dedicated officers are not being made to

work till they drop. So the reason for introducing the charge  is

just to stem the tide of mothers making a beeline for the Kandang

Kerbau Maternity Hospital, it is not true that if a mother cannot

afford the $10, she will not be able to deliver her baby, because

we  have  a free domiciliary midwifery service. We have  midwives

who  are  being  trained to deliver babies, and such  service  is

available at home. So we try to impress upon mothers that  unless

there  is  something which may not be normal birth, such delivery

can  take  place at home free of charge. Therefore,  the  Kandang

Kerbau  Maternity  Hospital  should,  as  far  as  possible,   be

restricted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>



to  cases where the doctor, after ante-natal examination,  thinks

that  it is preferable for the mother to have her child delivered

there,  and not every one wanting to deliver her baby in  Kandang

Kerbau Hospital. The task of having to deliver 70 per cent of the

babies  that  are born in Singapore is, I think, unreasonable  to

expect  from our dedicated doctors, nurses, and midwives in  Kandang Kerbau Hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards revenue, if the all-in charge of $10 is introduced,

we anticipate that the net revenue will only come to $200,000 per

year, because we would then do away with the charge of $3 for the

sanitary  towels  and toilet paper which are now  purchased,  not

from  the Government but from a retailer at the hospital who gets

the  contract by way of a tender, in which case, Government would

then have to provide sanitary towels and toilet paper for mothers

to  deliver their babies at Kandang Kerbau Hospital as "C"  class

patients, which we anticipate would cost $100,000 per annum. We

might get a revenue, of. Say, $300,000 per year less $100,000 for

the  cost  of  sanitary towels and toilet paper, which  therefore

should  bring  in  $200,000 net revenue for  the  Kandang  Kerbau

Hospital.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, of course, we anticipate that by bringing in this all-in

charge,  there  would  he a reduction in the  number  of  mothers

delivering their babies for the forthcoming year. But it may  not

prove to be correct. Whether it will be a permanent charge  or  a

temporary  charge, here again I am not in a position to  give  an

answer.  I would prefer to allow the system to run for, say,  one

year  before  I  provide  an answer to the  Member  for  Thomson.

Perhaps  sometime next year, if he is still with us, I will  give

him the answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): It seems to me that the increase in

the  charges at the Kandang Kerbau Hospital by $7, as  stated  by

the Minister, was to reduce the number of expecting mothers going

to the hospital. But I think if that was the only reason, then it

is not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>



quite  realistic.  If the expecting mothers were  to  deliver  at

home,  there  should  be  certain hygienic  facilities.  In  many

families,  the condition of the households is very  dirty.  There

may  not be any equipment, or facilities like electric appliances

and  other  things necessary for delivery. All these  things  are

very important for delivery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the increase of the charge to $7, this may perhaps not be

very  important to the rich, but it is not so to the poor, it  is

not easy for poor families to have basins and boiling water ready

at  a  moment's  notice, without which the newly  delivered  baby

would  not  have water to bathe. I feel that perhaps the  Minister

has  ignored such questions. He has given his answers at  random.

There  is also the necessity to go to the Kandang Kerbau Hospital

for first delivery. I think doctors will ask that mothers with  a

first case of delivery should go to the hospital for delivery for

fear  of any risk or complications. All in all, I would say  that

the reasons given by the Minister cannot hold water.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I hope that the increased charges will not be imposed.

There  are also increased charges for the outpatient services.  I

hope the Government will pay attention to the fact that there are

many people who are going downhill with regard to their financial

position,  especially at this time of the year. This  is  a  fact

which the P.A.P. Members must also admit. If this difficulty  is

added  to  their other difficulties, I think they cannot shoulder

any  more burden. I feel there should be a temporary measure  for

their  improvement, and this should be implemented for a  certain

period  of time. There should not be this imposition of increased

charges. Otherwise the lot of the poor people will be made  more

difficult.

regard to the increased charge which the Government has imposed

on the outpatient services and the Kandang Kerbau Hospital, we

already had discussions on the question of the increase of 50

cents when they were in the P.A.P. At that time, private practitioners were also charging for their services and the hospital

would be unfair.

*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Lim Huan Boon.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the 14th of November, the Prime Minister

assembled the heads of various departments for a meeting  at  the

Victoria Memorial Hall. At this meeting he said that Singapore is

now  full  of  flies. There are many wild dogs and  cows  running

about  in  the streets, and some of them have been occupying  bus

shelters  as  well. The situation looks very grave.  There  is  a

saying in Chinese, when a person wants to eat meat, he must  wipe

his  mouth clean. Why should the Prime Minister mention this  now

since these things happened years ago? The purpose is to cover up

the  inefficiency  and the responsibilities  of  the  Government.

Therefore,  he  has talked about the officers  not  dealing  with

complaints and that rubbish has been piling up. He has also  said

that  the  regulations have not been applied. This is  mainly  to

show  that  they are charitable and that they are concerned  with

the hygienic situation here.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Health also said at the meeting that the

problem  of  hawkers is also a problem of public health.  Let

me talk about the problem of hawkers.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In relation to public health?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Yes. On the question of public

health,  the  Public Health Division has got to  deal  with  the

question  of hawkers. I understand that the P.A.P. has  sacked  5

hawkers  inspectors. Or is it more? After, these inspectors  were

dismissed,  the  P.A.P. did  not  give  any  reason  for   their

dismissal.  The  only reason given is that they were  a  security

risk  and that they were a menace to security. As a result, these

inspectors have lost their jobs. From where do the P.A.P. want  to

employ new hawkers inspectors?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Sia Kah Hui)</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it on a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The point of order being?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Is the dismissal of hawkers inspectors

connected  with public health? If it is, it must be because  they

have not carried out their duties to see that general cleanliness

is  observed.  Otherwise, I do not see what connection  this  has

with public health.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the Member is trying to relate what he is

saying to public health. He is trying to say that, as a result of

the  dismissal  of  these hawkers inspectors,  public  health  is

suffering. May be, I do not know. We will soon find out  what  is

in his mind. Please continue. Mr Ong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I was merely

quoting the statement made by the Minister for Health that the

problem of hawkers has something to do with public health. I do

not know whether or not these people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>



have   been   dismissed   because  of  their   inefficiency   and

incompetence. The reason given by the Government is that they are

a  security risk. But I would like to point out that since  these

hawkers inspectors were dismissed, where is the Government  going

to  recruit  new hawkers inspectors? The Government has  not  yet

published any advertisement for the recruitment of hawkers inspectors.  They  merely want to recruit them through negotiations.  I

understand there is one hawker inspector who is a branch official

of  the P.A.P. One official has now been appointed. The dismissal

of  these  hawkers inspectors is solely aimed at  recruiting  new

hawkers inspectors who are supporters of the P.A.P. Those who are

supporters of the Barisan Sosialis, of course, will not have  any

hope of being recruited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I understand, none of the five hawkers inspectors is a

member of the Barisan Sosialis. Now the P.A.P. has engaged one of

its Party officers as a hawker inspector. If they feel that Party

officials  cannot  become civil servants, why should  the  P.A.P.

engage their own Party members to be civil servants?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Perhaps this might be a convenient time to

take the tea break and the Minister can reply?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and took

the Chair of the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I shall suspend the sitting of this House and

resume sitting at 5.30 o'clock.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We were on Head 0503 - Public Health Division. I

have just proposed the Question. Mr Yong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, once again I have to stand

up and say that the Opposition Member from the Barisan

Sosialis - in  this  case, the Member for Bukit Panjang - is just

like  his colleague, the Member for Thomson, who makes a statement

which is untrue  when  he says that I spoke at a meeting at  the  Victoria

Theatre  in which the Prime Minister addressed a number of  civil

servants on Saturday. I did not speak at that meeting; I was just

present  to  listen to the views of the Prime  Minister  and  the

civil servants, who discussed matters on Public Health. But I did

issue a statement which happened to be published at the same time

on the question of the appointment of the Director of the Central

Complaints  Bureau  to take charge of the reorganisation  of  the

Hawkers and Markets Department of the Ministry of Health. In that

statement I did say that the hawker problem is tied up  with  the

social problem and the public health problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find that the Member for Bukit Panjang actually spent a lot of

time  talking about the dismissal of 5 temporary - I underline  the

word  "temporary" - Assistant Hawkers Inspectors in the  Ministry

of  Health.  It  is  true  that  I dismissed  these  5  temporary

Assistant  Hawkers Inspectors in the public interest, and  I  was

rather amazed that the Member for Bukit Panjang went so far as to

say  that  these temporary hawker inspectors were not members  of

the  Barisan  Sosialis. Well, whether they were  members  of  the

Barisan Sosialis or not is a matter for his Party and the  people

concerned, but I think it is just typical of the Barisan Sosialis

in regard to their "expendables".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, after the 5 temporary Assistant Hawkers Inspectors were

dismissed, temporary replacements were appointed which were duly

processed through the Public Service Commission. At this moment,

the Public Service Commission itself is appointing not just the

replacements for the 5 temporary Assistant Hawkers Inspectors but

as many as 45 Assistant Hawkers Inspectors who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>



will  then form the core for a reorganisation of the Hawkers  and

Markets Department of the Ministry of Health.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the standard of

public health in Singapore is deteriorating. It is a fact, it was

not due to the disturbances in July and September. The situation

existed even before the occurrence of the two disturbances and

there is much left to be improved in the field of public health.

There was a cholera epidemic in the past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government tries to pass the buck to the civil servants for

having failed in their duties. This is not correct. Let us

discuss one matter. Recently the Minister for Health tried to

carry out a campaign to clean Singapore city. I cannot quite

remember the exact name of the campaign. In carrying out this

campaign, they did nothing apart from giving some publicity to it

over the radio and in the Press. It was mere publicity, because

they achieved very little from the campaign. They did not

mobilise the people in Singapore to implement the campaign

thoroughly to clean up the city. Many people have complained

about the bad situation in public health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Saturday when the Prime Minister talked to the heads of

departments concerning public health, he said that certain

departments had ignored the complaints of the public. As a matter

of fact, the Government should not put the blame on the civil

servants. It is the P.A.P. who should shoulder their responsibility. I should like to quote one example. In Queenstown

there is a market named "Princess Market". It is a big market

with more than a hundred hawkers' stalls, but so far the Government has not taken steps to clear the rubbish around this market.

Before the general election the Minister for Labour, when meeting

the hawkers in that area, had assured them that after his

election he would look after the problem of cleanliness in the

market and would arrange to remove the market rubbish. However,

after his election up till now, he has not done such a thing. Up

to July this year, when the Minister for Labour attended a dinner

and was approached by some of the citizens there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>



who raised questions on the cleanliness of the market, he

promised to help them, but after that he forgot about his promise. Now, the rubbish is piling up in that market. Of course, I

did not quote this example to show that the Minister for Labour

is not responsible, but since he has given such pledges, he

should fulfil them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who had complained to the Prime Minister and he

had accepted such complaints and had promised to deal with them,

but later on he forgot about them. This is his responsibility. On

the other hand, he has blamed the civil servants by saying that

they have not looked after the public health of Singapore. This

is very irresponsible of him. Our Ministers are busily engaged in

delivering speeches or giving publicity or going to the Cameron

Highlands to play golf, or to eat `satay' there. They have time

to go to the Cameron Highlands to enjoy themselves. Yet, on the

other hand, they accuse their civil servants of failing in their

duties. There is a saying, "When the top is not upright, then the

lower structure will be out of shape." There are some Government

departments which the P.A.P. can influence and to which they can

appoint their own people. On the other hand, some responsible

civil servants have been dismissed while they have appointed

their own people there. These people have no confidence in their

work and have to "kowtow" to the pressure of Government

appointees. All these important factors cannot he ignored by the

Minister. The Government wants to claim credit for itself but it

also wants to shed all responsibility by putting the blame on

other people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, on the

question of public health. I would like to give some of my views.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague has mentioned what the Prime Minister said in the

Victoria Theatre on Saturday the 14th. This shows that the

standard and condition of public health is very poor, as was

admitted by the Prime Minister. From what the Minister for Health

has said, it would appear that there have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>



difficulties in dealing with the problems of hawkers in  relation

to public health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the ballyhoo of the Prime Minister and the Minister for

Health on the question of public health, it would appear that

they are putting the blame on the hawkers for the present

condition of public health. The inference is that they can, from

now, take steps to persecute the hawkers further. Here I should

like to caution them - if they are to engage in such a move, then

it will be highly improper. The Minister for Health should see to

it that steps are taken to improve the conditions of public

health to protect the people and not try to put the whole blame

on the shoulders of the hawkers and to persecute them.

<hr size="2" noshade>

*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Lim Huan Boon.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vote for this item relates to the Director of Training (and

Head of Political Study Centre). I ask the Minister concerned, up

to now who is the Director or Head of the Political Study Centre?

Is he still the same expatriate, Mr G. G. Thomson? I believe that

certain  episodes by this gentlemen have been mentioned  in  this

House  in  the past at various sittings of the House. As  to  the

appropriateness of the appointment of this gentleman as  Head  of

the  Political Study Centre, we have raised our queries  and  the

Party  seems not to have paid any attention to them. In the past,

there   was  criticism  that  this  gentleman  might  have   some

connection with British



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>



Intelligence. If this is true, then such a person as Head of  the

Political Study Centre amounts to giving power to a British agent

to control such an important institution, because he may make use

of  his  position  to influence directly the  public  service  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is, is there really no capable person suitable

to fill this important post? Is it really necessary to have such

an expatriate gentleman in this post? I believe that it has been

quite a few years now since this gentleman was appointed. If the

P.A.P. are really sincere in the appointment of a local man, they

will not meet with any difficulties. It looks as though the

P.A.P. have great confidence in this particular person. Or

perhaps they feel that this person can very well be a useful tool

to provide them with information. We have heard what has been

uttered by Alex Josey, and perhaps the P.A.P. would like to take

its cue from Mr G. G. Thomson in regard to information given by

him. But the situation now after Malaysia is different. What we

need is an Asian who can understand the aspirations of the people

and the situation in South-East Asia. We need such a person in

the post, and not one who has been a colonial tool in the past.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> This is becoming a hardy perennial, and I

feel tempted to ask you, Mr Speaker, Sir, for a copy of last

year's Hansard so that I can read from it my reply last year.

However, the Gentleman says that Mr Thomson is an agent of

British Intelligence. Of course, no evidence is given. I am quite

certain that the Gentleman will not repeat this allegation

outside, without the privilege of this Chamber. But for the sake

of argument, let us assume that Mr Thomson is an agent of the

British Intelligence Service. Now what can the British

Intelligence Service get out of this? Mr Thomson is not party

to any important decision of the State Government, and is

therefore not in a position to give any information of value to

the British Government. He is not in a position to influence the

thinking of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>



local  civil  servants  to take a more kindly,  more  pro-British

attitude. As we have explained year in and year out, the syllabus

of  the  Political Study Centre has been worked out  between  the

Director, the Minister for Culture and me. It has been  found  to

be  of great value in past years in bringing to the notice of our

civil servants - who have led quite a protected life and who  were

therefore quite innocent of the great changes that were going  on

around them - the vast changes that were going on in Asia;  great

social  revolutions, either under the leadership of  a  Communist

Party, or the leadership of a nationalist Party. And the approach

here  is one of detached academic analysis. Now the courses  that

are  run by the Political Study Centre have proved so popular and

its  reputation has been so widespread that we have had  requests

from other territories of Malaysia for the staff of the Political

Study  Centre  to  carry out courses for the  officers  of  their

respective  State Governments. For instance, the Political  Study

Centre  has over the last two years run five courses in  Kuching,

two  in Sibu, one in Jesselton, one in Tawau, one in Sandakan and

one  in  Kuala Lumpur. To give an example of the content  of  the

courses, the first course in Kuching consisted of 15 lectures and

10  discussions. It was attended by 36 officers  of  the  Sarawak

State  Government  at  the  Sarawak Government's  Staff  Training

Centre.  The  subjects  included The  Evolution  from  Colony  to

Nations,  The Coming of Politics, The Civil Servant in a Changing

World,  The  Lessons of Singapore's Experience,  The  Lessons  of

Malayan Experience, Towards Malaysia, The Democratic Approach  to

Politics,  The  Communist  Challenge,  The  Marxist  Theory,  The

Strategy and Tactics of Parliamentary Democracy, The Strategy and

Tactics  of  Communism,  The  Marxist-Leninist  Conspiracy,   The

Economic Planning of a Nation, The Indian National Movement,  The

Chinese  Revolution:  (a)  The Nationalist  Revolution.  (b)  The

Communist Take-over, and finally, The Asian Revolution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, in addition to giving lectures to Government servants

not  only in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>



Singapore, Sarawak, Sabah, Kuala Lumpur and  so  on,

they  have  been running courses for senior business  executives,

because banks and big companies have asked the Government to  run

suitable courses for senior business executives. In the  last  15

months,  five such courses have been organised. And more will  be

organised as and when necessary. Now, of course, we do not expect

pro-Communist open front organisations like the Barisan Sosialis

to  take  kindly  to  these activities on our part,  because  the

principal purpose of the Political Study Centre is to make people

aware  that the democratic system does not succeed automatically,

that there are enemies - a closely-knit conspiracy - in our midst

who  make use of social democratic freedom to harass the  elected

government  of  the  day, bringing it into  disrepute,  creating,

complete  disorder and chaos by any means possible,  and  thereby

bringing a breakdown, a collapse of orderly organised government.

One of the reasons why the political position in Singapore is  as

stable as it is now today is that there is widespread recognition

among  members of the public of the dangers which the  democratic

system  faces  and  the  need for people  at  various  levels  of

leadership to take cognizance of this danger, to work together to

ensure that neither the conspirators nor their undercover leaders

would be allowed to undermine the democratic State.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh:</b> (In Mandarin): The Minister for Finance has

not  given a point-by-point answer to my questions. On the  other

hand,  he has been talking about Communism and the rest of it.  I

feel  that  it  is  useless  to repeat  my  questions.  When  the

Government  are unable to answer our questions, they  will  raise

other  side-issues  such as Communism and other  useless  things.

That  does not in any way answer my question. My direct  question

is   whether   the  Government  have  been  actively  considering

employing  a local man to fill this post, because this particular

expatriate gentleman has been filling the post for many years  as

Head of the Political Study Centre.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention of my question is that the Government should make

better  use  of  local men as far as possible.  The  question  is

whether  there is such a local man available at all,  or  whether

the  Government have a liking for this particular  gentleman,  or

whether a person in his position as Head, holds colonial views to

the  extent  that  the Minister for Finance and  the  Government,

being in the same boat, feel unable to dispense with him. That is

what  I ask them to answer. The Minister has not given any direct

answer to my question.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did say in my answer that

Mr G.  G. Thomson is the Director of the Political Study  Centre.

That being so, the present position is that a local person is not

in  occupation of that post. It is no use for the Barisan to  try

to  champion the cause of the senior officers. Nobody is taken in

by  that  sort  of propaganda line. Now, let me  make  clear  the

position  of the civil service and give it a certain perspective.

About  six  or  seven  years ago, there were  no  less  than  550

expatriate officers in all government departments. Today,  except

for  a  handful, mostly in technical departments - in  the  Marine

Department  and Marine Surveys - all these posts are occupied  by

local  officers. To bring about such a major change in  personnel

in  so  short  a time without a major decline in the standard  of

efficiency speaks well for the local officers. But I do not think

we  can  deceive ourselves into believing that we  have  anything

like the number of senior civil servants with the experience  and

capability  that  we would like to have. Competent  people  there

certainly  are.  Naturally there is also  mediocrity  as  in  any

organisation.  We also have men of outstanding  ability.  But  in

this  major  reshuffle of personnel, getting rid of 540  European

officers  and replacing them with local officers in  just  a  few

short  years has been a major operation. And all the able  people

that  we  have  we  keep  in policy-making  and  policy-executing

functions. Now, a post



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>



like  that of the Director of Political Study Centre,   I do  not

consider  a vital post in the administration. He does not  assist

Ministers  to work out important policies; he does not carry  out

policy  decisions.  He is there to explain the general  political

background  against which the country finds itself.  For  such  a

post  we  need  an  officer with some academic background,  some

erudition,  widely read, and particularly an ability  to  express

himself clearly, in terms which his audience can understand,  and

the   present  incumbent  is  eminently  qualified  to  do  this.

Eventually,  of  course, we have to find a local  officer  to  do

this.  There  are  in the Political Study Centre  now  two  local

officers  who are working with the Director. Whether one  or  the

other, or somebody recruited elsewhere, will take over the post I

do not know. We will make the decision at the right time when the

right person conies along.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the Minister for

Finance  says that many expatriate officers have left our service

and  the remaining few are in the technical service. He also  continues  to  hint  that the post of Director  of  Political  Study

Centre is not so important as to warrant a local man to fill  it.

But  to  me  the  question still remains  whether  this  post  is

important or  not. To me, the grade of the post, Grade E, drawing  a

salary  of  $1,670 per month, shows the importance  of  the  post

itself. The Minister for Finance has no desire whatsoever to fill

this  post with a local man. Even up to now he is not giving  any

consideration. Instead he is trying to give all sorts of  excuses

to  cover  up the continuation of an expatriate officer  in  this

post. Perhaps he has some difficulties.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I do not want to prolong this argument over

what  to  me is a very trivial matter. I will give an example  of

the  sort  of  thing we can do. Now, a Grade E post  is  very  important.  By a strange coincidence, there is another person  -  a

local  officer - who could very well have filled this post -  Grade

E,  Director  of Political Study Centre. There is an  outstanding

man in the Treasury. He is now holding



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>



Grade  E, but he is the Head of the Special Branch. But it  would

be  a loss to the administration if the present incumbent of Head

of  the Special Branch were to leave his post to do some teaching

in the Political Study Centre.  I am sure the Barisan will welcome

such  a  change, but we have absolutely no intention of  obliging

them in this respect.

Mr  Deputy Speaker, Sir, then I will withdraw what I have  said.

But if the Minister is inclined to answer, then I will continue.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, I do not mind clarifying the position as asked  by

the  Member for Thomson. The vote of $375,000 in last year's Estimates   was   the   Singapore   Government's   dollar-for-dollar

contribution  towards the cost of the memorial to  civilian  victims of the Japanese occupation. It has not been entered in  the 1965

Estimates as it is not anticipated that the memorial will be

paid  for  in 1965. It is likely that the memorial will  only  be

completed  in 1966 or 1967. Nonetheless, I would like  to  inform

the  House  that up to date the Chinese Chamber of  Commerce  has

already  collected  a  sum  of approximately  $140,000  from  the

public.  The Chamber has written to say that this amount will  be

paid  into  a  deposit account with the Public Works  Department

after  1st  December, 1964, with interest accruing. An equivalent

sum will then be paid into the same account by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following discussions with representatives of various religious

bodies,  it  has been decided to bury the remains of the  victims

and  not  to cremate them as originally proposed. As a result  of

this,  the  design of the memorial has to be altered, doing  away

with  the  vaults.  This will lead to a saving  of  approximately

$100,000  in  the cost of the memorial. When the  amended  plans

have  been  agreed by the Memorial Committee and the  Government,

construction of the memorial can progress, and as the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>



public  donations are raised by the Chinese Chamber of  Commerce,

the  Government will in the course of next year ask the  Assembly

to  vote  the remainder of the Government's share of the cost  of

the  memorial.  The  estimated  cost  is  $650,000,  less  public

contribution  in  1964  of $140,000, less Government

dollar-for-dollar  contribution  in  1964, $140,000  leaving  a  balance

of $370,000 to be accounted for.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One-half of this balance, i.e. $185,000, will be paid by the

Government  to match the other half to be collected  from  public

donations. However, I would like to assure the Member for Thomson

that  the  Government  will not back  out  from  its  promise  to

contribute its share towards this memorial. When the time  comes,

we shall come to this Assembly, if necessary, for a supplementary

vote.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the vote asked for in 1965 the sum to be given to

the  Kwong Wai Siu Free Hospital is only $15,000. I want  to  ask

the  Minister  concerned why such a small sum of money  has  been

voted  for  the  Hospital.  Is it because  of  the  size  of  the

hospital, or is it because of the small number of patients?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I noticed that the

Member  for Paya Lebar was looking at my colleague, the  Minister

for  Finance,  to  answer, but it comes  under  the  Ministry  of

Health. His question was whether the small sum of $l5,000 is  due

to  the fact that the hospital is dealing with fewer patients  or

not. If he will be good enough to look at the two columns of  the

Estimates for 1964 and 1965 for all the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>



charitable  organisations in respect of which  grants  are  being

made  for  the  Ministry of Health, he will find  that  they  are

practically  standstill grants, not only for Kwong Wai  Siu  Free

Hospital  but also for all the other organisations.  The  history

behind this is as follows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was in 1962 that a token grant of $15,000 was granted to this

free  hospital and it has remained at this same figure. They  did

apply  this  year for a grant of $50,000 but we  were  unable  to

improve on the previous grant for various reasons. First, because

the  Government itself is spending considerable sums in improving

the  hospital facilities; secondly, it is probably known  to  the

Member for Paya Lebar that this particular hospital, which has  a

long  history  as far back as 1910 when the first  Ordinance  for

Kwong  Wai  Siu Hospital was enacted provides for a  free  public

hospital  for  the treatment and maintenance of indigent  persons

connected with the Kwong Chow, Wai Chow and Siew Heng prefectures

of  the  Canton Province of China. It is true that they  are  prepared to give outpatient treatment to anyone who turns up at this

hospital,  but it is practically reserved as a hospital  for

in-patients,   for  those  of  Cantonese  extract.  Therefore,   the

Government  has  preferred to have a standstill  grant  for  this

particular  hospital, and it is the same for the other charitable

organisations.  There have been no increases  made,  because  the

Government   is  making  a  great  effort  to  improve   hospital

facilities for the public as a whole.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, I am not

concerned  with  the other organisations. I am  not  saying  that

contributions to the other organisations have increased,  whereas

the  contribution for Kwong Wai Siu Hospital has not. My  concern

is  that this hospital functions on a large scale. It is near the

Rumah Miskin area and is catering for popular needs. As far as  I

know,  the  expenses  incurred  by  the  hospital  are  met  from

voluntary  contributions and donations. This  hospital  not  only

caters for the ordinary patients but also for pregnant women.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being so, and since the hospital is expanding, one must

reasonably  expect  that  the expenditure  for  it  should  also

expand. As far as I know, there are more and more patients  going

to this hospital. In fact, there are more and more pregnant women

being  attended to by this hospital because of the population  increase. So the question now is whether one can consider that this

hospital is catering for the needs of the people to some  extent.

If  that  is  so,  then  it  is the duty  of  the  Government  to

contribute more towards the expenses of this hospital, because it

looks after the interest of the people. I urge the Government  to

contribute  more towards this hospital so that it can  expand  on

the  same  footing as that of the Thomson Road  Hospital  or  any

other  Government-run hospitals. With the help of the Government,

this free hospital will be better able to look after the interest

of  the  patients,  and  the problems and  difficulties  of  this

hospital  will  be  solved to some extent.  In  my  opinion,  the

$15,000  vote  is  only a token vote. It does  not  help  to  any

material extent. This is a hospital that is actually helping  the

people  and the Government should therefore pay more towards  its

expenses.  The Prime Minister himself is entitled to $10,000  for

his  transport  expenses; so compared to this figure  of  $15,000

there  is a wide difference. If you look at the vote for the  St.

Andrew's Hospital, you will see it is $129,000. This is also  too

small.  So I urge the Government to consider giving more  aid  to

hospitals  like  the Kwong Wai Siu Free Hospital  because  it  is

actually  catering for the needs of the people. I am  doing  this

not  out  of political interest - in fact, it has nothing  to  do

with  politics. So I urge the Government to try to  increase  the

figure.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have already

explained   that  there  are  always  requests  from   charitable

organisations  and, generally speaking, the Government  tries  to

comply  with  them  and make the necessary grants  but  sometimes

there are difficulties in the way. For example, the Kwong Wai Siu

Hospital asked for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>



$50,000, but because of the policy of standstill arrangement,  we

had  to  stick to $15,000. In respect of the St. Andrew's Mission

Hospital,  they asked for $174,000, but we stuck to $129,000.  It

must not be forgotten that we shall be expanding the Thomson Road

Hospital  from a 180-bed hospital to a 500-bed hospital,  besides

other  improvements to the Tan Tock Seng Hospital,  a  Specialist

Hospital for chest diseases where development charges and  so  on

will  be  to the tune of millions of dollars, and we are thinking

of  a  third General Hospital for the second Five-Year Plan which

has yet to be published.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I will say this, that I am all in agreement with the Member

for Paya Lebar that we should try to assist them. But perhaps  he

can  put  his words into action by coming forward to support  the

Kwong  Wai  Siu Free Hospital when they do have charitable  shows

and  giving  his support and encouragement so that they  can  get

more funds from the public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, just

now  the  Minister for Health has said that if I come forward  to

donate  money  to  this Hospital, perhaps it  could  get  a  good

response.  But the point is this, the Government is  well  within

its  powers to give generously to this Hospital. In the past, the

Government  asked for a larger vote for anything, and  if  it  is

sincere in helping the Hospital, it should table a motion and we,

the  Opposition  Party, will support. Just now the  Minister  for

Health  has  asked me to set a good example by donating  to  this

Hospital, but the point is that the Government is well within its

powers  to help the Hospital. This is not a responsible approach.

If  the  Government can well afford to do so, it  should  give  a

greater sum to the Hospital. It should not put the responsibility

on  individuals. There was a festival at Peck San Teng two  weeks

ago where the Prime Minister spoke quite a lot. This hospital  is

to cater for the poor, and in order to improve it, the Government

should  help  it. The Prime Minister is also concerned  with  the

expansion of this hospital. He says the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>



should  not  ask individuals to be responsible for the donations.

Well, if Government cannot afford to give a greater sum, then  it

should, of course, explain why. It should not ask individuals  to

take the lead in asking the public to contribute to the hospital.

<hr size="2" noshade>

*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Lim Huan Boon.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. Government claim that their

policy is for labour, to safeguard the interests of labour, to

prevent employees from being exploited by employers, and to

afford a good livelihood to the workers. In fact, they claim

theirs is a socialist policy. This has been emphasised and

stressed by them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year when debating certain laws relating to labour, there

was talk about this. The P.A.P., in order to safeguard the

livelihood of the people, cancelled the registration of certain

trade unions and suppressed certain progressive trade unions, for

example, the Naval Base Union, the Harbour Board Workers' Union

and other big trade unions, one of which was the General

Employees' Union. All these unions have been banned. Many workers

have lost their unions. Therefore, the employers can further

exploit then. But the P.A.P., in collusion with certain trade

unions, forced the workers to join unions led by Mr Devan Nair

and Mr Gomez. The then Minister for Labour made use of the

Government's power to suppress those unions which could really

look after the interests of the workers by forcing the workers to

join other trade unions which they do not like. This shows how

the P.A.P. increases its own forces and nurtures those trade

unions which support them, resulting in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>



weakening  of the trade union movement. Now we can see  that  the

workers  have  been forced by the P.A.P. to join  the  pro-P.A.P.

unions. What is the situation now? Can the workers' interests  be

safeguarded by those new trade unions? In other words, can  these

trade  unions - for example, the unions led by Mr Gomez and  Mr

Devan Nair really safeguard the interests of the workers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you some facts. As far as I can remember, before

those  unions were banned, their leaders worked for the  workers.

These  unions had accumulated large sums of money and these  sums

of money had been confiscated by the Government. We want to know,

after  the  implementation of this new policy, how  far  the  new

trade  unions  have gone in looking after the  interests  of  the

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Mr Devan Nair recently tried to leave

the S.T.C. As far as I know the reason why he wanted to leave the

S.T.C.  Union  was that the Executive Council had put  forward  a

claim  for a three weeks' bonus. However, this three weeks' bonus

had  been negotiated for last year and agreed to by the employer.

There  was  no  new  claim.  Mr Devan  Nair,  however,  was  not

satisfied with the Executive Council. He said that because of the

disturbances  the company was not in a position to  give  such  a

bonus.  He said the workers had no right to ask for such a bonus.

Because  of  this, he tried to resign from the S.T.C. Union.  Mr

Deputy  Speaker, Sir, if Mr Devan Nair did not know whether  the

employer  could give bonuses to the workers, how did he  come  to

know that the employers had no such right?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the S.T.C. have bought a lot of new buses. If the

Company is losing money, it will not buy new buses. Did Mr Devan

Nair  know the real position? If he did, he would have come to  a

compromise with the employer. He wanted to resign from the S.T.C.

Union,  but realised that to resign from it was a false move.  In

the  eyes  of the workers, he was not fighting for their benefit.

For



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>



this  reason,  he  was asked to go back to the  S.T.C.  Executive

Council and continue with the negotiations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain leaders in the S.T.C. Union expressed their views

that  the  S.T.C. wanted to give them the  three  weeks'  bonus.

Negotiations  for  this had been going on for years.  During  the

course  of  negotiations, the Company's management had agreed  to

the bonus. But, on the other hand, Mr Devan Nair claimed that it

was  not possible to give the workers a bonus. As leader  of  the

workers,  he  should  not have behaved in  such  a  manner.  The

Minister for Labour should have condemned him for selling out the

interests of the workers. Therefore, Mr Devan Nair at last  went

back  to  the S.T.C. Union and admitted his error. When  he  went

back,  he  raised one condition, that is, to sack the Member  for

Kampong  Kapor. In fact, when the P.A.P. wanted to  make  use  of

him, they sent him to Peking and put him in as the leader of  the

S.T.C. Union. But when they did not want to make use of him, they

just sacked him. Now, what has the Minister for Labour done about

this? Perhaps he is their own people and he will not do anything.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another absurd thing is that under the P.A.P.'s labour

policy - co-operation between employer and employee - the management

should  not  exploit the workers and the workers must  try  their

best  to  work  for  the  employer so as to  bring  about  mutual

benefit.  This  is what their labour policy is  for.  Mr  Gomez,

Secretary-General of the Singapore Manual and Mercantile Workers'

Union,  who advocated co-operation between employer and employee,

said, because  of  the  disturbances, employers  have  run  into

difficulties and the employees should make up for the  losses  by

working   overtime.   But  workers  also  suffered   during   the

disturbances. They lost their jobs and also incurred losses. Many

workers,  during  the  disturbances, had  to  borrow  from  their

relatives  or  friends in order to tide over the  period  of  the

disturbances. However, the employers have not been affected and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>



Mr  Gomez's  Union put forward the scheme to help the  employers

make up for their losses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in shops and factories, there is a break of 15 minutes at

ten  o'clock;  at 12 o'clock there is an hour for lunch;  and  at

half-past  three, there is a break for tea. But under the  scheme

to  boost  production, the workers have been asked  to  sacrifice

their  15 minutes tea-time and work for the employers. They  have

to  cut  down  their normal lunch time to half an hour.  This  is

absurd.  Saturday is a half-day and they are entitled to overtime

if  they  work a whole day; but according to the new scheme,  the

workers  are asked to work for the whole day on Saturday but  are

not paid overtime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is that the workers should not ask for sick

leave.  They should try to cut down on their sick leave, that  is

to  say, even if they are sick, they should not get leave.  Women

workers should not get their maternity leave.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, what is this boosting production

scheme? And our Minister for Labour has said nothing about  this.

All this has been done in the name of the P.A.P.'s labour policy.

This  had been carried out by the trade unions which support  the

P.A.P., the unions which profess to work for the workers. This is

a betrayal of trade unions. What is the result of the cooperation

movement?  From among the workers there is very poor response  to

this scheme. Therefore, this scheme is a flop.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, because of the P.A.P.'s own interests,

they make use of all means to deal with their political opponents

and  to  ban all those trade unions which do not toe their  line.

But  they foster those unions which bow to them, kow-tow to them,

and  those  workers  who do not join these  unions  will  not  be

entitled  to the benefits conferred by labour laws. For  example,

the  Singapore Manual and Mercantile Workers' Union has  been  in

existence for eight or nine years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 8-year history of the S.M.M.W.U., no worker has ever

wanted to join it. Mr Gomez was sacked by the General Employees'

Union.  He then led the Singapore Manual and Mercantile  Workers'

Union.  Because the workers have come to know him well,  that  is

why  they do not like to join this union. But the P.A.P., because

of  their  own interest, foster the S.M.M.W U. In spite of  this,

many  workers know that this particular union will not  be  in  a

position to help them. Mr Devan Nair used Mr Gomez ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Fong Kim Heng (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Dr Fong Kim Heng):</b> Order. The hon. Member's time

has expired.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are

today discussing the vote for the Ministry of Labour, but

unfortunately, the name of a colleague of mine. Mr Devan Nair,

was mentioned. I think it will be unfair if I do not rebut the

falsehoods uttered by the Member for Paya Lebar. He said that

Mr Devan Nair resigned from the S.T.C. Union because he refused

to fight for the three weeks' bonus for the workers. He went on

to say: How can Mr Devan Nair know that the S.T.C. was unable to

pay for the three weeks' bonus when he did not check the accounts

of the S.T.C.? This shows that the Barisan Members did not know

what had been going on. I am very closely associated with Mr Devan Nair,

and I know that the accountant, a professor, and Mr Devan Nair himself -

three of them - had asked the General

Manager of the S.T.C. to produce the accounts to show whether

the company had the capacity to pay a three weeks' bonus to the

workers. After investigating and checking the accounts, the

professor, the accountant and the adviser of the union, were

completely satisfied that they were not in a position to give a

three weeks' bonus to the workers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>6.48 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the adviser and his two colleagues still pressed on to

get  the  bonus  for  the workers. But why  did  Mr  Devan  Nair

resign? It was due to the plot of a handful of Barisan chaps and

the Alliance workers ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Kampong Kapor.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> They plotted together to mislead the workers

into  throwing out the recommendation of Mr Nair to  the  effect

that  the  company was not in a position to pay  a  three  weeks'

bonus.  As a result the workers did not accept Mr Devan  Nair's

advice, and as a trade unionist he did not want to put them  into

trouble, unlike the Barisan who helped the workers to close  down

many firms in Singapore. I think the Barisan have to shoulder the

responsibility for the hardships and difficulty that these people

are  now suffering. They are still unable to get jobs. Mr  Devan

Nair  is  an  intelligent  trade  unionist.  He  will  fight  the

management argument for argument. He has been the adviser to  the

S.T.C.U. from 1954 to 1964. Your trade unionist, Mr S. T.  Bani,

was at one time ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. "Your" meaning the Speaker?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sorry. Sir, I mean the Barisan trade unionist,

Mr S. T. Bani. He was thrown out by the S.T.C. workers. I think

that  is  enough to tell the Member for Paya Lebar that what  Mr

Devan Nair did was perfectly right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the allegation of the Member for Paya Lebar that the

N.T.U.C. is controlled by the P.A.P., I would like to  draw  the

Barisan  Members' attention to the fact that the N.T.U.C is  an

independent  institution.  Why do I  say  that  the  N.T.U.C, is

independent? The facts show today that although the  A.U.P.E, is

an  affiliate of the N.T.U.C., yet it is fighting the  Government

for better benefits, better pay, and so on. If, as the Opposition

Members have said, the N.T.U.C. is P.A.P.-controlled, it will not

fight



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>



against the P.A.P. Government. That is enough to show that it  is

independent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Member for Paya Lebar has boasted that S.A.T.U.

was  looking after the interest of the workers. I would point out

that  the  Hock Lee Union at one time was with S.A.T.U. Mr  Fong

Swee Suan was at one time its adviser. He negotiated a collective

agreement with the Hock Lee Bus Company for an annual 18-day sick

leave  for his bus workers, whereas in our Labour Ordinance,  the

provision for sick leave is 28 days. And this unionist boasted so

much!  He  negotiated  for  worse  terms  than  the  Government's

Ordinance provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members</b>: Shame!



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in this House

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not think he said that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Yes. I think he did.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Did he say that? Would the Member please repeat

what he said?



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> The exact words.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, these

shameless  slaves of the whites who argue on behalf of the  white

employers  are  willing to be servants and slaves  of  the  white

employers.  This is unprecedented in the history  of  the  labour

movement in Singapore. There has never been a true trade unionist

who  argues the cause of the employer, claiming that the employer

is not in a position to improve the lot of the workers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What have we seen in regard to the incident of the S.T.C. bus

workers  union?  We see that the workers' conditions  of  service

have not been improved, although the S.T.C. itself is flourishing.

Look at the working conditions of these workers and those working

in  the  Chinese bus companies! We can see the disparity  between

the  two sectors. In spite of the fact that the S.T.C. buses  are

running on profitable routes, while the Chinese buses are not  so

fortunate,  the  S.T.C. employees  are  getting  worse   working

conditions. Cannot the S.T.C. employers provide better conditions

for the workers? Their present conditions are worse than those in

the  Chinese bus companies. So the claims by the S.T.C. employees

are justified in view of the rising cost of living. In truth,  if

the  trade unionists and leaders of this S.T.C. union are  really

sincere  in looking after the interest of the workers, then  they

should not try to be slaves of the white ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. We are now on Head 0701 - Ministry of

Labour.  It is in order to refer to the trade unions in  passing.

But  a long and detailed discussion of trade union conditions prevailing  in  a  particular bus company is out of  order.  If  the

Member  will  just  mention them in passing to  substantiate  his

points, he is perfectly in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, talking about

labour  policies, in the past, the P.A.P. boasted to the  workers

of  Singapore  that their labour policy was very  pro-labour  and

that  they  thought  a  lot  about the  workers.  But  all  these

protestations  have been proved to be not so by  concrete  facts.

The facts have shown that the P.A.P. are actually serving the  interests of the foreign capitalists. Incidents have been many  and

there  are  concrete facts and evidence for us to  show  how  the

P.A.P, labour policy has been detrimental to the interest of  the

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we know that last year in Singapore there was a

trade  union,  namely, the Singapore Naval Base  Workers'  Union,

which had a long history, say, more than a decade. The workers of

this union raised claims for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>



better service conditions. Their boss was the British Naval Base

authorities, the colonial rulers. The claims by the workers had

been the unanimous opinion and wishes of the workers and decided

upon by the workers themselves. There had been several

negotiations with the employers' side. Because of the stubbornness of the employers, the claims were not settled

satisfactorily. In the end, it led to a strike by the workers to

assert their claims. In this matter, the Prime Minister, who had

claimed to be adviser to trade unions, had not shown any sympathy

for the workers. On the contrary, he adopted measures to break up

the strike and deregister the union concerned. After that, we

came to know that the military and police had been sent there to

beat up the workers with their batons. That is the P.A.P.'s

pro-labour policy. I, under such circumstances, when the workers

reported for duty on the following day, the Naval Base authorities sacked a number of the workers.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among them about 38 workers did not receive any compensation and

their  employment  was terminated by the Naval Base  authorities.

They were given a small chit saying. "Your post is now terminated

because of your participation in the illegal strike in the  Naval

Base."  But  16 of them did not receive this chit  and  yet  were

dismissed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After their dismissal, they approached the Commissioner for

Labour.  They pointed out to him the unjust action taken  by  the

Naval  Base  authorities  and asked for  remedial  steps  in  the

interests  of  the  workers. But the Labour  Department  did  not

proceed according to the stipulations of the labour laws for negotiations between the workers and the Naval Base authorities.  The

Labour  Department  did  not take any  action  to  safeguard  the

interests  of  the  workers or to act on their  behalf.  Yet  the

Ministry  of  Labour told the workers that they received  a  note

from  the  Naval  Base  authorities saying that  because  of  the

unsatisfactory  conduct  of  the  workers,  they  had  had  their

services terminated.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>



This attitude on the part of the Labour Department is comparable

to the attitude of the employer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me ask them whether such an attitude is correct. Were their

actions compatible with the stipulations of the provisions of the

labour laws? Because under the labour laws, if workers are to be

retrenched or dismissed, they should get three months'  wages  as

compensation and notice in lieu of compensation. But in this case

the Naval Base authorities did not comply with the provisions  as

laid down in the labour laws. The law provides that if a worker's

health  is  affected during the course of work, or his efficiency

is  lowered and he is found unsuitable for his job, then  if  the

employer  wants to dismiss him he should give him notice.  If  an

employee has served for more than seven years, the minimum notice

should  be  two  months; and if it is less than seven  years,  it

should  be one week. These are the provisions applicable  to  the

Naval  Base  authorities. It is also stipulated that  regulations

governing  working conditions and service should be in accordance

with  labour legislation in Singapore. Yet the dismissal  of  the

workers  was  not carried out in accordance with  regulations  as

valid  at the time. The Naval Base authorities should have  given

one week or two months' notice before dismissing the workers. But

they  did  not  comply  with  the  regulations.  Of  the  workers

dismissed,  there  were  some  who had  more  than  seven  years'

service.  But did the Ministry of Labour do anything to safeguard

the  interests of the workers or represent them? No, not at  all.

Instead  they  were  on the side of the Naval  Base  authorities,

speaking  for  the  employer, and claiming that  the  Naval  Base

workers  were  not justified in going on strike. In fact,  during

the  strike  the  workers were dismissed not in  accordance  with

normal  practice.  The  reasons  for  their  dismissal  were  not

justified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to mention in regard to the P.A.P.'s

self  proclaimed pro-labour policy is that concerning the  recent

Gian Singh trade dispute before the Arbitration Court.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>



The  Ministry  of  Labour referred the matter to the  Arbitration

Court.  What was the result of arbitration? It was to the effect

that  if the workers did not work in accordance with their  terms

of  employment, they should be liable for dismissal. What did  it

mean?  It meant that unless the workers obeyed all the conditions

laid  down by the employer, even if they were reasonable measures

such  as working to rule and a go-slow policy, which action could

be construed as not complying with the terms of employment of the

workers, then their just claims or actions would be thwarted  and

they  would not be able to resort to industrial action  to  solve

their grievances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 77 of the industrial Relations Ordinance provides

that  if workers resort to industrial action, the employer should

not  dismiss  them,  but  should wait for  the  decision  of  the

Industrial  Arbitration Court. I do not understand that.  Is  the

law  meant for the workers, or is the P.A.P. for the workers?  That

is  what I want to ask. If the so-called P.A.P. pro-labour policy

is such and since the Minister for Labour has been shouting about

democratic  socialism,  then such kind  of  democratic  socialism

should be thrown to the dogs; but even dogs would not feed on it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this, I would like to raise another matter,

namely, the P.A.P. wanted to prevent workers from choosing  their

own trade union and refuse them ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> On a point of order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b> remained standing.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member for Jurong resume his seat?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Under the new Standing Orders, I think a

Member  is  limited to 15 minutes when speaking in  Committee  of

Supply.  I  think the Member for Jurong has taken  more  than  15

minutes, and it is fair that he should allow others to give their

views.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I keep a close watch on the number of minutes each

Member takes. The Member for Jurong has only taken 14 out of  his

15 minutes. He has one more minute. Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh:</b> (In Mandarin):

Just now I was commenting on the P.A.P.'s pro-labour policy.  The

P.A.P. wanted  to  prevent the workers from choosing  their  own

trade  union. This can be seen from incidents such as  the  Naval

Base  workers'  strike. The strike action had  been  approved  by

secret  ballot. The majority of workers had unanimously  approved

such strike action, and the result of the ballot ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member's time is up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the Member of the

Barisan Sosialis has made certain charges against the Government,

some  of  which  have nothing to do with the Ministry  of  Labour

because  they  are concerned with the internal affairs  of  trade

unions. I think the Member for Bras Basah, who is Chairman of the

N.T.U.C.,  has  answered  some of the charges  quite  adequately.

There are other points which we should bring to your attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member of the Barisan Sosialis has made repeated charges

against  Mr  Devan Nair, the Secretary-General of the  N.T.U.C.,

when  he  is  not in a position to answer in this  House. It  is

unfair that such personal attacks have been made. It is said that

Mr  Devan  Nair has sold out the interests of the workers.  This

charge does not warrant any lengthy answer. It is very simple. If

Mr Devan Nair had sold out the interests of the workers, then in

April this year he should not have been elected by the people  to

the Central Parliament. But the facts are that during the general

elections in the Federation,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>



Mr Devan Nair, who represented the P.A.P., contested against a

Member of a Party allied to the Barisan Sosialis (Mr David)  who

was supposed to he the hero of the workers [Interruption] and  it

was  Mr Devan Nair who was returned, and not the so-called  hero

who   suffered  a  shameful  defeat  [Interruption]  during   the

elections.  If Mr Devan Nair had been a traitor to the  workers,

then  how  could  he  have obtained so  much  support  from  the

people? If the people's eyes are clear as snow, they can see for

themselves.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I must ask the House to keep quiet when the

Minister  is  speaking. I will not have these interruptions  from

both sides of the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you, Mr Speaker, if the

people can see for themselves, then how is it that your hero, the

hero  of  the Barisan Sosialis, did not get any support from  the

people? That is one point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong also mentioned the trade dispute in Gian

Singh  which was dealt with in the Industrial Arbitration  Court.

He  said that this has not been fair. We know, Mr Speaker,  that

this  trade  dispute  was  dealt with  by  the  I.A.C. which  is

independent, and the decision of this Court should give  rise  to

no  doubts  whatsoever.  If  they feel  that  the  Industrial  Arbitration  Court has not arrived at a fair decision, then  it  is

for the union to boycott the I.A.C. instead of resorting to it to

further their claims.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts are there for us to see. More and more unions are

going  to the Industrial Arbitration Court for help. From October

last  year  up to October this year many cases were referred  to

the  Industrial  Arbitration  Court.  The  collective  agreements

registered by the Industrial Arbitration Court number  some  199.

Of  this  number, 105 came from the N.T.U.C. group and  from  the

other group that is in support of the Barisan Sosialis there were

about 94 agreements



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>



which  gave  protection to about 8,849 workers belonging  to  the

Barisan   Sosialis  camp.  If  they  say  that   the   Industrial

Arbitration Court is no good, then why should they ask their  own

workers  to come forward to the Industrial Arbitration Court  for

protection?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to judge whether the labour policy of a Government is

good  or  bad,  there are two conditions which  one  can  use  as

criteria. One is whether the labour laws of this Government  have

the interest of the workers at heart and the other is whether the

Government is respecting the rights of the trade union  movement.

Otherwise all criticisms will be subjective and unrealistic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Barisan Sosialis Members were still in the P.A.P., they

praised the P.A.P.'s labour policy. Now that they have left, they

condemn the P.A.P.'s labour policy. Obviously, such behaviour and

criticisms  are  very  improper,  subjective,  unilateral  and  a

travesty  of facts. When the Barisan Sosialis Members were  still

with  the P.A.P., it did not mean that the P.A.P.'s labour policy

was  perfect. On the other hand, it does not mean that once  they

have left, the P.A.P.'s labour policy has gone to the dogs. It is

useless to shout slogans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. has not changed its labour policy, which is

pro-labour. We have contended in the past, we contend now and we will

still contend in the future that there should be industrial peace

through industrial justice. It is our policy to pursue this  aim.

We  have  not changed our policy. It is the Barisan Sosialis  who

have changed their stand because they have sold out the interests

of  the workers. After they betrayed the P.A.P., they have  tried

very  hard to turn the trade union movement and trade unions into

tools  for the Barisan Sosialis. They have tried to suppress  the

workers of Singapore; to bring the trade unions in Singapore into

a pro-Indonesian and anti-National United front. This act is most

detrimental  to the majority of our workers because  the  Barisan

Sosiahis  put the trade union movement in a state of crisis  from

time  to  time. As a result, the trade unions are unable to  deal

with labour and management disputes, which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>



are  sometimes made use of for their political aims. In fact, the

Barisan Sosialis have drawn into the political whirlwind the rice

bowls  of the workers because they are pro-Indonesian and

anti-national.  The united front that they have formed is  detrimental

to the workers of our nation. This is very clear, Mr Speaker. It

is  they who are the traitors of the workers. It is they who  are

trying to sell out the interests of the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the business of the trade union movement in Singapore to

try  to  shake  away from the control of these  traitors  of  the

workers. In this respect, it is the duty of the Government to try

to give the innocent workers every help.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was saying, Mr Speaker, that there are two conditions by

which  one could judge whether the Government's labour policy  is

good or bad. The first one is whether the labour laws are in  the

interest  of the majority of the workers. We can say  today  with

some  satisfaction that our labour legislation is very  excellent

compared to all others in South-East Asian countries. There is no

other  nation  which can rival us in our labour legislation.  The

most  important one that we have made is the Industrial Relations

Ordinance  which was passed in 1960. This sets up the  Industrial

Arbitration  Court.  One  can see that ever  since  the  law  was

passed, industrial relations in Singapore are heading for greater

and  greater  stability.  There are  less  and  less  strikes  in

Singapore.  Workers  can  now try to improve  their  lot  through

negotiations,  mediation and arbitration. They  do  not  have  to

picket  under  the  hot sun during strikes. Both  management  and

labour  can  talk over their terms peacefully and calmly  in  the

cool   chambers  of  the  Arbitration  Court,  without  incurring

unnecessary losses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we know that after the establishment of the

Industrial Arbitration Court, some 801 collective agreements have

been registered by the Court, benefiting 111,830 workers. It must

be  pointed  out  that agreements registered  by  the  Industrial

Arbitration  Court  have the protection  of  the  law.  Generally

speaking, we are quite satisfied with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>



implementation  of  the Industrial Relations Ordinance.  We  went

through the experimental stage, which is the first stage of  this

legislation,  and we are gathering our experiences  in  order  to

make further improvements in this Ordinance. We are now in active

contact  with  the Singapore Employers' Federation, the  N.T.U.C.

and  the  President of the Industrial Arbitration Court.  We  are

studying trade union problems together and, at the right time, we

shall make the necessary detailed amendments in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the second condition by which one may judge the

policy  of  the  Government,  that is,  whether  the  trade  union

movement  has the respect of the Government, I must say that  the

P.A.P. comes  from  the democratic trade  union  movement.  This

democratic  trade union movement is represented by  the  N.T.U.C.

Some  of our members, the P.A.P. members and the Members  of  the

House,  such as the Member for Bras Basah, are closely  connected

with  the  N.T.U.C. But it does not mean that we are dictated  by

the  N.T.U.C. or  the  N.T.U.C. is under  the  control  of  the

Government.  We  have  the  same  objectives,  and  that  is  the

establishment of a Malaysian nation. We want to try to  establish

a  socialist system within the whole territory so that there will

be no exploitation of man by man.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This aim can be carried out in two different ways. On the one

hand,  the  Government can realise this aim through its financial

policy  and measures governing taxation. On the other  hand,  the

democratic  trade  union  movement  is  trying  to  organise  and

mobilise the working class to realise this aim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the pro-Communist trade union movement has a long

standing  in  the  history of Singapore, whereas  the  democratic

trade  union movement is still in its infancy. Therefore,  it  is

necessary  for  the Government to be very careful  in  trying  to

foster the healthy growth of the democratic trade union movement.

The  democratic  trade union movement is facing difficulties.  It

has  to  put  up with a shortage of properly trained  cadres  and

leadership. The lower



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>



stratum  of this movement comes from the Chinese-speaking workers

whereas the leadership of this movement is English-speaking. As a

result of the language difficulties and differences in education,

there  are some conflicts and barriers between them, and we  are

trying  to  help  the  democratic movement to  overcome  these

difficulties in the years to come. Suitable leadership  and  support  for the democratic trade union movement will encourage  its

growth and make it flourish. This will help the industrialisation

scheme  of  the Government. The recent reshuffle in the  National

Trade Union Congress is worthy of our attention.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I will try to

make  use  of  the  next few minutes to answer the  Minister  for

Labour.  He  says that the trade union movement in  Singapore  is

very   progressive.   He  says  that  the   Government's   labour

legislation is the most excellent in South-East Asia. But I  want

to remind him that if it is so, it is not due to him that we have

this  progressive legislation. It is through the struggle of  the

workers  that  we  have come to the present stage.  How  can  the

P.A.P.  Government claim credit for such progress in  the  labour

legislation?  In some advanced countries, it is  true  that  some

trade  union  leaders have been imprisoned and that  success  and

progress  have  been  achieved.  He  has  said  that  workers  in

Singapore  do  not have to picket under the hot sun during  their

strikes.  He  seems to suggest that the workers  want  to  go  on

strike  for no rhyme or reason at all. I suggest to him that  the

workers are forced to resort to strike because they are unable to

solve  their  dispute  by other means. If  you  want  to  achieve

industrial peace, then you must look after the interests  of  the

workers rather than the interests of the foreign capitalists. The

Minister  seems to have spoken in defence of foreign capitalists.

It  is  the  P.A.P. who  is trying to disrupt  the  relationship

between the workers and the capitalists. As a result, the workers

are suffering misery.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has talked about the present trade union movement

trying to shake itself away from the control of the pro-Communist

elements. I would like to tell him that the question is not  that

simple.  There  is no question of shaking away from pro-Communist

elements. The question is that the P.A.P. is adopting suppressive

measures  to  try to silence some existing trade  unionists  and

trade  unions. They are putting them under their control  against

the  wishes of the people. We know very clearly the case  of  the

Naval  Base  Union  which  was banned and  deregistered  so  that

another  union was put up for the original members of  the  Naval

Base Union. But there was no support for the new union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministers of the P.A.P., together with their Backbenchers,

tried  to help the small group of trade unionists in running  its

new  union  and the Prime Minister found one day that he  had  to

officiate at the opening ceremony of the so-called new union.  So

it is the policy of the P.A.P. to support and foster unions under ---

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no freedom of the Press in Singapore.

This  is  well  known to everybody. Freedom of the Press  belongs

only  to  the P.A.P. and not to any other people, if  the  P.A.P.

want  to  publish any publications or magazines, they are allowed

to   do  so,  while  other  progressive,  healthy  magazines  and

publications  have been banned by them. They misuse public  funds

by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>



engaging in the publication of their party propaganda. This is  a

very clear example. I have here a publication by the Ministry  of

Culture  a small pamphlet, which was published with public  funds

but  not with the P.A.P. funds. This pamphlet contains statements

which praise the Prime Minister ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May we have the title of the pamphlet? Just give

the name on the cover.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The pamphlet is entitled "One

Hundreded Years of Socialism". It does not deal with the problems

of  Singapore; otherwise we would not criticise it. It deals with

the P.A.P.'s own affairs. In the Merger White Paper, no provision

was  made  for  the State Government to retain  its  powers  over

foreign  policy.  In what capacity did the Prime Minister  attend

the Conference? Did he attend it in the capacity of a diplomat or

in  the capacity of a Party leader, and is it right to use public

funds  to publish this pamphlet which is mainly for the publicity

of the P.A.P.? If they say that the State has powers over foreign

policy,  of  course,  it  may be right for  them  to  issue  this

pamphlet which has been published with public funds. On the other

hand,  the  P.A.P. have banned and suppressed  all  healthy  and

progressive  publications and magazines;  even  our  Party  organ

Barisan  has  been subjected to all sorts of interferences.  They

have threatened certain printing shops and coerced them into  not

publishing it. Now the printing shops have no political motive in

accepting our publication; they are interested only in  making  a

profit.  There  are hundreds of printing shops in Singapore,  but

because  of coercion these shops do not want to print  our  Party

organ.  Why  do  they not want to print our Party  organ?  Is  it

because they do not want to make a profit? No. It is because they

are  forced  by the P.A.P. Government not to print it because  if

they  do  so,  their  licence will be  cancelled  by  the  P.A.P.

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. can say that we have freedom of publication, we have

democracy,  we have freedom of the Press, and we can continue  to

publish our Party organ.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>



They  may claim that they have not suppressed our Party  organ.

However,  they  have tried their best to prevent  it  from  being

printed by the printing shops. This amounts to allowing a  person

to  live but not allowing him to eat. This is because the  P.A.P.

are afraid and they therefore try to prevent our Party organ from

being printed. They have accused the Barisan Sosialis, over the

radio  and  in the Press and even in this House, of  having  told

lies  and deceiving the people and the workers. But why are  they

afraid  to  reveal the truth? They say that the Barisan  Sosialis

are  deceiving  the people, but why should they he afraid?  They

should  allow our Party organ to he published. If we deceive  the

people  and the workers, we should be judged by them. Why  should

the  P.A.P, be  afraid? Therefore, I, feel  that  there  is  no

freedom  of  publication in Singapore. It  belongs  only  to  the

P.A.P. They have abused the freedom of publication for their  own

interest.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

think  I  can  save your time and the Lime of the House  by  just

reading out the answer I gave last year to the same old question,

the  same  old  problem, the same old grouse, that  there  is  no

freedom   of  publication  for  the  Barisan  Sosialis  and   the

Communists in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I know, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis publish a

cyclostyled  version of their paper. And if no printing  firm  is

prepared  to  undertake  the printing of their  publication,  the

reason  is  obvious. Any printer who publishes anything  must  be

prepared  to take the consequences of infringing the law  of  the

land. Sedition, treason, libel and so ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chia Thye Poh indicated assent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The point of order being?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): the Minister for Culture

said that our Party organ may contain some seditious and

libellous statements, if there are such statements in our ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the Member has misunderstood the Minister.

I think the Minister was trying to explain the reason why a

publisher might not want to publish certain papers. I do not

think he was accusing the Barisan Sosialis of having committed

anything. Mr Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Thank you, Sir, for clarifying what I have said

a few moments ago. The real reason is that no responsible printer

will dare undertake any publication by the Barisan Sosialis

especially in view of the fact that they are known throughout the

country for plugging Indonesia's line, advocating the cause of

treason. Also in view of the fact that internal security is in

the hands of the Central Government, no printer is prepared to

undertake any publication by the Barisan Sosialis. We ourselves

have placed no particular pressure except to draw the attention

of every printer that he is responsible for whatever he prints.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, again the complaint is that freedom of publication

belongs only to the P.A.P. As far as I know, the P.A.P. publishes

only one regular newspaper, the "Petir". Are the Sin Chew Jit

Poh, the Nanyang Siang Pau, the New Life, the Straits Times, the

Malayan Times - to take the daily newspapers - P.A.P.

newspapers? It is quite true that we have banned certain

newspapers. Everybody knows what publications they are. We banned

the Fajar - the Internal Security people are responsible for

security. Many of its leading lights are either under detention,

or have left the country to study law. We also banned the

University Tribune and the Partai Ra'yat publications. The Partai

Ra'yat and many of its members are known to be the advance guard

of Indonesia's invasion forces.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They left this country and joined and betrayed us to Indonesia;

they  came to kill our own people. A publication by any party  or

any organisation like that,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>



in  the interest of the country, must be banned because they  are

not  preaching democracy or expressing legitimate differences  of

views.  They are advocating treason. They are mouthing Indonesian

propaganda,  Indonesian  hostility  towards  us.  Therefore,  any

publication  like that, whether it is by the Barisan  or  by  any

other  group must be banned. But we have never banned  papers  or

publications which genuinely are against us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the lack of healthy publications, can the Barisan name, apart

from  these known pro-Communist publications, what other  healthy

publications  we  have banned? Can they give us the  names?  The

Barisan  Members are all University graduates; they  should  know

what kind of healthy literature, good books should be read by the

people  and  which we have banned, in fact, last year,  the  same

question  came  up on the lack of literature, reading  matter.  I

refer  to  Hansard,  Volume 22 No. 9, of 14th December,  1963,  I

asked  them,  Sir, at column 580, because they had  been  talking

about healthy reading matter, to give us a list - and I was quite

confident;  I could take a bet that there would not he  a  single

list  of  titles  coming from them - of healthy reading  matter.

That  was one year ago. Sir, and as far as I know, they have  not

submitted  one title, one magazine, one book, which they  believe

is not pro-Communist, not against the interest of the country and

which should be imported into the country. They have never given

me  a  list. I ask them again: if there is healthy reading matter

which  they  genuinely  believe will help us  to  make  ourselves

better  Malaysians, better citizens and which should  he  brought

into the country in any language - Malay, Tamil, Chinese or English

-  if  they feel that there are such books which we are withholding  and  which should be let into the country, then I  shall  be

prepared to consider them. But I know that the list of books that

have been banned - apart from sexy books which I am quite sure

they  do not want us to bring in - the other banned publications,

whether  produced  locally  or imported  from  abroad,  are

pro-Communist  literature, literature which advocates  the  cause  of

treason.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, what we have

said just now is that the Ministry of Culture has exercised its

power to suppress certain printing shops for printing our Party

organ. The Minister for Culture has said that if publications are

pro-Communist in content or laud the praises of foreign

countries, they should be banned. Such publications, of course,

in the end, will be banned by the Government. In so far as our

Party organ is concerned, we raise our points of view in the

interest of all the people of Singapore. If our "Barisan", the

Party organ, is not in the interest of the country, then the

P.A.P. Government may have cause to take action. But all action

taken by the Government should be open to all without having to

resort to behind-the-scenes manoeuvring and prohibiting the printing shops to publish our party organ. Such action is only done by

mean persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Minister for Culture mentioned

one  point - that as regards the banning of certain publications,

most  of  the  organisers or sponsors of these publications  have

either  run away or disappeared to foreign countries.  This  only

serves to smear such people. Now, what other significance did  he

convey? He uses words like "pro-Indonesia" or "Communists" as his

answers  to  all  questions. Last year he used  the  word  "Communists". This year he also uses the word "Communists" in answer to

all  the questions raised by the Opposition Members. This is most

irresponsible for a Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Government treats the people of this

State  in  such a way as not to give them freedom of  speech  and

publication, then the wishes and aspirations of the youths cannot

be  expressed  through  publications or  in  the  Press.  If  the

Government were to penalise the youths, it would only lead to the

youths  losing  their  confidence  in  the  Government  and   the

democratic   system.  This  would  amount   to   the   Government

suppressing the youths and forcing them into a tight corner where

they  are  to  carry  on  their political  struggle  against  the

Government. Such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>



action  by  the Government will cause the youths of Singapore  to

lose their confidence in constitutional means and that would only

reflect on the P.A.P.'s dictatorial actions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, today we have

seen the Barisan Members restating their past attitude and

practice in this House of crying about the death of democracy in

Singapore and claiming that there is no freedom of publication

and speech. In fact, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis are

now enjoying such freedom. Not only have they not made proper use

of their rights, but they have also been misusing these rights

even in this House. They have on many occasions praised foreign

countries and have now become the loud-speakers for Indonesia in

this House. Mr Speaker, in a democratic country the people

within the purview of the law should enjoy all the rights of

freedom of speech and publication. These rights are most obvious.

But the Government will have to do its duty to look after the

people of this country and to see to their security, especially

at this stage when we are faced with internal and external

threats. Internally, there are many anti-national elements making

use of this freedom to mislead our people in order to overthrow

our legally constituted Government. We not only respect the

people's rights, but we also see to it that good publications

which are beneficial to the people are safeguarded at all costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to spend some time talking about

the procedure for publications. Basing on principles of

democracy, first of all, an applicant will have to get a licence

from the authorities concerned. Later the publishing house can

proceed to publish the publication. After that the Government

will review the publication. Censoring is done only after it has

been published. Usually there are certain anti-national elements,

and it is very clear from the Barisan Party organ that the rights

of publication have been misused. If we were to have censoring

before publication, then I think that the first publication to he

banned would be their Party organ!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I will briefly reply to the Minister for Culture. He has quoted

from the Hansard of last year about healthy reading matter. He

says that the Barisan Sosialis have not been able to give a list

of the publications which have been considered by the Barisan

Sosialis as healthy reading matter. At that time the Barisan

Members asked the Minister for Culture to set up a Committee to

look into the list to see which was healthy reading matter and

which was not and should be banned. Today we still insist on this

line, to set up a special Committee to look into the

publications.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with reference to what has just

been  said,  we have a body of experts on literature  of  various

kinds. What I want to know from people claiming to be leaders  of

the people, graduates of a university, is this. Surely, Sir, they

should be able to give me at least 10 books. Maybe by tomorrow, I

will  ask them to give me five books which they think are healthy

literature which have been banned. That is all I ask of  them  to

do, Sir, because we want to know what it is they consider healthy

literature.  What I suspect they mean by healthy  literature  is

Communist literature. Or does it mean what most people understand

by  good literature? That is why I have been asking them for one

year  to give us a list. The Member for Bukit Panjang said,  "Set

up a Committee." All right, if we set up a Committee,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>



he  will  say that the Government is still  suppressing

healthy  literature.  So to give us guidance,  not  only  to  the

Singapore  Government but also to the Central Government,  as  to

what  they  mean by healthy literature, I ask them to give  us  a

list of five books, even three books, which have been suppressed,

or  even  one. Tomorrow? Now? The educated Gentlemen  who  have

spent  a  lot  of  money going through intensive courses  in  the

University  can surely give us one title of what  they  think  is

healthy literature which the Government has banned!
