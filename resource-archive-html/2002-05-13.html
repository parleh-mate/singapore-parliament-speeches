<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>OPENING OF TIDAL GATES AT KRANJI RIVER AND RESERVOIR</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung</b> asked the Minister for

the  Environment (a) what measures are in place to  warn  the

public  about the opening of tidal gates at the Kranji  River

and  Reservoir and (b) whether there are any other  areas  in

Singapore where there are similar situations.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Swee Say):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  PUB  has put in place  the  following  safety

operating  procedures at Kranji to warn  the  public  on  the

opening of the tidal gates:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) A siren is sounded for two minutes to warn the

public on the opening of the tidal gates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) A visual check is done to ensure that the channel

outside  the  gates  is  clear  of  human  activities  before

operating the gates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Both sides of the channel are guarded by high

fencing, running for about 80 metres downstream.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>



(iv)  Signboards  are placed in the park  area  to  warn  the

public  of the potential danger of rapid water flows  in  the

channel in the event that the tidal gates are lifted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin asked whether there are any other areas in

Singapore where there are similar situations.  Sir,  PUB  has

tidal  gates  at  four  other locations.   These  are:  Lower

Seletar  Reservoir, Poyan Reservoir, Pandan Canal and  Jurong

Lake.  Safety operating procedures similar to those in Kranji

are also observed in these four locations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members may wonder how effective these safety

measures have been.  These procedures have been in place  for

27  years.   There has not been any accident or mishap  being

linked to the operations of the tidal gates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the recent incident on 14th April 2002, I am

aware  that  there has been some speculation, as reported  in

our local media, that the incident might have been caused  by

the  operations of the tidal gates. So far, PUB has not found

any technical evidence suggesting that this may be the case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the incident is now under police investigation.

While  awaiting  for the outcome of the police investigation,

the  PUB  has introduced two extra safety measures to address

public concern.  These are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Converting the signboards in the park area into

four languages, and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) PUB staff using a loud-hailer to warn the public to

stay  clear  of  the water channel before opening  the  tidal

gates.  This is a temporary measure.  We will review the need

to  continue  with  this  measure as  well  as  the  need  to

introduce  further  measures pending the  outcome  of  police

investigation.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, may I ask

the  Minister whether the need for all these safety  measures

does  suggest that there are certain dangers involved in  the

opening  of  these  tidal gates?  Could he perhaps  elaborate

what  these  dangers are likely to be and whether there  will

indeed be a proper



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>



inquiry  into  the extra measures, if possible,  rather  than

waiting  for the police investigation because I am  not  sure

what  the  police  will come up with?   But  surely,  he  has

experts  in  the  Ministry who can perhaps  do  the  function

better.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, Prof. Chin asked two questions:

firstly,  what  are  the  likely dangers  involved  with  the

opening of the tidal gates?  Sir, to be more specific, I will

explain  using the Kranji tidal gates.  For the Kranji  tidal

gates, there are two types of operations.  The first type  is

when  the  water  level in the reservoir  reaches  a  certain

level.   To prevent any upstream flooding or overflow of  the

reservoir,  the floodgate will be lowered from the  top,  ie,

the  flag  gates  are  declined, so that  the  water  in  the

reservoir  can overflow into the channel.  For this  kind  of

operation, the lowering of the flag gates, the danger area is

actually  very small.  It covers only the first 40 metres  of

the  channel.  In fact, this is the reason why the  first  80

metres of the channel is guarded by this high fencing so that

nobody  could  get  access to the  first  80  metres  of  the

channel.  In other words, the lowering of the flag gates is a

fairly  safe operation and the danger area involves only  the

first 40 metres in the channel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin and the other Members may wonder: if that is

the case, why have these signboards to warn the public of the

danger  of  rapid  flow?   Sir,  there  is  another  type  of

floodgate  operation, which is, if the lowering of  the  flag

gate  is not enough to contain the rising water level in  the

reservoir, then in extreme situations, we may have no  choice

but to lift the floodgate entirely.  This vertical lifting of

the  floodgate will cause the water in the reservoir to  rush

through the floodgate from the bottom.  Obviously, the  speed

of  the  flow in the channel will be much higher.   In  other

words,  in  operating a floodgate, PUB does look at  the  two

different  types of operations.  In the case of lowering  the

flag  gate,  PUB  staff will ensure that the  immediate  area

outside of the floodgate is cleared of human activities.   On

the  day of the incident, that was indeed the case where  the

flag  gate was lowered but there was no requirement  on  that

day to lift the floodgate.  In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>



other words, the danger posed by the lifting of the floodgate

did not happen on that day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Prof. Chin asked whether there would be a

proper inquiry conducted to look into the incident.  Sir, the

main  responsibility of PUB is to make a technical assessment

on  the  potential impact of the tidal gate operation on  the

water  surrounding  the area.  As regards  investigating  the

cause of the incident, this comes under the police under  the

Ministry of Home Affairs.  We will leave MHA to complete  its

investigations.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Sir, why is the PUB

dumping  water  into the sea?  Is there not a  way  where  we

could  channel  this excess water into some other  reservoirs

directly to save the water?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Tan raised a very

interesting  point.   Today, in Singapore,  our  daily  water

consumption is about 300 million gallons.  To make sure  that

there  is  enough water stored in the reservoirs in  case  of

drought and so on, we have created as much reservoir capacity

as we can.  At this moment, the water storage capacity in our

reservoirs  is  about 100 times our daily consumption  -  300

million  gallons  multiply by 100 times will  give  us  about

three thousand million gallons of reservoir capacity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PUB's strategy is to manage our water supply and

consumption in such a way that, as far as possible, we  would

like  to  keep the water level in the reservoirs as  high  as

possible.   In  case we run into a situation of  shortage  in

water supply due to drought season, these reservoirs will  be

able to serve as a buffer.  The water level in the reservoirs

now  is about 90%.  During a heavy downpour, we will have  to

let go some of this water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure Mr Tan and Members here that we

are certainly not wasting all our rain water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day of the incident, from 5 pm to 5.30 pm, the

opening of the floodgate released about 17 million gallons of

excess rainwater.  But during the same half



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>



an  hour  period,  we  managed to capture  about  51  million

gallons.  In other words, three-quarters of the downpour were

captured  and  retained  in the reservoir.   The  other  one-quarter,  unfortunately, has to flow away because  the  water

level  in the reservoir has already reached 90% which is  the

safety limit.  However, Mr Tan may be happy to learn that  we

are  now  embarking  on  a  programme  to  link  up  all  the

reservoirs.   This  is to ensure that in a situation  whereby

some  reservoirs may have reached 90% while  there  is  still

spare  capacity  in the other reservoirs, we  will  be  able,

through  this  reservoir integration scheme, to minimise  and

reduce  the need to lower the floodgate at times of  a  heavy

downpour.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> The Minister just now

mentioned that there are four other areas with similar gates.

Is  his  Ministry likely to conduct a survey  as  to  whether

these  areas will also pose likely dangers to members of  the

public?   Would it be better to make sure that no members  of

the  public use the areas near the floodgate at all to  avoid

such incidents?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I mentioned

earlier, the same safety operating procedures do apply at all

the  four locations.  Further to that, the PUB has looked  at

the other four areas and concluded that the only area at this

moment  where there is mud flat and visitors is at the  Lower

Seletar  Reservoir.  PUB is going ahead to change the warning

sign there into four languages as well.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mdm Halimah Yacob</b> asked the Minister for Transport

what  measures  are  being taken to  ensure  PSA  Corporation

Limited's  competitiveness in view of the  intense  challenge

posed by other ports to PSA's premier position.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Transport) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Transport (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, first, let me assure the House  that  PSA  has

been a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>



competitive  port  operator, and  that  it  is  committed  to

remaining  so for the long term.  Despite the decision  of  a

major  customer,  Maersk, to hub elsewhere,  PSA's  container

throughput  for the first four months of this  year  went  up

8.6% compared with last year's figures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a reflection of its capabilities, PSA has been

consistently  voted the best container terminal  operator  in

Asia for 13 years.  More than 250 shipping lines call at  the

port, providing PSA with superb connectivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, shipping is a dynamic and increasingly

competitive  business.  This  is  especially   so   for   the

transhipment  business, as shipping lines need  not  call  at

Singapore to tranship their containers.  Given the  open  and

competitive  nature  of  the shipping  industry,  it  is  not

uncommon  for new ports to woo shipping lines,  and  for  the

latter to seek out ports which offer better commercial terms.

PSA  expects that it will continue to grow its volumes in the

coming  years even as shipping lines readjust their ports  of

call.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many positives in PSA's favour, including

its  high  connectivity, high productivity, reliable services

and  a large critical base of over 15 million TEUs per annum.

It  took PSA many years to achieve this, and it will not lose

its big lead overnight.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, let me add that PSA is acutely aware

that  the  competitive  environment is  constantly  changing.

Competition  for  the  regional  transhipment  business   has

intensified, with countries in the region striving to develop

their  own hub ports.  PSA is reviewing its strategy, and  is

taking steps to anchor its customers here for the long  term.

It  is  committed to remaining customer-oriented  and  price-competitive in order to maintain and grow its position as the

world's number one transhipment port.  PSA will also continue

to  innovate  and  add  value to  its  services  through  the

adoption of new technology and processes.  It will share  the

savings from productivity improvements with its clients. This

win-win approach will help



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>



entrench PSA's long term position as a hub port.

.     The  Government,  through  agencies  such  as  MPA,  IE

Singapore,  EDB  and  MAS, will also  continue  to  grow  the

maritime  services  sector.   These  activities,  like   ship

management,  ship financing, insurance and other  specialised

services,  provide high value-add to the  economy.   In  this

regard, I am pleased to announce that MPA is setting up a $80

million fund to help speed up the development of the maritime

sector.  One key focus of the fund will be the development of

the  specialist knowledge and expertise needed by the sector.

Details  of  this  fund  and how the shipping  community  can

benefit  from it will be released by MPA shortly.   The  fund

and  its programmes will complement PSA's efforts, and ensure

that Singapore continues to grow as a hub port, as well as an

International Maritime Centre.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, the Minister has

mentioned  that PSA is looking into ways on how  to  innovate

its  operations, its business, as well as how  to  share  the

productivity   gains.   The  situation  is  now   much   more

competitive.  Competitors are giving things like lower rates.

They  are also allowing a share in the port operations.  Does

it  suggest that PSA has failed to look at all these areas of

innovation before?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to ask the Minister what useful lessons can

other  Singapore  companies draw from PSA's  experience,  and

what are the implications to workers and management in PSA as

a result of this development.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, PSA has had a very competitive

regime  of  rates.  As you know, the marketplace  is  a  very

dynamic   one.    Different  ports  offer  different   rates,

different benefits.  And PSA has always strived to make  sure

that it is able to keep ahead of the competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the two lines that are leaving to hub

elsewhere - one of which has already left - they were offered

terms which they found difficult to turn down.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>



PSA  is reviewing its strategy now.  As I have mentioned just

now, primarily, it has to be price competitive.  But price is

not  the  end of the story, because what shipping lines  look

for are other services.  It is the range of services that can

be  provided because, at the end of the day, they are looking

at  the total value chain that the port can give.  A port can

give very low rates.  In fact, there are many ports that give

rates  that  are  far, far below what PSA is offering.   But,

because of inefficiencies and other problems, the total  cost

incurred  by  the  shipping line to call at  those  ports  is

actually much higher than what it would cost to call at  PSA.

So  it  is  a  total  equation that  has  to  be  taken  into

consideration.   PSA is reviewing this total equation to make

sure  that it is still the most cost effective port  to  call

at.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Prime Minister has mentioned, we would definitely

consider   the  other  options  as  well,  such  as  offering

dedicated terminals and offering shareholdings in PSA by  the

shipping   lines.   All  these  options  are  being  actively

explored at the present moment.

<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang):</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister

whether  there  is  any success in wooing back  some  of  the

shipping lines which have gone to our rival ports?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, whilst Maersk has shifted its

hub  to another port, I must inform the House that Maersk  is

still a substantial customer at PSA.  It has retained some of

the  international routes through PSA, and it  is  sending  a

large number of containers through PSA port every month.

<div align="center"><b>AIR HUB</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang</b> asked the Minister for

Transport  with  growing  competition  from  other  countries

setting in, what are the plans to keep Singapore an important

air hub over the next 10 years.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, competition to Changi as a

regional air hub is not new.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>



Many new airports have opened in the region, offering new and

larger  capacity;  more are being planned.  In part, this  is

due to the rapid expansion of the air passenger and air cargo

market  as Asian economies grow.  The Asian financial  crisis

and  September 11 have temporarily disrupted the growth,  but

the   long-term  trend  is  positive.   As  a   result,   the

competition amongst airports will continue to intensify.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To preserve our position as an air hub, we will continue

to  focus  on  three  main areas.  First,  strengthening  our

position  as  a  regional business  and  tourism  hub.   This

ensures that there is high passenger traffic originating from

and  coming into Singapore.  A strong economy also translates

into  large numbers of Singaporeans who can afford to  travel

abroad for business or on holiday.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, enhancing our connectivity. Fifty eight

scheduled airlines now serve Singapore, connecting us with 50

countries  and 139 cities.  This huge network  of  air  links

provides  the excellent connectivity that makes Singapore  an

important  air  hub.  Passengers can fly into  Singapore  and

catch a convenient connecting flight to his next destination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, providing the highest standards of airport

service.   We take great pains to ensure that Changi  Airport

is  well designed, equipped and managed, so that the airlines

and  air passengers who use Changi Airport find their  Changi

experience a memorable one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of all these efforts, Changi Airport has

been  rated  highly  by  passengers, airlines,  shippers  and

freight  forwarders.  Particularly noteworthy  is  the  Eagle

Award  conferred  on Changi Airport by the International  Air

Transport  Association last year, as a token of the airlines'

appreciation for the excellent service extended  to  them  by

Changi  Airport.   If we continue to remain relevant  to  the

airlines and the passengers and alive to the competition,  we

will be able to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>



keep Changi's hub status in the region for the long term.

<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, with

increased  competition coming in, how are we to maintain  our

cost  structure,  especially when we are  giving  value-added

services and adding new infrastructure to our airport?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, first, Changi Airport will

continue to make sure that it runs a very tight ship, so that

it  can  keep  the  cost down by being efficient.   Secondly,

Changi  Airport keeps a very constant eye on the competition,

to  make sure that the rates that it charges are not  out  of

line,  and  that airlines do find it profitable  to  continue

calling at Changi Airport.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT INFRASTRUCTURE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Audit of use and sharing of surplus capacity)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Fu Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mrs Yu-Fu Yee Shoon</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

and Minister for Finance (a) whether there is a procedure  to

audit   the   use  of  Government  infrastructure   such   as

educational  institutions, voluntary welfare centres,  family

service  centres,  community centres and  sports  centres  to

ensure  their efficient utilisation and (b) whether a  system

can  be put in place for voluntary welfare organizations  and

grassroots   and  civic  organisations,  such  as   Community

Development   Councils,  Citizens  Consultative   Committees,

Community  Club/Centre Management Committees  and  Residents'

Committees to share any surplus capacity.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Government development

projects  are  implemented only after a rigorous  process  to

assess need as well as the relevant costs and benefits.  This

applies  to  facilities  such  as  educational  institutions,

voluntary  welfare centres, family service centres, community

centres  and sports centres.  Judicious rental policies  also

help   to   promote   efficient  space   utilisation.    More

importantly, the various community organisations which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>



use  the facilities are accountable to their funding agencies

and  to  the  public for the effective and efficient  use  of

their    resources.     For   example,   voluntary    welfare

organisations are accountable to funding Ministries  such  as

MCDS  which  would monitor the effectiveness of the  services

and ensure value for money.  The People's Association has  an

established   system  of  ensuring  proper   utilisation   of

Government  funds  allocated  to  the  community  centres  or

community clubs and other community facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government also facilitates the co-location of

community  facilities, including family service  centres  and

other  social service facilities, community clubs,  libraries

and  so  on,  to  optimise land resources, and  provide  more

convenient   and   integrated  services  to   users.    Where

appropriate,   the   co-located   facilities   share   common

facilities   such   as  multi-purpose  halls,   to   optimise

resources.   URA  chairs a regular Community  Facilities  Co-ordination  Committee  meeting  with  relevant  agencies  and

parent  Ministries  of  the common  community  facilities  to

facilitate implementation of co-location.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo's suggestion for various community groups and

voluntary welfare organisations to share space or premises is

a  useful  one.  Such arrangements can be worked out,  taking

into   account  the  needs  of  the  clients  or  users   and

operational requirements.  This is already taking place among

Community  Development Councils (CDCs) and various grassroots

organisations,   which  work  closely  together   and   share

resources.  The five CDCs are using the CCs and RCs to  reach

out to a larger number of residents.   For example, the South

East  CDC  is using Potong Pasir Community Centre  and  Bedok

Community  Centre  as service points.  The  Singapore  Sports

Council has also piloted a programme whereby selected  school

fields are opened for public use outside school hours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, more can be done. Although plans are made

centrally for maximum utilisation of infrastructure funded by

the Government, full efficiencies can only be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>



extracted  by  goodwill and good sense  between  the  various

facility  owners  on  the ground.  MOF will  also  work  with

agencies  such  as MCDS and MOE to make improvements  to  the

allocation and sharing process for the greater benefit of the

community.  At their end, line agencies must foster a culture

which seeks to optimise and integrate services.

<div align="center"><b>PROCREATION TAX REBATE SYSTEM</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Extension)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Miss Penny

Low  -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. To ask the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for

Finance  whether the income tax rebates given to parents  for

procreation  can be extended to offset other types  of  taxes

like  property tax and vehicle tax, as many do not pay income

tax   and  hence  will  not  be  able  to  benefit  from  the

procreation tax rebate scheme.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Question 5, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government

grants  income  tax  rebates  for  procreation  to  encourage

working parents who pay income tax to have more children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The income tax rebate is not meant to be a general tax

rebate  or  a  grant which a parent may use to  offset  other

taxes.

<div align="center"><b>PETROL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Tax dollars earned and tax reduction)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister  and Minister for Finance (a) what is the amount  of

tax  dollars  earned  for each litre of  petrol  consumed  at

petrol  stations;  and (b) whether, in  view  of  the  rising

petrol prices, there are plans to reduce the petrol tax.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for every dollar of

the retail pump price, 35 cents go to petrol duty and 3 cents

to GST.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petrol duty was reduced from 40% to the current 35% last

October   as   part  of  the  off-Budget  package   to   help

Singaporeans  cope  with the economic  downturn.   I  do  not

propose to further lower the duty on petrol.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's pump prices and petrol duty are not

excessive  compared  to those of many other  countries.   For

example,  in the UK, the price per litre of petrol  is  about

S$1.90.  In Japan, it is about S$1.80; in France S$1.62.   In

Singapore, the average price is about S$1.20.  The  price  of

petrol  in Malaysia is about half of that in Singapore.   But

Malaysia is an oil-producing country and the retail price  of

petrol  is  subsidised and controlled by the Government,  and

kept well below world prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for petrol tax, it is up to 78% of the petrol price

in  the  UK. In France and Japan, the tax on petrol is  about

73%  and 56% of the price, respectively.  Singapore's  petrol

duty is 35% of the pump price.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir,

can  the Minister advise whether the petrol duty is also used

as a form of vehicle control and usage?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is both a

revenue measure and also a form of vehicle usage control.  It

is  less important as a usage measure now because we have the

ERP, but it is still not insignificant.

<div align="center"><b>OLDER WORKERS</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Ms Irene Ng

Phek Hoong -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. To ask the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the

success  rate of job-matching for workers aged above 40;  (b)

how  many  older workers have been employed under the  People

for  Jobs  Traineeship Programme since it was introduced  and

(c)  whether  his  Ministry has received  complaints  of  age

discrimination



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>



in  the  job  market  and, if so, how does  it  address  this

concern of older workers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Question No. 7, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  over the past months, my  Ministry  has  been

working  closely with our partners, including NTUC, Community

Development Councils and self-help groups, to provide workers

with  job  matching and training assistance.   These  efforts

include  job  referral  services  at  my  Ministry  and   our

partners,  job  fairs  and  traineeship  programmes  for  the

unemployed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On average, 1,200 unemployed Singaporeans, including 600

aged 40 and above are successfully placed each month.  At  my

Ministry's career centre, for example, about 60%  to  70%  of

the  job  seekers would receive referrals for job  interviews

with  prospective employers.  Close to 15% would successfully

find  jobs through our referral services.  However,  for  job

seekers aged 40 years and above, the placement rate (that is,

the  rate at which they obtain their jobs through our  direct

assistance)  is  significantly lower; it is  only  8%.   This

shows  that  older unemployed workers face greater challenges

in their job search.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also encourage unemployed workers to explore other

avenues in their job search and not just wait for us to  find

them a job.  Hence, some job seekers who come to us initially

would  subsequently  find  jobs through  their  own  efforts.

Overall, 59% of Singaporeans aged 40 and above retrenched  in

the  first  9 months of 2001 were re-employed by the  end  of

2001.  This is lower than the national average of 65% and the

average of 70% for Singaporeans aged below 40.  Again,  these

numbers  indicate  the greater difficulties  faced  by  older

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem faced by older workers is a multi-faceted

one.   Some  reasons commonly cited include higher wage  cost

resulting  from  our  seniority-based wage  system,  lack  of

skills   to  meet  the  needs  of  new  jobs  and  employers'

preference for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>



younger  workers who are perceived to be more  trainable  and

adaptable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has put in extra efforts to assist older

workers.   To help them pick up new skills, we have  provided

higher  level  of funding support for the training  of  older

workers.   Last year, we also introduced the People for  Jobs

Traineeship Programme to redeploy unemployed workers aged  40

years  and above to different industries or jobs.   To  date,

close to 2,000 older unemployed Singaporeans have found  jobs

under this programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry had received a few complaints from older

workers  regarding  age discrimination.  In  2000  and  2001,

there were 4 and 5 complaints respectively.  These complaints

were   investigated  and  where  there  were   discriminatory

practices, the employers concerned were warned and advised to

refrain from adopting such practices.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The Ministry introduced the Primary

Care  Partnership  Scheme  (PCPS) in  October  2000  to  make

subsidised medical services more accessible for lower  income

elderly  Singaporeans.  The scheme was  implemented  in  four

areas  and subsequently extended to five other areas in  July

2001.    It  offers  needy  elderly  Singaporeans  the  added

convenience of receiving subsidised primary care  at  private

clinics near their home instead of travelling to polyclinics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PCPS is open to Singaporeans aged 65 years and above

with  per capita household income of $700 per month or below.

Between October 2000 and February 2002, some 700 elderly poor

have  signed up for the scheme.  They were served  by  87  GP

clinics and made more than 3,000 attendances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1st March 2002, the Ministry extended the PCPS to all

constituencies in Singapore and widened the scope to  include

basic dental services.  An additional 900 elderly have signed

up  for  the scheme since March bringing the total  to  1,600

elderly.   There  are currently over 500 GP  and  200  dental

clinics  under the PCPS.   The PCPS is expected to  cost  the

Government $8 million a year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will continue to work with grassroots

organisations  to  promote the scheme to  the  elderly.   The

Ministry  has  no  plans currently to extend  PCPS  to  other

segments of the population.

<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang:</b> Can I ask the Minister how do

the  doctors  accept  this scheme?   Do  they  find  it  very

convenient to use or very cumbersome for them to administer?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have tried to

make   the  administrative  arrangements  as  convenient   as

possible, but it incurs extra administrative work by  the  GP

clinics.  I am happy to note that more than one-third of  the

total  GP clinics in Singapore and nearly half of the  dental

clinics have signed up for this scheme.  I think for many  of

the  GPs  and  the  dentists, they see this  not  as  just  a

commercial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>



service.  They see this as extending community service to the

elderly.  So we are very happy to welcome them on board.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, can I ask

the  Minister whether he would consider extending the  scheme

to allow disabled patients to be treated at GP clinics rather

than polyclinics?  Secondly, would he also consider extending

the  scheme  to allow patients who require long-term  regular

treatment  to be under this scheme?  And, thirdly,  would  he

consider allowing the low-income groups who have not achieved

the age of 65 years old to also benefit from this scheme,  so

that they would be able to save on their travelling cost?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have made quite a

quantum  leap  from  serving less than 10  constituencies  to

serving  all constituencies now.  So this is already  putting

quite  a  heavy burden on the administrative arrangements  in

the  CDCs,  getting the cards out to the  elderly.   We  will

consider   extending  to  other  areas  when  we  gain   more

experience with the present scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I must say that if we extend it, it means an

increasing  proportion of Singaporeans will come under  means

testing.  So we have to be quite sure of the pros and cons of

extending this scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A diet that is not excessive in energy, fat and salt,

and  provides adequate nutrients and dietary fibre  helps  to

reduce the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>



risk of heart disease, stroke and certain cancers.  Provision

of nutrition information on food products allows consumers to

compare the nutritional value of different products and  make

informed  decisions  when  they purchase  the  products.  The

Health  Promotion Board (HPB) is actively promoting nutrition

labelling and is working with food manufacturers to encourage

them to voluntarily label their products.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the implementation of the nutritional labelling

programme,  there has been an increasing number  of  products

carrying nutrition information.  HPB will continue to promote

and facilitate nutrition labelling by food manufacturers.

<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee:</b> Sir, can I ask the Minister, with regard

to  health supplement products sold as food, how rigorous  is

the Ministry's labelling requirements?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are many

products  in the market.  Some of them try to pass themselves

off with all kinds of claims on health benefits.  My Ministry

continues to monitor this and make sure that such claims  are

correctly   substantiated.   The   minimum   requirement   in

Singapore,  throughout  the whole continuum,  whether  it  is

food,  health supplements or drugs, is that the manufacturers

must  list the ingredients and show truthfully what goes into

the  product.  That is the minimum they have to  do.   Beyond

that, we will continue to take action to make sure that  they

are able to substantiate their claim.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My only other comment to Singaporeans is - take all

these claims with a pinch of salt!

<div align="center"><b>ENHANCED COMMUNITY SECURITY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Training of uniformed servicemen and population)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  what measures are being taken to better prepare  and

train  our  uniformed servicemen and population  on  enhanced

community security.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir,

let  me assure the House that our uniformed officers are well

trained  and  equipped  to handle a wide  range  of  security

threats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, in place since 1982, a National Emergency

System to ensure that Singapore survives any security threat.

We  conduct exercises regularly to ensure that the Home  Team

and  various  relevant  agencies are operationally  ready  to

respond  to  any  emergency,  including  those  arising  from

unconventional threats.  Last year, and again in  March  this

year,  Police,  SCDF  and the SAF came together  to  exercise

their   plans  to  deal  with  various  other  unconventional

threats,  including  chemical  agent  attack  by  terrorists.

These  exercises  not  only help to  validate  the  operating

principles and plans, but also provide valuable insights into

the  formulation of contingency plans and the development  of

capabilities to deal with various security threats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even before September 11th, Police had been training its

officers,  including Operationally Ready National Servicemen,

in  identifying  bombs and improvised explosive  devices,  as

well  as  guarding of key installations.  We  have  over  the

years built up a specialised Key Installation Protection  (or

KINS)  Force  comprising National Servicemen.  We  also  have

specialised units within SCDF which are trained to respond to

incidents  involving hazardous materials, and biological  and

chemical agents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the current security environment, the Home

Team  has  also  stepped  up training  for  all  its  regular

officers,  to  maintain  a  high  level  of  readiness.    In

addition, Police, together with ISD and the SAF, have briefed

and  trained security guards from private security firms  and

in-house  security  guards  of  selected  establishments   to

identify explosives, firearms and other weapons, as  well  as

how they should respond to any security incident.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has consciously been creating security

awareness amongst



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>



Singaporeans  since  the introduction of  the  Total  Defence

concept in 1984.  Singaporeans recognise that they too have a

role  to  play  in  ensuring Singapore's security.   One  way

residents   can   contribute   to   the   security   of   our

neighbourhoods  is by participating in the  Community  Safety

and Security Programme (CSSP).  Singaporeans also participate

in  Emergency exercises, such as the National Emergency Blood

Donation  Exercises  or  the  Civil  Defence  Public  Shelter

Exercises,  which  are  held  from  time  to  time.   Indeed,

Singaporeans  can help our security agencies by staying  calm

in  an  emergency and alerting the security agencies if  they

come across something suspicious in their neighbourhoods.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Home Team and various security agencies are ready to

deal  with  a  wide  range  of  security  threats.   We  will

constantly anticipate changes in the security environment and

prepare our uniformed officers to deal with these challenges.

We  will spare no effort in protecting Singapore's safety and

security.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, will the Minister

consider  extending  the practice of emergency  exercises  in

respect of terrorism to include more direct participation  by

members of the public and also by the IRCCs?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Members who have

constituencies which have experienced the Exercise  Community

Spirit  exercises will know that, for example, last  year  in

May,  we  conducted  an  exercise at  Holland  Village  on  a

simulated aircraft crash.  The point is these exercises  must

be  realistic.   So, in so far as terrorism  is  one  of  the

threats  that we face, certainly I think our agencies  should

consider  conducting some of these exercises.   But,  in  any

case, the point is that I would urge Singaporeans to actively

participate in all the exercises that we conduct,  including,

for  example,  public shelter exercises and also  the  public

warning  system  exercise.  I think this is  one  area  where

Singaporeans  can  do more, to know, for example,  the  three

signals  that  we have formulated together with  SCDF  -  the

message alert, the alarm and the all-clear signals.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Can I ask the Minister

whether he will consider the use of security cameras in areas

like  the  car  park or community parks, as well  as  at  the

Kranji Reservoir where security is a concern?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> The point is we must be open

to all devices that can help keep our neighbourbood safe.  In

fact,  the  Neighbourhood Watch Scheme has worked very  well.

About  96%  of our neighbourhoods and precincts  are  covered

already in Singapore.  So I take this opportunity to urge the

remaining 4% to come on board.  In fact, we have debated this

previously as to whether or not to use security cameras,  and

some  precincts  have done that.  Mr Sin Boon Ann's  precinct

has done that quite successfully together with his grassroots

leaders.   Prof. Chin also considered it and I think  one  of

his car parks in Woodlands has such cameras.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, where appropriate, especially if the crime is

localised,  and  security cameras will help deter  criminals,

that should be considered.

<div align="center"><b>EMPLOYMENT IN THE CIVIL SERVICE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Applications by former incarcerated individuals)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Dr Mohamad Maliki bin Osman</b> asked the Minister for

Home  Affairs (a) how many formerly incarcerated  individuals

have  applied  for  civil  service jobs  and  how  many  were

successful  in their applications; (b) what were the  factors

that limited their opportunities to gain employment with  the

civil   service;  and  (c)  whether  there   are   plans   to

"declassify"   some  formerly  incarcerated  individuals   to

enhance their employment potential by the civil service.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, previously, persons with criminal records

would only be employed in the Civil Service with the approval

of  the Permanent Secretary of the Public Service Division of

the  Prime  Minister's Office.  The Ministry of Home  Affairs

persuaded PSD to give, since



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>



August  2000, Ministries the discretion to selectively employ

them,  initially  for  two years on a  temporary  basis,  and

thereafter  permanently if they perform to expectations  like

everybody  else.   For such jobs where the specific  criminal

record  is not a veto factor, it however should neither  tilt

the balance in favour nor against the candidate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Home Affairs, through the Prisons

Department, has been working with various Government agencies

to  promote the employment of ex-prisoners through referrals.

As  recruitment  is  devolved to  individual  Ministries  and

statutory boards, I do not have information on the number  of

candidates  with criminal records who have been  employed  in

the   Public   Service.   But  I  believe  the  numbers   are

increasing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is considering amendments to the

Registration  of  Criminals Act so that  those  convicted  of

minor  offences  will  have their criminal  records  rendered

spent  or expunged after a certain period if they do not  re-offend.   This  will further help ex-offenders find  jobs  in

both  the public and private sectors, as the record would  no

longer   feature   in  the  assessment  of  an   individual's

suitability for the job.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Sir, the

Minister  does not have the figure for the other  Ministries,

but  what  about  the  figure for the Home  Affairs  Ministry

itself?   How  many ex-offenders have been  employed  by  the

Ministry of Home Affairs?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> The suggestion here is that

the  Ministry of Home Affairs must lead by example.  All  the

Ministries  must  play their part, but certainly  because  we

have  a stake in helping ex-offenders rehabilitate, both  the

Prisons  Department  and the Home Affairs  Ministry  take  an

interest in this.  For example, the Ministry of Home  Affairs

has  employed  60  ex-inmates as part of the  community-based

programme  in  one of the statutory boards, SCORE.   You  may

know  that SCORE also secures offers for jobs for ex-inmates.

But, here they have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>



directly   employed   these  60  ex-inmates.    The   Prisons

Department  has employed two ex-offenders, and  I  hear  that

they have done very well.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki bin Osman:</b> Sir, the Minister

mentioned the plan to reclassify some of the ex-offenders  if

they  do  not re-offend.  May I know when this plan  will  be

implemented  and what is the period of non-re-offending  that

will  be  considered  before the  person's  records  will  be

relooked at?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, in fact, this is

something we have been studying for some time.  Those of  you

in  the  House last year, in the Committee of Supply  debate,

will  know  that several MPs raised this point.  So  we  have

studied  the matter very seriously.  We have almost completed

the  study.  Within the next 1-2 months, we will come up with

certain plans.

<div align="center"><b>SENNETT ESTATE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Upgrading of precinct)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for National

Development when will the residents of Sennett Estate and the

other  blocks in the same precinct get the upgrading of their

precinct  since they make up more than 50% of the  votes  for

the  People's  Action  Party candidate at  the  last  General

Election.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all private residential estates, including

Sennett  Estate,  can apply for upgrading  under  the  Estate

Upgrading  Programme  (EUP).  A number  of  estates  will  be

selected each year, depending on the budget available.   Last

year, eight estates were selected.  The number for this  year

has  not  been  decided  yet.  Many factors  are  taken  into

consideration when selecting an estate for upgrading.   These

include  the  age and physical condition of the  estate,  the

level of community bonding and support for the programme  and

whether  there  is scope for improvement.  MND  would  invite

nominations from all Citizens' Consultative Committees (CCCs)

in June this year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, the upgrading of

Sennett  Estate and blocks of flats in the same precinct  was

promised  by the Prime Minister at the last election.   After

having  given a promise to the residents, do they still  need

to apply for upgrading?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that the

Prime   Minister  did  say  that  these  precincts  will   be

considered  for upgrading, and in the light of  the  comments

that Mr Chiam made after the election that his precincts  did

give more than 50% support to the programme through the votes

for the PAP candidate, I believe that this consideration will

be duly taken into account.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, clarification from the

Minister.  Is it not a promise and a matter of right for  the

residents there to get upgrading?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I do not think upgrading of any

sort is a matter of right.  We have made it very clear, first

of  all,  that  there are certain criteria that  need  to  be

fulfilled.   In  the case of the Estate Upgrading  Programme,

you  have  got  criteria like age, condition,  etc.   And  of

course, there is also the condition that the Government  must

be  able  to  afford to do upgrading.  In other  words,  that

there are budget surpluses available.  First of all, we  must

get  the  budget for it and then, secondly, we  have  got  to

invite nominations and all the estates which are eligible for

upgrading will then be considered together and the ones  that

are   most  deserving  will  be  selected.   There  are  many

criteria, as I have listed earlier.  Age is one, but not  the

most important one.  Similarly, the scope of works.  And  the

support  for  the  programme is also one, but  not  the  only

condition.   So eligibility of Sennett Estate for the  Estate

Upgrading Programme is certainly there.  But whether it  will

be  selected  or  not depends on whether other  precincts  or

estates are more deserving.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> If I get the Minister right, the

Ministry  of  National  Development does  not  take  note  of

anything



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>



stated  by  the Ministers during the elections, ie,  whatever

promises  they have made mean nothing to his Ministry.   What

he  is  saying is that, despite promises made at the election

these  promises  are  still subject  to  all  the  rules  and

regulations  of  the Ministry of National Development,  which

means  that  the  promises are just promises  and  they  mean

nothing at all.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think Mr Chiam

should  go back and check what the promise was.  The  promise

was that all these estates would be considered for upgrading.

There  is still the need to satisfy all the criteria which  I

have noted earlier.  Mr Chiam has always asked us how and why

we select precincts for upgrading.  I am now telling him that

precincts  are  selected  for  upgrading  based  on   certain

criteria.  In the case of Sennett Estate, it fulfills some of

the  criteria and certainly when it comes up, if and when  it

is  nominated  for upgrading, we will certainly consider  it.

But it must be done together with all other deserving estates

and  I am sure all the other Members of this House here would

appreciate that we would have to be fair in our selection.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister  for  National Development  seems  to  be  giving  a

different  criterion  now.   In  the  election,  we  had  the

impression  that political support is the sole consideration.

He  has mentioned in his main reply that there are many other

factors  like age, etc, but I would like to ask the  Minister

whether  he  can  tell  us  what is  the  weightage  of  this

individual  criterion  that  will  be  considered   for   the

selection  of a particular precinct and, in particular,  what

is the weightage of political support for the programme.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am talking about

support  for the programme.  I am not talking about political

support for the programme per se.  I am talking about support

of the programme in recognising the origins of the programme,

the  need  for budget surpluses, etc.  I think we  have  gone

through this many times in this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>



House with Mr Low Thia Khiang and many others, and I am  sure

I  do  not  need  to  go into those details  again.   But  in

specific  answer  to his question, what is the  weightage  of

each,  I  am afraid I cannot answer because we do not  go  by

specific  weightages.  There are a whole series of  criteria.

In  this  particular case, the age is very important  because

obviously  the older the estate, the more need there  is  for

upgrading.  But then, this is not the only criterion  because

if  you go by age alone, then obviously you are only going to

concentrate on one area of Singapore.  Besides that, it  does

not  mean  that,  if the estate is old, it is  in  very  poor

condition.  Sometimes, the estates which are older are not in

such  poor  condition.  So again, we  have  to  take  a  very

considered view of the age criterion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then of course, we have things like scope of works.

What  do you mean by "scope of works"?  It simply means  that

in  certain estates, certain things need to be done which  in

other  estates  do not need to be done, for example,  drains.

There  are some estates where the condition of the drains  is

very  poor.  So we have to look at that specifically  because

the Drainage Department of the Ministry of the Environment is

also  spending  money on drains.  So we have to  dovetail  it

with  the drainage programme.  Last but not least, of course,

there  is the question whether the residents actually support

such  programmes,  whether they have  a  sense  of  community

bonding, a sense of community spirit.  How do we gather that?

We  gather  that  by seeing whether there is a  neighbourhood

committee.  If there is a neighbourhood committee, it is much

easier   to  get  the  residents  together  to  support   the

programme,  to  tell us what is it that  they  need,  to  get

together  to work the programme through and to implement  it.

So all these things need to be done and to be considered.  It

is  not a paper exercise, as Mr Low seems to suggest, that we

just  go  through and tote up the points and, after that,  we

make a selection.  A lot of investigations need to be done, a

lot of ground work needs to be done, a lot of discussions and

interactions with other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>



Ministries  need to be done also.  So this is  not  a  simple

exercise, as Mr Low seems to think.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having gone through that exercise, we have to make

very  sure that the budget that we have for this is  properly

spent.   There is a limited budget.  The Ministry of  Finance

gives  us  a specific budget, say, $40 million for  the  next

five years.  We have found that the amount may not be enough.

So  we  have got to go and ask for more money.  Before we  go

and  ask for more money from the Ministry of Finance, we have

to  be  very sure about what the money is to be for, how  the

money  is  to be spent and to assure them that the  money  is

well spent.  So there is a lot of work that needs to be done.

And  I  would like to assure the House that when the advisors

put  in their applications, we will assess those applications

carefully  and  we  will make a decision  which  will  be  of

optimal benefit, not just to the residents, but also to  make

sure the money is well spent.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, may I clarify with the

Minister?   When a Minister makes an election  promise  at  a

general election, does he make that promise personally, or is

the promise binding on the Government?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> You have one minute, Mr Mah.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Can we continue after the next session

because  I am sure my answer will not satisfy Mr Chiam?   All

promises  that  are  made at election time  by  the  PAP  are

promises that will be honoured.  They are made seriously  and

all promises that are made will be honoured.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> If they are honoured, will it be

taken  as  more  weight  given to that promise,  rather  than

looking  through the criteria that he has just  mentioned  to

the House?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the promise is that we

will  consider  Sennett Estate for upgrading  under  the  EUP

programme if there is support for it.  If Mr Chiam  tells  me

that there is support for it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>



and I have no reason to disbelieve him, then that will be one

of the criteria that will be taken into account.

Government  for the financial year 1st April,  2002  to  31st

March, 2003."  -  [Minister for Finance].



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  am  most obliged and honoured to be given this opportunity

to  start  this Budget Debate with you in the Chair  for  the

first time as Speaker, and with the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr

Lee  Hsien  Loong in his maiden Budget Speech as the  Finance

Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after the announcement of the Budget, our GPC for

Finance,  Trade and Industry, held a meeting with  20  newly-appointed  members of the GPC Resource Panel.   The  Resource

Panel  Members  comprise professionals,  top  executives  and

entrepreneurs who come from varied industry background,  such

as   banks,  insurance  companies,  manufacturing  companies,

hotels, retail and others.  For the record, on behalf of  the

GPC,  I wish to express our sincere thanks to them for  their

valuable  comments and contributions.  My GPC members  and  I

shall be bringing up meaningful points raised by the Resource

Panel members during this Budget Debate and at the debates in

the Committee of Supply.

<br><br><i>Global changes to the tax system</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall I would like to describe this year's Budget as a

watershed, not so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>



much  because of the above factors that both you, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  and DPM Lee, are in your new appointments, but  because

of the profound long-term impact this Budget will have on the

Singapore  economy.  It is a forward-looking and  progressive

Budget in the sense that the announced policies are meant  to

prepare Singapore for the challenges of the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed tax and GST changes are bold and will

have  deep structural impact.  For this Budget, the corporate

tax  and  personal income tax rates will be reduced  to  22%,

with the GST increased by 2% to 5%.  The basic objectives  of

these   fundamental  changes  are  to  make  Singapore   more

competitive  and better able to attract foreign  investments,

attract foreign talent, and hold on to the well-qualified and

wealthy  residents and Singaporeans to remain  here,  arising

from the lower tax incidence for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I cannot help but feel that if merely changing

the  tax  structure will attract foreign investments,  retain

talent  and  solve all our problems, then the solution  seems

all  too  easy.   As DPM Lee has said, the Budget  is  not  a

magical  wand.   Merely by one wave of the  wand,  everything

will be solved magically.  I think that is too simplistic.

<br><br><i>Budget is part of an unfinished jigsaw puzzle</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that this year's Budget policies

and  changes  announced by DPM is but part of  an  unfinished

jigsaw  puzzle.  Annually, the Budget serves as the blueprint

of  the  Government  for not only the  year's  financial  and

fiscal policy, but a policy narration of the medium and  long

term economic plans of the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this Budget, a major piece of the puzzle is in

place, which is with regard to tax policy.   However, certain

major  Government  policies are not fully  described  in  the

Budget.   The  overall economic plan normally includes  other

key elements.  They should encompass the following:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Major industrial policies, such as promotion of local

industries, technopreneurship, innovation, target  industrial

sectors for promotion such as biotech, IT, education services

and tourism;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Manpower planning and labour policies, which impinge on

CPF rates, retirement age, foreign labour, foreign talent and

training; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Trade and international competition, such as economic

relations  with  our neighbouring countries, and  threat  and

opportunity of China and India.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reason for this sense of incompleteness of the

Budget  is primarily because the Government has launched  two

initiatives where the final reports are not out yet.  One  is

the  Economic  Review  Committee (ERC)  chaired  by  DPM  Lee

himself and the other is the Remaking of Singapore called the

ROS.   These two major long-term review studies have  various

sub-committees looking into several areas.  As  DPM  Lee  has

said,  these groups will review all matters, including sacred

cows and leave no stone unturned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of these two committees, the people are adopting

a  bit of a wait and see attitude.  I believe that once these

reviews  are  completed, the entire  jigsaw  puzzle  will  be

complete  and the total picture will emerge.  DPM  Lee  could

perhaps  enlighten  this  House  on  the  progress  of  these

committees,  and when do we expect to see the whole  picture.

What  are  the  final grand plans?  What  directions  are  we

taking?  Where are the threats and opportunities?  Where  are

the  further pains to be borne by the people?  Will there  be

final light at the end of the tunnel?

<br><br><i>Specific comments on the Budget announcement</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we wait for the big picture to emerge, Mr Speaker,

Sir, allow me to make some specific remarks on the Budget.

<br><br><i>Financial Year 2001 and Financial Year 2002 Budgets</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very pleased to note that for the FY 2001 Budget,

the Government has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>



achieved  a  surplus  of S$3.84 billion  versus  an  original

estimate of S$6.22 billion.  Although lower than expected, we

are pleased that a surplus is nevertheless achieved, in spite

of  the  year  2001  being a very bad recession  year.   This

enabled   the  Government  to  introduce  the  new   Economic

Restructuring  Shares  (ERS).   We  are  very  thankful   and

appreciative  of the very generous gesture of the  Government

to introduce this ERS soon after giving out the New Singapore

Shares (NSS) last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly for FY 2002, the Government is projecting a

small surplus of S$0.89 billion.  Again, we are very thankful

that  due  to  prudent and careful financial management,  the

Government  operating budget for FY 2002 remains  in  surplus

and not a deficit.



<br><br><i>Impact of tax changes</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general concern of the people is that the tax and

GST  changes  are  shifting  the tax  burden  from  the  rich

individuals and successful companies to the lower and  middle

income  people.   About 70% of the people, essentially  those

from  the lower and middle income bracket, do not pay  income

tax,  so they will not enjoy the income tax reduction but  at

the   same   time   will   pay  more  on   consumption   tax.

Fundamentally the tax changes are regressive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very pleased to note that the Government has

introduced offset measures to lighten the higher GST load  on

the  low  income group.  But the definition of this group  is

derived  from  the  use of 1-5 room HDB  flats  as  the  base

criterion.  However, two groups of Singaporeans will have  to

bear  the brunt of the GST increase without much relief  from

the offset package.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One group is the lower to middle income employees and

executives who do not live in HDB 1-5 room flats.  They enjoy

very little of the income tax reduction, but at the same time

have  to  pay  more  GST.  Another group is  the  pensioners,

especially  a certain pocket of retired junior and  mid-level

former civil servants, who live



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>



in old condominiums, old private apartments and small terrace

units.   They  also  do  not  enjoy  the  personal  tax  cut.

However, they will pay fully on the higher GST rates  without

enjoying  any of the offset package being offered since  they

do  not live in HDB flats.  Therefore, inherently there is  a

flaw  in this method of offering offset reliefs via HDB  flat

dwellers as the definition.  On the other hand, these  groups

of  Singaporeans  are too proud to seek redress  through  the

relief  scheme  administered by the constituency's  Citizens'

Consultative Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that the Government comb through

its  pensioners' list and offer on an automatic basis,  those

lower  income  pensioners who do not live  in  HDB  flats,  a

package  similar  to those given to the HDB  dwellers.   This

would be a very nice gesture on the part of the Government if

done.   It will demonstrate the Government's appreciation  of

this  bunch of old civil servants who have laboured  hard  to

help Singapore in the progress we have made today.

<br><br><i>Group offsetting of corporate tax</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very pleased that the Government has finally agreed

to this long-standing call by MPs, including myself, to allow

group offset of corporate tax.  The first step agreed upon is

to  allow  subsidiaries of 75% owned Singapore companies  for

corporate tax group offset.  I have some suggestions.  One is

to  include all Singapore companies above 51% because 51%  is

the  standard definition of a subsidiary to enjoy  group  tax

offset; and the second is to consider extending group  offset

to foreign subsidiaries of Singapore-based companies.  Sir, I

shall elaborate on these suggestions during the debate in the

Committee of Supply under the Ministry of Finance.

<br><br><i>One tier tax system on dividends</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the proposed one-tier system, there is no

allowance of a tax credit to the individual, who will then be

taxed  at  full rate for the dividends earned on shares  they

own.   This  one  tier tax system is unfair to  lower  income

earners and also to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>



pensioners  who depend on their share dividends  as  part  of

their  income.   These groups of people pay no  tax  or  much

lower  than the full rate of income tax.  Again, I intend  to

elaborate on this detail on my proposal during the COS stage.

<br><br><i>Educating the public on the purpose and impact of GST</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the GST is a hot topic, I thought it is imperative

of the Government to continue to educate the public about the

concept of GST.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a start, the Government has to continuously explain

to  the  people via public education programmes on why  lower

direct tax can help to attract foreign investors, and in  the

process  create jobs.  Many people are enquiring:   Will  the

shift of direct corporate tax burden from lower direct tax to

higher GST truly bring in new investments and therefore bring

in  employment?   What  if we cannot  achieve  these  desired

results?  Will there then be deeper direct corporate tax cuts

and  personal income tax cuts leading to the need to increase

on  GST?  I believe it is useful for this matter to be  fully

explained to the people.



<br><br><i>GST as a tax-on-tax</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another common misunderstanding of the GST is that the

5%  rate is a tax-on-tax.  The confusion is that some  people

think  that the GST is computed at the full 5% at each  stage

of  a  transaction.   So for a product that  requires  a  few

transactions  before reaching the final consumer,  the  total

GST charged could end up being 15% to 20% because of the tax-on-tax  effect.   Of  course, this is  the  wrong  perception

because GST is computed on a value-added basis.  However  the

public  is  not clear.  To make matters worse,  I  understand

that    certain   opposition   MPs   are   propagating   this

misunderstanding  and  instilling  unnecessary  fear  on  the

people.



<br><br><i>Small firms bear the GST</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other common misunderstanding is that the small

firms, since they are not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>



GST-registered, therefore cannot claim for GST paid from  the

Government.   For  small firms and retailers,  they  have  to

absorb  the  GST which is charged on them by the larger  GST-registered  suppliers.  In turn, they cannot claim  from  the

IRAS.   In  the  process they are disadvantaged.   Obviously,

this is another false understanding.  Sir, I believe there is

a  need  for more public education to clarify the  matter  on

GST.



<br><br><i>Combat Profiteering</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be unscrupulous retailers, shops, hawkers and

companies  which want to take advantage of the added  2%  GST

increase  to charge unfair higher prices.  I am pleased  that

the  Government has formed a Committee to Combat Profiteering

under the Minister of State, Mr Chan Soo Sen.  To improve the

effectiveness  of  this committee, I wish to  urge  the  mass

media  to  come  in to take part and help to publicise  those

culprits,  retailers, shopkeepers, group  companies  who  are

proven to be profiteering from this GST increase.

<br><br><i>Assistance to local companies</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that the tax reduction is to attract foreign

MNCs   to   invest  in  Singapore.   By  the  same  line   of

justification, it can be construed that the corporate tax cut

is  therefore beneficial primarily to MNCs, and not to  local

companies, especially for the SMEs.  The reason is that  SMEs

generally  pay low or no corporate tax as they  do  not  make

substantial profits.  Hence, the corporate tax cut  does  not

benefit them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, SMEs continue to face pressure on the

high  cost  of  doing business in Singapore.   Unfortunately,

this year's Budget did not address in much detail on how SMEs

can  be  helped to lower business costs.  In previous  years,

the  Government has helped the SMEs by lowering property  tax

rate,  lower  rental charges by HDB and JTC  and  other  such

measures.   This  year, there is scarce mention  of  how  the

Government intends to promote local companies and how to help

them to combat rising business



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>



costs.   A  good  example is the recent  increase  in  petrol

prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a call on the Government to address these

issues,  perhaps under the Economic Review Committee.   There

is  also  a call on the Government to continue to extend  the

previous rebates and rental reductions, such as property  tax

rebates  and  other fee reductions for local companies.   The

reason  is that many of them are still facing severe business

downturn, with no signs of recovery yet in sight for them.

<br><br><i>We need to lift the doom and gloom mood</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to report that there is

a  prevailing  mood  of gloom and doom amongst  some  people,

especially   amongst  the  older  segment  of   the   working

population.  Maybe I could cite this example to illustrate my

point.   Recently, I was informed by a colleague of mine  who

said  that he was very struck by the very low spirits of  his

elder brother and his group of friends.  In the past, he  and

his  friends were a cheerful and spirited lot.  They  are  in

their  late 40s and early 50s.  They have enjoyed the heydays

of  Singapore's boom in the 80s and 90s.  They bought  houses

and cars, went on family holidays overseas, and generally had

a  good  run.  But in recent years, since the Asian financial

crisis  in 1997, and the recession last year, many saw  their

fortunes turned for the worse.  They saw their friends losing

their  jobs  and encountering great difficulties  to  be  re-employed.   Prospective employers thought they were  too  old

and  outdated  to  employ them.  Those  with  jobs  clung  on

precariously,  toiling long hours just to  keep  their  jobs.

Those in business saw business failures, or severe cutback in

their business volume.  Many are just hanging on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last two years, we saw the September 11 incident,

read  about the terrorist threat in Singapore and around  the

world;  watched  with  concern the  political  and  religious

turmoils   yet  to  be  fully  unfolded  in  Indonesia;   the

escalation  of  the quarrel between Singapore  and  Malaysia;

repeatedly told of the great



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>



threat  of China but not yet told of how Singaporeans  should

work  together to deal with this threat and turn it  into  an

opportunity.  They were worried about the rising costs,  such

as  how  the  increase in GST could add  to  their  household

costs.  The  talk  about CPF cuts has  raised  some  concern.

People  are worried about how the CPF cuts will affect  their

ability  to  service  their housing mortgages.   Just  today,

there  is  a report in the front page of Business Times  that

states  that  "Defaults on HDB mortgage loans on  the  rise".

There were 19,400 households in arrears as at end March  this

year against 14,400 a year ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the bright side, there are reports of signs of

economic recovery in Singapore.  The Government has upped the

forecast  of  the GDP growth rate.  In the US, which  is  our

largest trading and export partner, the Federal Reserve Board

Chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, has said that signs of  recovery

are evident.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In typical "Greenspan" speak, he recently said on 17th

April  2002 at a Joint Economic Committee hearing  that  "the

foundation for economic expansion has been laid."  I think we

have  to  figure out ourselves what he meant  by  that.   But

there are also other economists and politicians who have said

that  it is still too early to tell. Such conflicting reports

add  to  the confusion and uncertainty.  We are living  in  a

fast changing world with shifting sands, hazy future and  few

guide posts to help us find our way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier in my speech, Mr Speaker, Sir, I

cannot help but feel that the Budget is only revealing a part

of  the  big  picture on how the Government intends  to  take

Singapore  into  the  future.  I would urge  the  leaders  to

conclude the reviews of the ERC and the Remaking of Singapore

expeditiously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not try to fly too many trial balloons. Do not pick

every  stone to turn it up, and then merely put it back  down

again.  Do not mindlessly slaughter all our sacred cows, many

have served us well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in times of uncertainty, the people

want  strong and able leadership. The Government has  in  the

past



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>



proven itself to be capable of tackling crises.  Work out the

short,  medium and long term plans quickly, explain  them  to

the people and then just get on with it.  We believe that  if

we  work  side by side together, Singapore could  once  again

pull  through this crisis.  All we need is the Government  to

point the way.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, today I would like

to  address a number of issues which are related to the state

of  the economy and will basically set the stage for a number

of  recommendations which I hope to make during the next  two

weeks of the Committee of Supply discussions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me start by saying what I have said many times too

that  Singapore's economic development model  has  done  very

well  in  the  first 30 years of development.  Our  model  of

bringing   in   foreign  direct  investments,   multinational

companies  and even of developing Government-linked companies

was necessary to bring Singapore to where it is today and  it

is a model that many countries try to emulate.  In developing

strategies   in  the  past,  we  did  however  develop   some

structural  problems  which I would  like  to  address  today

before I talk about the Budget proper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fundamental problem of how our economy is

structured  can  be  traced  to the  role  of  Government  in

influencing the economy. We are seeing our worst recession in

our  history  since  independence, and  in  my  opinion,  the

approach  we  took in developing our economy got outdated  as

the  new  economy  arrived.  Specifically, I  would  like  to

highlight a few areas where the Government had played a  role

in  causing  some  of the problems, because of  its  dominant

presence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the asset enhancement policy. The asset

enhancement policy has been a key policy since the 1990s  and

the  key  goal  was  to  create wealth for  all  Singaporeans

through  owning properties that will increase in  value  over

time.   Little  did  we realise that this wealth  was  mostly

going



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>



to  be  unrealised or perhaps paper wealth.  Through a number

of  Government  initiatives and policies, we  drove  property

prices to untenable levels, much like how the Japanese  asset

bubble  grew in the 1980s.  As has been told by history  many

times  before,  the  bubbles  are  never  long-lasting.   The

Government's  attempt  to  implement  the  asset  enhancement

policy  basically backfired, resulting in a vicious cycle  of

artificial high costs of properties, high wages and the  high

cost of doing business in Singapore.  The three policy levers

which  the  Government  used that have created  this  vicious

circle   are:   firstly,  the  use  of  CPF  investments   in

properties,  resulting  in  Singaporeans  over-investing   in

assets,  especially in properties; secondly, the  land  sales

policy and the approach of reserve pricing which artificially

propped up the price of land, whether for private, commercial

or  industrial land; and thirdly, the prices of new HDB flats

which increased at unbelievable rates throughout the 1990s.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the above levers were completely in the hands and

control  of  the Government.  Why do I say that this  is  the

cause  of  our  economic problems and  hence  our  employment

problems?   The  answer  lies in the  vicious  cycle  that  I

mentioned earlier.  The high cost of owning properties  drove

the  need  for  higher wages which added to  business  costs.

Similarly,  as  commercial and industrial land  and  property

prices went up, this eroded the margins for businesses.  This

therefore  accelerated the changes in the type of  industries

which  could  operate  in Singapore  and  also  led  to  many

companies  having  to exit from Singapore,  many  prematurely

because of the high rate of increase of cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue which is structural in nature is one of

Government-linked companies and is another significant factor

and  the creation of these companies, which are called  State

Owned  Enterprises  in many countries, is another  deliberate

Government policy.  Being impatient about the development  of

certain  industries, the Government felt that they needed  to

step  in  and  create companies, using the reason  of  market

failure.  On the other hand, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>



Government,   through   its  protective   policies,   created

monopolies which lasted for too long.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the issues that GLCs have created? I will

briefly  mention  some  of  them as  they  have  been  widely

debated.  The three main issues are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the stifling of entrepreneurship by using their

resources in the GLCs, especially easy access to funds, to do

the  same  of what can be done by smaller players,  that  is,

before they are publicly listed;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the crowding out of local companies, sometimes

through unfair practices; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) dominating and predatory practices which result in

foreign  companies  being compelled to  work  with  the  GLCs

instead of local companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third structural issue is one of the Government

influencing  the  outcome  of the  economy.   The  Government

created   many   economic  agencies  which  have   tremendous

influence on the outcome of our economy.  If you talk to  any

private sector company, whether big or small, they will  most

likely  agree that these agencies have had an impact on  what

they  do and how they do their business.  The Government  has

been dominant in the following three areas:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) picking industries;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) picking winners in each industry; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) deciding on how funding and incentives should be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;channelled.

All these influences are outcomes of our industries here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we have regulators also playing the role of

industry  developers, we run into problems.  Today, you  will

see  many private sector companies here which feel that  they

have  to  get the endorsement and the support of our economic

agencies in order to get moving in their businesses.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we still have the opportunities to be competitive

in  certain  types  of industries if we  focus  on  enhancing

capabilities  and  productivity,  and  through  the  use   of

technologies,   when   Government  agencies   start   picking

industries, they will never be able to do a good  job  simply

because  they  do  not  have  a  feel  of  business  nor  the

experience  of business acumen to understand what  determines

the  success of a particular industry.  For this  reason,  we

have  not  been able to successfully create global  champions

like  Starbucks and McDonalds.  These industries would  never

have  been  on  the  radar screen of our  economic  agencies.

Instead of planning the industries to the details and instead

of   driving   industry  development  to  the  details,   the

Government  should  focus  on the  broad  strategies  and  be

involved  in  only  creating  and facilitating  the  business

environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are there no new world-class companies from

Singapore?   I still remember the Government's bold  plan  of

identifying 500 world-class companies in a certain number  of

years.  We have missed the target by miles and if you ask me,

I would have guessed that we would have missed simply because

the  Government was not capable of picking industry  winners.

The  various  Government  agencies have  relied  on  old  and

irrelevant  measures  in  picking the  potential  winners  to

groom.   Schemes  like the Promising Local  Enterprise  (PLE)

which  have  been  in place for so many  years  have  had  no

success  in finding real global winners except for a  handful

of  companies which were excellent in their own  sense.   The

yardsticks   measuring  promising  companies   have   to   be

completely different from what we are used to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third structural issue is basically rules and

regulations designed for multinational companies and GLCs and

not  for SMEs.  One of the clear issues we have today,  which

is  a cause for concern, is a structural problem and that  is

the lack of local private enterprises and local entrepreneurs

who  are  able to develop world-class capabilities.  How  did

this  come  about?  We started rightfully with the industrial

economy driven by multinationals and then one dominated by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>



Government-linked  companies.  Our  administrators  basically

focused  on a regulatory system which was conducive for  both

types of companies to operate in Singapore and they were big.

There  was nothing wrong with this in the beginning,  but  we

never got out of this mode, despite the many signals that  we

got  many  years  ago when we started seeing sleeping  giants

like  India and China opening up.  What we should  have  done

was  to  start shooting the laws to accommodate and encourage

and  grow  local enterprises, particularly SMEs.   We  should

have  learnt  from countries like USA where  legislation  has

been put in place for many years with SMEs at the core.   The

focus  for legislators and government administrators  in  the

USA  has been to create local private enterprises many  years

ago.   It  will  logically  follow then  that  if  rules  and

regulations  work for SMEs, there should be no  problems  for

the  same  rules to work for larger companies.  The likes  of

competition    laws,   Government   procurement   procedures,

financing schemes and many others are examples of legislation

with  SMEs  in mind. Time is of essence for us in  Singapore.

We must make the necessary changes to our rules to facilitate

the development of our private enterprises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there were very high expectations for this year's

Budget  because it was supposed to be a Budget for a new  and

different world.  I personally feel that there were  no  real

new initiatives to tackle the issues of the new world, except

for  the tax changes.  I was hoping that this could have been

called  a  bold  new Budget, with creative  initiatives,  but

frankly  I feel that there has been nothing significant  this

year.   To  be fair, I believe that the Government  is  still

waiting  for  the  recommendations  of  the  Economic  Review

Committee  to  be  finalised before making the  bold  changes

which   Singapore  badly  needs.   I  hope  that  after   the

recommendations  are ready, the Minister will  not  wait  for

next  year's Budget to make more changes.  I feel that  there

is  a  real  need  for  us  to  implement  measures  quickly,

particularly  in  the area of the cost of doing  business  in

Singapore and by waiting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>



too  long,  it may result in the premature collapse  of  many

companies   and  the  premature  departure  of  many   multi-nationals.  I would like to touch on a few areas which I feel

should have been addressed, but have not been done so in  the

Budget   and,   I   hope,   in  anticipation   of   the   ERC

recommendations,  these issues will be  considered  seriously

soon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first of all, the tax system. While I am in

complete  agreement  to  go towards a consumption  based  tax

system, I believe that we have been too quick to increase the

GST  from  3% to 5%.  By all means, this should be the  long-term  target,  but by doing it so early, we  once  again  put

tremendous  cost pressures on our companies even before  they

could  recover from the worst recession our nation has  seen.

The  real  short-term  improvement  that  the  Government  is

suggesting  is a mere 0.5% reduction in taxes since,  in  the

preceding  years,  we  were  already  enjoying  tax  rebates,

bringing  the effective tax rate down to 221 /  2%.   So,  by

going down to 22% with a consequential increase of 2% in GST,

this  is  a  significant increase in cash out-flow  for  many

companies.   The feedback that I have got from  a  number  of

people is that while a 20% maximum income tax level is  good,

we have not been radical enough.  We are still worse off than

Hong  Kong,  and  if  we include the many  other  taxes  that

Singaporeans  and Singapore-based companies are paying,  then

we  are still not very competitive.  While we may look better

than many countries like the USA and Germany, as the Minister

has  mentioned,  we must compare this against the  percentage

reduction  these  countries have  made  as  compared  to  the

reductions we have made.  The facts are as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the USA, as the Minister has mentioned, the effective

tax  rate,  after  many  provisions,  is  actually  11%.   In

Germany,  the  new tax rate is 25% compared to  the  previous

40%.  This is a reduction of 37 1/2% for the 15%-point drop.

Whereas in Singapore, we plan to reduce from 25% to 20%,  and

this is only a 20% reduction.  In Ireland, the tax rate is at

12 1/2%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countries that I have mentioned are the ones that we

should compare against,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>



as we are trying to do the same things as all of them.  It is

obvious  that compared to where they have gone,  our  changes

are not radical enough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue with this Budget is that we have not

addressed the single most important issue, and this is on the

cost  of doing business.  I mentioned about our vicious  cost

cycle  and  the consequent impact on the cost of  businesses.

This   year's  Budget  clearly  did  not  address  this  very

important issue.  On the contrary, we ended up adding to  the

cost  problems  with the implementation of the additional  2%

GST.  We may argue that companies will be able to offset this

with lower income taxes.  The problem is that this additional

2%  adds  up to the cost upfront and affects cash  flows  and

puts  additional strains on businesses, while the tax  is  an

after-the-fact phenomenon.  Many companies in the short  term

may  not even benefit from the lower taxes, because they will

not be making money in the first place.  I therefore urge the

Minister to delay the implementation of the additional 2% GST

until  the  business environment improves.   Why  the  hurry,

especially   since  the  Government  has  the  firepower   to

withstand lower tax collections for a short period?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless we find a solution for our structural cost

problems, we will have difficulties competing in any type  of

industries that we choose to compete in, including  those  in

the high value added activities.  Everything being equal,  we

will  still  lose out because of the cost when  it  comes  to

competing  with any of the countries, whether it  is  Taiwan,

China,  Malaysia, Ireland or many others.  So we  should  not

brush  aside the cost issues by saying that those  industries

dependent  on cost should be eliminated from Singapore  while

we  bring  in new industries.  The cost issue will linger  on

with us forever.  It is a structural problem and needs urgent

resolution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are our cost problems? And everyone knows this.

First, the high wages driven by high asset values.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, terribly high land cost leading to high rentals,

thus eroding margins for businesses.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the regime of hidden taxes which also erode

margins.   Let  us  for a moment try to add  all  the  taxes,

levies and charges which may seem small on their own in  some

cases,  but all add up significantly.  Let me list  the  ones

that  I  can think of.  We have property taxes, petrol taxes,

utilities  taxes, foreign worker levies, COEs,  ERP  charges,

business licences, Skills Development Fund contribution,  and

these  are all that I could think of when I was writing  this

speech.  I am sure there are many more that I do not have the

time  to think of.  These all add up and do have a high  cost

impact for businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A couple of years ago, a prominent businessman from the

Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry showed  me

a  computation  comparing  similar businesses  in  Singapore,

Malaysia, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and his analysis showed  that

because of all these hidden taxes, companies in Singapore are

inherently  delivering weaker profits and much lower  margins

compared  to Malaysian and Hong Kong companies doing business

in the same area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, Government charges like aviation and port

charges, Government fees, licence fees and the likes are also

significant.  Adding to the cost problems are also  our  high

telecommunications charges compared to many  other  countries

in the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third issue that was missing in this Budget was help

for the small and medium enterprises (SMEs).  This is another

regular topic for many of us from the private sector.   There

were  high  expectations of the Budget from local  companies,

and  they  were disappointed that help did not come promptly.

Many are struggling and have faced two consecutive recessions

and  many  have  yet  to  come back  to  profitability.   The

additional cost burden, especially the increase in GST, could

deal  a  final blow to some of these companies.  I  mentioned

about  the  need to restructure our economy and to create  an

environment  which  nurtures small  and  medium  enterprises.

SMEs are not always looking for handouts, as has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>



popularly  been talked about.  And I also do  not  support  a

subsidy   mentality,  because  I  believe  that  it   weakens

companies  and  not  strengthens them.   All  SMEs  want  are

avenues which facilitate and not hinder their businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue is that our SMEs face obstacles in many areas,

including  when  they deal with Government  agencies.   Those

which  are  bigger know how to get around the obstacles,  but

the smaller ones, particularly the start-ups, have tremendous

problems.   They  do  not  have the  resources  and  time  to

manoeuvre around the obstacles that they face.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other important problem they face is the access to

funds.   Once  again, SMEs are not asking for free  and  easy

money.   They  just need the right channels and  institutions

where  they are able to get the support.  For the banks,  the

effort put in for too many small companies are just not worth

their while and they prefer to deal with bigger clients,  and

a number of bankers have mentioned this very clearly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue for Singapore is also the fact that we are at

a  very  infant  stage  of our venture capital  (VC)  market,

created by transplanting some big names from around the world

into  Singapore.   The problem with this transplant  is  that

these VCs operate in a very narrow range of investment cycle.

With  VCs on the one end and debt financing through banks  on

the  other end of the spectrum, we have one big vacuum  which

should  consist  of  a  whole slew of  financing  instruments

consisting  of  angel  investors, early stage  VCs,  hybrids,

derivatives,  junk bonds, collateral and IP-based  financing,

brand  name  financing and many others.   If  the  Government

wants  to  help  out  by  not getting  directly  involved  in

businesses, then it should focus on developing the  financial

instruments that I have mentioned above.  It will go  a  long

way  in  helping our SMEs.  This approach differs from giving

handouts and subsidies which we all want to avoid.   We  will

see two possible outcomes if nothing new is done



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>



for  SMEs.  First, they will collapse and, second, they  will

relocate,  and  many of them are talking about relocating  to

the  nearest location they can think of and manage, and  that

is  to  Malaysia.  And I know that many of them are seriously

thinking of this right now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the final issue about the Budget, and about most of

the  Budgets  that  we  have had in the  past,  is  that  the

approach  that  we have taken to address the  cost  pressures

during  the  recession has been by temporarily bringing  down

rentals,  charges, levies and taxes through rebates,  and  we

have become a nation of rebates, subsidies and grants.  While

this is good for the short term, it does nothing for the long

term.   On  the  contrary,  it sends  the  wrong  signals  to

investors and companies that costs will go back again to  the

high  levels  once  there is a sign  of  improvement  in  the

economy.  It may have worked in the past in keeping companies

invested in Singapore, but I think, by now, most of them have

wised  up  to the reality that costs will come back  and  hit

them  over  and over again.  So, instead of using rebates  to

address our cost problems, it is more prudent and more useful

to institute real cost reductions, whether in rentals, taxes,

levies  or charges.  It will allow companies to have a  long-term  view  of  things and plan to be in  Singapore  for  the

longer term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also have an issue with the approach that we have

taken  each  time when we run into an economic crisis.   Each

time,  we have put in place rebates for companies as well  as

individuals.   The signal that this gives to our  society  is

that  we  are  so tightly geared and fundamentally  stretched

that  each time something changes, we have to resort to  such

measures to create some relief.  This indicates that  we  are

living  to  the brink and have very little room for  changes.

With  such tight margins, life can be very stressful and  one

can  understand why the Government has to come to the  rescue

with  rebates  and subsidies.  We really need to  permanently

reset  the  whole  cost  structure so that  Singaporeans  and

companies  here will have much more margins,  and  each  time

they face a crisis,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>



we  will  then  not have to resort to rebates and  subsidies.

And we should spend the next few years building up the margin

for  Singaporeans so that their lives do not have  to  be  so

stretched and stressful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I started by saying that the Budget

has  not  been  bold  enough, contrary to  expectations  that

something  significant should have been done in  this  year's

Budget.   We know that we have to wait for the final  outcome

of  the  ERC  recommendations.  I thought I should  take  the

opportunity to give a sense of what I feel are bold  measures

and  of  what it should really mean when the Government  says

that  there will be no "sacred cows" and that "no stones will

be  left  unturned."  Here is my wish list of radical  things

which we should do:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, a 30% reduction in rentals, whether it is JTC or

HDB  properties, and allowing property prices to decline  and

to   find  their  right  levels,  without  propping  them  up

artificially.  And if need be, the Government should step  in

to  mop  up  any residual problems, even if it means  dipping

into the reserves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, bringing the income tax level down to 121/2%

that Ireland has.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, to spin off most of the GLCs, except for

strategic  ones like SIA, PSA and perhaps SingTel.   And  the

Government should cut its ownership to less than 30% in  each

of these GLCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, to help the SMEs with their problems before we

could develop a mature financing industry, to create a fourth

local bank to service the SMEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, halve the petrol tax, halve the ERP charges,

halve the foreign worker levies and halve the property tax.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixth, eliminate the need for yearly Government issued

licences  and  depend on income tax and GST  to  collect  all

revenues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventh, reduce the size of the Government and the civil

service by 30% over a 5-year period.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are radical things, just to give you a feel

of  what  people are thinking of. The list can go on,  but  I

thought  that I would give a feel of what being  bold  really

means, from the perspective of the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I feel that it is too early to rejoice. When

the Minister revised the growth forecast from the previous 1-3%  to  the current 2-4%, I thought he was a little too quick

off  the  mark.  Things are still very unclear, including  in

the  USA.   There are pockets of recovery, but  just  a  few.

Good  times  will  come back, as we know, but  let  us  tread

carefully  for now and not let our guards down  too  quickly.

By  thinking that the economic recovery is going to come very

soon, I feel that the Government may get complacent in trying

to  help  address  some  of  the  issues  that  I  have  just

mentioned.  Sir, uncertainty still rules the day.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must commend Mr

Inderjit  Singh on his very interesting speech.  In fact,  it

was a good lecture, as far as I am concerned.  He has touched

on  cost issues and he has also given his wish list.   But  I

think  it  is very difficult because whatever spare money  in

the  market,  the Government will mop them up.  Basically,  I

think  the  Government's intention is always to have  a  very

strong surplus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall touch again on this topic of Government

surplus.  In the past, in the debates on Budget statements, I

have  highlighted the obsession of the Government in  wanting

to  budget  for a surplus for that year.  This year,  despite

the  recent economic recession that Singapore has  just  gone

through,  the  Government is still bent on budgetting  for  a

surplus,  albeit  a modest sum at $0.9 billion,  compared  to

other  years of $4-5 billion.  However, with the 2%  increase

in GST and revenues from motorcars and other sources, I would

not  be  surprised at all if the Government ends  up  with  a

budget surplus close to $3 billion.  I have asked many  times

in  this House why is there a need to have such a substantial

budget surplus every year.  If I am not mistaken, it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>



is  reputed that Singapore has about US$140 billion  surplus.

Why is there a need to accumulate such a mind-boggling sum of

money?   That colossal amount of money, I believe, is  mostly

invested abroad.  Singapore does not really benefit much from

such  a  large sum of money in terms of improvement  for  its

people.   Our  quality  of  life  has  not  improved  by  our

surpluses when compared to those in the developed West.   Our

indigenous industries have not in any way benefited from  our

surpluses.   Other than Creative Technology,  which  we  have

heard  so  much,  we  cannot speak  much  of  our  home-grown

industries.  The surpluses are like huge monuments set up  to

give  repute  and  manifest the power of the PAP  Government.

The   surpluses   that  are  tucked  away  do   not   benefit

Singaporeans very much in their daily lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surpluses remind me of the pyramids of ancient

Egypt.   The  old  Pharaohs exuded power  and  might  in  the

pyramids  they  built.  At first, the people  of  Egypt  were

happy  and joyful to labour under the hot sun, to cut  stones

and  drag  them  to build the pyramids for their  kings.   In

later  years,  when much of the stone supply in  neighbouring

quarries  were  exhausted, the Pharaohs  had  to  source  for

stones  further  and further away.  By then,  the  people  of

Egypt  were quite exhausted.  They could not see the  purpose

of  building those huge monuments to perpetuate the  rule  of

the  Pharaohs.  The Pharaohs had to use force  to  get  their

people  to  work  hard, to go further and further  afield  to

bring the stones back to construct the pyramids.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sincerely hope that the huge amounts of surpluses the

Government  has accumulated are not just for the  purpose  of

perpetuating the PAP rule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that, at the present time, the economic

difficulties   of   our   people  are   not   resolved   yet.

Unemployment  stands at about 5%, and the world  economy  has

not   really   picked  up.   Times  are   still   tough   for

Singaporeans.  Yet, the Government goes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>



ahead to force the people to pay an additional 2% GST on what

they  consume.  Government coffers shall probably swell by  a

couple  of  billion  dollars.  If this  is  not  pushing  our

workers  to work harder and contribute to the income  of  the

Government,  I  do  not know what is.  The  workers  and  the

poorer Singaporeans shall probably suffer a double blow.   On

the one hand, the GST is raised to 5% and, on the other hand,

retailers  and  hawkers shall seize the  opportunity  of  the

increase  in  GST  to  raise  their  prices.   When  GST  was

introduced in 1994, prices were increased by about 20%.  This

time  round,  since  the  GST is  pegged  at  5%,  the  price

increases  shall  most likely be more than  20%.   This  will

cause  hardship  to households with old people,  infants  and

other dependants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the people's part, they must be urged not to give in

to hawkers and shopkeepers who practise blatant profiteering.

Until now, without the Fair Trading Act or other statutes  to

control unfair trading, the Government and CASE cannot really

do  much.  I am wondering how the proposed committee to check

on prices can be useful when it has no enforcement powers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB flat dwellers are concerned at the impending

increase in the monthly parking fees.  At the moment,  it  is

pegged  at $55 a month for one parking lot.  At $55, the  HDB

is  already getting more than the land cost.  It is therefore

unfair and unnecessary to increase the cost of parking at HDB

housing  estates.  If the monthly parking fees are increased,

then  it  is a case of the Government giving rebates  to  HDB

flat  dwellers on the one hand and taking them back with  the

other.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the increase in GST, I hope the Government

shall commit to holding down the GST at 5% and give a promise

not to increase it for at least five years beginning from 1st

January next year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen (Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office and Ministry of Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office and Ministry of Community Development and Sports (Mr Chan Soo Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what we have heard from the Deputy

Prime Minister and Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>



for  Finance, I believe, is a pro-growth, pro-job  and,  very

importantly,  a  caring Budget.  We heard Mr  Inderjit  Singh

wanting  to  do  very radical things.  I think  some  of  the

proposals  may make very good economic sense.   But  when  we

consider people's feelings as well as the kind of people  who

may be most affected by such radical changes, the outcome can

be disastrous.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, in Singapore, are faced with a very big dilemma. We

must compete with the potential competitors around the region

and  win.  Because if we do not, we get skinned!  And we were

told  that there were many ways of skinning us.  But, on  the

other  hand,  if we have a Budget which is perfectly  correct

economically, but without due care for the people who may  be

very  badly  affected, then I think we will face an  internal

collapse.   We  lose  cohesion; we lose unity.   We  will  be

finished with all our bones broken.  We either lose  all  our

skin  or lose all our bones.  Hence, we need a balanced, pro-growth, pro-job and, at the same time, caring Budget.  It may

not  appear  radical at first, but with clear  direction  and

consistent implementation, it will all add up over time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we are facing a situation very similar to what we

were  going through in the late 60s and the early 70s.   Just

like  that  time,  we  have to generate growth,  we  have  to

generate  jobs, we have to preserve the value of our savings,

and  we  have  to ensure that we do not have hyper  inflation

that  eats  away confidence and strength.  And that  explains

why  we  cannot have deficit financing, certainly  not  on  a

large  scale - cutting 30% here, 40% there.  Such sudden  and

panic action will scare away foreign investors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that on the unity part, I read the 4th May

Lianhe Zaobao and I found something very exceptional.  I  see

Mr Chiam See Tong, in a sense, giving some support to what we

are  trying to do, saying that whatever that is given out  in

this Budget as relief is more than enough to balance off  the

increased tax liability on the people who are poor.  He  even

said



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>



that  while there can be concern about profiteering, he would

be  very  happy to join the Committee to Combat Profiteering.

Well,  may  I  say that I sincerely invite him  to  join  the

Committee and work with us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are here to achieve unity. We are here to involve

everybody  to  support the new measures and the  new  Budget,

necessary  for  our  economic  restructuring.   In  combating

profiteering, we are going to invite the local  community  to

judge  whether  a  certain undue price  increase  amounts  to

profiteering.  If it is, we will try to talk to  the  traders

for  precisely the same reason that Mr Chiam and Mr  Inderjit

brought  up,  that the traders were also subjected  to  price

pressures,  some  of  which might be  beyond  their  control.

Maybe  the sole distributor may have jacked up prices because

of  certain  international pricing  policies  set  elsewhere.

What  is important for us is to ensure that people feel  that

we  have  a  Budget that is really fair to everybody.   Well,

maybe  not entirely fair to everybody, as not everybody would

agree that the Budget is totally fair to him.  But seen as  a

package,  I  think  we  have benefited here  and  there,  and

everybody feels that it is something worth supporting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say to Mr Chiam that he might want to let me

know   later   whether  he  wants  to  accept  this   sincere

invitation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think many hon. Members will be talking about the

economic and financial aspects of Budget.  I would just  want

to  emphasise on the heartware aspect.  We are  going  to  go

through  a  very,  very important phase in order  to  face  a

changed world.  We want to be able to face this changed world

as a people, as a people who feel that we have got a stake in

this nation.  Therefore, we have to ensure that our Budget or

our   economic   policy   is  well   balanced   with   people

understanding it, with people feeling that they play  a  part

in  it, and with people supporting it.  In the 1970s, we were

able  to  achieve unity of the people and we steered  through

the  then  difficult economic situation.   Not  only  did  we

create an economic miracle, we also built a nation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>



We  are now at the crossroads again.  We want to ensure  that

all  of us, cosmopolitans and heartlanders, feel that we  are

together on this ship, each playing a role in sailing through

this  difficult  stretch of water.  If we sail  through  this

difficult  stretch  of water, then we  would  emerge  with  a

stronger Singapore to face the 21st century.

<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</b> Sir, many people, when

asked  what  they thought about the recent Budget  2002,  had

described it as a "balanced" Budget.  I would like to use the

word "surgical" to describe the Budget.  Let me explain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister for Finance has said, we are in a very

different world.  As a result of all that has happened around

us  in  the  recent year or two, Singapore, like  many  other

countries, faces many challenges that affect the economic and

social  conditions.   The  Budget  addresses  many  of  these

challenges and concerns in a pragmatic approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to highlight four areas that I feel the pro-business Budget underscores the surgical aspect that I am

referring to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the reduction in corporate taxes. Business

performance is key to our nation's survival.  I am happy that

the  corporate tax is being reduced from 24.5% to 22% for the

Year  of Assessment 2003, and a plan to further reduce it  to

20% by financial year 2004.  This is good news.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For companies with deferred tax liabilities, a reduction

in  corporate tax rates will result in an immediate reduction

in  their  deferred tax liabilities.  Companies  with  a  big

capital  expenditure programme on their balance  sheets  will

then have an improved net asset position and tax write-backs.

Some  of  our  bigger companies that fall into this  category

will  have a direct benefit as a consequence of the reduction

in corporate taxes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What many may not know is that the cut in the corporate

tax by a 2 percentage



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>



point also means that the estimated market earnings per share

(EPS)  of  a company may rise by about 2%.  A combination  of

these two factors, ie, improved net asset position and a rise

in  EPS,  makes these companies very attractive to investors.

This  gives investors a very clear signal that the Government

is serious in promoting companies in this position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the business community's and hon. Members'

request  for  group relief for losses has  been  answered  in

Budget 2002.  It is indeed a welcome news and all too timely.

By  allowing qualifying companies within a group to  transfer

their  current  year's  unutilised  capital  allowances   and

losses,  it  helps  businesses reduce  some  risks  in  doing

business.   It echoes the Government's call to businesses  to

be more entrepreneurial and to explore new ventures.  By this

one  stroke, it also reduces the high effective tax rates  in

their consolidated accounts and cash flow problems due to tax

settlements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, on the GST increase. The GST increase will

impact  some businesses that are not registered for  GST  who

incur  the  increase  of  2%  on  their  purchases  from  GST

registered suppliers, and residential property developers and

financial  services industry that may not fully recover  some

input  tax.   With  the specific tax changes  for  businesses

coupled with the corporate tax decrease, it may mitigate some

of  these effects.  For some SMEs, for example, if they  have

private  cars  that they use for their marketing  force,  the

charges for the repairs on these cars may not be claimable by

the company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For individuals, the offset package that will accompany

the  GST  increase is not only comprehensive but is flexible.

As  the  Minister  has said that, should the  need  arise,  a

review to extend the package beyond the five-year time  frame

is  possible,  this  package will benefit  the  lower  income

directly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth highlight is in the area of transport and

logistics.   We  are  faced  with extreme  competition.   The

extension of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>



Approved International Shipping Enterprise Scheme to  enhance

the  attractiveness for international shipping  companies  is

crucial  at this time.  We need to tackle the possible  slide

in contribution to our GDP from this area with some urgency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if necessary, I hope that the Minister for Finance

can  support  an  allocation  of a  supplementary  budget  to

reinforce our position in the transport and logistics sector,

as it is not only the threat of a reduced contribution to GDP

from this sector but recent events have shown that a loss  to

another  competitive  party  has  impinged  somewhat  on  our

national morale.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, yes, I am kiasu. In this matter, we

cannot  lose.  Not yet.  Not when our other engines  that  we

are  building in R&D, biotech, life sciences, and so on, have

not taken off yet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong mentioned that the Government's

intention  is  always to have a strong  surplus.   Without  a

strong  surplus, we would not have been able to dish out  the

package  that we did last year to help our citizens.   Kuwait

has  oil.  Brunei has oil.  They can extract their oil,  send

it  overseas and invest, and when need to, they could call on

those  resources.  We do not have oil.  We do not have water.

And I do not think it is possible to squeeze water or oil out

of this sand that we are using to reclaim land around us.  It

is  just like what Mr Lim Swee Say mentioned earlier on, this

is  the  character of the PAP Government.  Mr  Lim  mentioned

that   we  have  reserves  of  about  100  times  our   daily

consumption of water in our reservoirs.  Money is like water.

In  that sense, it can never be enough.  But we are using  it

and directing it to help our citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when Mr Mah had one minute left to

answer  some  of  the points that Mr Chiam brought  up  about

promises  that we have to keep, may I remind him  that,  ever

since  the  elections, almost every other day, we  have  been

keeping our promises.  The ERC has been meeting almost  every

other  day  involving citizens and non-citizens to  keep  our

economy and engine going.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, permit me to continue by using some aeronautical

parlance.   In  the early 80s, as a result of  our  pragmatic

approach  to  economic planning, we enjoyed economic  growth,

employment  was  not  a  problem,  foreign  investments  were

pouring in, so the economy accelerated and we went aerobatic.

Then in the mid-80s, Singapore faced a difficult period.  The

economy  went  acrobatic.  During that period,  many  of  our

businesses  had to take the flips, the twists, the  yaws  and

the  pitch as the economy spun.  Well, we went from aerobatic

to  acrobatic,  and it certainly was not very  aromatic  when

parts  of  the economy sputtered and many splattered  towards

earth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, now, we are in a very different world,

where economies are so intertwined that even with the control

of  the  joysticks  in our hands, the deliberate  actions  on

those  joysticks  may not produce an exact  response  to  the

input.  As our Leader of the House, Mr Wong Kan Seng, put  it

in  his speech on a sitting on 31st August 1985, and I  quote

him,  "economics is not an exact science".  In the  world  of

today,  the aircraft must be built with a fuselage  that  can

take  the  spins,  the twists, the yaws, the  pitch  and  the

forces  in  the environment through which it has to navigate.

The PAP Government had been building this fuselage, inspected

it as it went through some stress testing as late as the 1998

Asian  financial crisis and as recent as the global  economic

slowdown  that  began last year.  This  Budget  will,  in  my

opinion, contribute to strengthening that fuselage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need our people and our businesses to understand that

we need to adapt to new forces that are already upon us as we

go  about in our lives today.  We have built and strengthened

the  fuselage,  but  it  is only as  good  as  the  crew  and

passengers  to  take the physical stresses the  fuselage  can

withstand.  In this changed world, our economy, our  country,

has  to  be  able to navigate the crowded airspace  with  new

engines  for  this  fuselage.  We have to  jettison  the  old

engines and snap on new ones that will take us through.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget encourages the production and the ultimate

promotion  of those engines.  As I have mentioned earlier,  I

liken  these new engines to the areas of biotechnology,  life

sciences,  the  businesses of R&D and intellectual  property.

The budget also secures the fuel to drive these engines.   It

provides the technology to operate and, more importantly, the

ability to tune these engines while we are in mid-flight.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is much like the Formula One car, where the

suspension  set  up  can  be  adjusted  from  the   technical

directors'  computer via radio signals from the pit  lane  as

the  car  races around the circuit.  They do this to  account

for  the  changes  in  the  race  conditions  brought  on  by

variables, such as fuel load changes as the car gets  lighter

further along a race and changes in the track temperature  as

a  result  of  the weather, and we know how controllable  the

weather is!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has to adapt as we race along. The changes to

the economic, social and security aspects demand that we have

to adapt on the fly, except that our race is for survival and

to provide a better way of life for the four million of us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Budget has been surgical in that

it  fixes the areas that need to be mended, reinforces  areas

that need to be stronger, and it reconstructs areas that need

to be more flexible.  And I hope that during the Committee of

Supply,  we  will  be  touching more  on  SMEs  and  cost  of

business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In concert, Sir, this Budget is what I will call an ERS,

not  the  Economic Restructuring Shares, but this  Budget  is

expedient, it resuscitates or revitalises areas that needs it

and,  if  I  may borrow the expression, it is "right  on  the

money" in its specificity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank

you for allowing me to join in this debate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Budget Statement was made on 3rd May, there

has  been  much discussion in society.  And as expected,  the

most  discussed  areas were the GST increase and  its  offset

package,  and the cuts to corporate and personal income  tax.

Some individuals say that they will not benefit from the  tax

cuts  because  they were already not paying any  income  tax.

Some  business people lament that the corporate tax cuts will

not help them if their business is bad and there is no profit

to be taxed, and therefore no tax to be saved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the GST increase, we hear fears about it triggering

inflation  and profiteering, driving up the cost  of  living.

And  turning to the offset package, some pointed out that  it

might  not  be enough to offset the tax in their  case.   One

person  at a dialogue asked, "Even if it is enough to  offset

for  five years, what happens after five years?"  And another

pointed  out  that since the offset package cost  almost  the

same  as the expected increased GST collection, why not  save

the effort and do the tax cuts?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singaporeans are indeed paying great attention to

how  these  measures  are affecting them individually  or  as

businesses.   This is understandable and to be expected.   It

is  in fact a good sign that Singaporeans are concerned about

the impact of policies and have done the calculations and are

voicing  their reactions and concerns.  The challenge  before

us  now  is  how, having listened to those reactions,  do  we

connect  those  views with our process here  in  this  Budget

debate,   to  yield  the  best  outcome  for  Singapore   and

Singaporeans?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the budget session is an annual exercise,

it is by no means a routine or a mere ritual.  When we decide

on  the  budget, we do not just vote money for the Government

Ministries and Departments to continue operating as they are.

When  we ask questions on the budget, we do not ask them just

to  make a display or to give a semblance of scrutiny, or  to

create work and stress for those who have to answer.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the budget is the means to carry out the intent of

this  House.   It  is the ship that sails us to  our  desired

destination  in the future.  And if we build a ship  that  is

structurally weak, or that lands us in a different place from

that which we want to head, then we will be in trouble.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of ships, I am reminded of the story of the

Titanic - not the love story that came to our cinema screens,

but  the real disaster that killed more than 1,500 people  on

the  high  seas.   The Titanic  was touted as an  "unsinkable

ship"   in   its   design.   It  had  15  airtight   buoyancy

compartments that were supposed to be impervious to piercing.

Furthermore, its designers calculated that even  if  four  of

the  15 compartments did puncture, it would still have enough

buoyancy  to  stay  afloat.  Added to that was  sophisticated

communications  equipment of the time, and additional  safety

provisions such as some lifeboats.  Hence, the maiden  trans-Atlantic voyage of the Titanic was supposed to be nothing but

pure  fun  and  enjoyment for all those on board.   For  what

could go wrong?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Titanic, as we all know, sank after hitting an

iceberg.  Was it an unfortunate accident that could not  have

been avoided?  Records showed that the ship received at least

six  warnings of icebergs before the hit.  The warnings  were

not taken seriously.  Maybe people were more caught up in the

revelry and game of one-upmanship to see who could get better

seats at the ship's theatre.  Maybe the captain and crew  did

not  act on the signs because they were complacent about what

they thought were the "unsinkable" design of their ship,  and

saw no need to prepare the passengers for what was happening.

Maybe  they  dismissed too readily what seemed to  be  little

pieces of floating ice until the hit revealed the rest of the

icy mountain that lurked beneath the surface.  Whatever their

thoughts  were, when the accident happened, there  was  utter

chaos  and  confusion,  as the population  on  board  plunged

totally unprepared into the sea.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the aftermath of the disaster, fingers were pointed

in many places and at many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>



faces.  Why did the captain and crew not take the ice warning

signals seriously?  Then there was another ship nearby  which

could  have helped but did not.  Why?  There were not  enough

lifeboats  relative to the number of passengers.  Why?   Some

men  were  rushing to get onto the lifeboats, denying  places

for  women  and  children.  Why?  Whatever the  reasons,  one

thing  is  for  sure.  No answer, however  comprehensive  and

wise,  could  bring back one lost life.  It  simply  was  too

late.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the often-told story of the Titanic is one of

tragedy,  drama  and heroism at the point of  disaster.   The

seldom  mentioned  story,  and  that  which,  to  me,  is  of

immeasurably greater value, is the prevention and preparation

that  could have gone into avoiding the disaster.  But  alas,

prevention  and  preparation are never as glamorous  as  high

drama, and so are often overlooked.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has the Titanic story to do with our Budget debate?

Everything, in my view.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the President addressed this House in March

this year, he reminded us that "the world has changed".   And

it  was  in the context of that changed setting that he  laid

out the future direction of the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister in his Budget Statement said, "We

are   entering  a  very  different  world.   Conditions   are

uncertain  and  volatile, competition is intense,  change  is

faster  than  ever.  Our ability to adapt nimbly and  quickly

will give us a valuable edge.  In our personal lives too,  we

must expect change and disruption."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are the iceberg warnings to us. They define

the  setting  around which this Budget must  be  built.   The

central  purpose  of  this Budget is  therefore  not  a  mere

routine  or  ritual.  It is our opportunity to  redesign  our

ship,  Singapore,  so that it can sail the  stormy  seas  and

bring  us to our destination safely.  We must be careful  not

to become Titanic II.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How then should we structure our policies to maximise

our hopes?  Sir, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>



would  like to suggest three areas for consideration.  First,

to   increase   awareness   of  the   fundamentally   changed

circumstances  among the population.  For without  widespread

understanding  and  acceptance  of  the  new  situation,  old

patterns of behaviour will continue to be entrenched.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my concern is that despite the many jobs that have

been lost, and the many pronouncements of change and need for

fundamental  adjustments, I think the message is  still  just

scratching the surface of our collective awareness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we ask ourselves what proportion of our population

have become keenly aware of these wrenching changes that  are

altering  the way work and employment are structured  in  our

economy, what would be our estimate?  If we ask of those  who

are   aware,   what  proportion  among  them  is   responding

proactively, what would be our estimate?  If we do  not  know

the   answers  to  these  questions,  or  if  we  think   the

proportions  are  still low, then we  must  consider  how  to

redouble  our  efforts in this area.  The Government  on  its

part  must  consider  how  best to  coordinate  the  flow  of

information from the labour market to the student and working

populations  on  a  sustained basis.  Improved  knowledge  of

supply  and  demand  conditions, and the ways  that  work  is

structured  are key to helping both students and workers  set

and adjust to realistic expectations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get the message out on a strong, sustained basis

cannot just be the work of the Government.  It is not only  a

question  of information and resources to mount communication

campaigns.  It is also about the strength and credibility  of

networks   and  how  these  can  be  tapped   to   speed   up

dissemination, acceptance and response.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me to my second point, which is the need to

rally  the  public, private and people sectors to  work  more

closely   together   to   achieve   national   progress   and

development.  We must



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>



recognize that it is only through such a partnership approach

that  the  different  strengths of  the  three  sectors  will

reinforce each other.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private sector is the engine of economic growth and

wealth   creation.    It  must  identify  opportunities   for

investment    and   break   barriers   through    innovation,

resourcefulness  and  sheer  grit  to  make  a   success   of

enterprise.  How far have our businesses come to  terms  with

the changed landscape?  What are their strategies to overcome

the challenges posed by a saw-tooth economic growth path?  Do

they  expect to win by out-competing their rivals to  capture

market  share  and revenue growth?  Or do they just  hope  to

survive  through more cost savings and rebates?  And  indeed,

how  are  employers  fulfilling  their  role  as  responsible

corporate  citizens to help prepare workers for  the  changed

environment?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a time when circumstances were much more stable,

it  may  be  viable  or  desirable for the  State  to  decide

industrial policy and for businesses to simply toe the  line.

In   the   complexity  of  today's  environment,  much   more

visioning, strategizing and path finding must come  from  the

businesses  themselves.   Enabling businesses  to  strengthen

themselves  in  these areas is key to our future.   For  this

reason,  enterprise  development must continue  to  be  given

heavy weightage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public sector has great clout in Singapore. Through

its  policies and commitment of resources, it signals to  the

rest of the society the direction that the country will head.

For  example, when 45 % of the Government Budget is  proposed

to be allocated to Social Development, with Education, Health

and  Community  Development  and Sports  getting  substantial

increases, it signals the Government's emphasis on human  and

social capital.  Similarly, when the Government says that  it

"will  not  stint  in  its  support for  workers  to  upgrade

themselves",  we know that the employability  of  workers  is

topmost on the mind of the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the role of Government is more than just using its

annual Budget allocations to signal its priorities.  It  also

has the critical



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>



role  of setting up and managing a conducive environment  and

infrastructure, so that the overall goals of society could be

achieved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to highlight two specific points. If

tax revenues and Budget surpluses are most likely going to be

reduced  and become more volatile, then how should Government

agencies plan their services?  Clearly, they cannot go on the

basis  of  "straight  line  projections  from  the  past,  or

business  as usual".  On the other hand, it may not  be  wise

for  Government  services to match the volatility  of  cycles

like  the  private sector business would  try  to  do.   Some

services,  such as those in social development, may  arguably

have   funding  needs  that  are  counter-cyclical.    Hence,

Ministries   and   departments,  just  like  businesses   and

individuals,  must  examine  the  implications  of  the   new

economic   landscape  and  adjust  their  work   accordingly.

Clearly,  in  such an environment, more must be  done  to  be

frugal  in expenditure and to maximise savings from  improved

productivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government must also continue to invest in long-term

infrastructure   and   capability  building   to   strengthen

Singapore's place as an investment location and hub.  How are

Ministries   and  statutory  agencies  being   measured   for

investments  and outcomes in these areas?  My concern  simply

is  that  "what  gets measured gets done."   In  the  private

sector, unbridled pursuit of shareholder value and return  on

investment,  asset and cost of capital have  accentuated  the

already  short-term  orientation.  Chief Executives  may  not

always   be  interested  in  the  long-term  good  of   their

companies, because they do not expect to be there in the long

term  to  inherit  either the rewards or  the  mess.   In  an

environment  of  reduced surpluses and more uncertainty  over

tax  revenues, there may, at times, be similar temptation for

the  public  sector to let up on longer-term  commitments  in

favour of projects that yield more immediate returns,  or  to

inadvertently drive up costs of services and assets in  order

to  show  a  return.  So we must ensure that our  performance

indicators for the public sector continue to let a long  term

view to be taken.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people sector is an equal partner in this tripartite

relationship.  It is not a "remainder sector" that  picks  up

the  pieces  that neither the public nor the  private  sector

wishes  to deal with.  By its vision, focus and capabilities,

it  encourages  and amplifies the efforts of  Government  and

enterprise  toward social cohesion.  Encouraging philanthropy

is  a  good  example of an action that links the three  parts

together  for the benefit of the less fortunate  in  society.

Strengthening the relationship between the Government, labour

and employers is another example.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The potential of the people sector is immense. In an

increasingly uncertain and stress-filled world, many  of  the

services provided by the people sector, such as social  work,

counselling  and mediation will become critical.   An  ageing

population  will  also  create new demands  that  the  people

sector   will  be  well  placed  to  meet.   These   enhanced

capabilities and capacities will require additional attention

and resource support to develop.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move now to my final point, which is to increase

the  development  and  support of  individual  self-help  and

initiative.   This I see as a key success factor  in  a  more

turbulent  operating environment.  Central direction  is  too

slow and inadequate in many instances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All said and done, the individual is the one who

ultimately faces the consequences.  As someone once remarked,

"The  unemployment  rate may be 5%,  but  to  any  unemployed

worker, the unemployment rate is 100%."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individuals who insist on not responding to the changed

reality  have  made themselves unemployable.  But  those  who

understand the situation and want to keep themselves relevant

and  employable should be helped.  Here, I return to my  call

for  the  Government to move on supplementing  employer-based

training with more support for individual-initiated training.

Conditions  can  be set and safeguards made  to  ensure  that

training  is  not frivolous or wasteful.  Countries  such  as

Sweden and even England are ahead of us in this.  Let us move

quickly on this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the challenges before us are big and serious. Our

only  hope lies in strengthening our unity, organisation  and

capabilities.   This  Budget  is  strong  on  prevention  and

preparation, to give Singaporeans hope for a better future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget.

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

thank you for allowing me to join in this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the quintessence of Finance Minister Lee Hsien

Loong's Budget Statement is encapsulated in the title for his

speech  "A Budget For A Different World".  Indeed, while  the

physical  landscape of the world remains largely intact,  the

economic landscape has seen fundamental shifts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In ancient times, human beings were hunters and

gatherers.   The economy was totally mobile - existing  where

the   hunters   and  gatherers  existed.   The   agricultural

revolution created predictability in food supply.  Homes were

built,  production  and  economies  were  centralised.    The

industrial  revolution again changed the  basis  of  economic

production.   Division of labour and mass production  led  to

economic  specialisation.  Where is the hunter and  gatherer?

Meanwhile,  in this whole process, our hunters and  gatherers

have  become  merchants and tradespeople - their geographical

spread diminished in favour of clustered industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, however, the IT revolution is again changing the

rules   of  the  game.   Time  and  distance  do  not   limit

businesses.  Even space tourism is now a reality.  People are

once  again extremely mobile, like our `hunter and  gatherer'

forefathers.   The new age hunters and gatherers  find  their

food  in  a borderless world, armed with advanced information

systems   and   network  that  can  help  them   find   their

opportunities  and  make  their kill.   The  world  is  their

oyster.   The rule of the game is the fittest and the fastest

survive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I take this opportunity to applaud the Finance

Minister's courage in keeping



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>



in  sight  the demands of the global arena in the formulation

of this year's Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this breed of new hunters and gatherers,

we  must  ready our people, our economy, to stay relevant  to

the  world.  May I offer three areas which the Budget, or the

rest of the ERC jigsaw puzzle teams can address:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we must attract the new breed of hunters and

gatherers  to our land.  Second, we must cultivate  our  own,

our local hunters and gatherers and, third, we must take care

of all who is in our land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me touch on the first point. To attract the new

breed  of hunters and gatherers to our land, we must  realise

that  when these IT-age hunters and gatherers move, they move

with  huge  resources and global network that we can  benefit

from.   They can enhance our global hub status and bring  the

latest technology to create jobs, jobs and more jobs for  our

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget has addressed these challenges by firming a

fundamental  shift in the national tax regime, from  narrowly

focused  direct tax structure to a broad-based  indirect  tax

structure.   The controversial GST hike from 3%  to  5%,  the

welcome cuts in corporate tax from 24% to 20% and the reduced

personal  income tax from 26% to 20% in 3 years are necessary

steps to position Singapore as a viable business location for

both  local and global players.  The Not Ordinarily  Resident

(NOR)  taxpayer  scheme  attracts  talents,  while  the   tax

incentives  for  the  global fund managers  attract  capital.

With all these, combined with our FTA efforts that fasten our

links  to  the  world, Singapore is in a better  position  to

attract talents that will reside here and create new business

enterprises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I feel we need to further identify the type of

hunters  and  gatherers  we  want  to  attract.   The  Budget

signalled   a   shift   in  emphasis  to   develop   high-end

manufacturing  alongside high value added services,  such  as

finance,  logistics,  healthcare and  education.   Given  the

limited  land and high labour cost, we must indeed  focus  on

branding ourselves



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>



and  develop  industries at the top  of  the  economic  value

chain.   While  diversification  is  sound,  we  must   avoid

diluting our potentials to become mediocre players.  Just  as

the  Singapore  brand is synonymous with  "quality",  we  may

consider further positioning ourselves to be synonymous  with

our  niche industries.  This will position us as the de facto

headquarters for our desired hunters.  These niche industries

should  then  be developed as our new engines of growth  that

lead  economic activities further down the value chain.   For

example,  when we think of consumer electronics, Japan  comes

to  mind.  When we think of IT, Silicon Valley appears.  When

we  think  of  textile,  it is India and  when  we  think  of

fashion,  it is Paris.  So my question is:  when we think  of

Singapore, what comes to mind?  Perhaps it is SIA or Creative

Technology.   Whatever the case may be, we need  a  face  and

personality to attract these global hunters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, cultivate hunters and gatherers from our land.

In  times  of severe crisis, I believe that chances  are  the

home-grown  industries  will have  a  stronger  economic  and

social  heartstring  to Singapore.  Therefore,  we  must  not

relent  on  our  efforts  to  cultivate  our  own  companies,

alongside world class MNCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do so, we need to adopt a holistic approach. Very

often,  it  has  been said that we are very clinical  in  our

approach  and  we segmentise things, and when these  segments

are put together, they do not form anything that is viable in

the  long-term.   Hence, I would call on  the  Government  to

consider  putting  these segments together and  examine  them

closely  and  adopt a holistic approach.  Perhaps,  a  broad-based  "dare  to fail" or "never say die" culture  should  be

inculcated  all  round,  rather than in  limited  pockets  of

activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest that via the budget allocated to MITA,

Ministry  of  Manpower,  Ministry of Education,  Ministry  of

Trade and Industry and Ministry of Community Development  and

Sports, we invest heavily in our human capital. We can create

more community-in-partnership



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>



programmes beyond the football fields into the fields of arts

and  culture,  entrepreneurship, sports and adventure.   This

broad-based  approach  will help lay the  foundation  for  an

entrepreneurial  culture  and  provide  the   critical   mass

necessary to encourage any snowball effect desired.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also applaud the 7.8% increase in MOE's budget and

hope  that  the  investment in our children's varied  talents

will   translate  into  future  leaders  who  are  not   just

academically sound, but also able to think out of the box and

move  fast in the global hunting arena.  For those  who  have

left  school,  the  Finance Minister can  consider  a  higher

personal tax relief for education to encourage working adults

to  upgrade themselves.  The current relief level  of  $2,500

has  not  kept pace with the cost of education which,  for  a

part-time degree programme can cost between $15,000-$20,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there is no gain without pain, an encouraging

breeding  ground  for our own hunters should have  favourable

risk-reward ratios.  This is especially so in Singapore where

many are educated and taught to look at cost-benefit analysis

before venturing beyond their comfort zones.  Currently,  the

risks associated with entrepreneurship is perceived to be  at

a  premium vis-a-vis a return on investment.  For example,  a

young entrepreneur who requires a small basic office with two

clerical  staff  would probably need a  start-up  capital  of

about $75,000 to last a year, ie, not counting his own salary

or living needs.  For the many self-employed road warriors in

sales-related  work, a shift in car cost  from  ownership  to

usage has also become an additional cost that eats into their

return on investment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cost of doing business, this risk-return

relationship, must be addressed, not just for the new  start-ups,  but also for the existing SMEs.  In fact, for  the  new

start-ups,  due  to  the limited finance  schemes  available,

young  start-ups often have to beg and borrow from the 3Fs  - father, friends and some say in jest, the `fools'.   Each  of

them  then becomes a minor shareholder who may decide to  get

interested and exercise their rights when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>



the  business  grows, thereby distracting  the  entrepreneurs

from  the  main thrusts of his business.  When  the  business

fails, the entrepreneur is greatly discouraged and he becomes

the  laughing  stock of the community that he  lives  in  and

borrowed from.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is made worse with the local bank mergers. Even

banking  and  finance costs have increased for  the  new  and

smaller enterprises, as banks prefer to deal with the 'bigger

fish'.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these, to sum up, are entry barriers. Perhaps, the

Finance Minister can look into the above areas of concern and

consider  measures to create a conducive breeding ground  for

local hunters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point of SMEs, many SMEs that I spoke with were

unexcited  about the Budget.  Some lamented  about  the  high

cost  of  doing business in Singapore and some  were  worried

about the hollowing out of some industries to countries  with

lower  cost.  Many are unhappy about the crowding-out  effect

of  GLCs.   All  these were not directly  addressed  in  this

Budget.  May I suggest that resources be allocated to build a

database  of  business opportunities, procedures and  network

programmes,   so   that  there  is  more   transparency   and

accessibility  to information?  Perhaps GLCs  and  successful

enterprises  may also act as mentors for the new  or  smaller

kids on the block.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the Budget made provisions for start-up stock

options, specific incentives for SMEs would make our economic

stimulation  initiatives even more powerful.  In  particular,

easier  access  to capital for SMEs and other entrepreneurial

financing  instruments  could  be  developed.   Perhaps,  the

Government  could consider setting up SME banks that  operate

on  slightly different objectives from that of the three  big

banks, with the focus on helping and investing in SMEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In both the inward and outward economic expansion

strategies of Singapore, the EDB has been instrumental,  over

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>



years,  in  bringing the top names to Singapore.  The  newly-formed International Enterprise Singapore (IES) will need  to

expand  their every effort to globalise our enterprises.   To

this  end, we need to unlock the potentials of SMEs and  grow

them  into corporate giants of tomorrow.  We should  identify

as  many SMEs as are deserving, so as to form a critical mass

with  real  impact.    Thus, the Budget should  increase  the

resources  for  these Boards in lean times, rather  than  cut

them.  A penny saved on this may cost us many dollars in lost

business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, take care of all in our land. If the Pareto's

principle  of 80/20 is true, then whilst the Budget addresses

the  needs of the top 20%, which are our desired hunters  and

gatherers, who may create jobs and wealth for the  nation  at

large;  the  Budget must make provision for  the  less  well-endowed and the less able.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, Budget 2002 has sagaciously granted double

tax  deductions to charitable and welfare organisations  with

IPC  status.  This means that for every one dollar given, the

Government contributes 44 cents.  In addition, donations from

estates,  are now exempt from estate duty.  This is certainly

a step in the right direction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher personal income tax relief for NSmen, their

wives  and  parents,  new  tax  reliefs  for  families   with

handicapped  parents and continued child-bearing rebates  for

divorcees,  are  also  much  welcomed  measures.   All  these

demonstrate the budget planner's determination in promoting a

cohesive society based on the virtue of care and share.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, perhaps more funds can be allocated to help the

lower-income and senior citizens who have toiled to bring  us

the  fruits  of their labour.  Many of them are the  founding

fathers of Singapore, and many of them have low education and

little funds to live on. Even with retraining, many would not

be  able  to  keep up with the pace of change and the  rising

cost  of  living.  Hence, I hope that the heartening increase

in  the  social  development budget to 44.5% would  translate

into greater benefits for the less-able and senior



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>



citizens,  to help them take care of their basic  needs  like

food, medical, transport, among other needs.  Most of all, it

must  help  them to integrate into the mainstream.   To  this

end,  perhaps  I could suggest that the GROs  be  given  more

operating grants so that volunteers can focus on serving  and

integrating residents and the community, rather than limiting

their ideas and imaginations to the funds they can raise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RC centres, for example, given the necessary manpower,

can  be opened every night and utilised as residents' kampong

corners.   These  centres can certainly act  as  social  glue

stations  for all, regardless of race, language or  religion.

In  the  face of rising ethnic and religious intolerance,  as

witnessed in the Middle East and, more recently, the rise  of

Mr  Jean-Marie Le Pen in France and the shooting  of  Mr  Pim

Fortuyn  in Holland, I urge the Government to reconsider  its

funding operatives for GROs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, after the two economic crises in 1998 and

2001, the GST hike and the sweeteners, what remains unchanged

is  an  economy that needs to constantly redefine itself,  in

order to stay relevant to the world.  This is the only way to

ensure  that its people can continue to enjoy growth and  the

comforts   of   secure   jobs.    Commensurate   with   this,

Singaporeans  must be willing to take on the  challenges  and

accept rapid changes in their working lives.  This means  not

just a political will but a collective will of the 3Ps, as Mr

Heng  Chee  How has mentioned -  the people, the private  and

the  public sectors.  The Government's role will then  be  to

persuade  and  enable  the people, enhance  and  empower  the

private  sector,  and  style itself as a  shrewd  steward  of

Singapore's economic growth in the global arena.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I support the motion.

<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Hawazi Daipi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, earlier, Mr

Chiam  told  us  a  long  tale on  the  construction  of  the

pyramids,  but  I  think  he missed  the  point.   While  the

Pharaohs  were  interested  in  building  edifices,  we   are

building  a  cohesive  and  strong  nation  in  which   every

Singaporean  has  a stake, and I think the  Budget  addresses

this point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not a businessman, but I acknowledge the need

to see their major concerns.  I see the strong and clear need

for  us  to  focus on the future of our people in a  balanced

way.  Sir, I think this Budget is fair and a balanced one. Of

course, employers would expect more concessions.  But by  the

same  token, employees expect more give-aways.  So, too,  are

retirees  and  others who are now not in the workforce.   But

the  business  of  government in raising revenue  is  not  to

punish  its people, but in order that we have more  resources

to do more things for the common good of society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of greater concern to me is whether the Government will

do  more  in the area of skills training.  All too often,  we

hear  of people who find it difficult to get alternative jobs

after  they  are retrenched.  When I was in the NTUC,  I  was

deeply involved in the business of job matching.  Believe me,

it  is  an unenviable task!  Yet, it has to be done, and  the

NTUC is now expanding much resources to improve job matching.

There is even a centre in Trade



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>



Union House, now located at Bras Basah Road, dedicated to job

matching.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that if the Government releases more money

for  training, more can be done to run even more courses, not

only to equip retrenched workers for new jobs, but to upgrade

the  skills  of those still at work, so that they can  better

preserve  their  jobs.   The figures given  by  the  Manpower

Minister  earlier indicate that retrenched workers  above  40

years  old face more difficulties in securing jobs.   To  me,

the  most important task is to change the mindsets of workers

as  well  as employers.  We need to also address the concerns

of retrenched workers who turn down job offers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of training should be offered? Experience

tells me that workers are better prepared psychologically  if

they  are given training when they know it will benefit them.

In  other words, if a worker is told that at the end  of  the

course he will have a job, he will be even more motivated.  I

am  therefore calling on the Government to spare  no  efforts

and  resources in having a closer link between  job  training

and  job placement.  We should even consider farming out such

training-for-job   placement  schemes   to   private   sector

companies which can do the job more efficiently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the media has a big role to play in helping

to  encourage  workers to switch from one  kind  of  work  to

another.  Yes, there have been some examples  -  in the print

media, on radio and over television. But more can be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various constituencies have their own newsletters. They

are  an  excellent avenue to let residents  know  of  success

cases.  These are people in their own neighbourhood who  have

benefited from breaking with the past.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with another area of training. This is

the  preparation  of  young  Singaporeans  yet  to  join  the

workforce.  In particular, I would like to talk about



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>



those  who take the ITE path.  I would like to put particular

stress  on  this because, as we are tackling the  problem  of

employability  of older workers, we do not want  to  see  the

younger generation face the same problems because they do not

have a good education foundation.  Parents whose children may

not  be academically inclined should consider seriously about

sending  them  to  ITE.  Here, I would like  to  commend  the

Government for continuing to give substantial allocations for

education,  from  which our ITE campuses  and  students  have

benefited.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some parents and Singaporeans in general appear to think

that  ITE  is  an  inferior institution, and  that  if  their

children end up in ITE, then their job prospects will be less

promising.   No, this cannot be true.  Statistics  show  that

88%  of  ITE  graduates  get  jobs  within  three  months  of

finishing  their  courses.  According to the  recent  release

from  ITE,  the  average  salary is about  $1,222  for  fresh

graduates and $1,423 for post-NS graduates.  This is not  bad

for people on their first job.  The salary is just $300 short

of  the  starting  pay  of people with diplomas.   These  are

strong  indicators which reaffirm the employability  and  the

value of ITE graduates, even during economic downturns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ITE has, over the years, made a conscious effort to

develop  in students skills that are needed in the  industry.

So  parents as well as young Singaporeans should look at  ITE

in better light.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, ITE increases the employability of young

Singaporeans.  It gives them the foundation to upgrade  their

skills.   Some ITE graduates have gone on to the  polytechnic

to further enhance their employability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is also considerable debate over the need to

raise GST from 3% to 5%.  Of course, if we look at it from  a

mathematical perspective, it is almost a 100% jump.   But  is

this so?  Of course, not.  Nevertheless, we have to intensify

public  education so that our people are not unduly  worried.

One good example of how the GST works can be found in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>



latest issue of NTUC News.  I recommend that Members look  at

the  latest  issue of NTUC News in our attempt to explain  to

our residents and the public about how GST works and how they

should  not  be  unduly worried about  the  increase  in  two

percentage points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we have to be on guard against possible

profiteering.  Those who try to take advantage from  the  GST

increase  by  hiking  their  prices  unjustly  will  only  be

damaging   their   businesses.   The  Committee   to   Combat

Profiteering, chaired by Mr Chan Soo Sen, should expose  such

companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When GST was first introduced, NTUC cooperatives were

among  the first to declare that they would absorb GST for  a

period.  Other trades followed suit.  NTUC cooperatives  also

decided not to round up prices.  Again, this was emulated  by

other traders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time round, NTUC cooperatives have again been the

first off the mark, to say that they will absorb the extra 2%

that  is  to be levied.  And, as in the first exercise,  this

will  be  for  a  period  of time.   This  is  a  commendable

initiative by NTUC cooperatives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is an impression in some circles that the

Government  has  been  over generous towards  those  who  are

better off.  Now, they pay less in taxes  -  both company tax

and  income  tax.  This will lead to widening of  the  income

gap.   But  has the Government done this to deliberately  fix

the  lower  income?   We  all know the  answer  is  No!   The

Government has adjusted taxes to make Singapore an even  more

attractive  place for people to do business,  and  to  create

jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in general, I find the Budget generous and fair.

It  may  appear  to be pro-business, but it is actually  pro-people  because  it  attempts to create  more  jobs  for  the

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget Statement.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you

for allowing me to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>



join in this debate.  I support the efforts by the Government

to remake Singapore for a changed world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, driven by technology and globalisation,

the  world has been changing.  The pace, initially slow,  has

speeded  up  in recent years.  It was just a matter  of  time

when  the  cumulative effects became visible.   September  11

precipitated  its  unveiling.   Everyone  was  thus  abruptly

awoken  to  a  changed  world.   However,  if  one  has  been

discerning with the works of the Government over time via the

changes   made  to  policies,  systems,  values,   processes,

institutions, infrastructure, he would have noticed that  our

leaders have always realised the changing landscape.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of September 11 thus demanded a sudden step

change,  ie, a major response.  The luxurious gradual  change

of  yesteryears was no longer enough.  The tax  changes  just

announced  emanated from the recommendations by the  Economic

Review  Committee's  sub-committee  on  policies  related  to

taxation,  the CPF system, wages and land, headed  by  Senior

Minister  of State, Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, and  reflected

the gravity of the situation.  These are significant changes.

I  know.  I have sat over five budget sessions in this august

Chamber  in  the past years.  To get Minister Richard  Hu  to

agree  to a tax change was a major battle, very few of  which

were  ever won.  But in the Budget just announced, the  shift

was  tectonic.  The changes could only have been  dreamt  of.

The  degree  and  extent  of  change  clearly  reflected  the

seriousness  with  which the Government  viewed  the  changed

world  and  our  need to respond.  These are  brave  changes,

which  though  taken with calculated risks, are fraught  with

great  uncertainties, but change we must if we want  to  give

our  children and grandchildren as good a future in Singapore

as  we  had  of our lives and opportunities.  My more  senior

colleagues with more years in this Chamber may feel even more

strongly of these changes than I.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the tectonic shift, some may ask, is it

enough?  Hong Kong has a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>



corporate tax of just 16%.  Ireland has reduced its corporate

tax  even lower to 12 1/2% taking effect next year.  I  would

say  that it is enough for now.  By raising our GST  rate  by

2%,  from  3% to 5%, it has already aroused so much  distress

and  discomfort in our people.  A reduction of both corporate

and  individual  tax rates to below 20% would necessitate  an

even  higher GST rate.  In any case, tax, though an important

factor,  is  not  the  only factor in  the  decision  whether

Singapore  is  a  good place to do business.   We  require  a

holistic response to the new circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, very few worthy changes are easy or painless to

achieve.   More  often  than not, sacrifices  are  needed  to

achieve  the  desired goals.  The changes in the  tax  regime

will  shift  and  redistribute responsibilities.   Some  will

contribute more, others less.  This is inevitable,  but  this

is  not  the  purpose  of the change.  These  are  unintended

effects.  It is vital to constantly bear in mind the  primary

purpose  of making the change.  But it does not mean that  we

should  merely accept the pain and not do anything to  soften

the adverse consequences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GST affects every Singaporean. This means that

increasing the GST rate, all Singaporeans will pay more  GST.

Singaporeans  who  pay income tax and thus benefit  from  the

decrease  in  income tax will be better off  in  the  changed

regime, but those who do not pay income tax and thus  do  not

benefit from the decrease in income tax will be worse off  in

the changed tax regime.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GST offset package of economic restructuring shares

and  rebates is thus very reassuring to the people.   I  have

spoken to several of my residents and they are reassured.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important for all of us to realise that by making

changes,  we  can grow the pie.  The intended result  is  not

that  of  a  zero sum game where one gains at the expense  of

another, but that of a win-win



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>



situation where every Singaporean benefits.  Let us say  that

if  we  have $100 to spend with the GST rate of 3%,  we  have

effectively  $97 to spend.  If we do nothing and become  less

competitive,  we  may end up with just $50, and  taking  into

account  3% GST, it means that we have effectively $48.50  to

spend.   But with the change and the economy grows, we  could

have  $150,  and taking into account 5% GST,  it  will  still

leave  us with effectively $142.50 to spend.  So compare  the

value  of  $48.50 without change to a value of  $142.50  with

change,  the  brief  pains of change are  clearly  worth  the

while.  Some may disagree with my choice of numbers, but this

illustration makes clear the intended dynamics of the change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, let me join my colleague, Mr Leong Horn

Kee,  to  plead with the Government for the public assistance

recipients and pensioners.  The Minister has said  that  both

the  amounts of public assistance and Singapore Allowance are

under  review.  This  is  good.  I  have  spoken  to  several

pensioners  who  ask  for more sympathetic  understanding  of

their  situation.  Their pensions are tied to their salaries.

The  current  salary has galloped way out of sight,  and  the

Singapore Allowance which is to adjust for this hardly  keeps

pace.   They  had  contributed to the growth  of  the  nation

during their productive years and now depend on the State for

the  remaining years of their lives.  Like them,  the  public

assistance recipients, less able to help themselves, are also

dependent  on the State for help to live.  On this  basis,  I

hope  that the Government, in the current consideration, will

be more generous in its assistance to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately after Senior Minister of State, Mr Tharman,

announced  the recommendations of his Committee,  changes  to

income, corporate and goods and services tax rates caught the

attention  of the public.  Many saw the changes as benefiting

the rich and taxing the poor.  After the Budget was announced

and  the  package of GST offset was made known,  the  fervour

quietened.   The  purpose  of  the  GST  offset  package  was

achieved.  It was thus evident that to many, the changes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>



quickly boiled down to who gained and who lost.  Every  group

saw  the  specific impact upon itself.  The raison d'etre  of

the  effort was missed.  Should this be the case, the purpose

of  the  change  would be defeated.  We cannot merely  assume

that the people will understand, or that they will eventually

understand.   The  changes, with many more on  the  way,  are

intended to remake Singapore for a changed world.  The  world

will  not wait for us to be ready.  The world will just  move

on.   Hence, the quicker we get the people to understand  the

seriousness of the situation, the better prepared will we  be

to  face and surmount the challenges, and the faster  we  can

respond  to  the changing environment.  We need  to  get  our

people  to  understand and focus on the big picture,  on  the

long-term  benefits  to  all,  than  merely  harping  on  the

immediate gains and losses to individuals and groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot just assume that a few announcements by

Ministers  and  the  discussion in this august  Chamber  will

inform  the people of the purpose and the seriousness of  the

change.  Like Mr Heng Chee How, I believe we need to sell the

needed change to the people.  We must engage our people.   To

succeed, we must try to get everyone to come on board  -  the

quicker,   the  better.   To  succeed  in  the  remaking   of

Singapore,  we need the population to understand and  support

the  changes  that are needed.  We need a deliberate  focused

effort to do this.  But let me also quickly add that we  must

let our people know that we are not making these changes from

a  position  of desperation or panic, but one of proactivity.

By  moving before others do, we get a headstart in the  race.

We  must not be complacent like the proverbial hare.  But  it

bears  repeating that we do not oversell the  change  to  the

extent  that  we  appear desperate, as this  will  cause  the

people to lose confidence, when we are really taking off from

a  position of strength, of confidence and in command of  our

pace of change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am repeating myself here in elaborating the rationale

for  change.  There is a tendency to view the change  in  tax

rates as a key point of change.  It is not.  It bodes us well

to remember that a zero



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>



percentage  of  nothing  is  still  nothing.   Whereas   some

percentage  of  something is real, no matter how  small  that

something is.  For if there is no work, there is no  pay,  so

what, if the tax is zero?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that our people will rally round if they

are  aware  of this.  The changes are efforts to ensure  that

there  will be good, well-paying jobs for us and our children

now  and  in the future.  I am sure that we will happily  pay

our taxes for there is something to pay from.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will more changes be necessary? Unfortunately, the

answer  is  yes.  Besides the increase in pace,  change  will

also  be relentless.  The number of players in the field  has

increased  and  they  have  also become  more  sophisticated.

Competition in the future will be like treading on a conveyor

belt, constantly on the move.  We have to keep on moving just

to  keep up.  Hence, we have to be constantly on our  toes  - changing  and,  at  the  same time, proactively  anticipating

changes to keep ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides rapid changes, the cycle of change will be

short.   Booms  will follow busts, in quick succession.   The

pace  of  technological advances will force us to  learn  and

relearn  our knowledge and skills to remain relevant, quickly

discarding  those  no longer useful and replacing  them  with

newer  useful  ones.   Furthermore,  the  downturn  will   be

sectoral.    In  other  words,  simultaneously,  while   some

economic  sectors boom, others may be in recess.  It  appears

that  this  will  be the typical economic  landscape  of  the

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cope with such a dynamic and parlous future requires

a  sea  change in our mental attitude, in how we should  plan

and do for the future.  Our thinking of what we need to do to

survive must change.  Because of the last 40 years of  nearly

continuous   prosperity,  we  are  not  well   prepared   for

adversities.   Over committed in assets and low  in  savings,

two economic downturns in quick succession, resulting in high

retrenchment  and  exhaustion of savings,  led  to  financial

difficulties for many.  Here, we can learn



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>



from the proverbial ant who starts to prepare for winter,  as

soon  as  spring begins, through autumn, knowing that  winter

will  come and life will be tough.  Unlike the happy-go-lucky

grasshopper,  the  ant tempers his enjoyment  during  spring,

summer  and  autumn, keeping something aside and accumulating

its  larder for the winter.  Singaporeans must do  the  same.

We  have till now saved for just one winter in our life - our

old age.  Some do not even do that.  We must now begin to set

aside  a part of what we earn to build a larder for the  next

downturn,  so  that  we  will have the resources  to  weather

through  it while waiting for the upturn.  It is better  that

we  prepare for such a future than to look forward to others,

like  the  Government,  each time for help  when  a  downturn

occurs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we first began as a nation, our leaders, with

less  resources  and  experience and under  equally  daunting

circumstances,  overcame the odds to develop the  country  to

what  it  is  today.    They  succeeded  because  the  people

understood  the  situation  and  what  needed  to  be   done,

supported  the Government and worked together to achieve  our

common  goals.  Today, we come yet again to another watershed

in  the  life  of  our  nation, but now  equipped  with  more

resources  and  experience.   The  unknown  is  the  support,

commitment  and resolve of our people.  Like our parents,  if

we  understand our situation, share a common vision, and  are

prepared  to support the Government and work hard and  smart,

we will succeed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not fear competition. As much as we desire to

grow,  so  also  do others.  Economies grow as societies  and

nations  prosper.   With  the growing  pie,  competition  can

result  in  a  win-win  situation.  Under  fair  competition,

everyone  improves and the pie grows in size.   We  must  not

particularly  fear  our neighbours, for competition  can  and

will   also   come  from  afar,  especially  with  increasing

globalisation  as an irreversible trend.  But this  does  not

mean we simply give up our share.  We will fight to keep what

is ours,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>



and  our  competitors will have to convince the  buyers  that

they can do better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am convinced that my fellow countrymen share with me

that  we  have  the  means and the resolve  to  overcome  the

challenges  that  we face.  We can have our place  under  the

sun.  We will, if we work together as a people, thinking  not

just  for  ourselves but also our relatives and friends,  all

our  fellow  Singaporeans and, importantly, our children  and

their children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the People's Action Party and its leaders have

remained  true to its ideal to serve the people of  Singapore

to  the  best  of  its ability.  As long  as  the  people  of

Singapore  keep faith with the PAP, we will work our  fingers

to  the bone for them.  With the support of all Singaporeans,

we will overcome our challenges and our nation shall prosper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion moved by the Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, over the last one

week, I have been asked many times how I would describe  this

Budget.  Many also asked whether the tax measures would  help

to  create jobs as promised, or is this just a Budget to take

care of the rich in our society.  These may sound like simple

questions,  Sir, but there are serious issues which  underpin

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget reinforces the shift that has taken place

over  the  last few years in our tax and regulatory  systems.

It  is  not something new, as many other countries  are  also

doing the same.  Among the OECD countries, for instance, most

have  been reducing their corporate tax rate since 1990.   In

fact,   concerned   by  the  revenue  consequences   of   tax

competition,  the OECD has even established a task  force  to

look  into the matter, as it recognises that capital mobility

opens  up  the risk of competitive bidding between  countries

for mobile business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the key words here are capital mobility. Companies

can vote with their feet and will relocate to countries where



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>



they  can  reap the most returns.  It is a serious  challenge

for  states  limited by geographical and manpower constraints

to  draw and retain capital within their boundaries.   To  do

so,  they  have  to  create  attractive  tax  and  regulatory

systems.   We  know  that  capital  mobility  is  due  to   a

convergence   of   factors,   such   as   globalisation   and

deregulation   of  trade  and  investment  and  technological

advancement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, having an attractive tax and regulatory system

alone  is insufficient to sustain our long-term progress  and

prosperity.   We  can have an attractive tax system,  but  we

will  still not be able to attract and retain investments  if

there  is no support for such initiatives, because people  do

not  understand nor appreciate how these measures can improve

their  well-being.  We have seen how globalisation  has  come

under  attack  world-wide.  Abating somewhat only  after  the

September  11 incident, the debate on globalisation  has  not

ended.  In many countries, people feel that globalisation and

free trade have not benefited them.  The fiasco in Seattle is

a  case  in  point and it is not likely that such  objections

will  disappear  if  the  key  issues  of  inequity  are  not

addressed.   The real problem though is not globalisation  or

free trade.  Rather it is the failure of many governments  to

invest  in  their people and have an effective social  safety

net.    Without  heavy  investments  in  human  capital   and

programmes to help those who are displaced to cope  with  the

transitional  adjustment  problems,  there  will  be   strong

reactions  to  change  and the chorus of  protest  will  grow

louder.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we, in Singapore, are no strangers to change. Over

the  last few years, the pace of change has in fact quickened

considerably.   Many  of  us have  had  to  revisit  our  old

assumptions   and  beliefs.   Job  security   and   life-long

employment  no  longer  carry the  same  meaning  as  before.

Today,  nobody can reasonably expect to retire from the  very

first  job  that  he  or she was employed  in  after  school.

Individuals  now  have  to  take  on  the  responsibility  of

managing   their   own   careers  and  ensuring   their   own

employability.  Many companies today do not wait to  retrench

until they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>



are  in the throes of death, but regularly review their  cost

structure  in  order  to  stay competitive.   In  many  ways,

individuals  now  carry  more of the risk  of  labour  market

downturn  and  a company's poor performance compared  to  the

past.  Workers can no longer afford to remain indifferent  to

issues  of cost and returns to shareholders, as these have  a

direct link to their job security and wages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often, Sir, we question whether there is any meaning to

the  word  "loyalty" at all.  What is the meaning of  loyalty

when  you  cannot even be assured of a job?  As the  business

environment becomes more competitive and companies come under

pressure  to  reduce  cost,  the social  compact  with  their

workers  can weaken.  Not so long ago, I remember  we  had  a

different discussion about loyalty.  The debate then was  how

to penalise job hoppers by forfeiting their CPF contributions

if they leave a company after only a short period of service.

Today,  we have to deal with issues of outsourcing,  contract

work and part-time work, all of which are on the increase and

are temporary in nature.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that we are having this discussion shows how

dramatic  the  changes have been.  We are no  longer  talking

about  how to retain people but instead our focus is  now  on

how to educate and train people to manage frequent changes in

jobs and careers.  We know that change is inevitable.  But we

also  know  that  the impact of such changes on  Singaporeans

will  have  to  be  managed, so that those who  are  affected

during  the transition will not bear the cost of such changes

disproportionately.   In a free market and  an  open  economy

like  Singapore, the Government has a very important role  to

play.   Openness  is clearly good for growth and  employment.

But  for such openness to benefit everyone, there must  be  a

comprehensive  policy  on human resource  development  and  a

social floor in the form of effective labour legislation  and

social protection.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because labour markets are different from

markets for goods and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>



services.  Labour markets are about people, their skills  and

competencies  and  their  aspirations  and  motivations.   An

employment  contract cannot be treated as  purely  commercial

contracts   due  to  the  unequal  bargaining  strengths   of

individuals  as  against companies.   In  Singapore,  we  are

fortunate  to  have a farsighted Government that  understands

these imperatives.  We have a comprehensive social safety net

in the form of subsidised education, health and housing.  And

there  is  heavy  investment in human  resource  development.

Although the social contract with companies has weakened, the

social  compact  between our Government and  the  people  has

strengthened.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased, Sir, to note that in this year's Budget,

45%  of  the  expenditure will go to social  development.   I

agree  entirely  with  the  Minister  for  Finance  that  the

substantially  increased  budget  allocation  for  education,

health  and  community development are necessary  foundations

for a strong, cohesive and resilient society.  I believe that

without  such  heavy investment in human and social  capital,

changes  will be more bumpy and there will be greater  social

disruptions  which,  at the end of the day,  will  impoverish

everyone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also note that the allocation for the Ministry of

Manpower's  operating expenditure has increased by  22%.   Of

this,  the  largest percentage, or 28.4% of the total  budget

allocation of $220 million allocated to the Ministry, will be

spent  on life-long education and skills upgrading programme.

I strongly welcome the Minister for Finance's statement that,

despite budgetary constraints, the Government will not  stint

on  its support for workers to upgrade themselves.  We are on

the  right track, Sir.  Our priorities are well-placed.   The

way ahead for us is to make sure that everyone who aspires is

given a chance to be placed on the ladder and, thereafter, he

or  she decides how fast or how slow he or she wants to climb

up the ladder.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question which I raised at the beginning of my

intervention, has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>



answered.  Yes, the 2% GST increase will be painful.  But the

offset  package of measures will take care of the  adjustment

needs  of low income Singaporeans in the short term.  And  in

the   long   term,   the  heavy  investment   in   developing

capabilities  through  education  and  skills  training   and

upgrading will enable all Singaporeans to acquire better jobs

and  a  better  life.  This Budget is clearly  not  for  high

income  Singaporeans only, but will benefit all  Singaporeans

today and in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we move ahead, there will be serious challenges

faced  by  all  Singaporeans.  For the Malay  community,  the

challenges will be even more serious.  As it is a known  fact

that the community lags behind others in education and skills

upgrading, there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that  there

are more Malay workers in low-end and unskilled jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many training opportunities available and

funds  is  not  an issue.  The Minister in charge  of  Muslim

Affairs  has also outlined a vision for the Malay  community.

In  this  vision of a community of excellence, upgrading  the

skills  and  employability of Malay workers is a  key  focus.

For  this community of excellence vision to take place, there

must be a quantum leap in the thinking in the Malay community

about  the  importance of learning and skills  upgrading.   I

must stress that, over the years, we have seen some progress.

Many  more  have enrolled in the various training programmes.

IT  and  computer literacy courses run by NTUC see  a  larger

number  of  Malay  workers attending them.   Higher  educated

Malays  are now no longer contented only with basic  degrees.

Many  have gone on to acquire post-graduate degrees and post-diplomas  in  various areas.  Self-help bodies, like  MENDAKI

and  AMP,  have also rallied around this cause and have  been

actively  promoting  skills  upgrading  courses.   But   more

remains to be done, as I fear that, as the economy moves into

higher gear, there will be more displaced workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this respect, I call upon the community to focus

on the key points



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>



mentioned  in the community of excellence vision outlined  by

the  Minister in charge of Muslim Affairs.  They should avoid

getting  side-tracked by specific issues of how to  interpret

some  of  the points made in the vision statement.   Instead,

focus  on  the core issues, believe that change is necessary,

galvanise all our resources and work together with one  heart

and one mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before ending, I would like to urge the relevant

Ministries,  statutory  boards and  GLCs  to  exercise  great

restraint before increasing the prices of their services.  We

are  not out of the woods yet.  We still have 100,000  people

unemployed and, therefore, I think this call for restraint is

necessary and pertinent.  The recent increase of HDB car park

charges  by $15 to $90, for instance, has created  a  lot  of

unhappiness,  because  it has also affected  the  small  time

businesses  and the retailers.  The dust on the GST  has  not

yet  settled and people are still trying to digest the impact

when this increase comes about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of particular concern to Singaporeans will be

healthcare   cost.    I  note  the  Minister   for   Health's

explanation on this recently, but I am not clear whether  the

assurance  which  he  had given is in  relation  to  the  GST

specifically,  or  whether it was on  healthcare  cost  as  a

whole.   There is also a concern expressed over the  proposed

means  testing  of subsidised healthcare.  I hope  that  this

will not make it much more difficult for those who are really

in need of help to get subsidised medical care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I end, Sir, there is one old ghost which I would

like to revisit since this is a new Parliament, I think it is

only  appropriate that we must look at some of the old ghosts

and  resurrect them for some discussion.  The policy which  I

would  like to see changed is the medical benefit policy  for

female civil servants.  I must declare my interest because we

do  have many female civil servants in our membership in  the

NTUC.   Presently,  unlike  their male  counterparts,  family

members of female civil servants do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>



enjoy subsidised medical benefit.  With a high percentage  of

women  now  in  the workforce - we have two  women  Permanent

Secretaries, we have many women Judges, we have several women

Lieutenant  Colonels - I really do not see  why  we  need  to

continue  with  this policy which is quite unsustainable  and

the rationale for which is becoming more and more murky as we

go on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I certainly think that it sends a contradictory

signal about the Government's position on women.  On the  one

hand,  the  Government encourages and supports  women's  full

participation in the labour force but, on the other hand,  it

continues  to preserve outdated policies.  Sir,  I  am  quite

sure that the new Minister for Finance is a very progressive,

in  fact, fair-minded person and that perhaps, this time,  we

will actually see a change in this policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this hopeful note, Sir, I thank you and I support the

motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker,

Sir, for allowing me to join in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, several European businessmen I met last week, when

discussing the Budget, felt that this is a rather bold,  even

audacious Budget.  They were very impressed by our commitment

and  political will to implement fundamental changes  to  our

fiscal  infrastructure.   They  admired,  even  envied,   our

financial   capacity  and  commitment  to  help  Singaporeans

adjust.  But they also pointed out that, after all, the  core

proposal  is  to cut taxes for corporates and  those  at  the

higher end of the income spectrum whilst increasing the  GST,

which  will  affect  the  man-in-the-street.   And  in  their

countries,  such a fiscal mix would make for a very  volatile

cocktail.  That is perhaps why Singapore is different.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think a close analysis of the Finance Minister's

speech  and specific measures within the Budget should dispel

any  misconceptions.  Because this Budget addresses both  the

needs in the immediate term of businesses and talented



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>



individuals  so  that they will come here but,  at  the  same

time,  also  sets  in  place fundamental changes  which  will

benefit Singaporeans as a whole in the long term.  The aim is

to  create economic growth and jobs.  The strategy is to  put

in  place fiscal measures that will ensure Singapore's  long-term  competitiveness whilst maintaining essential Government

services.  The short-term impact on Singaporeans is cushioned

by  a slew of offset measures.  And if we are successful  and

with  a  modicum of luck, the average Singaporean will  be  a

significant   beneficiary,  through  more  and   better   job

opportunities as well as higher wages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the past week or so, I have also had the

opportunity to discuss the Budget with Singaporeans from  all

walks   of  life,  through  numerous  feedback  and  dialogue

sessions,  and  I  must  say I was  very  inspired  by  their

feedback.   In general, Singaporeans accept and  support  the

principle  that  underpin Budget 2002.  They  understand  the

need  to  attract and retain businesses and talent to  foster

growth  in  our  economy.   And  they  also  appreciate   the

heightened competition that Singapore faces and the  need  to

reposition our economy.  They also understand the  role  they

have  to  play through training, skills upgrading, and  maybe

even absorbing some short-term pain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, Sir, the Singaporeans I have spoken to, and

they  are  reflective of Singaporeans in  general,  they  are

concerned  about jobs and job security.  They have put  their

trust  in  this Government's judgment that Budget  2002,  and

other recommendations of the Economic Review Committee,  will

best serve their long-term interests.  It is critical that we

live up to this expectation and fulfill our obligations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to make specific comments on one or two

aspects of the Budget, drawing on some of the feedback I have

received   so  as  to  represent  some  of  the  views   many

Singaporeans have conveyed to me.  One pertains to  the  GST,

and it pertains to the timing and extent of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>



increase.  Many have raised this question and I believe  some

of  my colleagues have done so earlier as well.  Why increase

the  GST?  Why now?  And if any increase in the new financial

year  is  necessary, why not adopt a more graduated approach?

These   questions  come  from  different  segments   of   the

community,  stemming from varying concerns.  Small businesses

are concerned that an increase in GST in the current economic

environment will have a further negative psychological impact

on  consumers  and cause contraction in spending.   They  are

also worried about an increase in business costs, even though

GST-registered businesses can claim input taxes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual Singaporeans welcome the Government's

comprehensive offset package to ease the impact of the GST on

them.   But they also asked whether the whole exercise  could

have  been  deferred till the economy is more firmly  on  the

path to recovery and the employment situation has stabilised.

They are concerned that many sellers of products and services

might  use this opportunity to raise their prices.   We  have

the legendary examples of coffee prices going up by more than

the 2% implied by GST increases.  Perhaps the rises in prices

may  not be high enough to be deemed to be profiteering  but,

nevertheless, it could be significantly higher  than  the  2%

implied  by the GST rise, and that, in turn, they fear  would

have a greater impact on their own spending.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from a broader fiscal perspective, the question is

also  whether  the desired corporate and personal  tax  cuts,

which are essential for repositioning our economy, could have

been  absorbed  without a concomitant rise in  the  GST.   In

particular, the increase in GST from 3% to 5% is expected  to

yield  additional  revenue  of $1.3  billion  annually.   The

offset  package costs nearly the same amount.  The ERS  alone

will  cost the Government about $1.2 billion a year  for  the

next  three years.  So, that being the case, the question  is

whether we could have deferred the decision on the GST.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans accept the need for Government to

compensate for revenue



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>



lost through tax cuts in order to meet the growing demand for

essential   Government   services.   The   Finance   Minister

elaborated on this point extensively during his statement  on

the  need  to  maintain  Government  services  in  education,

health, housing, transport and defence, and I think the point

has been well taken by Singaporeans.  The question is whether

there  is  a  need to implement the GST immediately,  in  the

short term, especially given the economic situation today and

cost  of  the  offset package.  I do hope  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister   and  Finance  Minister  will  elaborate   on   the

Government's thinking on this matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other aspect that has come up for some degree

of commentary is the Economic Restructuring Shares.  Sir, the

ERS is a welcome and effective means of cushioning the impact

of  the  GST  increase  on  average Singaporeans.   The  ERS,

together with the S&C and rental rebates, will go a long  way

towards   helping   Singaporeans  adjust  to   the   changes,

especially  those  in  financial difficulty.   However,  some

questions have been raised on the ERS scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first pertains to its coverage. Many have asked

whether  the  ERS  scheme's coverage need be  so  wide.   For

example,  even  those  who benefit  from  the  corporate  and

personal  tax  reductions and, for  that  matter,  the  other

reductions  for vehicle related taxes, will be receiving  the

shares.   Is  that necessary or should the scheme  have  been

confined  to those in the lower income brackets or those  who

do not benefit directly from the tax reductions?  Sir, unlike

1994 when the GST was first introduced, in this instance,  it

is  being  raised to compensate for revenue lost  from  other

measures which already favour those who are better off.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question pertains to the criteria for

allocation.   By  using the annual value  of  properties  and

setting it at $10,000, the Minister for Finance has erred  on

the  side  of  generosity,  and I suspect  deliberately,  and

captured  all  HDB households, and then some.   But  property

value is a relatively blunt instrument to gauge a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>



household's  financial situation.  There  are,  for  example,

many  retirees who may be living in terrace houses bought  20

years  ago, and they certainly do not fall within the  higher

income bracket, but they would probably get the lower tranche

of  ERS  shares.   At the same time, there  are  high  income

individuals,  some  owning  several  properties  and  driving

luxury  cars, who live in HDB flats.  Could we therefore  not

use  income, based on income tax returns or other sources  of

data,  as  the  allocation  criteria  instead?   I  know  the

Minister  has to strike the tricky balance between efficiency

of  the  process and equitability of the outcome.   There  is

also  a  need  to  ensure privacy of personal  data  such  as

income.   But given the sophistication of IT systems and  the

civil  service's  experience with previous  schemes  in  this

genre,  could  we  not try to have a more  equitable  outcome

based on a more reflective allocation criteria?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the SME perspective and on business cost,

several small businessmen have opined that the Budget appears

to  favour  the  larger and more profitable companies.   They

pointed  out that a tax cut is useful only if one's  business

is  profitable  in  the  first place, and  the  reduction  in

personal  income tax does not really help them in  attracting

the  necessary talent to drive their businesses so as to  get

them  into  new  areas of growth.  They  therefore  urge  the

Government to take further measures to reduce business  costs

which  will be of the greatest significance to them, and  the

key  components  they  highlight are the  cost  of  land  and

rentals.  This would also apply to many MNCs who have to  pay

corporate  taxes  at the rates applicable  in  the  countries

where  they  are headquartered regardless of Singapore's  tax

rates.  Many are aware that the Economic Review Committee  is

studying  this  aspect  of  the  economy  and  are  anxiously

awaiting the recommendations on these other measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally, a word on intellectual and social capital.

I  was very inspired by some of the measures announced by the

Finance  Minister  to promote and grow both  aspects  of  our

country and economy.  In times of economic difficulty,  there

is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>



tendency  for  companies  to cut  back  on  R&D  expenditure,

because  it has an immediate impact on expenditure  and  cash

flow, and the benefits are only realised in the long term.  I

am  therefore glad that the Minister will be liberalizing the

tax  deduction  for  expenses incurred for  R&D,  leading  to

ownership  of  intellectual  property  in  Singapore.   This,

together with our laws protecting intellectual property, will

certainly  encourage Singapore's development  as  a  hub  for

intellectual capital and knowledge-based industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another casualty of economic hardship is philanthropy.

I   am  aware  that  many  charities  and  volunteer  welfare

organisations  are  finding it hard to raise  funds  in  this

climate.   Yet, we would all acknowledge that their  work  is

essential  if  Singapore is to be cohesive and united.   Sir,

the  introduction of double tax deductions  of  donations  to

IPCs  and allowing such tax deductions to be carried  forward

for five years is a welcome investment in our social capital.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

thank you for allowing me to join the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my discussions with my community and grassroots

leaders,  many  have  expressed  concerns  about  Singapore's

future.  Can Singapore continue to remain competitive in  the

long  term, especially with the entry of China into the World

Trade  Organisation, the uncertainties in the global as  well

as  the  regional  economies and our  neighbours'  intent  to

challenge our competitive position, pulling away some of  our

businesses?  As for GST, there is a concern that there may be

more GST increases at shorter and more frequent intervals  in

the future, especially when we reach the limit of our ability

to reduce corporate and personal income tax.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that the Budget has addressed some of

these fundamental



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>



concerns.   At  the same time, the Economic Review  Committee

and  the Remaking of Singapore Committee are considering what

more  need  to be done to strengthen Singapore's capacity  to

keep ahead of our competitors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our effective economic management and prudent

fiscal  policy  have  enabled  us  to  accumulate  a  healthy

reserve,  and we have the resources to decisively restructure

our  economy  and  be ready for the tough  challenges  ahead.

Sir,   the   recent   General  Elections  have   shown   that

Singaporeans are solidly behind our leaders in their move  to

chart  new  directions  to be a more vibrant  and  successful

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to overcome the challenges before us, it is clear

that  we cannot afford to be complacent and soft.  The  world

is changing fast and we will have to make changes and adjust,

regardless of how painful they may be, so that we continue to

be  relevant.   We cannot become a low-cost business  centre,

but  we  can be a reliable and flexible place to do business.

We  must also be ready to accept measures that will enable  a

fair share of global talents to join our team.  Above all, we

have  to strengthen inter-racial and religious confidence  to

enhance our social cohesion and national unity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this point I would like to stress that the Malay

community  in  Singapore has a bright and sunny  place  here.

The  educational attainments of the Malay students have shown

remarkable  and  steady  improvements.   Most  of  our  Malay

students  have  strong  grasps of English  and  their  mother

tongue.   We  can  therefore continue to be relevant  to  the

global new economy.  In fact, some of our Malay students have

shown  that  they  can attain high rankings in  international

competitions in Science and Mathematics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new Minister in charge of Muslim Affairs, Dr

Yaacob  Ibrahim, has spoken on his vision of a  Community  of

Excellence.  Sir, I am confident that the community will have

the confidence to move ahead and reach higher heights of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>



excellence, and we can make significant contributions to push

Singapore  ahead to a higher standard and quality of  living.

In  this connection, Sir, I share entirely what Madam Halimah

has  said of the need for us to be ready to make changes  and

adjustments so that we can continue to excel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with those opening remarks, let me now move to

certain  specific  issues.   First,  employability  of  older

workers.  Sir, the experience at the CDC's Employment Centres

is  that it is difficult to find jobs for older workers, even

for   those   with  skills,  education  and   relevant   work

experience.  This situation is likely to continue  even  when

the  economy  improves.  Sir, employers' first preference  is

for  younger  workers.  Hence, there is  a  need  to  provide

urgent  measures  to help older workers and  make  them  more

confident.  I think it is necessary to provide more financial

incentives  to  employers to encourage them to consider  more

employment of older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Manpower's People for Jobs

Programme is helpful but I think much more need to  be  done.

Can  we  provide  funds either in the Ministry  of  Finance's

budget,  or for SPRING or EDB, so that they can provide  help

to senior and experienced employees who are now redundant, to

enable them to set up businesses, say, consultancies, to help

local  businesses to improve their organisations or  even  to

venture  overseas?   Sir,  the  EDB  may  have  the  Industry

Assistance   Scheme,  but  the  criteria  are   perhaps   too

stringent.   Could  we also encourage our  banks  to  open  a

sympathetic  window to provide loans to persons who  want  to

open  businesses,  provided  they  come  up  with  some  good

business plans?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the South-East CDC has set up job creation

opportunities.  For example, we provide the Domestic Training

Scheme  and  the  Ministry of Manpower is providing  us  some

financial  provisions.  We will consider more such facilities

in   the  informal  sector  and  I  believe  my  other  Mayor

colleagues are also doing the same.  But we certainly can  do

with more funds.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, more assistance to the small business enterprises

and on this point Mr S Iswaran has provided some inputs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feedback which I received is that the SMEs are

rather disappointed with the Budget.  They find that the cost

of  doing  business is high, eg, high rentals and  also  high

statutory  charges,  and many experience cash-flow  problems.

They  also find it difficult to get good staff.  Hence, there

is  a  need to help them to tap finance, recruit good  talent

and  also  to  help  them  expand  their  business  overseas,

especially beyond our troubled region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me touch on the CPF. Many older workers are

concerned   about  their  ability  to  meet   their   housing

commitments  if the employer's contribution rates  for  older

workers  are  reduced.   So  I  think  it  is  important  and

necessary  to  quickly clarify and remove  this  uncertainty.

Older  workers have planned their commitments on the  current

rates  and they therefore fear changes.  Perhaps the new  CPF

rates  should  apply only to younger workers who  could  then

plan  the use of their CPF for housing, having regard to  the

new contribution rates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on social cohesion and national unity, the

Finance  Minister has pointed out that we have been  able  to

weather difficult times because of our strong unity.  We will

have  greater challenges to our social cohesion in the  years

ahead,  because  of  September 11 and  also  because  of  the

increasingly  competitive global environment.  Sir,  I  would

like  to encourage our companies and businesses to provide  a

budget  for  activities to enhance social cohesion  in  their

organisations  and for the bigger companies,  they  can  also

perhaps  appoint special staff for this function.   It  would

benefit  them  as  it  would  help enhance  teamwork,  better

understanding  and therefore increase productivity.   Perhaps

such  expenditure could receive tax credits  or  can  be  tax

exempt  and they can use the funds to organise projects  with

the local community where the company is located, or with the

CDCs.   Sir, in this way, we will create a more united people

and this will certainly enhance our total competitiveness.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, I support the motion.

<br>4.30 pm

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Sir, the Budget this

year is hard-headed, yet compassionate.  It is hard-headed in

its determination to restructure Singapore and at a time when

unemployment is hurting some 100,000 Singaporeans.  Put  them

together, and that is more than three-quarters the population

size   of   Tampines  GRC,  my  constituency.   Indeed,   the

restructuring  process is likely to cause more  blood  to  be

spilled  in  the  job  market.  But as the  Finance  Minister

pointed out, this decisive move to restructure the economy is

this  country's best hope of staying ahead of  the  race  and

creating jobs for our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hard-headedness is balanced by compassion, with the

close  attention  paid to those who will be affected  by  the

restructuring  process.  The Government should  be  commended

for  working  out a generous Economic Restructuring  Package,

including  the  ERS, and for promising that all  lower-income

households will not be worse off with the hike in GST rates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have several concerns. They revolve around

the kind of society that we are building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the measures are said to be aimed ultimately at

creating  jobs.   But jobs for whom?  Most  likely,  for  the

skilled and nimble workers who are able to compete in the new

economy.  But if there are not enough of them, we say, "bring

in  the foreigners".  Let me make clear that I am not against

this  policy.   It is good for Singapore that  higher  value-added jobs will come in, such as in biotechnology and in  the

life  sciences.   It generates growth for  this  country  and

helps  to  secure our economic future.  But where  does  that

leave our lower-income, lower-skilled and our older workers?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figures show that they are often the first casualties of

the  restructuring process.  This is often because  the  jobs

that  are  created are way beyond their skills  level  or  in

entirely  new  high-tech fields.  Their  problem  is  one  of

structural unemployment.  This is a problem confronting  many

developed countries and many countries in transition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the problem is being felt on the ground.

I  see  a  steady  stream of older workers and  lower-skilled

workers  coming  to my meet-the-people sessions  begging  for

jobs.  The success rate of job matching at the North-east CDC

does not give much cause for cheer.  Despite its best efforts

to  find jobs for 1,220 job applicants from January to  March

this  year, only 41 of them were successfully matched with  a

job.   This  is  about a 3% success rate.  The  main  reasons

cited  for  the  low  rate: shrinking vacancies  in  the  job

market, more retrenchments, the mindsets of employers and job

seekers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not helpful for us to keep lamenting that

they   are  choosy  about  work  or  have  unreasonable   pay

expectations.   Some, especially the older workers,  tell  me

that  they are prepared to take lower pay but employers  just

refuse  to give them a foot in the door.  Companies are  also

reluctant  to  send  their older workers for  retraining  and

upgrading  programmes, preferring to invest in their  younger

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these biases and practices against the older

workers,  including  the skilled ones,  must  be  overturned,

especially  given  the  fact  that  Singapore  has  an  aging

population.  Will the lower-skilled and older workers have  a

place in this new Singapore?  If the Government can go out of

its  way  to  save  and conserve marine life  in  Chek  Jawa,

surely,  it  should  expend even more effort  in  saving  and

preserving  the economic shelf life of our lower-skilled  and

older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, I would like to make four suggestions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, redistribute the overall gains from free trade

through subsidies to employers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>



who  hire  and  train such workers.  The first step  in  this

direction  could  be  a  tax credit.  If  tax  credits  prove

insufficient,  the Government should consider cash  subsidies

to firms that hire and train lower-skilled and older workers.

Our  People  for Jobs Traineeship scheme should  be  expanded

further.  This is a better option than giving direct handouts

to  those hit by restructuring.  It fosters self-reliance and

self-respect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, review the effectiveness of the training

programmes. There are many training programmes.  There is  no

doubt that the Government has put a lot of thought and effort

into  rolling them out.  The issue is how effective are  they

in  securing  better jobs for displaced workers  in  a  fast-changing environment.  It is a cause for worry that  many  of

the places on the various training schemes still go unfilled.

But  we cannot expect hard-pressed workers to go for training

just for the sake of it.  They must be confident that it  can

reap  some  tangible  benefits for them and  their  families.

What  is the point of going for retraining if at the  end  of

it, jobs are still elusive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I welcome the Finance Minister's assurance that

the  Government will not stint in its support for workers  to

upgrade  themselves,  we must ask, given  our  scarce  budget

resources,  how  high  are  the  returns  on  this  slew   of

programmes.   We must identify the effective programmes  that

can  lead  to better jobs for workers, rather than  roll  out

many programmes with minimal returns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we should address the issue of quality of work

for  older workers. This means modifying the organisation  of

work,  working hours and working life in general to the needs

and  abilities  of  the older workers.   Most  older  workers

seeking  employment today want part-time work.  However,  new

types  of  jobs  suited to the older workers  are  still  too

scarce.   Presently, only about 3% of workers work  part-time

in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must declare my interest. I am working on a

programme to give part-time



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>



work  for older residents at my ward in a non-profit  elderly

centre  in  my constituency, Tampines-Changkat.  I hope  that

such grassroots effort will receive the support of Government

in terms of funding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should consider providing funding to new

businesses or projects that promote legitimate employment and

training opportunities for these workers.  They may not yield

high-growth rates for the economy but it will give  residents

some  useful  pocket money and a greater sense of  belonging.

We should also provide incentives for VWOs and CDCs to expend

employment opportunities for this group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Africa, to help its older workers cope, the

Government in Zimbabwe has given rural headmen in some  areas

to  set  aside one plot of land to be farmed jointly  by  the

community.  Private charities, such as HelpAge Zimbabwe,  are

also  trying to set the elderly up with small businesses  and

collective  farms.  We do not have land to set up farms,  but

we  can  take  the  lead  by running  useful  businesses  and

projects which involve older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These issues facing us today are not just technical

economic issues.  They are also moral and ethical ones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those urging ever more tough market measures use the

language  of  economic efficiency and individual  enterprise.

They  tacitly assume that people stay the same regardless  of

the  kind of social structures that surround them.   This  is

not  true.   If a society becomes too thoroughly  marketised,

where  everyone is an economic entity or else irrelevant,  if

the principle of private pursuit of personal gain becomes too

dominant, then people become greedy and selfish.  I fear that

we might run that risk.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already, I hear that Singaporeans are not talking just

about the 5Cs.  They are now talking about promoting the need

for  the  5Ks - Kaki Ko Kaki.  That is Hokkien for "to  each,

his  own."   If  we  go down that road, it undermines  social

relations that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>



make  life worth living.  It treats people as things with  an

expiry date.  It breeds alienation and rootlessness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is crucial that we reinvigorate families, community

groups  and  VWOs  which  stress responsibilities,  duty  and

sharing,  to  counterbalance  the  ethic  of  private   self-interest.   The  Government is trying to give  a  balance  by

raising  public spending significantly on social  development

and  by  providing the ERS package.  It is well aware of  the

need  to  promote  a  sense of community and  to  spread  the

benefits of growth across the board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I applaud particularly the tax measures to promote the

spirit of philanthropy in individuals and corporations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no one disputes that faster growth is necessary to

reduce  poverty and the income gap between people.  The  more

challenging  question is whether economic  growth  itself  is

enough to achieve our social goals of creating a better  home

and a better future for all Singaporeans.  The Government has

long  subscribed to the world view in which the  rising  tide

lifts   all  boats,  including  many  at  the  bottom.    But

increasingly, this world view is being challenged.  The  poor

do  get  richer,  but at a far slower pace than  the  higher-income  group.    This leads to a widening income  gap.   The

latest  measures to cut tax rates will widen this income  gap

further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was with an eye on this widening gulf that Prime

Minister  Goh Chok Tong had last year stressed  the  need  to

forge  a  new  social compact. One prong  of  it  is  to  pay

particular   attention  to  the  needs  of  the  lower-income

Singaporeans.  But going by the handout given by the  Finance

Minister,   the   table  which  says  "Impact   of   Economic

Restructuring Package on representative households", it would

appear that those who gain most would be those in 4-room  and

5-room  flats,  mainly because of the ERS.   Unlike  previous

redistribution of budget surpluses, this time the  allocation

is not skewed in favour of the lower-income.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the NSS scheme last year, the lower-income

receives  seven times more shares than the top earners.   The

Economic  Restructuring  Shares will  be  redistributed  more

evenly,  with  more  than  90% of  households  receiving  the

maximum, 1,200 shares each and the rest, half of that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not help very much to narrow the income gap.

In  a  sense, this focus on the middle-income is  fair.   The

middle-class is also hit by restructuring, and in some cases,

even  harder,  as they have to bear higher financial  burdens

than  the lower-income.  Middle-income families, as we  know,

now  form the bulk of Singaporeans.  About 60% of HDB  owners

live in 4- or 5-room flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So perhaps it is right that they get attention this time

round.  On the other hand, unlike those without the skills to

cope  in the new economy, the middle-class Singaporeans  have

more  resources and abilities to fall back on.   It  is  this

resilience that we need to encourage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a danger that all the welfare and wealth-sharing mechanisms and schemes will be taken for granted and

that  everybody  would begin to expect them as  a  matter  of

course.   I am not saying that we should not help the middle-income families but I am saying that we should help them, but

to  help  the lower-income more.  They are the ones  who  are

finding  it  hard  to cope and they are the ones  who  should

deserve our special attention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fundamental task of every legitimate government

is  to  secure  the  good society for its citizens.   A  good

government has to discern the true interests of this  country

to  invent  and  pursue  policies that  transcend  the  self-interest often revealed in public opinion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing which worries me is how quickly

despondency descends on the public mood when faced  with  bad

times.   The danger is that it can paralyse required  efforts

to  turn  retreat into advance.  And this mood does not  only

affect  the  vulnerable groups, such as the lower-income  and

older workers, it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>



seems that they are also spreading to the younger generation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an Asian survey conducted last year for Coca-Cola,

young Singaporeans are found to be the least optimistic among

young  people  surveyed in eight countries.   Asked  if  they

agree   that   the  future  always  offers   more   and   new

possibilities, only about 65% of Singaporeans say  yes.  This

is compared to 84% in Malaysia and 91% in Thailand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One possible reason for this could be the trend towards

more  unemployed graduates.  The latest labour  force  survey

showed  that  the  number of graduates unemployed  rose  from

6,600  in 1997 to more than 20,000 last year.  The Government

must give hope that the restructuring will yield jobs for the

mass of Singaporeans and that it will indeed translate into a

better Singapore with opportunities for all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, employment is not just about numbers or a line on a

chart.   The  conditions under which work is  performed,  the

livelihood  it  provides, and the solidarity shown  by  those

doing  well  in  this  new  economy  towards  those  who  are

displaced by it - these are all measures of a decent society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to take this opportunity to also lend my

voice  and support to Halimah who asked for a review  of  the

medical  benefits scheme for women.  I had intended to  raise

this  as  a Budget cut which I put under the Prime Minister's

Office  but I just want to say that it is an outmoded  policy

and it definitely needs to be reviewed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in his Address, the President called on us to

remake  Singapore together so that we will continue to thrive

and  prosper  in  an  uncertain  world.   The  world  may  be

uncertain  but  we  have  to  be certain  about  why  we  are

embarking  on this difficult journey as a people.  It  cannot

be  only  for  economic growth.  In this globalised  economy,

growth rates can zig zag up and down very rapidly, as we have

all found out, and if that is what we hitch our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>



destiny  and  happiness to, we will be quite a  sick  people.

Nausea  cannot be a driving force.  In facing these difficult

times,  we  must equip and engage our people as  citizens  in

shaping their future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This economic downturn will be worth all the troubles

and problems they give us if they show up the areas which  we

need  to  work  on,  and  teach us that  the  true  worth  of

citizenship  lies not in waiting selfishly to be helped,  but

in  helping ourselves and our fellow citizens.  We will need,

in  larger  measure  than before, the help and  encouragement

that  the  strong  can give the weak.  Thus  helped,  we  all

should  rise to the path that leads to the objective we  have

all   pledged  ourselves  to:   "Happiness,  prosperity   and

progress for our nation."

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker Sir, I rise to

congratulate  the Deputy Prime Minister and Finance  Minister

for  his  courage and vision in outlining for us a  pragmatic

and competitive strategy in this Budget that will see through

the  remaking  and  survival  of Singapore  in  these  highly

volatile times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's Budget has been labelled "pro-individual".

It  has also been called  "pro-business".  Many agree that it

is  indeed a "balanced" Budget.  The need to enhance business

competitiveness in the country by reducing the cost of  doing

business  in  Singapore  is balanced off  by  mitigating  the

impact   of  the  associated  measures  on  the  economically

disadvantaged  consumers and businesses, as well  as  by  the

need to meet the concerns and aspirations of its citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noteworthy that the Finance Minister has actually,

after  taking into account relief packages, budgetted  for  a

small  deficit  of  $190  million.  For  a  country  used  to

enjoying surpluses in excess of $10 billion, this is symbolic

and  could be viewed as an indication of the resolve  of  the

Government to increase Singapore's competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although not an entirely painless budget for some, the

keywords used by the press



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>



to describe the Budget Statement were "bold and competitive."

There  has been applause from businesses, and even  Mr  Chiam

See  Tong from Potong Pasir has been positive in his response

to the press after the budget announcement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, the reactions of the men-in-the-street - the workers, the wage earners and the displaced

professionals,  executives and managers  -  have  yet  to  be

digested.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some Singaporeans, especially the middle-income

groups,  have  expressed their displeasure at  the  allotment

formula  used  in  the first distribution  of  the  Singapore

Shares.   This  time, the Government has heard their  voices,

and   has   made  the  necessary  adjustments  to  make   the

distribution of the Economic Restructuring Shares more widely

acceptable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, as the Finance Minister has put it, Singapore

has to make painful but necessary adjustments now so that  we

can   sharpen   our  competitive  edge  in  an   increasingly

unpredictable  world.  This year's Budget must be  understood

in this context.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Government has made these unavoidable

adjustments less painful, Singaporeans must fully accept  the

surgical  act when it comes, as otherwise the patient  cannot

recover.   Let  us  therefore take comfort in  the  assurance

given  by  Government that we are in their good and competent

hands,  that Singaporeans will be widely consulted  and  that

ramifications of any measures are clear.  As with  any  major

operation, life-supporting and life-saving equipment as  well

as contingency plans must be in good working order before the

surgical knife is delicately applied.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pronouncements in this year's Budget have all the

makings of a successful operation.  But until Singapore fully

recovers   from  the  operation,  ie,  the  remaking  of  our

economy,  external  global viruses and infections  can  still

attack us



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>



with   impunity,   often  without  warning.    I   urge   all

Singaporeans  to accept some of the painful adjustments  such

as the GST increase as a necessary vitamin pill to strengthen

our competitive immunity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know that a key fundamental that has helped

Singapore  make economic progress in these last 37 years  has

been  the  vigilant  and robust promotion of  wise  economic,

social  and political policies.  These policies have  brought

about   political   stability,  racial  harmony,   industrial

advancement and a secure livelihood for our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the farsighted and dynamic leadership of the

present  Government  and with the unanimous  support  of  the

people of Singapore, this little island with no resources has

made  quantum  progress  in  various  fields,  much  to   the

discomfort   of   our  Malaysian  neighbour.    I   am   sure

Singaporeans are proud to belong to a nation whose future  is

promising and a Government that has always come good  on  its

promises to the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, today, Singapore is operating in a very

competitive  business environment, but some  Singaporeans  do

not seem to grasp the momentous and dramatic changes going on

around  us.   Singapore faces increasingly fierce competition

from  China,  which today offers a haven for investors.   But

are  we  prepared  to  take  the  Chinese  on  in  terms   of

creativity, entrepreneurship, and sheer diligence?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even our much vaunted advantage over the Chinese in the

area  of  services  may now be under threat.   Prof.  Michael

Porter has recently pointed out that our nation needs to work

on  some of our competitive strengths, one of which is in the

area  of  services.  However, if we are not careful,  we  may

even lose this edge to China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a point of illustration, Sir, I had an opportunity

last month to attend the Assembly of the Asian Parliaments in

China.   Prior to this visit, my last visit to China was  two

and  a  half  years  ago.  I must say, the first  thing  that

struck me this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>



time  round was the tremendous change in the attitude of  the

Chinese people.  What I could literally feel was their hunger

for  knowledge, friendship and the desire to want  to  please

and  serve their foreign guests from both young and old,  men

and women alike.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the Chinese people, attending to the Assembly,

spoke  grammatically flawless English.  It seemed  as  though

they  had learnt  "by heart every phrase and choice of word,"

to  demonstrate  that I can do just as well, if  not  better.

They  even delivered their services beyond what was  normally

expected of them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, when you ask for the directions to the

washroom,  the service provider will walk you  all  the  way.

Such  is  the  kind of service excellence that  will  make  a

delightful service experience and provide the cutting edge in

the  competition.  The whole attitude displayed  was  one  of

eagerness to show their feats and their readiness to  embrace

foreign investors.  Customer savvyness  seems to become  more

and more an ingrained part of the Chinese psyche.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in remaking Singapore, our ultimate aim is to

thrive  and  prosper in this global competition.   Our  long-standing  principle  "to  make as few  enemies  but  as  many

friends as possible" is worth revisiting.  By this principle,

we  will  make more friends amongst men and nations, and  our

personal  and national prestige can be expected to grow.   No

doubt  the pedagogy of engaging Singaporeans from all sectors

of  our  society  in  this remaking  is  a  resounding  move.

Nonetheless, our policy makers and leadership must be able to

convince and win the hearts and minds of our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China's economic involvement will increase in this part

of the world.  It is to our advantage that we start preparing

our young for more involvement with China, as the majority of

our  students  still  betray very  scanty  knowledge  of  the

Chinese.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of our students have even expressed disbelief at

reports of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>



rapidity  with  which the Chinese people have  made  economic

progress.   What is even more disturbing is that some of  our

students  have shown a marked reluctance to monitor and  keep

up with developments in China.  To many of them, the world of

excitement and progress is still America and Europe.  I would

like  to propose that the Ministry of Education sets aside  a

budget  to  organise  more  subsidised  educational-cum-trade

missions   for  our  students  from  secondary  and  tertiary

institutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, such educational-cum-trade missions will provide a

melting pot into which distances, differences, prejudices and

even  self-interest  are integrated, mixed  and  brewed  into

mutual beneficial arrangements.  What I saw during this trip,

in  the world's largest dam construction of the Three Gorges,

will  amaze Singaporeans of the engineering prowess and  feat

of the Chinese civil engineers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dam site takes 17 years to construct. 28,000 people

involved  in  this project have been living in this  isolated

site  since 10 years ago and will continue to live there till

2009, the expected date of completion.   All these will be  a

reminder to Singaporeans that, at the end of the day, it is a

flexible, adaptable and enduring attitude that will make us a

winner, granted that all other qualities are a given.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also timely that a national customer service

programme  be  mounted to start inculcating service  attitude

and service skills in our students who are the future service

leaders  of  tomorrow.  Sir, it is not  enough  to  have  the

knowledge of the product.  That is going to be a given.   But

the service attitude and skills will make that difference  in

whether customers choose to patronise the business again  and

again.  In inculcating such values and attributes, we need to

start early.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my proposition for such a programme is premised on

practicality  and  what is much needed in the  real  business

world.   The  IT world has taken away too much of  the  human

touch and face to face encounter, and we need to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>



bring back these old but results-winning formula.  Again, the

Ministry of Education should seriously consider incorporating

such a programme into its syllabus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This programme is about "Hui Zhuo Ren, Hui Yong Ren", a

phrase  used by shipping tycoon, Li Ka Shing when asked  what

was  the secret of his success.  This phrase means, if we  do

it  right from here on the way to deal with people, we  would

have equipped ourselves with a powerful tool for survival.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no point remaking Singapore in all the 5Cs if we

cannot  recognise  that the fundamental C is  your  customer,

both  internal  and external, whom you must win  over.   When

that  happens,  then  all the Cs of cash,  condominium,  car,

credit  card, club will be yours with the wink of an eye  and

the smile of the lips.  Sir, we need to learn the finesse  of

winning  people in this competition, and we must  start  with

our students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have mentioned in the beginning that some have

felt  the  pain  of  this Budget.  I agree with  the  Finance

Minister's  sentiments that this is not a  give-away  but  an

encouragement  to help Singaporeans remake  themselves.   The

pro-business strategy of our Government all these  years  has

been  necessitated by our geographical size and fate and this

year's Budget continues to aim at attracting investments plus

global talents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shift to an indirect mode of taxation is in the

right direction.  The increase in the GST, which is meant  to

make  up for the loss in revenue as a result of the reduction

in  corporate  and  income taxes, is well  cushioned  by  the

offset  package  which  ranges to about  10  years  for  some

categories.   As  can be expected, there are Singaporeans  in

our midst who will be left out totally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hardest hit in this downturn is the cohort of

displaced professionals, executives and managers I label PEM.

Unlike the unskilled lower income and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>



older   workers  who  touch  at  the  heartstrings   of   the

Government,  PEMs do not do that well.  Many retrenched  PEMs

have  heavy  commitments incurred during  better  times,  eg,

mortgages, loans, children's educational expenses. Yet,  when

they  are out of work, they are not considered "poor  enough"

to  qualify for the offset measures spelt out for the  lower-income groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the same vein as Mr Iswaran who has treaded on the

subject  of  the ERS, I offer another perspective.   Some  of

these displaced PEMs reside in residential dwellings and,  as

such,  will  not  be eligible for the higher tranche  of  the

Economic  Restructuring Shares (ERS).   Therefore  using  the

criterion of housing type or value may penalise those in need

of  real  help.   To extend the argument, one may  say,  then

downgrade.   But,  Sir,  this may be painful  as  residential

property  prices  were much higher in the past  and  it  just

makes no economic sense to sell at a loss.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me turn to some other areas where further

strengthening of our social fabric can take place.  The  bulk

of  the  displaced PEMs, if they remain unemployed, will  not

gain  from any income tax deduction in 2003, whereas in 2002,

when they lost their jobs, they had to fork out their savings

to  pay tax for income earned in the year 2001.  The increase

in GST will be an additional burden compared to those who are

gainfully employed.  They need some financial assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I therefore humbly request that this group of

affected Singaporeans be helped in the transition, as they do

not  benefit from the tax-saving and road tax saving, and yet

they  have to meet additional expenses due to the higher GST,

transport  and  parking charges?  Will the  Finance  Minister

consider making an exception for displaced PEMs to enjoy  the

higher  tranche  of the ERS, if at the point  of  issue  they

still have not found employment, and not subject them to  the

criterion of housing type?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, taking care of the elderly and needy requires

sacrifices and resources.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>



With  GST  and other increases associated with ferrying  them

around,  people  who do not qualify for the  offset  measures

need  to  be  helped, especially when they  are  affected  by

difficult economic situations, such as unemployment  and  its

accompanying effect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget is silent on the assistance measures. I

would  like to urge the Government to consider the plight  of

people   who  have  to  take  care  of  the  less  fortunate,

especially  when they are handicapped or are  suffering  from

illnesses requiring regular treatments, and thereby having to

incur non-healthcare related expenses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the highly anticipated changes to the role of

Government-linked Companies (GLCs) were not mentioned in  the

Budget.   Generally,  the feeling of the small-time  business

players  is  that  they relish being courted  or  invited  to

participate  in  the business of the GLCs.  I recognise  that

this  should not be too great an issue if the SMEs can  prove

that  they  have value added contribution to  make.   No  one

begrudges  the  GLCs of their right to compete for  business,

especially in those areas that are their forte.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I continue to encourage and support Government private

joint   ventures  in  order  to  further  consolidate  social

construction  and  welfare services.  I  trust  hon.  Members

would  agree  that the hard work of our people and  the  wise

leadership  have  enabled resource scarce Singapore  to  grow

into  an  economically strong and prosperous nation within  a

short period of its independence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must therefore continue to nurture our national

capitalists through business opportunities and, at  the  same

time,  grow  the State coffers from the profits derived  from

the  GLCs.   These profits can be used to initiate programmes

to help  the aged and the handicapped.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming to the increase in parking charges, I fear

that the cost will go up for those who use their vehicles for

carrying out their work activities, eg, taxi drivers,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>



bus   operators,  heavy  vehicle  operators,   salesmen   and

technicians.   Unlike  those  who  use  their  vehicles   for

convenience and comfort, these vehicles are essential to  the

livelihood of these Singaporeans.  Is the increase on vehicle

usage  aimed  at those in the second category  or  the  first

category?   Should  we have a differential  in  the  rate  of

charges  for  the two categories in order to achieve  a  more

equitable imposition of such increases?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another concern arising from the increase in parking

charges  is  the issue of illegal parking in private  estates

near  to  HDB  estates.  Our successful  integration  of  HDB

dwellings  with  private  residential  estates  has  made  it

convenient for vehicle owners, including goods vehicles  from

HDB  estates,  to  park their vehicles in  these  residential

estates,  often  causing  inconvenience.   Will  the  Finance

Minister kindly look into some of these implementation issues

so as to minimise negative consequences?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to end here by saying that in this

time of great change and in the midst of the terrorist threat

and political instability in the Middle East, it is important

that Singapore continues to surge forward with both political

and   economic  strength.   The  Finance  Minister   deserves

appreciation from all in this House for presenting  a  Budget

which  pulls  no  punches in laying out a  strong  and  sound

launching  pad by which the economy will find the ballast  to

thrust us upwards into higher global reaches.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Mdm Halimah and Ms Irene Ng, I look forward to the

Finance  Minister's  pro-women policies in  order  that  more

Singapore women will be convinced to come forward to serve in

this august Chamber.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I join my colleagues in supporting this Budget.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  the new economic landscape created by a sea change over

the last few years warrants a new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>



budgeting  paradigm.   Budget  2002  manifests  this  as   it

represents   more  than  a  carefully  thought  revenue   and

expenditure plan with its broad policy and strategic thrusts.

Beyond  the  cyclical  measures and the short-term  budgetary

goodies, more importantly, the 2002 Budget embodies  two  key

tenets which I would like to highlight.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first tenet refers to an "under siege" Budget.

There  have  been criticisms aplenty about this  Government's

overly  cautious approach to budgeting.  The debates in  this

House  accompanying  last  year's second  set  of  off-Budget

measures amply illustrate this point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly, a journalist commented in a recent story

in  Streats  that  he  knows of no other government  that  is

planning to give hand-outs just after general elections,  and

in  the midst of a recession.  This remarkable ability to  do

so  stems  from  our  previous healthy budget  surpluses  and

prudent fiscal management.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, underlying this conservative budgetary approach is

what  critics have described as a siege mentality,  bordering

on  paranoia, a general reluctance to loosen up, to  being  a

tad  more  generous.  This is borne of fear that baser  human

instincts may take over and lead to the squander of  precious

resources,  like  the  prodigal son in  the  Bible.   Such  a

mindset, however unpopular, is nonetheless not completely  at

odds with the New Singapore we are trying to create.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we push ahead with giving our citizens more

economic,   social  and  political  space,  the   forces   of

globalisation   will  create  winners   and   losers.    This

Government needs to build up the resources to help the weaker

members  of  our  society  - the aged,  the  underclass,  the

physically  and  mentally challenged - who feel  increasingly

bewildered by the profound changes affecting us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economic base is being challenged by the rise of

China and India.  Around us



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>



too, there are also voices of suppressed anger and envy.   We

are  a little red dot, and a cat waiting to be skinned.  Sir,

we are indeed under siege.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the very small budget deficit of $190 million

after  implementing the proposed tax changes and  GST  offset

package  is  understandable.  A budget should not be  viewed,

like  in  some  quarters, as a well-conceived plan  to  spend

beyond  one's  means.   Our years of prudent  budgeting  have

given  us  fiscal surpluses that have enabled us to implement

off-Budget  measures,  including  immediate  significant  tax

cuts, without undermining our fiscal position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am very pleased that the tenor

of  this  Budget shows a sensible approach to  balancing  the

competing  claims  that  confront us  and  yet,  retains  the

prudence  of  past  budgets,  belying  our  siege  mentality.

Future budgets of this Government will undoubtedly follow the

spirit of this Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second key tenet I would like to highlight is one of

letting  winners  emerge.  Sir, this Budget  can  be  rightly

called  a  New Singapore Budget, a watershed Budget,  one  in

which  due  recognition  is given  to  the  markedly  changed

circumstances,  precipitated  by  the  onslaught  of   global

competition and heightened nationalism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, I am delighted to note that the Budget

represents  the  beginnings  of  a  sea  change  in  the  way

industrial policy is being pursued, from trying to  pick  and

groom winners, including GLCs, to creating an environment, an

ecosystem, in which winners can emerge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrowing an analogy from the stock market, the

efficient  market  hypothesis  postulates  that  one   cannot

perpetually outperform the market by intelligent stock picks.

Neither  can we do so for industrial sectors, no  matter  how

"sexy" they may be.  Hence, as Harvard academic Rosabeth Moss

Kanter recently remarked, it will be better not to place your

bets only on a few



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>



key  industries, but to cast the net wider and  bet  on  more

sectors, including the social services or people sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this is exactly the comment of a volunteer

social worker for autistic children whom I recently met.  She

observed that every time they organise a seminar or course on

autism, it is over-subscribed with many participants from the

region.   She  feels  that there is scope  for  Singapore  to

become  a  regional  hub  for  special  education,  and   the

Government  should also take a bet in this  sector,  and  not

just in mainstream education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget 2002, as my other parliamentary colleagues have

noted,  is clearly only one part of a very large jigsaw  that

is  still being put together to remake Singapore for the  new

uncertain  and volatile world.  It initiates the  process  of

restructuring  Singapore, but a lot more  work  needs  to  be

done.   There  are  some areas of concern  that  need  to  be

addressed  to  ensure that Singapore can play confidently  in

the  major league - share in the pie and not just pick up the

crumbs.  And I wish to highlight three.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the plight of the SMEs. Although the generous

income  and corporate tax rate cuts and group tax relief  are

welcomed by manufacturers, a frequent complaint has been that

this  Budget  does little to help SMEs faced  with  shrinking

markets,  high  costs  and domestic competition  from  multi-nationals and GLCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the oft-repeated refrain of what use is the

reduction  in corporate taxes if there is no profit  to  tax.

Worse   still,  the  shift  from  direct  taxes  to  indirect

consumption  and  usage-based  taxes  will  exacerbate  their

difficulties.   While consumers can turn to  the  GST  offset

package  and the economic restructuring shares, SMEs continue

to face daunting cost structures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I appreciate that Singapore's limitations will

always mean that we cannot compete with the low cost base  of

China or India and, hence, are at risk of more hollowing out.

While the policy of moving



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>



up  the  value chain and promoting entrepreneurial  start-ups

that could become the next Creative Technology is, I believe,

correct.   SMEs are also our constituents.  They  do  have  a

role  to  play  in  the economy and should  not  be  left  to

struggle on their own.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would thus like to echo the calls of the SMEs and urge

the  Government to undertake a comprehensive  review  of  all

Government  administered charges and levies and  reduce  them

where possible, so that operating costs could be kept as  low

as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst I have no quarrel with the view held by the

Senior  Minister of State for Trade and Industry, Mr  Tharman

Shanmugaratnam,  that  the  lasting  solution  for   economic

competitiveness   is   not   lower   costs,   but    stronger

capabilities,   streamlining  and   reducing   costs,   where

possible,  would  clearly  allow the  ship  to  be  run  more

tightly,  and  thus making it more profitable without  losing

its seaworthiness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should also be a thorough review of all Government

rules  and  regulations which affect  SMEs  with  a  view  to

rationalising  these  rules  and regulations  to  remove  any

barriers  to doing business.  Many businessmen have expressed

frustration over the labyrinth of rules and regulations  they

must negotiate.  More recently, for instance, Mr Simon Lim, a

Director at Wong San's pub in Mohamed Sultan Road was  quoted

in  the  press as saying that setting up a pub could  involve

"onerous"  applications to at least seven separate Government

agencies!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I support some of the ERC's recommendations on

taxes and incentives that would help SMEs.  These include the

broadening  of the Technopreneur Investment Incentive  to  an

Entrepreneur Investment Incentive to be made available  to  a

wider  group  of  entrepreneurs, and not just  the  high-tech

sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third concern relates to rationalising the role of

GLCs.   Again, there has been considerable debate  about  the

role of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>



GLCs in Singapore's economic development, and their "crowding

out"  effects.  Sir, it is recognised that GLCs, such as  SIA

and   PSA,   have  played  critical  roles  in  the  economic

development of Singapore.  Indeed, I have no doubt that  GLCs

will  continue  to  play  important  roles  in  the  economy,

specifically in areas where the private sector does not  have

the resources or the will to enter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I submit that, important as GLCs have been in the

past,  the  time has come for them to re-look  at  their  own

backyards.    Recapping   a   now  familiar   criticism,   an

unidentified businessman was quoted in the Straits Times, 4th

May  2002,  that there is a perception among many, even  till

now,  that GLCs have intruded into every profitable  business

there  is,  often  at  the  expense of  the  private  sector.

Sometimes,  the companies at risk are the SMEs  who  are,  at

times,  aggrieved  by the zeal of GLCs  in  their  quest  for

higher EVAs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The working out of a charter for Temasek Holdings to

spell out its mission and responsibilities, and make it clear

how  the  Government sees the role of the Temasek  stable  of

companies  in the Singapore economy is therefore  timely  and

welcomed.   It  is also heartening to note that the  Minister

for Finance has categorically stated that the Government will

divest or dilute its shareholdings in a controlled manner  in

GLCs  that  are  no  longer relevant  to  the  Government  or

Temasek's objectives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I am pleased to note that the ERC sub-committee headed by the Minister of State for Trade and

Industry and Foreign Affairs, Mr Raymond Lim, is working  out

a  set of guiding principles for Government's involvement  in

business.   This is to ensure that private sector  initiative

will  not be stifled by the pervasive role of GLCs with  deep

pockets  and abundance of scholarly talent, or even statutory

boards offering services to the public that are already being

offered  by private entities.  Instead, GLCs could facilitate

the internationalisation of SMEs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>



by working jointly with them on overseas projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that clarifying the role of GLCs would help

define   business   areas   where   GLCs   could   contribute

strategically  to  the  development of  the  economy  without

treading into areas where the private sector is fully capable

of handling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my third concern relates to helping stragglers

cope.   Even as the Government embarks in earnest to  put  in

place  changes  that  will  help  Singapore  survive  in   an

increasingly competitive and hostile environment,  there  are

many  in the marathon race that are straggling behind.  These

Singaporeans are bewildered and fearful, even feeling a sense

of  hopelessness  with the sea change that is  taking  place.

Some,  particularly the above 40s, who have found  themselves

unemployed  due  to restructuring exercises  are  frustrated.

What  use is a reduction in income tax as they are now unable

to earn any income?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, those who remain employed are now

worried  about how any change in the CPF system would  affect

them.   Many are also feeling indignant that the proposal  to

cut  employer's  CPF  contribution  for  those  above  40   - supposedly the prime years of a person's working life - is an

indictment of their economic worth.  Some are also  concerned

that  they may become redundant soon and lose their jobs.   I

therefore would like to urge the Government to continue to be

sensitive  to  the many Singaporeans, including professionals

and  other white-collar workers, who may feel left behind and

hopeless  as  a  result of the many changes  that  are  being

implemented or considered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am relieved, for instance, that the Minister for

Finance  has  taken pains to mention in his Budget  Statement

that  the  issues related to the CPF contribution  for  older

workers  and  allocation  amongst  the  different  uses   are

recognised  to  be  complex and sensitive.   He  has  assured

Singaporeans  that  any change will be done  very  carefully,

after full consultations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>



and  without causing disruptions either to CPF members or the

property market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would therefore like to urge the Government to

commit sufficient resources to consult and educate the public

and carefully consider the possible impact on individuals and

the   economy  before  slaughtering  any  scared  cow.    The

Government must avoid the temptation of finding "quick fixes"

for  problems which touch on the very fabric of  society,  as

just  like  surgery, a botched operation  could,  instead  of

curing the sickness, cause even more harm.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, I would also like to join the

choruses  of  my female parliamentarians here  regarding  the

medical  benefit  for  female civil servants.   Sir,  I  must

profess and say that I have a vested interest because if  you

are  a male MP, you are entitled to medical benefits for your

dependants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> No more!

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> No more. I am sorry. Then I do

not  have  a  vested interest.  I am pleading for the  female

civil servants whom I think deserve our plea.  In addition to

the  fact that they work full time and work as hard as  their

male counterparts, they also have to take on many other roles

as a wife and as a mother in many instances.  So I would also

like to join the plea of my female parliamentarians that  the

reasons  for  not  giving  medical benefit  to  female  civil

servants are getting murkier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget 2002 spells a brave new vision for the future

Singapore economy and takes the first few steps forward.  The

marathon,  or  more accurately the "ironman race",  has  also

just begun.  There is still a long distance to cover and many

obstacles to overcome.  The Government has clearly shown  its

resolve   and   set  the  tone  for  change,  including   the

willingness  to  slaughter what were  previously  thought  as

scared  cows in the tax system, such as the Group Tax Relief.

No doubt, more scared cows may have to be slaughtered, whilst

some others may have to be given



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>



a  strong  dose  of  medicine when the ERC and  the  Remaking

Singapore Committee submit their recommendations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, to restructure Singapore, so that it is able to

compete  effectively in the major league,  truly  requires  a

mindset  change  and  cooperation of  all  players  including

businesses,  Government and society.  Many other issues  have

to  be grappled with and carefully considered.  These include

CPF  issues, portable medical and retrenchment benefits, dual

citizenship   and  changing  attitudes  about   success   and

education.  The task to remake Singapore thus has  only  just

begun.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I support the Budget.

<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak in this debate on the

Budget  Statement.  After a series of speeches  by  my  three

female  colleagues,  I hope the House  will  welcome  a  male

voice.   My speech would not be long.  I will take  about  10

minutes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gist of my good friend and fellow parliamentary

colleague,  Mr Arthur Fong's speech is that, in a new  world,

we  are  living  with  new and sometimes tougher  challenges.

Hence,  we need a newer and stronger plane to fly us  through

the turbulence we are experiencing now and, more importantly,

to  last  the  longer journey ahead.  Mr Fong's speech  is  a

direct  reference  to the title of Finance Minister's  Budget

Speech "A Budget for a Different World".  This Budget  is  an

aberration  in more ways than one.  It is indeed a  different

world we are living in.  For starters, we are experiencing  a

hitherto high unemployment.  The experts in this field called

this structural unemployment.  But, Sir, call it by any other

name,  to the tens of thousands of unemployed, for months  on

end now, it is just as painful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two points I would like to highlight with regard

to  this  Budget.  Firstly, the changes to our tax  structure

introduced in this Budget.  When I was in university, I  read

with great interest that Singapore's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>



brand  of  politics  can  be  best described  as  "democratic

socialism".   Hence,  whenever I discuss Singapore's  success

with  foreign  counterparts,  I  feel  very  proud  to  be  a

Singaporean.  I am very proud to say that the PAP  Government

had  benefited the whole population.  Our people's lives  had

gotten richer over the years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our Government's policies had always been crafted

to  benefit  the  people on a bottom  up  the  social  strata

approach.   For  instance,  we allocated  a  huge  amount  of

resources  to the building of public housing and the  success

of  HDB  had ensured 90% of Singaporeans having a  roof  over

their heads.  We build schools with universal access to allow

all  our citizens, regardless of race, language, religion and

social class, the benefits of education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our system of rewards is based on meritocracy and it

does  not  matter who your father or mother is.   It  matters

equally  less what race and social class you belong to.   For

that,  Sir, I am very proud to be a Singaporean.  And because

I  am  proud to be a Singaporean and being also a  Member  of

Parliament, I feel that I would not be doing my duty if I  do

not echo the concerns of my fellow citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some wise alecks have labelled this Budget as a

"Reverse   Robin   Hood".   This  view,   unfortunately,   is

reverberating in many quarters of Singapore.  They  refer  to

the changes in the tax structure.  In particular, many are of

the  opinion that  lowering personal income tax and corporate

tax  will benefit only a small pool of the population.  Since

about 70% of Singaporeans do not pay personal income tax, the

reduction in personal income tax does not benefit them.   The

increase  in  GST, notwithstanding the offset  package,  they

argue, will hit them directly.  The GST is indirect in nature

and  is  consumption based; it is the 70% who would be  taxed

most.  Hence, the wise alecks argue that the shortfall in tax

revenue  collected as a result of the reduction  of  personal

income  tax  amounting to $1.3 billion is net  off  with  the

amount of $1.32 billion collected



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>



from GST.  Is this really reverse Robin Hood?  Is this really

the  Government  taking from the poor and,  in  the  process,

benefiting  the rich only and, in the midst of  it,  widening

the  income  gap, as mentioned earlier on by my parliamentary

colleague,  Ms Irene Ng?  If this is so, we have shifted  our

focus  in our policy.  If not, I rather believe that we  have

not.  How did this perception creep up, and is germinating?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me state here that I do not fully agree with

the  views represented by the general public.  The perception

however  is  very real on the ground.  Do we  put  our  heads

above  the cloud level ignoring the rumblings on the  ground,

stubbornly believing in the superiority of our views?  I feel

the changes introduced are significantly profound.  The shift

from direct to indirect taxation calls for greater individual

responsibility.  I feel that this is a fundamental change and

the   citizenry  should  be  given  more  time   to   prepare

themselves.  As a doctor, I have come across enough cases  to

come to the conclusion that individual responsibility is  not

very reliable.  Many times, I have made the correct diagnosis

and prescribed the right medicine for the full recovery of my

patients.   Yet, I see many repeat cases simply because  they

do  not  take  their  medicine.   The  increase  reliance  on

consumption-based  tax system might be a step  in  the  right

direction.  Many feel that this is a major change, yet  there

is not enough consultation and deliberation.  Herein, Sir,  I

feel  lies  the  problem.   Our population  is  getting  more

educated and informed.  They would like to be informed of big

changes, preferably well beforehand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is the objective to allow me to quote

Finance  Minister  Lee Hsien Loong, "bring to  Singapore  the

economic  activities  that  will  provide  Singaporeans  with

jobs".   Sir, I have no quarrels with that stated  objective,

except the point of using lower corporate and personal income

tax  to  attract foreign direct investment to  Singapore.   I

feel that the concomitant reduction of corporate tax and  the

increase  in  GST  have,  in total,  a  negative  bias.   The

attractiveness to foreign companies of the reduction in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>



corporate tax is very much negated by the increase in GST.  I

am  not  a businessman, but I do not think you need to  be  a

savvy  businessman to work this out.  When a company  invests

in  Singapore, the reduction in corporate tax is good to them

only if they are profitable.  But when a foreign company sets

up  shop  in Singapore, they pay the GST upfront,  even  when

they  are still starting to set up the shop.  Moreover,  they

might not have benefited from the reduction in corporate  tax

if their business is not profitable, while they still have to

pay indirect tax.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am highlighting these feedback so that we may

have,  to quote Mr Arthur Fong again, a better plane  with  a

stronger jet engine to take us higher and faster.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the Budget.

<br><br><!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih (Senior Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Matthias Yao Chih):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support

the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the 1960s, a Dutch bus company wanted to find a

more   scientific   way  of  recruiting  bus   drivers.    It

commissioned  a  study on what makes  a  bus  driver  a  good

driver.   At  first, most people thought that the  key  trait

should be quick reaction and sharp reflexes.  Well, that  was

not so.  As it turned out, the study showed that the best bus

drivers   were  the  ones  who  could  anticipate  the   road

conditions  early and adjust their driving well  before  they

entered the curves or the bumpy stretches on the road.   That

makes  a  lot  of sense.  A bus driver is not  a  racing  car

driver.   If  he drives the bus like a Formula One  car,  the

passengers  will have a scary and sometimes disastrous  ride.

A  good  bus driver is one who brings his passengers speedily

but  safely on their journey, while giving them as  smooth  a

ride as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In managing the economy, the Government must drive it

like  a  bus, not like a racing car.  That means anticipating

the  problems that may come well in advance, and making small

adjustments  before the problems hit us so that they  do  not

become a crisis.  This Budget is one such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>



move.   It  anticipates the tough economic  competition  that

lies ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, investors would set up companies where the

markets  were.  This was because transport was expensive  and

communication  was slow.  The businessmen and  the  factories

had  to be close to where the buyers were, to lower the  cost

of  delivery and shorten the reaction time to changing market

conditions.  Investments had to be spread over many countries

to  be  close  to  the customers in every region.   Singapore

benefited by being the gateway into South East Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, transport is cheap and communication is fast. It

does not cost much more to ship an item 5,000 km than 500 km.

Businessmen  can  be  in touch with the developments  in  any

major  market by cable television and Internet  even  as  the

events  unfold.   They can give instructions  by  e-mail  and

telephone  direct to the recipients almost  anywhere  in  the

world in an instant.  Investors no longer need to spread  out

their plants and offices to be close to their markets.   They

are more concerned over where they can get the best value for

their dollar.  And they can concentrate their investments  in

a  few  locations  around the world  to  derive  the  highest

benefit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, there are many more new places that are

attractive  for them to invest in.  The end of the  Cold  War

opened up the whole of Eastern Europe and the ex-Soviet Union

republics  to  Western  investment.   Ireland  adopted   pro-investment policies and made its economy attractive.   Mexico

joined  NAFTA  and  became an important supplier  to  the  US

market.   China  entered the WTO and will  be  the  focus  of

investor attention for many years to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The competition for investments is no longer regional,

but  global.   It is so much keener than just 15  years  ago.

The  world  does not, and will not, stay still  for  us.   To

attract investments, we must watch what others are doing  and

take the necessary steps to stay ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax changes are an important step in the right

direction.  But in our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>



discussions  with union leaders in NTUC, one question  stands

out  and this is the same as the one raised by Dr Chong  Weng

Chiew  a moment ago.  This Government has always been a Robin

Hood government, ie, it takes from the rich and gives to  the

poor.   So, why is it that this time the Government is taking

from  the  poor  by raising GST and giving  to  the  rich  by

lowering their income tax?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government is taking nothing from the poor.

The  GST is fully offset for lower income Singaporeans for  5

years  or  longer,  by  which time the  economy  should  have

recovered  sufficiently for wages to rise again.   But,  more

importantly,  if Robin Hood wants to rob the rich,  the  rich

must be there for him to rob.  I regret to report, Sir, Robin

Hood  cannot  rob  the  Sheriff of Nottingham  anymore.   The

Sheriff  has  relocated  to Hong Kong  because  of  the  more

conducive environment there.  And I heard that he is thinking

seriously about moving on to China next year!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that this Government will always be a Robin

Hood  at heart.  But to be always able to take something from

the  high-income individuals and companies  to  give  to  the

lower-income, they must want to remain here to work and to do

business  in  the first place.  We must do  what  we  can  to

encourage  them to come here and stay here, so  that  we  can

collect  a  little  bit of income tax  from  them  and,  more

importantly, so that they can create good jobs for  us.   The

tax changes will be effective in achieving this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Economist Intelligence Unit rated

Singapore  to  have  the best business environment  in  Asia,

overtaking Hong Kong for the first time, and the tax  changes

were cited as a key factor.  Singaporeans should view the new

tax  structure positively.  It will help our economy to  grow

in the long run.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another change that is being discussed is the CPF

system.  Sir, the public discussions are getting Singaporeans

worried.  They wonder how much of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>



contributions will be cut, and what new restrictions will  be

put in place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge Singaporeans to take a calm approach to this

discussion.   The time has come for us to take a  re-look  at

the  CPF  system.   As the population ages  and  as  we  live

longer, our retirement income will become an important issue.

The   projections  suggest  that  at  current   rates,   many

Singaporeans will not have enough savings to retire on.  This

needs  to  be corrected before it is too late.  The  question

is:  what should we do?  In making the review, I suggest that

we observe four working rules.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, focus firmly on the fundamental objectives of CPF

savings,   which  are  to  provide  for  retirement   income,

healthcare  and housing.  We need to make adequate provisions

for  each  of  these  needs and find  the  right  balance  of

allocation  among them.  Everything else should be secondary.

We  should  not eye CPF funds for other uses.  We should  not

use CPF as a macro-economic instrument to influence the money

supply   or  disposable  income.   We  should  make  a   firm

commitment never to dilute its basic aims.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, workers should have enough CPF savings but they

must  not be priced out of a job because of CPF.  Because  of

our  seniority-based wage system, employers  prefer  to  hire

younger  workers  compared to older ones.   Since  the  Asian

financial  crisis  in 1998, we have seen  many  instances  of

older  workers  not  being able to secure another  job  after

retrenchment.  If the CPF system needs to be adjusted to help

older  workers  find  and  keep  jobs,  we  should  study  it

seriously.  Remember that without a job, there is no  CPF  to

talk about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, while we may suggest ideal new systems to replace

the  current one, many Singaporeans are already locked in  by

the  present  system and practices.  Knowing what  the  ideal

system  should be and changing the present system to fit  the

proposals are two different things.  Workers use CPF  to  pay

for  their housing and medical care.  A complete overhaul  of

the  system, or any drastic changes to the rules, will  cause

hardship to ordinary workers and their families.  While we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>



should  range freely to capture all good ideas,  we  must  be

extremely careful in choosing what to implement and how to do

it.   Like  a good bus driver, we must not turn a corner  too

sharply  as  the  passengers will surely be flung  off  their

seats if we do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, give as much time as possible for Singaporeans

to  make  the  adjustments.  CPF is a  huge  subject.   Every

worker, every family in Singapore is affected.  We must  help

everyone  understand  and  prepare  for  the  changes.    The

Government gave almost 10 years between the original proposal

for GST and its implementation.  The Medisave system was also

given  much time for digestion before implementation.  I  ask

the Government to make haste slowly on the CPF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Budget kicks off many more changes to our

economic strategies and structures.  The Government  is  open

in finding new ideas and proposals.  I hope Singaporeans will

take  part in these discussions with a positive spirit.   The

outcome will be a set of changes that will put our economy on

a firmer footing to face our challenges ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise on a

point  of  clarification.  Too many people have talked  about

skinning  cats  in this House and I want to  remind  everyone

here  that  we are a civilized people.  We do not indulge  in

barbaric  acts  like that.  In fact, the Bill  to  amend  the

Animals  and Birds Act, which had its First Reading  a  month

ago,  provides  for increasing the fine and imprisonment  for

people  who indulge in cruelty to animals.  So I would advise

people  who persist in such barbaric acts to keep  away  from

Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, since the delivery of the Budget Speech by  the

Deputy  Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lee Hsien  Loong,

many discussion sessions have been conducted, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>



I  have  participated  in  a  number  of  them.   From  these

discussions,  a few issues kept popping up.  Let  me  reflect

five of these issues concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Budget Statement, DPM Lee said our highest

priority is to create good jobs for Singaporeans.  To do this

we  must continue to attract companies and talent to come  to

Singapore  and help our economy to grow.  This  statement  is

very  reassuring  to  the workers.  Many  workers  and  union

leaders have asked how the ordinary workers will benefit from

the  tax changes.  The link between tax cuts and job creation

cannot be seen immediately, but we all know that the link  is

there.   Tax cuts attract investments and investments  create

jobs.   This is the message that union leaders shall continue

to  convey  to our workers.  Some people are sceptical  about

how  the  tax cuts work.  Let us look at a concrete  example.

Within  two weeks of the announcement by the Economic  Review

Committee  recommending cuts in corporate  tax  and  personal

income tax, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) published a

survey  that Singapore had overtaken Hong Kong as the economy

offering the best business environment in Asia.  The EIU said

that  the  proposal  to  cut taxes was  the  key  reason  why

Singapore had topped the survey.  We are on the right track.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newspaper reported last week that our biomedical hub

will  generate  at  least  4,000  jobs.   That  is  certainly

encouraging  news but there are some questions asked  by  our

workers.  Apart from this, with the new tax regime, how  many

jobs can we create down the road?  What jobs are these and in

what sectors?  How soon can we expect these jobs to come?  We

hope  the  Government can give us more good  news.   Can  the

Government   give  us  some  projections?    We   know   that

projections are projections.  They are tentative.  But,  with

more accurate projections we will able to guide and encourage

people  to  upgrade their skills in the relevant fields,  and

have  better  chances  of  getting better  jobs  in  the  new

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reducing corporate tax does not mean reducing corporate

responsibility.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>



Mr  Deputy Speaker, Sir, the reduction in corporate tax  will

certainly  be  welcomed by the business community.   It  will

alleviate  the tax burden on the companies and improve  their

bottom-line.   As  a labour MP I urge the companies  to  take

advantage of the tax changes by taking more risks and seeking

new markets so that their business can grow and more jobs can

be created for workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They should also realise that reduction in corporate tax

does  not  mean reduction in corporate responsibility.   What

are  these responsibilities?  Let me broadly highlight  three

messages   to   the  business.   First,  treat   workers   as

stakeholders.  From time to time we hear of horror stories  - employers    retrenching   workers   without    compensation,

retrenchments disguised as dismissals or terminations to save

on  retrenchment benefits.  Such cases, if proven to be true,

must  be  deplored.   Companies have an obligation  to  their

shareholders  to  improve on their returns.   But  they  must

acknowledge that there are other stakeholders too, and  these

include  the  workers too.  With improved earnings  resulting

from lower corporate tax,  I urge companies to invest more on

workers'  training and spend more to enhance  their  welfare.

Do not forget that all members of the staff are entitled to a

share in the fruit of the company's success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, responsibility towards customers. I have been

involved  with CASE for two years and I have personally  come

across   many  cases  of  business  malpractice.   A   common

complaint is a lack of transparency.  Consumers are often not

well-informed of price change or they are caught by the  fine

print.  I believe that the business approach can be a win-win

situation.   There  can  be improvements  to  their  earnings

without  compromising the interest of  their  customers.   In

today's  newspapers,  it is reported that  the  DBS  Bank  is

making  their credit card terms reader-friendly.  That  is  a

good example.  Other companies should do likewise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, responsibility towards the community. A

company cannot be completely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>



isolated  from  the  public  and  the  community  at   large.

Perhaps, companies that are performing well can channel  part

of  their  improved  earnings  to  community  and  charitable

projects.   Such an act of charity will send a strong  signal

that  it is sharing its successes with the community and that

it is a good corporate citizen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Government has introduced a

comprehensive  package to offset the impact of  the  proposed

GST  increase.   In particular, I am glad that  DPM  Lee  has

given  a  strong reassurance that low-income households  will

not  be  worse  off.   I want to highlight three  GST-related

issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I urge the Government to monitor the impact of

the GST when it is implemented next year to make sure that it

will  not  lead  to  inflation.   Secondly,  I  commend   the

Government for making much efforts to explain the reasons  of

the  tax  changes.   I  am impressed by  three  things:   the

brochures  in  different  languages  to  reach  out  to   all

Singaporeans, the use of cartoons to convey the key  messages

and  the  on-line calculator which Singaporeans  can  use  to

compute  how  much   benefit they can  get  from  the  offset

package.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Government can do more to dispel common

misconceptions such as:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) GST is compounded and the end-customer pays more

than 5%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Increased GST will discourage consumers from

spending   and   the  retail  sector  will  be   hurt.   More

Singaporeans  will  shop in neighbouring  countries  and  our

neighbours will benefit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On our part, as a labour movement, the NTUC News

published an article last week using the example of  a  shirt

to  illustrate that GST is not compounded and would not  lead

to   price  increase.   The  Government  can  consider  doing

likewise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, are there any particular group of people who

are  not  adequately covered by the GST offset package?   All

along, the Government has been using examples of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>



typical families to illustrate the extent of GST package. How

about those single-parent families or retirees who are living

alone?  Could we do more to help them?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the Budget speech, DPM Lee

said  that Government expenditure in the economic development

sector  would continue to emphasise on workers' training  and

upgrading.  He stressed that the Government would  not  stint

in  its  support for workers to upgrade themselves.  This  is

very  important.  Our efforts to train workers must keep pace

with  economic  restructuring.  It is time for  our  training

drive  to go into turbo charge.  We have all along relied  on

incentives  and  subsidies.  But if these  incentives  cannot

achieve  the  desired result, should we not push workers  and

employers  harder?   Workers  are  increasingly  seeing   the

importance of training but can we do more to get employers to

come  on  board?   Can Government identify  certain  specific

industries  and  areas to channel our training  efforts?   We

know generally where the growth areas are, such as biomedical

and  ship building.  If more specific industries and  numbers

can  be  provided,  we will have clearer objectives  to  move

towards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the world has changed and

changed  rapidly.  International competition is getting  more

intense.   The future challenges are getting more severe  and

the  current times are unsettling.  What are the main  causes

of  uncertainty?  I can identify three sources of discomfort.

The  first  source is employment-related issues.   There  are

discussions on employability of older workers and changes  in

the CPF can be disenchanting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second source of worry is the uncertain external

environment,  particularly the competition we face  from  our

neighbours and the unresolved issues we have with them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third source is the likelihood of lifestyle changes

that  we  may  have to make. Can we continue to maintain  our

high  standard  of living as we used to enjoy?   In  such  an

uncertain environment, it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>



important  for  the  Government to give our  people  a  clear

reassurance, just like what DPM Lee has done when he gave the

assurances  that the Government's top priority is  to  create

jobs  and the low-income families will not be worse off after

the GST increase.  We have to continue to reassure them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, after MediaCorp actor, Pierre

Png gave part of his liver to Andrea De Cruz, I was told that

many  wives  and  girlfriends had been asking their  partners

whether  they  would do the same thing if  the  same  tragedy

happens  to them.  The New Paper reported yesterday  that  it

asked  50 single Singaporeans whether they would donate their

organs  to  their  partners and 33 said,  "Yes!".   Unmarried

partners  may be able to say no, but for husbands,  there  is

only  one correct answer to your wives - "Yes!".  This answer

alone  is a reassurance of  love for your better half, and  I

am  sure  that it is something that many wives would want  to

hear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although our Government does not have any liver to

donate,  I am sure  it has a big caring heart. The Government

should  reaffirm and say to its citizens that  "we  have  the

interest of all Singaporeans at heart and we will continue to

enhance  the  social  safety  net".   Such  a  statement  and

commitment would be a reassurance that Government  cares  and

no  matter  how  many times it has been said, no  matter  how

difficult our circumstances, we will make sure that our heart

is  always warm, and the people will not be tired of  hearing

it.   I hope that the Government will make such assurance  of

love,  especially when we have to face the challenges  ahead,

we  must  have  a  government with the people's  benefits  at

heart.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, to restructure the economy, Singapore obviously

needs  to  have a more equitable direct and indirect taxation

system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget goes someway to address this issue and the

DPM and Minister for Finance has been, and should be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>



applauded for providing a comprehensive analysis of  how  the

tax  structure should be revised.  I generally agree with the

Budget.   I  only  have  a few points to  make,  mainly  from

feedback  received,  I realise that Members  before  me  have

raised some of the points already, so I shall attempt  to  be

brief.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the comment is that: is this the right time to

introduce  the restructuring?  Some see the restructuring  of

course  as leading to a more equitable system.  However,  for

the  majority of Singaporeans who do not pay income tax, they

only  see the increase in indirect taxes as making them  even

poorer  and the reduction in direct taxes as benefiting  only

the  better off.  Must the changes therefore come at  a  time

when  almost  everyone is facing economic  problems  such  as

unemployment, retrenchment, pay reduction or pay freezes?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, following from that, has the Budget adequately

addressed the high cost for individuals and businesses?   For

the  individual,  the  tax  burden  will  increase  with  the

increase  of  GST  next  year.   The  increase  in  GST  will

definitely bring higher bills for essentials, such  as  food,

utilities  and transport. We can only hope that the  increase

in  GST  will  not result also in a reduction in consumption,

which will always affect our economic recovery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly worried for those who are still

unemployed.  As it is, I believe all in this House have  seen

the hardship faced by many jobless.  Even at today's prices - mountains of bills to pay - many have had their power  supply

cut  off at one time or another, many could not afford to pay

for  even the basic necessities, and there seems to be no end

in sight.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many families have been affected. So the question is:

will  the  offset  package be enough?  All  in  all,  is  the

Minister  confident that the offset for GST  has  taken  into

account, for example, the potential increases that are likely

to be brought



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>



about  by  increases in fuel cost?  Can we expect  more  off-Budget  measures to tackle the problems that the increase  in

consumption  taxes would bring?  The Minister  has  mentioned

that  where the offsets are not enough to cover the  increase

in  GST, such families could appeal to the CCCs.  Sir,  I  am

afraid  that if the current trend in unemployment  continues,

the  CCCs  will be snowed under with this burden and  I  hope

that sufficient resources for this purpose will come from the

Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also disappointed that while we recognise that in

Singapore, we have an increasing number of older workers,  we

seem  not to have provided sufficient incentives to encourage

companies   to   retain  or  re-employ  them.    Even   small

industries,  such  as the garment industry,  are  outsourcing

their  work  to neighbouring countries where labour  is  much

cheaper.   There  is no incentive for them to employ  workers

here even when such workers are available, ready and willing.

Many of them have come to tell us, "give us some work and  we

will  prove  ourselves".  Should we not consider some  fiscal

incentives  to  encourage  companies  to  employ  Singaporean

workers  even  in  those non high-tech industries  so  as  to

absorb this growing group of workers who are in their mid-40s

or  50s?   We need fiscal measures to encourage companies  to

employ   these  older  workers,  preferably  without  adverse

consequences to their CPF.  I believe that the over-40s still

need their CPF, even though they may not have as much to  pay

off as the younger ones, but they would still need to provide

for their retirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, is the Budget helpful to small businesses?

Another  growing  perception is  that  this  Budget  did  not

provide  much  good news for the small businessmen  who  have

been  facing the twin mishaps of poor business and increasing

cost.  There is every probability that with fuel prices going

up, business cost will increase.  The small businesses in the

sectors,  such  as manufacturing, retailing or  non-financial

services,  see no great tangible benefits from  this  Budget.

Many of the companies are striving to stay afloat, so a cut



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>



in  corporate taxation, as many of my colleagues had  earlier

mentioned, is irrelevant because they have no profits to  pay

tax on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, they face increasing competition with

neighbouring countries and if costs in Singapore rise all the

time,  the  degree  of  competitiveness must  correspondingly

reduce.   One example I have been told about is that  freight

costs, for instance, have already risen by 10% recently,  and

GST has not been increased yet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for those in the retail business, we have also been

telling  Singaporeans to shop in Singapore and support  them.

But,  in reality, can we blame Singaporeans from going across

the  Causeway if the Singapore dollar stretches much  further

than  it  does  here?   So,  all in  all,  small  businesses,

particularly those in the retail trade, see that  the  Budget

does not really help them that much.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, from the consumers' point of view and from the

HDB residents' point of view, many have made the comment that

this Budget is a give-and-take budget.  What is given by  one

hand  is taken away by the other.  And the illustration  that

we  have  of this is the way in which we have been  adjusting

taxes on cars.  True, of course, there are reductions in  the

ARF,  road taxes and other direct taxes, but these reductions

are  unlikely to be felt, with the increase in petrol prices,

COE, ERP and HDB car park fees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, car owners are already paying substantial

taxes to buy a car and maintain them.  And the taxes that are

collected  amount to billions of dollars.  Also, if  we  just

look  at the additional 5,000 COEs to be issued, and if  each

COE  is  worth  about $30,000, it would generate  about  $150

million.   One suggestion is that Government should use  this

revenue to offset some of these increases in the building and

maintenance of car parks until such time as the economy picks

up.  So, will the Government consider postponing the rise  in

car  park charges till a later date when the economy is in  a

more robust condition?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I have to confess that I withdrew my

wish  list  after listening to the one proposed by  the  hon.

Member for Ang Mo Kio, Mr Inderjit Singh.  My wishes pale  by

comparison,  and I do not think that I can come up  with  the

bold  ones  that  he had proposed.  But in listening  to  the

female  colleagues of this House, I cannot  but  find  myself

compelled to support the call to review medical benefits  for

female  civil  servants.  And I hope they will not  think  it

presumptuous of me to do so and would welcome support,  I  am

sure, from their male counterparts as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that in mind, Sir, may I say that although this

Budget  presented so well by the DPM and Minister for Finance

should  also  perhaps pay attention to those individuals  and

businessmen that remain mired in the throes of the recession.

Let  us  hope  that these concerns will be addressed  at  the

earliest opportunity should the need arise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Budget, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy

Speaker, for allowing me to participate in this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say, at the outset, that I thought that

the presentation of the Budget by the Finance Minister was an

extremely good presentation, and that it is a Budget which is

deserving of praise.  I do not think it is necessary  for  me

to highlight all the good points about it, because so many of

my  colleagues in this Chamber have done so before  me.   So,

what  I intend to do is just to raise three areas in which  I

have specific comments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is, of course, my concern that it does not

sufficiently address the needs of the SMEs.  For that, I  had

prepared  a  segment, but here I want to  thank  Mr  Inderjit

Singh  for  saying some of the things which I had  considered

and  many  more things which I had not, and I would  like  to

endorse what he has said and fully support that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is on the GST offset. I understand the

need for the offset.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>



Government  financial  policy is not  like  Newton's  law  of

gravity.  It is not a situation where what goes up must  come

down.   When  you are trying to balance a budget, clearly  if

something comes down, something else must go up, and I  think

we  fully understand the need for it.  The only thing  though

about  the  GST offset is that it is, in its very  nature,  a

short-term  solution.  It does not address the problem  which

is  really  the  employability of older  workers,  especially

those  who have a lower level of education.  I have heard  it

said  in  this House that, ultimately, we hope that with  the

restructuring  and with the financial and fiscal  incentives,

in  due  course, the economy will recover and there  will  be

jobs.  This is true, but the way we are trying to restructure

our  economy  is to attract the high value-added  industries.

And for the older workers with lower levels of education,  it

will   still  be  extremely  difficult  for  them   to   find

employment.   So,  as  far  as  this  segment  of  people  is

concerned,  the  GST  offset is a  short-term  solution  but,

ultimately, we have to find a way to make them employable and

keep  them  employable.  In that respect,  I  was  encouraged

somewhat by hearing the Minister for Manpower talk about  the

skills  upgrading programme and the amount of money  that  we

spend  on that.  This is something which I think needs to  be

taken further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing, of course, is to change the employers'

mindsets.  I am not sure that subsidies alone will  do  that,

but it is a mindset change that employers have to go through.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, to identify certain types of industries where

these older workers would be more suitable to participate in.

But,  clearly, we have to do something in that regard.   That

was my second point on GST offset.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is on the falling birth rates. Financial

policy  is wonderful if we are planning to build the economy,

we  are  planning  for the future.  Of  course,  if  we  have

falling birth rates, there may not be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>



many  Singaporeans left by that time to enjoy the  fruits  of

what we are planning now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had noticed that in the Budget Statement, no specific

things  were put in the Budget to address this concern.   The

Prime Minister, at the opening of Parliament, had very kindly

responded  to  my plea for housing for singles  and,  in  the

course  of addressing that, he said that the greater  problem

was the falling birth rates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our birth rate in 1988 was 1.96. It has been on the

downward trend since then.  In 1999, it was 1.48; in 2000, it

was  1.59; and in 2001, it was an all-time low of 1.42.   And

we have to ask ourselves why this is the case.  Partly, it is

a  personal  decision.  But, partly, I think  it  is  also  a

result of the somewhat incoherent policy that we have had  in

trying  to  encourage the birth rates to go up,  and  I  will

explain exactly why I say our policy has been incoherent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two groups of people we have to look at when

we  are looking at falling birth rates.  One is the group  of

people  who  choose not to get married at  all.   The  second

group  is  those  who  are married but  choose  not  to  have

children.  And we must never confuse the two groups,  because

their reasons are quite different.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will take the second group first, which is married

couples.   When dealing with married couples and  encouraging

them  to  have children, the problem with our policy is  that

the  measures  so  far  have  been essentially  financial  or

fiscal.   We  have treated what is, by its nature,  a  social

problem as if it is an economic one, and that is why we  have

not  been  successful.  Because Singapore, as a  country,  is

excellent  at  economic policy.  We are very good  at  fiscal

measures.  And over the years, we have restructured, managed,

boosted,   designed,  tweaked,  pruned  our   economy   using

financial and tax incentives.  We have pioneer tax status, we

have  ERP,  we  have car ownership, and somewhere  along  the

line,  we  have  come  to believe that Singaporeans  have  an

almost pavlovian response to cash stimuli.  We put a monetary

incentive and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>



Singaporeans will react.  That is fine when, ultimately,  the

end  objective is profit.  They will react in that way.   But

when  the  end  objective  is  a  social  thing  like  having

children, then money has very little to do with it.   And  if

we want to address the problem, we have to ask ourselves what

are  the  things that people actually think about  when  they

decide whether or not to have children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various reasons. One, they look to see

whether  or  not they are ready, because having babies  is  a

heavy  responsibility.  And, increasingly,  we  find  amongst

young couples that they actually want to spend some time with

each other first before they actually have children, and that

is  why  they  put  off the decision to  have  children.   Of

course,  if  they wait too long, they could run into  medical

problems, but that is another area altogether which I do  not

intend to touch on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it is whether they can manage their work

commitments  if they have a child.  This is perhaps  less  so

for  men who are expected to be the breadwinner.  But I think

we  constantly underestimate the desire of women to  actually

continue working even if they have children.  So we  have  to

take this into account if we want women to have children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing that they take into account also is time

and  stress.  The pressures and demands of work in  Singapore

are  enormous.  This pressure has been exacerbated by the use

of  information technology.  Generally speaking, Singaporeans

have  very little rest.  We cannot escape, because  there  is

SMS,  there is e-mail and there are all sorts of things.   We

just  cannot  switch off, and work follows us  everywhere   - back home, to the office, in our car, when we are on holiday,

work  comes  with  us.  And with all this kind  of  pressure,

people  are so busy just trying to live their own lives,  let

alone  think  about  having children  and  worry  about  that

additional responsibility.  These are the three main factors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing about our policy regarding financial

incentives to have children is that it has a very off-putting

effect to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>



Singaporeans.  It is off-putting because many  of  them  feel

that when we do this, it is as though I give you money, I pop

it  in  and  out  comes  a baby.  They  are  not  baby-making

machines.   It does not work that way.  It is not correct  to

think  that  financial or fiscal measures  will  address  the

problem.  So then, what will?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I applied some thought to this. I certainly do not have

all  the  solutions, but there are a couple of ideas which  I

think may help.  One is a more coherent approach towards  the

issue of maternity leave.  There are currently two pieces  of

legislation  on  maternity  leave.   First,  there   is   the

Employment  Act  which provides for two months  of  maternity

leave  for employees who are covered by the Act.  I  have  no

issue  with  two months of leave.  But when you look  at  the

Employment Act, the provision was enacted at a time  when  it

was  a stop-at-two policy.  So that allows for paid maternity

leave  for  the first and second child, and it  provides  for

protection against termination of employment during a woman's

maternity leave for first and second child only.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then somewhere along the line, we decided that having a

third   child  will  be  good.   So  we  have  the   Children

Development Co-Savings Act.  What that Act does  is  that  it

allows  for  paid maternity leave for a third  child  and  it

imports  the provision of the Employment Act.  So it provides

for  protection  against termination of  employment  for  the

third  child.  The thing is that the Employment Act does  not

cover  professionals, executives, managerial or  confidential

staff.   That  means   women  professionals,  executives  and

secretaries are excluded.  They do not have the protection of

paid maternity leave.  I know in the market many employers do

follow the Employment Act, but it is not compulsory for  them

to do so for the non-Employment Act group of women workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads to a very inconsistent situation because for

Employment  Act  women,  first  and  second  child,   it   is

protected  in  the sense that a woman cannot  get  terminated

when she is on paid maternity leave.  And for all women under

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>



Children  Development Co-Savings Act, they get paid maternity

leave.   But for women executives, for their first and second

child,  they are not protected, because legislation does  not

provide  that they have maternity leave there, and  certainly

not  for the fourth, fifth, sixth child.  So we have got this

very incoherent policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing about maternity leave is that it is not

supposed  to  be regulating the number of babies  one  churns

out.   The thing about maternity leave is that at the end  of

nine  months  of  carrying a child  -  mind you,  I  have  no

personal experience, but I have it on good authority that  it

is  very tiring  -  the woman needs some rest, and she  needs

some time with the child to bond, and that is the purpose  of

maternity  leave.  The trouble is that we use paid  maternity

leave  as  a  means to regulate the number of babies  that  a

woman  has,  but that misses the purpose altogether.   And  I

think  if our target is to encourage more women professionals

to have babies, this is an area that needs to be looked at.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing I should mention is that maternity leave

should be across the board, not just for first, second, third

child, but for any child, and it should also be for unmarried

mothers.  I know that, as a matter of policy, we do not  wish

to  encourage  people to have children outside  of  marriage.

That is true, but mistakes do happen.  These things do happen

and  we  cannot ignore it.  And if the purpose ultimately  at

the  end  of the day is to allow a mother some time to  rest,

allow  her  some time with her child, then I think we  should

have maternity leave for this group of people too.  I do  not

think  if  we had paid maternity leave for unmarried mothers,

that  it  would  suddenly result in a rash of  children  born

outside  of wedlock.  Because I think the societal  pressures

are  still  strong enough that people would  prefer  to  have

children  within marriage and not outside.  So  that  is  the

first thing that would help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing is greater childcare facilities. What

is the one thing that will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>



make  a woman want to have more children?  If she has a child

and  she  wants to work, the thing that would really help  is

her  feeling that the child is looked after while she  is  at

work.   There  are many mothers who choose to give  up  their

jobs.   That is not a problem.  If they are happy to do that,

that  is  okay.   They  stay at home  and  look  after  their

children.   But  like  I  said, we have  under-estimated  the

desire of many Singapore women to want to work.  If we  force

them  to  choose  between having a child  and  maintaining  a

career,  they  may  very well choose  the  latter,  and  that

results  in  a falling birth rate.  So something  that  would

help  them  is  better  childcare  facilities.   And  knowing

Singapore parents, it is not just childcare facilities  where

they  can just drop their children, and that is it.  It would

have to be childcare facilities that are good in terms of the

people  who  look after the children, the kind  of  not  only

teaching but care that they can give their children, and also

the  age at which they look after the children.  Because now,

most childcare centres would be happy to take them in at  two

years  old, some may be at 18 months, but certainly not  many

that I know of that would take them in at perhaps six months.

In  the Scandinavian countries, I think they do take them  on

from six months onwards.  So if we want to increase the birth

rate, that is something that has to be looked at.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the first category of people - the married

couples.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the group of singles who do not want to

get  married.  And we have to ask ourselves why this  is  the

case.  At the Opening of Parliament, in his speech, the Prime

Minister identified the two groups where there seem to be the

largest  problem.   For single men, it was  those  that  have

secondary  school level education and below.  And for  single

women, the largest proportion of the unmarried women was  the

graduates.  What this suggests is that non-graduate women are

marrying  either graduate men or non-graduate men.   So  they

have a larger pool to select from.  And for the graduate men,

it also suggests that they are marrying either graduate women

or non-graduate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>



women.  So they also have a larger pool to select from.   And

that  is  why we have the two ends, which is the non-graduate

men with secondary education and below and, of course, at the

other end of the spectrum, graduate women.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the reasons why these two groups tend to remain

single  are  different.  For the men in the  lower  education

group, I think it is more difficult for them to marry someone

with a much higher education qualification.  And if the women

with  the  same or similar education qualification with  them

are  marrying  upwards, so to speak, that  leaves  them  with

little  choice  but  to look outwards  and  perhaps  to  non-Singapore  women.  But if they do that, they run  smack  into

the  SIR.  Because during my meet-the-people sessions, I have

many  men  who come to me to ask for PRs or citizenships  for

their  wives,  or they have difficulty getting permission  to

marry  in some cases.  I fully understand that we need to  be

very  cautious in terms of immigration policy because we have

to be quite careful about where our society is going.  But if

we  do  want  to look after the needs of this group,  then  I

think  we  do  have to examine the criterion for  immigration

policy afresh and see whether there is a way in which we  can

strike  some  balance so that at least for this  group,  they

will  have  a  certain measure of access, shall  we  say,  to

spouses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the single women, it is quite different. Although

it has been put as the largest group being graduate women,  I

think the "true" group is actually career women, not so  much

graduate  women, because we can have non-graduate  women  who

are  also career women.  What has happened, I think, is  over

the years, there has been a change in gender expectations  of

one another which has led to this current situation.  For the

men,  they  have  not really had to change their  own  roles.

Forty years ago, a man was seen as a breadwinner, a protector

and  a  provider,  and today he still sees  himself  in  that

light.   There  is absolutely nothing wrong with  that.   For

women,  40  years  ago,  they may not necessarily  have  seen

themselves  as  career women.  What has happened  in  the  40

years is that they have actually



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>



come  a  long way.  We have education, and because we have  a

meritocratic system, we have been able to advance in terms of

careers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So a lot of changes have happened in women's life over

the  last  40  years and their perception of  themselves  has

changed,  and  the perception of the role that men  play  has

changed as well.  For women, they see the men today less as a

protector  and  a provider, although I think many  still  do.

But many see them as a person whom they can look to for their

emotional  or intellectual needs.  By this, what  I  mean  is

that in the past, many women would have married for financial

security.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, because they can actually earn for themselves,

this  is  not  the reason to marry anymore.   They  have  the

option of not marrying, which means that they do not look for

a  man  for  financial security.  They look to him and  would

consider  marrying him only if he meets their  emotional  and

intellectual needs.  And I am not sure that this problem  has

been  sufficiently identified or realised because the way  we

treat the problem is one of, "Oh, well, you know, maybe  they

are  not  meeting one another enough.  Maybe they don't  have

opportunities for interaction."  So I asked a friend of mine,

who is single, after the Prime Minister's speech, and I said,

"Well,  you know, you think it would help if you get to  meet

more  men?"  And she looked at me with a slightly incredulous

expression  and said, "What will I talk to him  about?"   She

obviously had this difficulty.  So that is actually the  real

area of the problem.  And if it is something that we want  to

address,  then this is what we should be looking at,  not  so

much of fiscal measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role that SDU and SDS play in helping people to

meet, I am sure, is helpful, but it does not actually address

the  crux of the problem.  Just a brief word on the  role  of

SDU  and  SDS.   I  am  not  sure that  the  public  actually

appreciates the distinction of one organisation for graduates

and  another for non-graduates.  Because what we are actually

doing is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>



sending  out a message that there are two classes of society.

Singaporeans have been born and bred to believe that we are a

meritocratic system and, in many respects, we are  equal  and

there are equal opportunities for all.  Certainly, there  are

many  graduate  women  I know of who do  not  appreciate  the

distinction,  and  they automatically switch  off  when  they

receive  something from SDU.   This is not to  denigrate  the

efforts  of  SDU whose officers work extremely hard  and  are

very  diligent.   I  know because when  I  became  an  MP,  I

received  a packet on dating tips which I have not  yet  made

use  of.   But they do work very hard.  But they are fighting

against something which is not within their control.   So  if

we  do  wish  to  address the problem,  I  think  maybe  this

distinction  between  graduates and non-graduates  should  be

done  away with.  And we should see Singaporeans as a  whole,

as equal people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is a tax reform

Budget.   The  Government intends to offset the reduction  in

direct  tax revenue by increasing the Goods and Services  Tax

(GST).  The  reason  for reducing the  corporate  tax  is  to

attract more investments, retain the present investments  and

create  more job opportunities for our people.  At  the  same

time, we are reducing the personal income tax to attract more

foreign  talents  to  come  to  Singapore  and  to  encourage

Singaporeans  to  be more enterprising.  If this  policy  can

attain  the above objectives, then there is no reason why  we

should not support it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, having heard the Budget Statement by the Deputy

Prime  Minister and Finance Minister, I do have a  number  of

doubts.   We reduce the corporate tax by 2.5% and then  raise

the GST by 2%.  This would only benefit those companies which

are  making  substantial amount of profits.  If  you  have  a

product  for  sale,  take  away  the  production  cost,   the

overheads



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>



and  other  costs, your profit margin is 45% and  above,  you

will  benefit from this scheme.  If the profit margin is less

than 45%, the company would be worse off.  Three years later,

when  the  corporate tax is further reduced to 20%, you  will

benefit if your profit margin is 35% and above.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the MNCs, most, if not all, small and medium

enterprises  (SMEs) in Singapore do not have a profit  margin

as  high  as 35%, not to mention 45%.  So with this  new  tax

regime, the business cost would increase rather than decrease

for  the SMEs.  These measures would not benefit them and  it

would, in fact, be detrimental to their operation.  I do  not

know  what  measures  we have to help these  companies  which

would end up worse off because of these tax adjustments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, most Singaporeans are not paying any income

tax   since  the  major  adjustment  when  the  3%  GST   was

implemented in 1994.  That being the case, this present round

of  tax reduction does not benefit them at all.  On the other

hand,  they have to pay 2% more in GST, the tax burden  would

be  heavier for them.  Although we do have an offset package,

it  is  going to last only five years or, at most, 10  years.

What is going to happen after that?  Like it or not, the poor

people  would  still have to pay 5% GST.  As  a  result,  the

lower income people will have a heavier tax burden, and  this

burden is added to them because they have to make up for  the

reduction in tax revenue resulting from the tax cut  for  the

high  income earners and the corporate tax.  In the long run,

this is not being fair to the lower income people. As far  as

this  issue is concerned, in five or 10 years' time, it  will

be  a  real  problem for our people.  I think the  Government

should take note of this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, we know that many people living in

the  HDB  executive flats have a lot of unhappiness over  the

distribution  of  the New Singapore Shares.   Those  who  are

living  in  the Executive Condominiums (EC) were conveniently

classified as "rich" people.  As such, they were deprived  of

the  benefits  enjoyed by those living in HDB  flats.   Under

such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>



circumstances,   many   people  living   in   the   Executive

Condominiums were very unhappy with this distribution.   This

time round, when the Economic Restructuring Shares (ERS)  are

being distributed, the Executive Condominium residents should

be  very  happy  because they will be entitled  to  the  same

number  of  shares as the HDB residents.  In this  aspect,  I

think we should recognise that the residents in the Executive

Condominiums are not really "rich" people as such.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, on conservancy charges rebate, the E-flat

residents again will be excluded from this benefit.   I  hope

that  the Finance Minister would listen to the complaints  of

EC owners.  They are not high-income people.  In fact, many E-flat  residents  are  earning  just  as  low  as  other   HDB

residents.   I hope that the Finance Minister would  consider

this  aspect of it and consider giving some of these benefits

to  the  owners  of Executive flats to offset the  impact  of

higher GST.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my speech during the debate on the President's

Address,  I  mentioned that subsidiary  companies  should  be

allowed  to  offset their losses against the profits  of  the

other  companies in the group or the main company.   This  is

also  one  of  the  means to reduce business  cost.   I  also

mentioned   about  the  high  business  cost  due   to   high

transportation  cost.   I  am pleased  that  both  are  being

provided   for  in  Budget  2002.   This  will  benefit   the

businesses,  and  the businesses would  be  more  willing  to

undertake  more  high risk ventures and this  would  help  in

building up their entrepreneurship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the reduction in the vehicle taxes, I have some

views.   Every time, when the Government reduces the  vehicle

taxes  like  the  Additional Registration Fee  (ARF)  or  the

import duty, the second-hand car dealers would be hard-hit as

the  stock of second-hand cars would almost immediately  lose

its value substantially.  The losses can be very severe.  For

example, a second-hand car dealer has about 20 to 30 cars  in

hand.  If the price of a second-car drops by, say, $2,000, he

would  have  suffered  a  loss of  some  $40,000  to  $60,000

overnight.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we help these people when we implement these

measures?   How do we help the second-hand car  dealers?   It

would depend on how we are going to decide on the PARF value.

If reduction in the PARF values equals to the total reduction

in the ARF and import tax, the effect on price of the second-hand cars would be minimised.  In this instance, the ARF  and

import tax are reduced by a total of 20 percentage points  of

the  OMV, when the car is to be scrapped in five years' time,

the  PARF  value  will  be reduced by 33%  of  OMV  from  the

original  PARF value.  In other words, by these new measures,

on  the  surface, it would appear that they would reduce  the

cost  of  owning a car.  But, in fact, by implementing  these

new  measures, the scrap-value for vehicles will be  reduced,

and  the  amount  recoverable by the  owners  will  be  less.

Hence,  the  net  cost in owning a car is  higher  under  the

proposed new scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the end result of these new measures actually

runs  contrary to the original intention of making cars  more

affordable to the people.  The effective cost of owning a car

is  actually  higher  than  the original  one.  I  think  the

Government should reconsider this PARF adjustment, as it runs

contrary to its original intention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Budget, it is mentioned that the civil service

and  statutory  boards should be "lean" and  efficient.   But

when  you  look  at the procedure in some of  the  Government

departments,  you will find that some of the  procedures  are

unnecessarily  cumbersome.  For  example,  if  you  want   to

register  a  car,  you have to go through  so  many  payments

before a car can be registered.  Let me tell you what are the

things  you  have to do.  First of all, you have to  pay  the

import  duty,  the  GST  on the import  duty,  the  ARF,  the

registration  fee, and then the road tax,  and  then  another

GST.  When the car is on the road, you pay petrol tax GST and

ERP.   There  are so many types of charges that you  have  to

pay.   Is  it really necessary?  If the Government wants  the

Government  departments to be lean and  efficient,  then  you

should consolidate all these levies into one payment.  If the

Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>



wants  to  be  effective, to be lean, it has to simplify  all

these procedures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that we are talking about giving double

tax  rebates for R&D expenses and for those who are employing

foreign companies to conduct R&D for local companies. It is a

very  good  practice.   It  is something  that  warrants  our

support.   But we know that in R&D, the scope is  very  wide.

More  often  than  not,  it is not  just  one  company  doing

everything  in a R&D project.  In the R&D market,  there  are

things like copyright, patent and other intellectual property

rights on sale.  Companies could speed up their technology by

purchasing all these intellectual property rights.   It  will

benefit many companies.  So I hope that when a company has to

pay for the use of intellectual property or right/licence for

manufacture, these expenses would also be entitled to  double

tax rebates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite all my doubts and reservations, I nevertheless

support  the motion standing in the name of the Deputy  Prime

Minister and Finance Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

this  first Budget 2002 presented by DPM and Finance Minister

Lee Hsien Loong is significant in responding to the different

world we now live in.  The proposed strategic changes, in  my

opinion, are bold, honest and unwavering.  The impact will be

far-reaching  as  it would contribute to  the  well-being  of

Singaporeans in the next phase of our growth and development.

The  picture  he has painted is now clearer in  defining  the

kind  of economy we want to create for Singapore.  Sir,  this

is  the  kind  of  leadership  that  Singapore  needs  during

turbulent  times  and  when we move from  one  generation  to

another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's Budget is presented later than the usual end-March Budget in each year. The Budget has the advantage of

knowing  the  results  of the year's first  quarter  economic

performance.  In fact, the global economic environment is so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>



volatile  and uncertain that it makes financial and  economic

forecasting  perilous.   There  is  the  dire  need  for  the

Government,  even  after  the Budget  has  been  approved  by

Parliament, to constantly review the progress throughout  the

year  so that timely measures are taken and adjustment  made,

taking  into  account any critical and momentous developments

that  might  scuttle the Budget plans for  the  year.   I  am

thinking  about  the developments in the  Middle  East  which

certainly could be a development that can change the scene in

the  world.   We  experienced this last year, Sir,  when  the

Budget  was  presented as usual in March, yet the  Government

saw  it fit to implement the $2.2 billion package of measures

in  July  to forestall and cushion the effects of the  severe

deterioration in our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has given the highest priority in

creating good jobs for Singapore.  Sir, good jobs mean higher

value  jobs  that command good salaries for Singaporeans  who

have  the  skills  and  qualifications  to  take  them.   The

Singaporean businessmen commonly ask the Government  to  help

bring  their cost of operations down so that they can compete

against the countries in the region.  Unfortunately, there is

a  limit  as  to how low we can go in bringing  the  cost  of

operations  down.   Sometimes, I wonder whether  our  liberal

policy  to allow the importation of cheap foreign labour  has

led  to our lack of competitiveness in some of our industries

today.   It  is  not possible for Singaporean businessmen  to

want  to earn good profits and Singaporean workers to  desire

and  expect  higher  salaries and yet are unprepared  to  pay

commensurate  prices for the goods and services produced  and

provided for by fellow Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversely, we should not unwisely pay generous

remuneration to foreign talent just because they are  foreign

without  scrutinising their capacity to contribute and  their

ability  to  fit into the local culture and environment.   We

should  not  overlook the equally deserving  Singaporeans  by

giving  them  similar opportunities to make the  grade.   The

cynicism  Singaporeans have for foreign talent has been  that

quite a few have been deemed to be largely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>



unsuccessful  in making their mark.  Singaporeans  have  been

unconvinced that foreigners have made the vast difference  to

the  performance  of  Singaporean organisations  that  employ

them.   Singaporean  corporations can  do  a  better  job  in

succession planning and the development of Singaporean talent

as   corporate  leaders  for  their  organisations.   It   is

sometimes amusing to note of the contrary approach  taken  by

Singaporean  corporations that want to  employ  more  foreign

talent  and  the foreign MNCs are satisfied with Singaporeans

because they find them to be capable and competent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore market is highly competitive and

demanding.   In  order to succeed, a strong  management  team

supported  by  a  cohesive  group  of  subordinate  staff  is

required.  The issue is not talent alone.  It has also to  do

with  business knowledge, systems, culture and  team  effort.

The  question is not foreign or local talent.  It is that  in

Singapore, we just simply do not have a large enough pool  of

leadership and executive talent in Singapore with the breadth

and   depth   of   experience  operating   as   multinational

corporations  at  the  corporate level in  the  regional  and

global markets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans now realise that it is no longer a stigma

to  move  from job to job and to change from one business  to

another.    Singaporeans  have  learnt  to   seize   whatever

opportunities available and the need to climb  up  the  value

chain both in their careers and businesses.  However, we have

to  be  realistic that no matter how hard we try and whatever

encouragement  we  may  give, there would  only  be  a  small

segment of our population who would want to be entrepreneurs.

The  vast  majority  would be content to remain  as  salaried

employees.  There is no doubt that the nature and  tenure  of

employment   will  also  change.   The  present  unfavourable

employment  market conditions have affected the attitude  and

psyche  of  the  average Singaporean who feels  insecure  and

vulnerable.   In  recent  times, we have  witnessed  graduate

executives  and professionals losing their jobs arising  from

mergers  and acquisitions, and the organisations  needing  to

adjust to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>



new   business  operating  environment  with   the   use   of

information and communications technology and this had  added

to the gloom and doom.  We have to brace ourselves that for a

long  while yet, a sizable number of Singaporeans will suffer

joblessness   and   have   difficulty  securing   alternative

employment  with  salaries comparable to what  they  used  to

earn.   For Singaporeans who are currently employed, the  way

to protect themselves and secure their employability would be

to  be  flexible  in  accepting  work  assignments  and  even

accepting downgrading in job roles and be diligent  to  learn

new skills and apply their knowledge as best as they can.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Budget did not cover any changes to the

current rate of CPF contribution at 20% for employees and 16%

for employers for those below 55 years.  Singaporeans used to

have  the  total CPF saving rate of 50% and then  reduced  to

40%,  and  now  adjusted  to  36%  because  of  the  economic

downturn.   The Government has all along expounded the  long-term  policy  of 40% in CPF contributions to be  adequate  in

providing   for   the  retirement  needs   of   Singaporeans.

Therefore,  Singaporeans are especially concerned when  there

was a suggestion to introduce new age bands for the 40 to  55

years  old  to  lower  the employers' wage  cost.   This  has

rattled  middle age Singaporeans who fear that they would  be

adversely affected if this came about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know that CPF savings have been used to

cater  to  the  housing,  medical  and  retirement  needs  of

Singaporeans.   Singaporeans in the 40 to 55 age  groups  are

people  with  the  highest financial needs.   We  should  not

reduce  the employers' CPF contribution for the older workers

without giving them ample notice.  I would hazard to say that

they  should be given at least five years' notice before  any

change  could  be made to allow them to make their  long-term

adjustment.   I  estimate that there must  have  been  a  few

hundred  thousand properties that have changed hands at  high

property  prices  in the last few years.   Many  Singaporeans

have  borrowed and mortgaged their homes to the hilt  with  a

substantial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>



instalment  repayment coming from the withdrawal  from  their

CPF  savings.   Any reduction in employers' CPF  contribution

would  certainly  cause severe financial  hardships  to  many

families who have bought new homes in recent years.   I  hope

the Government will think very carefully before attempting to

change  the  rate  of employers' CPF contribution  overnight.

And  I  think any change just to solve the problem of a small

group at the expense of a much larger group is not the way to

go.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that the Government has recognised that

with  the reduction of corporate and income taxes, the income

gap  will  widen.   The  tax deductions  provided  will  help

promote  the  spirit  of  philanthropy  in  individuals   and

corporations,  which  I  believe  is  a  step  in  the  right

direction.   In fact, I am pleasantly surprised that  such  a

heavy document as the Budge Statement saw it fit to have this

element  of  philanthropy  written  into  it.   I  hope  many

Singaporeans and local and foreign corporations operating  in

Singapore  would  contribute generously to support  the  less

able  in  our  community.  Their act as socially  responsible

citizens will contribute to social bonding and help  build  a

strong and cohesive Singapore society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  thank  you for the opportunity  to  speak  on

Budget  2002.  However, it is getting late now and many  have

spoken, and on overlapping areas too, and so I will try to be

short.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government is well-known for being

decisive.   Now is the time indeed to be decisive  and  bold.

As  DPM  and  Finance Minister Lee Hsien Loong  said  in  his

Budget  speech, to thrive in a different world we are in,  we

must  confront and accept the new realities, we must  quickly

adapt ourselves to the changed environment, and to many  more

changes to come.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed changes to restructure our economy are

indeed  very sweeping.  I agree, as we must start  early.   I

have  asked  around and the reactions I obtained are  varied,

understandably.  From the private sector, they like the  bold

moves,  especially the corporate and personal tax  cuts.   We

must  spur our economy to grow, they urged.  There are  those

who however feel that not enough was being done for the SMEs,

a  point  also stressed by Mr Inderjit Singh and many  others

today.   For  the  more  radical, they  even  feel  that  the

corporate tax cuts should not be done in stages.  For greater

impact, it should be done at one go, they said.  That is  how

serious  and  how  urgent, they feel,  is  the  situation  if

Singapore were to remain competitive and to save jobs.   That

is  how  fundamental it is.  The bottom line  is  saving  and

creating jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the average citizen, especially the lower income

earners,  their main preoccupation is why increase  the  GST,

especially  now.  They feel that while the corporate  sectors

and  higher income earners have a lot to gain, they  are  the

ones  having  to  pay more.  The GST offsets notwithstanding,

they  feel  that  there is no point in the Government  taking

pride in the position that 75% of the population does not pay

taxes when there is the GST to fend for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the lower income, including and especially those who

have  been retrenched or unemployed, there is no big picture.

It  is  their micro position that looms high on their agenda.

That is the bottom line too:  jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we know, of course, that this is precisely the

reason for the sweeping changes in Budget 2002:  saving  jobs

and  creating jobs.  That is also the critical test for  this

Budget.  If I may cite the experience at the North-East  CDC,

and  here  I  declare my interest as Mayor of the  North-East

CDC, jobs, jobs and jobs are also the focus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, when I was appointed Mayor of

the  Ang Mo Kio-Cheng San CDC, part-time before and now full-time at North-East, my main



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>



preoccupation  was then racial harmony and  social  cohesion.

But now, it seems "Jobs, Jobs, Jobs" matter most.  But do not

be mistaken, for jobs too play an important part in forging a

more  cohesive society.  For not many will care about harmony

and  cohesion,  when on an empty stomach, and  with  so  many

bills unpaid, with electricity and water on hold, awaiting to

be cut.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the North-East CDC, we have set up what we call JELL

(Jobs, Employability and Lifelong Learning) Committee as part

of  our  priorities.  Yes, jobs, not just for the short-term,

filling the vacuum left by retrenchment and unemployment, but

long-term  employability achieved through lifelong  learning.

We  believe  that  way we will be able  to  ensure  a  better

jelling of the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, Sir, the people trust the Government.

The  75%  votes cast last November said so.  Not  that  there

were  no outstanding issues and problems then, but the people

knew that the Government can and will deliver, especially  in

trying times.  In other words, the people are saying, do what

you  think  is necessary, but just save the jobs  and  create

enough new ones to make us Singaporeans sleep better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to close by focusing

on three recommendations:

<br><br>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To call upon the Government to do more for the SMEs and

help them to grow further and help save and create more jobs;

<br><br>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To monitor closely the effects of the new GST rate to

ensure that the offset package to help alleviate the short-term problem is effective, especially for the lower income

earners; and

<br><br>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide more resources for the CDCs to help

Singaporeans prepare for the new realities, be it in

educational and bonding programmes, improved job matching and

placements and/or training and retraining.

I  have  just mentioned them briefly but I think  I  will  be

dwelling on them at the COS later this week.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a final note, Sir, if the Government has been bold in

its  Budget measures, the people too should respond with grit

and  determination.  The challenges brought about by this new

and different world require nothing less.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, my

parliamentary colleagues in this Budget debate have spoken on

the different financial aspects and the difficulties faced by

our  people, SMEs and corporate companies.  I would like  now

to dwell on another financial consideration of many, that is,

healthcare  affordability which has been  touched  on  by  my

parliamentary  colleague Madam Halimah Yacob earlier.   After

listening to 23 speakers before me and a long day, may I seek

the  patience of my colleagues here for a while more to  hear

me out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, healthcare affordability has been a major concern

for many Singaporeans.  This concern will only get worse with

the  expected  escalating healthcare costs  in  view  of  our

ageing  population and rapid advances in medical  technology.

In  fact,  Singapore's national health  expenditure,  at  the

current level of healthcare servicing, will rise to 7% of GDP

by 2030.  The widespread worry, especially among the elderly,

on  hospitalisation  affordability is understandable.   I  am

reminded  of a familiar saying "Can die but cannot afford  to

fall  ill" and I hope we do not succumb to such a predicament

in the days ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our National Health Expenditure (NHE) increased from

$4.4  billion  in  1999  to  $4.7  billion  in  2000.   As  a

percentage  of  GDP, NHE formed about 3%.  Per-capita  health

expenditure rose about 6% in one year from $1,360 in 1999  to

$1,439  in  2000.  The NHE proportion is borne two-thirds  by

the  people, or the private share and only one third  by  the

Government.   This  contrasts  significantly  with  that   in

England  where  the  private share  is  only  one  sixth,  in

Australia where the private share is only half, and  in  Hong

Kong and Malaysia where the ratio is roughly one to one.   If

the ratio of Government and private



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>



proportion  is going to remain, the impact on the people  can

be  great indeed.  It is worse still as in this year, when in

absolute  terms,  the allocation to MOH is less  because  the

Government allocation is based on GDP.  As the NHE cannot  be

lessened, the extra burden will be on the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I would like to beseech the Government to address

this concern of many Singaporeans and find ways to ameliorate

their worry with some expedient actions and with further  and

better planning to soften the future burden.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a people, our main prime resource, the provision

of  good  healthcare to all Singaporeans must be prioritised.

This   is   to  ensure  a  healthy  workforce  as  the   main

contributors  to our survival as a nation.   The  MOH  should

have  the same importance and bestowed the same weightage  as

other  Ministries, the MOE, for example.    The  Ministry  of

Education  is  cultivating  our  future  resource,  but   the

Ministry  of Health is sustaining and nursing the present  as

well  as  our future resource.  Sir, I would like to  suggest

the  following  eight ways relevant to Singapore  to  address

this issue of affordability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) There is a need to allay the concerns of many,

especially    the    elderly   on   the   affordability    of

hospitalisation bills should they fall sick.  It  is  a  fact

that  hospitalisations can cost thousands of dollars and  can

even be tens of thousands if surgery is involved.  This is so

even  in  our  public  hospitals.  We need  immediate  action

towards assuring people that affordability of hospitalisation

is  ensured  with  our  3M-scheme (Medisave,  Medishield  and

Medifund).   Remarkably, many people still do not  understand

their  usage  fully.   For  a start,  MOH  can  provide  more

briefing  materials for MPs to familiarise  their  grassroots

workers  with what is provided for.  With the new Eldershield

and Elderfund, MOH must provide even more in public education

regarding the various schemes available.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) To ensure special long-term affordability, "health

risk pooling" through



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>



insurance,  a  risk transfer mechanism, may  be  better  than

plain  dependence  on  savings alone.   Therefore,  a  bigger

proportion  of  Medisave should be allowed  for  purchase  of

medical  insurance,  such  as the  Portable  Medical  Benefit

Hospitalisation and Surgical cover.  The fear of  encouraging

the buffet syndrome or of driving up healthcare costs can  be

contained  as long as Medisave accredited insurance companies

contain  the  co-payment  and deductible  elements  in  their

policies.   This will emphasise the principle  of  individual

responsibility  or  one's own healthcare  needs.   This  will

encourage Singaporeans to better plan and save when they  are

younger,  and not to depend just on Medisave alone or,  worse

still,  to  depend on Medifund when they fall  sick.   It  is

necessary for the people to know that we cannot assume  there

will always be budget surpluses to build up our Medifund  and

provide an unlimited safety net in the years ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Sir, our homecare services are almost non-existent

at present. We need to make this service available quickly in

order  to  lessen the need for high cost stay in the tertiary

institutions,  especially  the  acute  hospitals.   With  our

ageing  population, homecare, where many discharged  patients

can be looked after in their own homes, will be an increasing

demand and an important part of our healthcare structure.  In

tandem  with  the establishment of homecare,  there  must  be

effective   support   from  primary   healthcare,   community

healthcare and social services, as well as modified  housing.

I  feel that for homecare to be really effective, there  must

be  the  involvement of the community.  There should be  more

community volunteers and home help for families to  care  for

the  dependent elderly in their homes.  There should also  be

more  adjunct community supporting services like domiciliary,

daycare, rehabilitation and occupational therapy services  to

complement  the  homecare.  Such facilitation will  translate

into lower costs and convenience for a happier people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) We need more innovative concepts to better plan the

present and future manpower needs of our healthcare



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>



system  because manpower costs demand a rather large  portion

of  our  healthcare costs.  We must have fresh  ideas  and  a

"dare-to-do" attitude in trying out new grounds. For example,

in  order to cater to the manpower needs in starting homecare

services,  MOH  should  re-look at the  usage  of  healthcare

workers and consider using not only full-time paid personnel,

but  also  family members, community volunteers, and  so  on.

Such  healthcare workers can be trained in a matter of weeks.

In  England, it takes only three weeks of intensive  training

to  equip them with the necessary skills.  They are certified

at  the  end of courses which teach them in assisted feeding,

catheter  care, prosthesis use, simple dressings  and  simple

grooming  as  in  toenail  cutting  for  non-diabetics  using

sterile techniques.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another example is the recognition that nurses who

are well-trained can do a lot and can contribute not only  to

better care of patients but also to lower costs in healthcare

delivery.   It is very much cheaper to maintain  a  nurse  as

compared  to,  let us say, a doctor.  Moreover,  well-trained

nurses  can  carry out many functions otherwise performed  by

doctors  and  this  frees the latter for other  duties.   The

present shortage of nurses has to be addressed urgently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have an undergraduate nursing programme for

nurses.   There  is  only  the diploma  course  from  Nanyang

Polytechnic and Certificate in Nursing course from ITE.  Sir,

it  is about time that this option be made available. We need

to train more professional nurses, not just as caregivers but

also as care managers, coordinators and innovators to keep up

with  the  changing needs.  The provision of an undergraduate

programme  for  nursing  will also address  the  shortage  of

nurses  and this will provide another channel for the  better

qualified  students that will otherwise  not  go  to  ITE  or

Nanyang Polytechnic to do nursing.  This group may feel  that

they  are  wasting their talent by not pursuing a  university

degree.  The undergraduate course will provide the discipline

to  grow  as  many  nurses can also upgrade themselves  after

graduation from ITE and Nanyang Polytechnic.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the scope of nursing work must be expanded.

Qualified  nurses become even more relevant as we pursue  the

life  sciences and excellence in medical healthcare.  We  can

have nurses as trained personnel to assist in scientific  and

clinical  projects  as  part  of  a  team  with  doctors  and

scientists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Preventive healthcare must be the hallmark of all

issues  concerning  healthcare affordability.   The  adequate

allocation  of  funds  today and the  success  of  preventive

measures  will save us millions in the future.  The  Ministry

of  Health  must ensure continuity and lasting follow-through

of  all  efforts  on preventive healthcare.   The  Ministry's

priority  must be to continuously identify prevalent diseases

that  need greater attention and to continuously monitor  and

study the trends for prevention and common diseases, as  well

as  the  many  different  aspects of  preventive  healthcare.

Consider  these  examples.  Since colorectal  cancer  is  the

second  leading  cause of cancer in men, there  should  be  a

national screening programme started.  Since pneumonia is the

third  leading cause of death, it will be useful to find  the

causal factors and establish the preventive measures. As  the

prevalence  rate of depression in Singapore is  8.6%,  a  new

emphasis  on  mental health, which has not received  its  due

attention, is necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, since morbidity and mortality

from  any  disease  can  be  dramatically  reduced  when  the

diseases  are  treated  in  their  early  stages,  preventive

healthcare  should be especially targeted at the younger  age

group.   I  am concerned that the young may assume that  they

are  less  vulnerable because of age, and therefore  have  no

need  for regular check-ups.  We have to make sure that  they

are  not  left out in our preventive care efforts, especially

in   prevention  of  early  and  treatable  conditions   like

diabetes,   hypertension  and  high-blood  cholesterol.    In

tackling  this problem, there is a need for much  creativity,

funding and enthusiasm.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Appropriate investment in medical research and life

sciences directed at our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>



prevalent  needs,  like  finding the  cures  for  the  common

diseases  and  cancers  that affect  most  Singaporeans,  can

address  the  long-term  healthcare affordability.   If  gene

therapy  can  be  found to treat and prevent heart  diseases,

diabetes  and  hypertension, the amount of  savings  will  be

enormous.   If  cures or better still the preventive  factors

can be found for the common cancers affecting Asians, such as

nasopharyngeal  cancer, many will be saved  from  dying  from

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is better to place more emphasis on prevalent

diseases  and  possible  future plans  in  Singapore  in  the

development of these diseases.  For example, Hepatitis C  has

emerged  from  obscurity  to being recognised  as  the  major

public health problems world-wide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because western researchers may lack priority and

subject material to work on Asian conditions, priority in use

of  funds  and manpower should therefore be directed  at  our

specific  needs and especially at those diseases that  affect

mostly  Asians.  We should have more detailed epidemiological

studies of disease patterns and based on medical research and

life  sciences study on them, to better plan and cushion  our

own long-term healthcare cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) The rise in healthcare expenditure has prompted

many  nations  to develop and implement on armoury  of  cost-control  mechanisms.   A  study  on  the  experience  of  six

countries, Australia, Canada, Germany, United States,  United

Kingdom  and Singapore, showed that healthcare inflation  can

be  managed  and not through the strategy of competition  but

through  centralised control over healthcare resources.   Two

countries, the United States of America and Singapore,  opted

for  competition in healthcare financing.   In  the  case  of

Singapore,  our Government decided to use market  competition

by  carefully  designing competition between the  public  and

private  hospitals.  The expectation of countries subscribing

to  this approach is that competition will drive down prices,

while providing incentives to improve efficiency



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>



and  quality.  However, evidence suggests the contrary.   The

United  States  and  Singapore have experienced  the  highest

growth  rate  in  healthcare expenditures.   Sir,  the  right

approach  should be an integration of the private and  public

sectors in Singapore to maximise our small resource pool.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Sir, new medical technology can contribute to

efficiency gain in the hospitals, for example, in  making  it

possible for more day surgeries done which otherwise  require

hospitalisation  stay.   Technology  acquisition  is  closely

linked with manpower considerations.  Physicians are a  major

factor  in  the  demand  for and  use  of  technology.   More

specific  training  of  physicians to use  high-tech  devices

should be encouraged.  Limits on medical technology have been

envisioned  for the private sector in Singapore.  Sir,  these

limits  will  jeopardise Singapore's  role  as  a  healthcare

magnet  for  patients  from  foreign  countries.   Technology

limitation might alter the inflow of such patients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to end by reiterating that the

development of Singapore into a medical hub of the region and

turning Singapore into the "Mayo Clinic of Southeast Asia" is

a  worthwhile  industry to pursue.  Having  more  full-paying

foreign patients, apart from giving a spin-off effect for our

other services by having more visitors to Singapore, may be a

source  of  subsidy rather than a cause of rising  healthcare

cost for local patients. There is a need for a mindset change

here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I hope that the above

suggestions  to  address the affordability of  healthcare  in

Singapore can be considered favourably by our Government.

<br>7.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

I shall be as brief as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an overwhelming victory of 75%, the people's

expectation of the Government is very high, and the  task  of

meeting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>



this  expectation  is challenging and daunting.   Challenging

because  many  changes  to our economy and  institutions  are

being made, and daunting because these changes bring a lot of

uncertainty and pain to our people.  Yet, not to do so  would

be  like  an ostrich hiding its head in the sand.  We  change

because  the world has changed since September 11.   Business

methods  are  changing,  so  our financial  institutions  and

banking instruments will have to change.  Manufacturing is no

longer assembly work, but innovation, design, research-based.

Biotech  is  slowly  going to replace  even  our  wafer  fab,

because the latter has reached an over supply stage.  And  we

cannot  compete with China as it has more of  the  wafer  fab

plants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, Indonesia and Malaysia served as our

hinterland, but geopolitics and competition have changed  all

that.    Our   ports  face  competition  from  Malaysia   and

Indonesia, and so also our airport will soon face very strong

competition.  We must accept this as part of our neighbouring

countries'  upgrading and domestic needs, and push  ourselves

into new frontiers of service and business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not foresee the position we enjoyed in the past

with  our neighbouring countries as ever coming back.  So  we

must  change  and  change fast.   Geopolitics  and  terrorist

activities will serve as a backdrop, as we continue with  our

determination  to progress and survive.  With  these  opening

remarks,  I  look  at  our  Budget trying  to  meet  the  new

circumstances  of doing business and helping  our  people  to

come along with the Government to meet this new challenge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concern of the man-in-the-street is GST, CPF

changes,  car  park  charges,  utility  bills,  medical   and

education.  Above all these, he wants job security and  jobs.

The changing economy has made many Singaporeans very insecure

and  worrying.  This insecurity affects many, but more so the

less  educated.   Some want to change with  retraining,  some

simply  cannot  change,  and watch with  frustration  to  see

foreign workers doing the jobs that they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>



do  not want.  Calling Singaporeans to have mindset change is

right,  as  we  cannot  continue  to  provide,  for  example,

economic  downturn  relief,  as this  will  create  a  crutch

mentality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, there are some who have lost jobs, because of

business  change  and  relocation  up  north  and  elsewhere,

especially   manufacturing  plants.   They  cannot   upgrade,

because  of  technological changes and cost of  operation  is

high compared to China, Indonesia, etc.  However, perhaps  to

save  jobs,  we  should  not be too  eager  to  replace  such

factories too quickly with new biotech ones.  Some are beyond

rescue,  but surely there must be some that can be helped  to

upgrade   to   meet   the  new  business  and   manufacturing

requirements of high-end products.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope our special Committee on Remaking of Singapore

will look into this.  Perhaps they can involve the Enterprise

Promotion Centre to help.  Do not write off manufacturing too

fast,  because employment in this sector is high, and  if  we

can  lend a helping hand, we should and this will be able  to

protect  job  losses in this sector.  We must capitalise  the

expertise  of EDB, our universities and industry  experts  to

help such companies to upgrade, and thus preserve jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am advocating a balanced approach to transform

our  economy because many of our people are not able to  cope

with  the speed of change we expect of them.  So many  policy

changes  are  happening each day that the average Singaporean

is  probably lost or cannot follow, resulting in many  to  be

indifferent  to  the changes.  However, we  cannot  turn  the

clock  back.  We have to be more circumspect in the execution

of  our policy changes and not be too quick to throw the rule

book at them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, creating jobs through the tax

restructuring is one way of attracting investors and  talent.

Therefore, the cut in corporate and personal income tax  will

be  most  welcome.  But do tax cuts draw investments?   In  a

report  of  Barclays Capital, which I read  in  the  Business

Times on 9th May 2000, it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>



unlikely to spur inflows of foreign direct investments  (FDI)

and   in  its  view,  the  main  impediment  to  FDI  is  not

necessarily the cost base but limited business opportunities.

And it goes to explain:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'South-east Asia's manufacturing base is also "far

shallower"  and its economic outlook "far more  modest"  than

North  Asia,  while  Singapore's regional  entrepot  role  is

undermined by competing port and transport hubs in  Malaysia.

Until   South-east  Asia  can  deliver  the  economic  growth

prospects  seen  in   North Asia, we find  it  unlikely  that

Singapore  will  experience  an  upsurge  in  foreign  direct

investments.'

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It further says:

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'At best, the new tax measures may prevent a net decline

in FDI   -  which itself is not an achievement that should be

sniffed at.'

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you see, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Singapore watchers

are guarded in their assessment of our economy restructuring.

But  having said that, I think they should, on the  contrary,

spur us to explore more investment opportunities through more

aggressive  selling  of  Singapore through  our  EDB.    This

becomes a challenge to push us to achieve more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I agree that tax changes do help to bring more

investments to our country, I am sure those who want  to  set

up  businesses  here have to take into account the  political

and  social security of our land.  In this respect, we should

be ahead of many countries.  In fact, I have no problems with

the  Minister allocating one-third of this Budget to  Defence

and  Security.  We have to ensure that this place is safe not

only for the investor but also for his family and friends.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of the GST on the economy as a whole has been

discussed  and  I  shall not go into it.  What  seems  to  be

taking  a low profile is the offsetting package for the  GST.

So,  to  sell  the  GST  better, I would  suggest  that  more

emphasis be done after this Budget to bring the message home.

There are already listed at least nine ways of cushioning the

GST  and  this includes the ERS shares, no GST on  subsidised

medical  care,  increased subvention to  Town  Councils,  PTC

would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>



not  raise  fares  in 2003, SC&C and rental rebates  for  low

income  HDB households, households with less than $3,000  can

apply  for  assistance from the CCC, raise public  assistance

and  the  Singapore Allowance for pensioners and, finally,  a

Committee to Combat Profiteering.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to emphasise this and in order to sell our

GST  better,  because  we did well in  1994.   Here,  I  must

commend NTUC Fairprice, Unity, NTUC Healthcare and NTUC  Food

Fare  for volunteering to absorb the 2% GST hike for at least

one  year  on essential items.  They deserve a pat  on  their

backs and I do hope others will follow suit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, Sir, when I talk to Singaporeans, I get a

very  gloomy picture of Singapore, somewhat depressing.  They

worry  about  the  economy,  Malaysia's  recent  harsh  stand

against us, Indonesia's response to terrorist operations  and

China's emergence as an economic force.  While I share  their

concerns, I also tell them to look on the more positive side.

All  is not lost.  Relations with Malaysia, like the economy,

will  have  its  ups  and downs.  Nothing  is  static.   Good

fortunes  will  return, not by chance,  but  through  careful

planning.  We must not take things lying down, react fast  to

make  the  necessary  change, to be more  pro-active  in  our

approach  to issues, and to stand our ground when challenged.

I  believe  this  Budget  tries to  meet  some  of  the  more

challenging issues facing us.  Externally, a different  world

and  uncertain  outlook globally and regionally;  internally,

restructuring taxes and creating jobs.  We may not  have  the

complete  answers,  but at least we are  attempting  to  move

ahead.   I  wait to see the various reports of the many  sub-committees involved in the Remaking of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget. It is a good Budget.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</b> asked the Acting Minister for Community

Development  and  Sports what further measures  the  Ministry

will  take  (i)  to  alleviate the sense  of  loneliness  and

alienation faced by senior citizens;  and (ii) to allow  them

to remain economically active.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The social integration of our seniors is a key principle

underpinning  our  national policy on  ageing.   Our  desired

outcome is for every Singaporean to grow old gracefully, stay

active  and  continue to enjoy the support  of  families  and

friends in the community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are already a number of programmes and services,

carried   out   by   various  agencies,  to   support   older

Singaporeans who are more vulnerable, for example  those  who

live  alone  or without family support.  One example  is  the

befriending  programme, where a volunteer is assigned  to  an

elderly and visits him/her on a regular basis. Another is the

mutual   help   scheme  where  10-15  seniors   are   grouped

informally, pursue activities of common interest and  members

keep an eye on the well-being of one another. For seniors who

live  in selected one room rental flats or studio apartments,

my   Ministry   has  set  up  senior  activity   centres   or

Neighbourhood Links to help integrate them in community life.

We  will be setting up more Neighbourhood Links over the next

four years to cover more housing estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Older persons need social contact and meaningful roles

to  keep  them alert, active and integrated in the community.

The  programmes  and courses run by the People's  Association

Senior  Citizens' Clubs and Retirees' Clubs have  contributed

towards enhancing the well-being of their participants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has also set up a $1 million a year Active

Seniors  Programme to support projects that help our  seniors

to  play a more active role in the community. I have recently

launched  the inaugural series of projects which are expected

to   involve   more  than  2,000  seniors.   We  hope   these

initiatives will encourage more seniors to become  active  in

the  community.  This in turn will enable them  to  be  fully

integrated into our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The continual employment of our senior workers remains a

key  challenge  to the Government.  About  a  year  ago,  the

Ministry  of  Community Development and  Sports  piloted  the

first  Golden  Manpower Centre at the Central Singapore  CDC.

The  Centre  sources  for  employment  opportunities  in  the

community for their residents, including senior citizens  and

works  towards  changing the mindsets  of  employers  towards

older  workers. With this initial experience, the CDC is  now

in  better  position to reach out to our senior citizens.  We

will  look  into sharing the Centre's experience more  widely

with  other CDCs and employment agencies, so as to strengthen

our efforts to find suitable employment for our seniors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Manpower has also implemented the People-for-Jobs Traineeship Programme to help older job seekers who

are  prepared  to  make a career switch across  sectors.  The

programme provides financial support to companies to  put  in

place  traineeship arrangements to better induct and increase

the  comfort level of older workers taking on a new job in  a

new  working environment. MOM also actively promotes training

and  skills  upgrading  of  older workers  under  the  Skills

Redevelopment  Programme.  The  National  Skills  Recognition

System  which  will be set up in more industries,  will  also

provide  modular courses to make skills upgrading easier  for

older workers.

<div align="center"><b>EARLY MARRIAGES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Dr Mohamad Maliki bin Osman</b> asked the Acting Minister

for  Community Development and Sports (a) what is the  extent

of  the  problem of early marriages; and (b) what  programmes

are and will be in place to address this trend.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 22,561 registered marriages in 2000, 18,550 were

civil and 4,011 were Muslim marriages. For non-Muslims, 1% of

grooms and 4% of brides married when they were below 21 years

of  age.  The corresponding percentages for Muslim grooms and

brides  were  higher  -  4% and 16% respectively.   Marriages

involving 1 teenage partner have been declining since 1980.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2000,13% of female divorcees and 2% of male divorcees

were  under 20 years old when they married. The corresponding

figures  for Muslims were 22% of female divorcees and  5%  of

male divorcees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reason for teenage marriages is pre-marital

pregnancy. They are usually forced to choose marriage to save

their  families from embarrassment. Marriage for such couples

is  often  the  start of more problems for themselves,  their

children and families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underaged couples granted the Special Marriage Licence

under  the Women's Charter are required to attend a  workshop

to  prepare  themselves  for marriage and  parenthood.  Their

parents  are  advised  to support the  couple  in  their  new

responsibilities.   For  young  Malay/  Muslim  couples,  the

Registrar  for  Muslim  Marriages  refers  them  to   similar

marriage preparation workshops.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February this year, the Registry of Muslim Marriages

launched  the  Strong  Relationship for  Resilient  Community

Programme,  which  targets Muslim  teenagers.   A  series  of

preventive  education  programmes will  be  launched  by  the

second half of this year. For example, the No Apologies:  The

Truth About Life, Love & Sex Programme will help youths  make

informed  life  choices.  Parents will be  taught  skills  to

guide  their teenagers in the area of sexuality.  The various

community partners of MCDS will conduct these programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, my Ministry will continue to reach out

to  teenagers through a variety of activities.  Some of these

include  roadshows  in secondary schools, programmes  in  the

media  on  dating,  values and responsible sexual  behaviour,

dialogue sessions with teenagers, and positive messaging  via

sports.  Marriage  is a personal choice.  But  we  hope  that

parents and the community can play an active role in advising

our  young  on  the  right choices to make  with  respect  to

marriage and the starting of a family.

<div align="center"><b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD FLATS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  if there are plans to ease restrictions  on  the

use  of  Housing and Development Board flats for other quiet,

desk-bound  businesses, other than the current  technopreneur

scheme.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Technopreneur Home Office (THO) Scheme,

aspiring technopreneurs are allowed to use their HDB flats as

their     registered    business    address,    to    conduct

infocommunication  technology-related  work.   To  date,  385

applications  have been approved under the THO Scheme,  since

its inception in July 1999.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB also allows other small-scale businesses to be

conducted  from  HDB  flats, so long as  they  do  not  cause

inconvenience to neighbours.  For instance, HDB residents may

use their flat to conduct tuition classes or music lessons to

small groups of students.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as HDB eases the restrictions on the use of HDB

flats, it will ensure that it protects the residential nature

of   our   HDB   estates.   HDB  residents  should   not   be

inadvertently   inconvenienced  by  noise,  excessive   human

traffic  or  loss  of  privacy, as  a  result  of  businesses

conducted by their neighbours from their HDB flats.

<div align="center"><b>MAID ABUSE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. <b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

(a)  what  is the trend of maid abuse cases;  (b)  has  there

been  a  study to determine the causes of maid abuse  in  our

society;  and (c) are the present measures to stem such abuse

and  to  safeguard  the welfare of foreign  domestic  workers

sufficient.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government takes a serious view of employers who

abuse their foreign domestic workers (FDWs).  The Penal  Code

was  thus  amended  in  1998 to enhance  penalties  committed

against a foreign domestic worker (FDW) by 150%.  Since then,

the  number  of  maid abuse cases has declined significantly.

According  to  the Police, the number of substantiated  abuse

cases has dropped from 157 cases in 1997 to 41 cases in 2001.

This declining trend should also be seen in the context of  a

rising FDW population.  Employers and their household members

who  are  convicted  for  abusing their  FDWs  will  also  be

debarred from employing another FDW.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has also been focusing our efforts at

educating  employers  on how to better  manage  and  forge  a

harmonious  working relationship with their  FDWs.   We  will

continue  with our promotional efforts.  Ultimately employers

should   realise   that  they  have  a   social   and   moral

responsibility  to look after the welfare of their  FDWs  and

not impose unrealistic work demands on their FDWs.
