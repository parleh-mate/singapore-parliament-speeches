<div align="center"><b>PUBLIC UTILITIES BOARD</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Single-meter single-tariff system for power and lighting)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Low Yong Nguan</b> asked the Prime Minister

if  he  will ascertain from the Public  Utilities

Board  whether  the Board plans  to  introduce  a single-meter



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>



single-tariff system for both power and  lighting

consumption, and when the system can be  expected

to be introduced.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Lim Kim San) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been

asked to reply on behalf of the Prime Minister as

I  am directly involved with the Public Utilities

Board. To answer the first question, I would  say

that   Singapore  is  still  saddled   with   the

antiquated   system   of  wiring   and   metering

separately for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>



lighting and power. If we change over to a single-meter system, which does not differentiate between

lighting and power, it would mean a saving in  the

cost  of  wiring and metering. So we have asked  a

firm  of  consultants to advise us on the changing

over  to this system of single metering. They will

present  their report soon to the Public Utilities

Board.  It  is hoped to introduce the single-meter

system  of  electricity  tariffs  to  the  general

Public as soon as it is conveniently possible.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>PUBLIC UTILITIES BOARD</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Electricity Code)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Low Yong Nguan</b> asked the Prime Minister if

he would ascertain from the Public Utilities Board

whether  the  Board  plans to  introduce  its  own

Electricity Code to suit local requirements.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Electricity Department of the

Public Utilities Board has compiled two draft sets

of  electricity  regulations - (i)  Licensing  and

Safety  Regulations  for Electrical  Installations

and   (ii)  Electricity  Supply  Regulations.  The

Licensing  and  Safety Regulations for  Electrical

Installations    cover   safety   standards    for

electrical installations and the operation, repair

and   maintenance   of  such  installations,   the

licensing  and registration of private generators,

the  registration  of electrical contractors,  the

colour  coding  for  electrical  appliances,   the

approval of electrical apparatus and other related

matters.  The  Electricity Supply Regulations  set

out  general  rules  concerning  applications  for

electricity supplies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The draft regulations now under review will

shortly be presented to the Public Utilities Board

for  approval  before enactment under  the  Public

Utilities Act.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan (Crawford):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

will  the Minister inform the House whether  there

has been consultation with the relevant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>



professional bodies in the drafting of regulations

before such a draft is finally accepted?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I am sure there has been

consultation   with   the   professional   bodies.

However,  if  the  Member will let  me  know  what

professional body he has in mind, and if  we  find

that they have a standing in their profession,  we

will  certainly  try to get their  views  oil  the

legislation that will be enacted.

<div align="center"><b>PUBLIC UTILITIES BOARD</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Results of salary consolidation exercise)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Low Yong Nguan</b> asked the Prime Minister

(a) if he will ascertain from the Public Utilities

Board (i) how many officers of the Board have  had

their  take-home pay reduced in the recent  salary

consolidation exercise; and (ii) how many officers

have had to pay arrears to the Municipal Provident

Fund in excess of their monthly salary; and (b) if

he  is  satisfied that as a result of the exercise

there have been improvement and simplification  in

the salary structures.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the exercise on  consolidation  of

salaries  was to integrate the basic  salary  with

the  variable allowance into an all-in salary;  in

other words, what were allowances before have  now

been  incorporated  into  the  salary  proper.  As

donation  and  contribution to the Provident  Fund

will  be  based on the consolidated  salary,  some

1,389  out of a total of 2,756 officers will  have

their take-home pay reduced. There is, however, an

increase  in the gross emoluments drawn  by  these

officers  because of the larger amount of donation

made  by the Board to the Provident Fund. For  the

30-month period from 1st January, 1969, the  total

increase in the Board's donation to Provident Fund

would   amount  lo  51,350,700,  averaging   about

$40,000 a month.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some 79 out of 839 officers who ate members of

the  Municipal Provident Fund have to pay  arrears

in  excess of their monthly-consolidated  salaries

to the Fund covering the 30-month period. However,

they  have the option to pay these arrears in  one

lump sum or by 12 monthly instalments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of the exercise on consolidation has

been  a  reduction  of 88 basic salary  scales  of

senior, junior and subordinate officers grades  to

25 key scales.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the consolidation of salaries, emoluments

drawn by the staff are based on services rendered,

irrespective of sex or marital status, a principle

recommended by the Harvey Commission and  accepted

by Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The improvement in salary and salary structure

is  reflected by the fact that 93.1  per  cent  of

monthly  paid staff, (that is, 2,756 out of  2,961

officers)   have   opted   to   accept   the   new

consolidated salaries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan:</b> Sir, in the case of officers

opting  to  pay  their arrears  to  the  Municipal

Provident  Fund in instalments, can  the  Minister

let  us  know whether interest has been added  for

paying such arrears in instalments?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we do not

believe  in giving anything f tee. We are charging

six per cent interest on the loan. This is cheaper

than they can get anywhere.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan:</b> The point is this. The

arrears have been accumulated not because  of  the

fault  of the officers, it is due to the delay  in

the  implementation of the consolidation which was

recommended  some  two  and  a  half  years   ago.

Therefore,  how can the P.U.B, justify its  action

in  adding  interest to the arrears  which  should

have  been  paid long ago if they  had  been  more

efficient in their consolidation exercise?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

consolidation  exercise did not  depend  upon  one

party. It was arrived at and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>



agreed  upon  after  long  negotiations  with  the

officers. So if the P.U.B, is to be blamed, then I

say  the officers are to be equally blamed. On the

whole,  they  gain; they do not lose.  As  I  have

pointed out, the Public Utilities Board is out  of

pocket  by about $40,000 a month. Let me tell  the

Member  here  that if I had my way, it  would  not

have  been  backdated to 1st January 1969.  It  is

just  because the Board made an error in promising

the staff that consolidation would be backdated to

1st  January  1969. The question of backdating  is

one on which I hold very strong views indeed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan:</b> There should have been no

backdating, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, an option was

given   to   the   officers  whether   to   accept

consolidation  or  not.  Whether  it   should   be

backdated  to  1st  January,  1969,  or   not   is

something which was forced on me. I would say that

most  of the P.U.B, officers supported backdating.

They  wanted it to be backdated because they would

gain  in  the  long  run.  Consolidation,  in  the

majority  of  cases, means an  increase  in  total

emoluments though the take-home pay would be less.

If  I  had  known  earlier that the  Member  would

prefer  not  to have it back-dated to 1st  January

1969,  I  would have conscripted his services  and

probably the P.U.B, could have saved quite  a  lot

of money.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan:</b> If the P.U.B, had been more

efficient in getting the correct views, Sir, ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the Member asking a supplementary

question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan:</b> No, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister of

Defence  how  many applications for  deferment  of

National Service have been received since January,

1971, and how many of them have been (i)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>



approved,   and  the  circumstances   for   which

approval was given; and (ii) rejected.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Sir,

a total of 189 applications for deferment of full-time  national  service were  received  from  1st

January,  1971, to 16th July, 1971.  Applications

for  deferment  generally fall under  three  main

categories:  namely,  (1)  social  or   financial

hardship; (2) business disintegration; and (3) in

the case of Government employees or employees  of

statutory boards, the exigencies of the service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifty-four applications were approved on grounds

of  social  or financial hardship,  and  17  were

rejected.  Thirty-two applications were  approved

on  grounds  of business disintegration,  and  22

were  rejected. Forty-three applications received

on  grounds of the exigencies of the service were

approved, while 21 were rejected.

<div align="center"><b>PUBLIC BUS SERVICE REORGANISATION</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Complaints of dissatisfaction and steps to improve situation)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Communications,  (a) since the reorganisation  of

the  public  bus service, how many complaints  of

dissatisfaction  over  bus  services  have   been

received  by  his Ministry from  members  of  the

public,  and  whether  the complaints  have  been

dealt  with  immediately; and (h) whether  he  is

aware  that  there  are irregular  departures  of

buses  from bus termini with the result  that  it

takes half an hour before the next bus arrives at

a bus-stop or that several buses bearing the same

service number arrive at the same time, and  what

steps he has taken to improve the situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir:(a) As a result of the

recent bus services reorganisation, the number of

written  complaints received by  the  Suggestions

Action  Unit  (P.O. Box 6000)  of  the  Ministry,

which was set up on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>



5th  March,  1971, more than a month  before  the

reorganisation, was 348.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These, however, included 65 letters which were

anonymous, that is, without name or address, thus

making   it   impossible  for  our  Ministry   to

acknowledge or to follow up on them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining 283 letters, of which 226 were in

English,  49 in Chinese and eight in Tamil,  were

first  acknowledged  by  the  Ministry  and   the

complainants  were subsequently  advised  of  the

remedial decisions that were taken; whether  they

were found acceptable, as proposed, or acceptable

after  suitable amendments had been made, or  not

acceptable but with reasons therefor, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may interest the Member for Sembawang if I

give  him  some indication of the nature  of  the

complaints   received.  They  may  be  classified

broadly as follows:



<pre>

           Type of complaint                      Number  of

		                                  complaints



   (i)  Deprivation of former service                 80

  (ii)  Dissatisfaction over no direct service        78

 (iii)  Poor or irregular frequecy                    78

  (iv)  Bus fares                                     19

   (v)  Service numbers on buses not visible          19

  (vi)  Complaints regarding routes being too

          long and circuitous                         10

 (vii)  Time schedule

          (first bus/last bus leaving terminal)        9

(viii) Complaints against bus drivers/conductors       5

(ix)   Complaints regarding old buses                  2

                                                     ---

                                                     300

                                                     ===

</pre>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we dealt with 283 letters, of course, some

letters  of  complaint did contain more  than  one

type of complaint.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Regarding the irregular departure of buses

from  bus termini resulting in irregular and  poor

frequency  along  the  routes,  the  Bus  Services

Licensing  Authority, as well as the  Registry  of

Vehicles,   are  fully  aware  of  this  perennial

problem,  which  occurs  whenever  there  is  poor

management control over the bus drivers or because

of  traffic congestion upsetting bus schedules. To

counter this, the Bus Services Licensing Authority

requires  all  bus  companies to  furnish  to  the

Authority  a  Performance  Bond  of  $100,000  per

company,  under  the  new Bus  Services  Licensing

Authority  Act, which came into operation  on  1st

March  1971.  Any company, which is  found  to  be

giving poor services, without any good reason,  is

liable to a financial penalty deductible from  the

Performance  Bond. The staff of the  Investigation

Section   of   the   R.O.V.,   which   is    being

strengthened,  will  keep  observation  over   the

performance  of  the bus companies  by  conducting

routine  checks, or on receipt of complaints  from

the  public,  to ensure that the bus companies  do

provide a more regular and efficient service  than

what  was  available  prior to  the  bus  services

reorganisation in April this year.

Speaker,     Sir,    by    "foreign    undesirable

publications",  I presume the Member  for  Thomson

has in mind the Chinese chain comic books imported

mainly from Hongkong. These books, as you can  see

from  the samples here, are poor in quality, crude

in  production and seem to contain nothing  except

violence, bloodshed, ghosts and demons,  and  even

sex.  We consider them to be very harmful  to  the

young children and have always been trying to slop

them  from  being  imported  into  Singapore.  Our

methods    include   Post   Office   and   Customs

interceptions  and  periodic  surprise  raids   on

bookshops known to be specialising in this kind of

comic books. I myself have personally made appeals

to  the Singapore Chinese Booksellers' Association

to  restrain  their  members from  importing  such

books. But there are always the black sheep in the

flock.  We  have tried several ways to stop  them,

but  they  are always one up on us. I presume  the

profit  that they derive from selling  such  books

must be quite substantial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, our criteria on these books are

different  from those in Malaysia. This difference

has  been  exploited  by the operators  in  recent

months.  They first import the books quite  openly

into Malaysia and then smuggle them into Singapore

through our Woodlands



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>



check-point where we had no inspector to check on

book  parcels.  However, since March  this  year,

measures  have been taken to remedy  this.  Since

then, more than l9,000 copies of these books have

been confiscated and destroyed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to keep a close watch on these

operators  and, if necessary, very  stern  action

will be taken against them. But this alone is not

enough. We want the help of parents, teachers and

the civic-minded public. They should report to us

whenever they find these books being sold in  the

bookshops.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui) (for the Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move the motion standing in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>



name of the Minister for Labour, namely,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to subsection (3) of section 66 of the Factories Act (Chapter 123, 1970 Edition), resolves that the Building Operations and Works of Engineering Construction Regulations, 1971, made on the 18th day of March, 1971, and published as Notification No. S 96 in the Gazette

Subsidiary Legislation Supplement No. 21  of  26th

March,  1971, as contained in Paper  S.L.  16  of

1971, be approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the past few years, my Ministry has

been  very perturbed and greatly concerned at  the

steady  rise in the number of accidents  occurring

in   the  building  and  engineering  construction

industry.   Statistics  show  that  279  accidents

occurred in the industry in 1969, and in 1970 this

figure rose to 376, a rise of nearly 35 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first six months of 1971, reports of 166

accidents  have been received. What is  even  more

tragic is the number of persons killed as a result

of  these  accidents.  In 1969,  17  persons  were

reported  killed  in the building and  engineering

construction  industry. In 1970 it was  19.  Until

June  this  year, nine fatal accidents  have  been

reported.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above figures illustrate the urgent need for

the   adoption  of  higher  standards  of   safety

measures   in   the   building   and   engineering

construction  industry. But experience  has  shown

that mere exhortations and appeals to the goodwill

of the employers and the good sense of the workers

to  be  more safety conscious have been of  little

avail.  My Ministry is therefore of the view  that

definite guidelines are necessary. The Regulations

now  before  the  House not  only  strengthen  the

provisions  of the Factories Act relating  to  the

health,  safety  and welfare of the  workers,  but

also   provide  for  safety  measures  of  special

application   to  the  building  and   engineering

construction  industry.  The  cardinal   principle

enunciated  in  these  Regulations  is  that   the

required  safety  measures  for  any  project   or

construction  work  should be  incorporated  right

from the design stage and not left to be added  on

as an afterthought or when accidents



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>



have  already  occurred. The basic provisions  for

safety  should therefore be `i major consideration

at   all   stages  and  levels  of  planning   and

implementation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Regulations also stress the need for

qualified and competent persons to erect or set up

the requisite safety measures and to make frequent

inspections  to  ensure that  these  are  properly

maintained and correctly used. The Regulations not

only  require the employer to provide safe working

conditions  but  also make it the  duty  of  every

employee  to  co-operate  in  carrying   out   the

Regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hoped that with the implementation of

these  comprehensive,  unequivocal  and  stringent

Regulations,   workers   in   the   building   and

construction industry will enjoy a greater measure

of safety at their working places and also enjoy a

higher standard of health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

it  is  all  very well to have all the  rules  and

regulations, but how about their  enforcement?  I

think  the  Factory Inspectorate is not adequately

staffed.  I  am just wondering what is the  latest

position  regarding the staffing  of  the  Factory

Inspectorate. Will the Minister please inform  the

House?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, at the last

sitting  of  Parliament, if I  remember  correctly

indications    were   given   that    a    special

Establishment Warrant would be issued to  get  the

necessary  staff. I am glad to say that  that  has

already  been  done,  and  that  almost  all   the

vacancies sc established have been filled.



<br><br>3.04 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,   industrialisation  and   the   process   of

construction have attendant hazards. In Singapore,

industrialisation and construction work are  going

on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>



rapidly.  The  consequence of a disregard  of  the

safety  rules to achieve a target is the cause  of

the  rising  number  of  industrial  accidents  in

recent   times.   This  is   recognised   in   the

President's  speech.  I am particularly  happy  to

make  an  observation of the introduction  of  the

Building   Operations  and  Works  of  Engineering

Construction  Regulations  which  would   provide,

among  other  things, comprehensive  measures  and

requirements designed to safeguard the health  and

safety  of workers at the building and engineering

construction  work  sites. These  Regulations  are

most necessary and timely. As is recognised by the

Government,  the  number  of  accidents  in   this

particular field has been the highest. It  can  be

expected that in the race against time to complete

building projects, the accident rate in this  area

will increase. For instance, the competition among

hoteliers  to  be the first to catch the  tourists

has  caused  the people concerned in the  building

project   to  disregard  all  safety   rules   and

precautions  necessary  for  the  safety  of   the

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was, for example, an instance at the

Mandarin  Hotel construction site  where  two  men

fell  to their death within a short space of time.

After the first death, the workers asked for  some

safety measures to be taken. Their request fell on

deaf  ears.  After  the second fall,  the  workers

stopped  work.  No one could blame  them  for  the

stoppage.  In  fact,  with so much  disregard  for

safety  by the contractors. I think we could  well

have  some more stoppages. We could not blame  the

workers  for  their militancy in this respect.  In

this  regard, when a trench wall collapsed at  the

construction site of Chartered Industries I  think

this is a company owned by the Government a worker

was buried and killed by an avalanche. The workers

downed tools, they said, as a mark of respect  for

their dead colleague. I think it is not only  good

wages  and  bonuses  that the  workers  should  be

concerned with, but also their safety and  health.

Therefore,  safety  and health standards  must  be

maintained at the highest possible



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>



level,  and  the introduction of these Regulations

is  most  welcome  to  the National  Trades  Union

Congress  though the workers in the  building  and

construction  field  are not  organised.  In  this

regard,  I  think the Chief Inspector of Factories

should pay some particular attention to reduce the

safety hazards, which the workers face day by day.

It is immaterial whether they are citizens or non-citizens.  There  are  some  10.000  citizens,   I

believe, who are engaged in construction work. For

humanitarian  reasons,  I  think  more   attention

should be paid to reduce the safety hazards, which

the  workers in the engineering construction field

face.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make another point. Attempts

should  be  made to correct attitudes towards  the

question  of safety. We can find one thousand  and

one  excuses to ignore safety hazards.  Among  the

excuses there is one quite commonly given  when  a

rational  answer  cannot be  found  to  a  problem

whether  it is in respect of culture or  safety  -

that it is our Asian way of life. I think we could

well profit by adopting some Western habits. There

was  one incident, which comes to my mind. When  I

was  in Canada in 1963, as a V.I.P., I was brought

to  a  construction site because  the  union  boss

there wanted to show me the pride of his town.  My

host  took  me  to  inspect the showpiece  of  his

union. Hardly had we been in the building for five

minutes  when  I heard a loud voice shouting  like

"Get  out" several times. My host, the union  boss

tried  to  explain  to  the foreman,  "We  have  a

V.I.P.". That explanation was totally disregarded.

He was shouted down and practically abused. We got

out of the building. After he had cooled down, the

foreman  heard  the union boss' explanation.  Very

politely,  he brought us in after he  had  ordered

some  helmets for us. This is the kind of attitude

which  foremen or mandores engaged by  contractors

in  our own building and construction site; should

have. Unfortunately, they have not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I can say is that the N.T.U.C, welcome these

Regulations. We have made a study of  them  and  I

think we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>



could  have a period of experimentation,  and,  if

need be, make the necessary amendments as a result

of experience.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am in entire

agreement  with  the sentiments expressed  by  the

Member  for  Kallang. I think  the  staff  of  the

Ministry of Labour, like any other citizen or non-citizen   for  that  matter,  is  aware   of   the

importance  of  measures  to  save  lives  and  of

preventing accidents happening anywhere.

following motion standing in my name, namely,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section

4  of  the  Foreshores  Ordinance  (Chapter  246),

approves  the  reclamation by Government  of  that

portion  of  the  foreshore and  seabed  at  Pasir

Panjang  containing  an area of  approximately  91

acres  as  shown edged in red on the  plan  marked

"LAND  OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 1/71" which  is

deposited in the Land Office, Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a result of rapid industrialisation and

expansion of trade in recent years, the  need  for

more warehousing facilities has become acute.  The

Port   of  Singapore  Authority,  which  has  been

assigned  the task of developing a new warehousing

complex, proposes to develop the area along  Pasir

Panjang  Road  as shown edged in yellow,  coloured

purple  and  brown, and edged in red on  the  plan

marked "LAND OFFICE REXCLAMATION PLAN NO. 1/71", a

copy  of which is displayed in the library of this

House  for  the  information of Members  for  this

purpose. This area has been chosen because of  its

close proximity to the harbour, the railways,  the

Jurong  Industrial Estate, the proposed  container

depot  at  Clementi  Road,  and  other  facilities

relevant to warehousing. It comprises State  lands

(shown  edged in yellow on the plan which will  be

alienated   to   the  Authority),  private   lands

(coloured  purple  on  the plan  which  are  being

acquired  for  the Authority), the reclaimed  land

(coloured  brown, about 4.5 acres  in  area),  and

foreshore and seabed (edged in red on the plan).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to enable the development to be

carried  out,  it  is  necessary  to  reclaim  the

foreshore and seabed, as shown edged in red on the

plan, the area to be reclaimed being approximately

91 acres in area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Port of Singapore Authority will reclaim the

foreshore  and seabed as agent of the  Government.

The  cost  is estimated at about $20 million.  The

fill



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>



will  be taken from the surplus earth cut  in  the

development  of the hilly areas of  Telok  Blangah

and  its vicinity. The reclamation is expected  to

be completed in about two years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Parliament of the Republic of Singapore,

express our thanks to the President for the speech

which he delivered on behalf of the Government at

the opening of the Second Session of this

Parliament.".'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a great honour for me to move this motion

as  the 58th Member of this 58-Member House. It is

my   practice   to   address  my  colleague,   the

Honourable  Member  for Kampong  Kapor,  with  due

deference  as "Mr. 57", for he had his victory  at

the 1970 by-elections declared five minutes before

mine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President began his speech with these words:

"After six years of separate independence, we have

shown that Singapore is viable."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those words constitute a simple statement of

fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were many who were saddened by the

separation of our country from Malaysia six  years

ago.  Our  leaders and people then knew  that  the

road   ahead  as  an  independent  and   sovereign

Republic  of Singapore would be a hard  one.  They

must    today    look   back   with   considerable

satisfaction on what has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>



been    achieved.   Characteristically,   however,

because  of  the sterner stuff of which  they  are

made,  our  people  seek still higher  performance

from themselves for our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our President observed, we want the quality

of  life to go up. The quality of life for  us  in

Singapore, like our Housing and Development  Board

flats which house one in three of our people,  has

no  alternative but to go up. For it not to go  up

is   to   expose   our  people  to   poverty   and

degradation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we are rapidly becoming a nation. Our

people  today  are able to cohere and  to  respond

collectively  to challenges to the Republic.  They

have  a  stake here. Some 700,000 of our  citizens

live in 125,000 H.D.B, flats. Another 500,000 will

live  in the 100,000 flats to be built in the next

five  years, some of which will be located in  Ulu

Pandan.   These  flats  are  subsidised   by   the

Government. Thus the less affluent of  our  people

are  directly benefiting from the wealth  that  is

being  generated in Singapore. The more well-to-do

have  homes  in the many fine housing estates  and

blocks of luxury flats that abound in our island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt whatsoever that our people will

defend what they have created and what they own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also confident that I speak for all Members

in  this House that we will not be deflected  from

our   course   towards   a  modern,   multiracial,

democratic and industrialized island-nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three years ago, the debate following the speech

of  our late President Yusof Bin Ishak was sombre.

We  faced  many  problems then,  for  the  British

Government   had   decided  to  accelerate   their

military  withdrawal. The Member for Nee  Soon  on

that  occasion spoke about maintaining a  rate  of

growth  of  Gross Domestic Product  of  eight  per

cent.  There  must have been many  at  that  time,

academic  economists included  those adherents  of

that dismal science - who must have thought him an

incorrigible optimist. But his confidence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>



in  the  will and determination of our people  was

well founded. If today that Honourable Member were

to  predict the same rate of growth of  eight  per

cent for our economy, which I am sure he will not,

he  would  be  suspected  of  being  a  congenital

pessimist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the measure of our success in overcoming

our economic problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, not all of our problems are solved by

a mere doubling of the rate of growth of the Gross

Domestic  Product. The Minister of Defence  sagely

observed  in a recent speech that economic  growth

by  itself does not necessarily generate happiness

all  round. I will only add the trite comment that

the absence of such growth can be relied upon most

assuredly to generate the greatest unhappiness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the six years since our separation from

Malaysia,  the average annual growth rate  of  our

Gross   Domestic  Product  was  12.8   per   cent.

Previously,  in  the six years before  separation,

the  average annual growth rate was 7.6 per  cent.

We  therefore  have  cause for  satisfaction.  But

there  are new problems which we had not  hitherto

faced as the various parts of the addendum to  the

President's speech remind us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Science and Technology is taking

steps  to  establish an "indigenous  technological

capability",  and  the Ministry  of  Education  to

expand  the  supply  of  technical  skills.  These

measures   to   overcome  the  present   temporary

shortage of skilled labour are to be commended. In

this   respect,  though  Ulu  Pandan  is  not   an

industrial   constituency,  we   also   contribute

towards meeting the challenge of industrialization

with our Dunearn Secondary Technical School.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am fully in support of the declared intention

of  the Ministry of Labour to punish "recalcitrant

employers  wilfully  neglecting  the  safety   and

health  of workers", and to treble the quantum  of

workmen's  compensation.  We  have  earlier   this

afternoon   heard  how  urgent  the   problem   of

workmen's safety is from the Minister of State for

Labour. Workers have strong voices in this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>



House, as we also recently heard. For example, the

efforts of the Honourable Member for Kallang  have

led   to  silicosis  being  regarded  now  as   an

occupational disease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in full agreement with Government's view

that  employers who have been making  "exceptional

profits"   ought   to  give  better   bonuses   in

recognition  of the workers' contribution  to  the

present  economic prosperity. I also believe  that

workers  must  obtain an increasing share  in  the

wealth  generated  as a result  of  their  greater

efficiency  and productivity. This will  no  doubt

come after the effects of the British military run-down have been assessed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are really all workers, as some of my friends

in  the University of Singapore have at long  last

recognized. They have organised a trade union.  It

is  to be hoped that they will recognize, too, the

common interests of all workers, whether they work

standing up or sitting down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President touched on a crucial problem

arising out of our rapid economic growth.  We  are

making  the  transition  from  an  economy   based

largely  on  entrepot trade and  services  to  one

based  on manufacturing and services. We  run  the

risk  that  some of our businessmen have  not  yet

been  able  to distinguish between entrepreneurial

and  managerial skills. It is one thing  to  be  a

successful merchant; it is quite another to be the

successful manager of a large corporation - be  it

manufacturing,   servicing,   transportation   and

communications  or, for that matter,  finance  and

banking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a very different thing to study or to

teach political history or political science,  and

to participate in the political process itself. So

it is with the study and teaching of Economics and

Business  Administration and the practice  of  the

market place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether we should not attempt to reduce

the  distance  between  our  two  Universities  in

Singapore  on the one hand, and Raffles  Place  on

the   other.  The  Universities  can  provide  the

theoretical  conceptual framework and intellectual

discipline. Raffles Place can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>



demonstrate how important are considerations of  P

and   L,  namely,  Profit  and  Loss,  of  meeting

deadlines and can provide potential managers  with

on-the-job experience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Science and Technology recently

called   for  a  diminution  of  distrust  between

academics  and  bureaucrats.  I  support  him  and

further   propose  greater  co-operation   between

academics and business executives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a new breed of managers, professional in

their  approach to the problems of a manufacturing

economy   and  international  in  their   outlook,

because  our  industries are export-oriented.  Our

banks  ought to consolidate, to co-operate and  to

upgrade  management skills so that we  can  become

international bankers. It is a sad fact  that  our

11 domestic banks have a total of only 11 branches

overseas, excluding Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water is one problem that interests several

Ministries.   When  Stamford   Raffles   came   to

Singapore  in  1819,  one of  its  attractions  in

addition  to its strategic location and  excellent

natural  harbour was the abundance of  good  fresh

water.  However,  the increased  demand  resulting

from  the rapid expansion of homes for our  people

and  the  development of industries has  caused  a

temporary shortage of supply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we have a seasonal surplus, the Ministry of

National  Development intervenes, Members  of  the

House will be pleased to know that the Bukit Timah

Flood Alleviation Scheme, which is located in  Ulu

Pandan,  is nearing completion. When we  have  too

little  of water, as in recent months, the  Public

Utilities  Board  of the Prime  Minister's  Office

becomes involved, and we M.P.s go around exhorting

people to conserve its use. After effective  anti-pollution  measures, we can extract  one-third  of

the average daily rainfall of 750 million gallons.

We  will then be able to meet the demand for water

for  many  years to come. The Ministry  of  Health

also  has an interest in water, or rather in those

people     who,     through    inadvertence     or

inconsideration, breed mosquitoes in it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The progress that we have achieved is the hard

work  of  a political leadership, a civil service,

men  and  women  in the uniformed  services,  both

labour  and management in the private sector,  who

by  and large lived through a period when Asia was

convulsed by revolutionary changes. These  changes

sharpened their awareness of the forces of history

that were at play and they responded positively to

the challenges of the time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revolutionary changes, such as military

occupation by an external power, will not be

allowed to happen again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not mean that there are no longer

challenges  to grip the imagination of our  young,

no  problems  for  them to grapple  with.  One  of

Magellan's  ships  circumnavigated  the  globe  in

1521. It was a singular feat by any standard.  But

in  1969 Neil Armstrong landed on the moon, a feat

that  I  myself stayed up all night  to  watch  on

London Television.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our burgeoning industries and the expressed

intention  of our Government to make  Singapore  a

financial centre open vast opportunities  for  the

diligent, the able and the enterprising. Also open

are  careers  in  the uniformed services  and  the

teaching profession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the young who have not undergone the

metamorphosis   brought  about  by   revolutionary

changes  must consciously develop their  political

instincts in order to enjoy their inheritance  and

to build upon it. If they should become complacent

and negligent, they will run into difficulties  in

the years ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Foreign Affairs addendum has

noted  some of the major recent developments.  The

Indian  Ocean  has  joined the  Pacific  Ocean  in

attracting the interest of the big Powers.  We  in

Singapore are one main connexion between these two

oceans.  Like  the real estate in  Ulu  Pandan  in

recent  years,  the  value of Singapore  has  also

risen very considerably.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are too small a country to be able to

influence appreciably the attitudes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>



and  policies of the big Powers. However, we  must

be   certain  that  we  understand  and  interpret

correctly  their real intentions so  that  we  can

plan for the best interests of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we need to establish closer

ties  with our Southeast Asian neighbours. We need

to   learn  what  are  their  problems  and  their

achievements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education in recent years

organised  two  seminars, one on "South-east  Asia

Today" and the other on "Communism and Democracy".

The seminars gave our Pre-University students some

insight  into these problems and the  thinking  of

our  leaders on them. They also served to  provoke

greater  thought and discussion among the students

themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my association with these seminars as well

as meeting students in the University of Singapore

and  schools,  I  am  greatly  encouraged  by  the

positive and realistic approach of most of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge Government to send parties

of  our students to visit our neighbours in South-east Asia, beginning possibly with the close ASEAN

countries. We already offer scholarships for ASEAN

students  to  come  to  Singapore,  but   we   can

encourage larger numbers to come on visits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that our young people would like to

have their views heard and some of their proposals

implemented.  Mere articulation of  ideas  may  be

good  for the ego, but ideas are of little benefit

to  the people at large unless they are tested and

put into operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, the great challenge of this decade is for

us  to survive and progress as an independent  and

sovereign  nation in the fluid situation  that  is

being very rapidly created in South-east Asia.  We

will  need  the ingenuity of all our  people,  the

young  and  the  not  so young,  to  steer  safely

through the rough waters ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also suggest to Government to send

abroad    groups   of   our   community   leaders,

particularly members of the Citizens' Consultative

Committees   and   community   centre   management

committees. They can see for themselves the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>



problems and achievements of our neighbours. I am

sure  there will be much that they can  learn  to

put to good use for our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on that note I wish to thank you, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, and Members of the House  for  the

courtesy and patience you have shown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  in the history of mankind,  there

are  examples of small countries which were  very

prosperous  and  strong;  for  instance   ancient

Phoenicia  and medieval Venice are good examples.

Even  in  recent times, we have examples of  some

small countries surrounded by stronger countries,

such as Finland, which is encircled by Russia and

Sweden;  Switzerland,  which  is  surrounded   by

France,  Germany and Italy; and Israel, which  is

surrounded by the Arab countries. These countries

are  all  independent and yet they  can  survive.

Moreover,   they   have  also   developed   their

countries  and have not become the appendices  of

stronger powers. The reason is that their society

is  not  made  up  of loose and  pleasure-seeking

people. We can see from this that the success  or

failure of nation building depends mainly on  the

type  of people. Success comes if the people have

a  strong  will,  a united purpose  and  national

consciousness, and who will always think in terms

of  the  interest of the whole country. They  are

united in the common purpose of forming a closely-knit society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 9th August. 1965, when Singapore was

forced  to  be independent, we, a small  country,

have  managed  to survive and progress.  When  we

became  independent,  our Government  immediately

announced  to  the  world  that  we  will  be  an

independent and neutral country, and that we will

be  friend  with all the other countries  of  the

world We want to make as many friends as possible

and  as  fewer  enemies as  possible.  With  this

foreign   policy  and  posture  we  entered   the

international  arena.  Only  with  this  kind  of

policy  can we ensure our survival in this  fluid

region in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>



Southeast Asia, which is the arena of Super-power

politics. We have no other alternatives. We  must

be  determined to live on. During these six years

under  the  judicious leadership and guidance  of

our  Government, with their timely  judgment  and

the various measures taken for the benefit of the

people,   we  have  seen  prosperity  and   great

progress  in  our commerce and industry.  We  now

have  political stability, peace and social well-being.  Our people are contented with their  lot.

But we can only maintain our prosperity, economic

progress and growth provided we have the will  to

survive,   the  determination  to  maintain   our

independence  and sovereignty, a united  national

consciousness, co-operation with one another, and

if  we  redouble  our  efforts  towards  national

regeneration.  In addition to  this,  if  we  are

resolute, we will achieve much, not only  in  the

political  field  hut  also  in  the  spheres  of

defence, economy, culture, education, health, and

social activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the policy speech made by the President on

the  21st  of  this month paints  a  very  bright

future  and  shows  us a guiding  path  to  tread

along.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would like to touch upon the effect

which  Singapore's rapid growth  and  development

has  on  the people of Thomson Constituency.  Our

land  is limited. Unless we can make full use  of

it  many otherwise good plans may not be  of  any

use.  The Housing and Development Board  has  all

along   taken   the  correct  measures   in   the

acquisition and use of land. It has received  the

support  and praise of all our people. Under  the

urban  renewal  plans  in  Thomson  Constituency,

Government has acquired 42 acres of land  in  the

vicinity of Sin Ming Road. It intends to  develop

the  area  into  an industrial estate  for  motor

vehicles  and to build a motor vehicle inspection

centre. There will also be facilities for vehicle

spare parts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a plan to build 21 blocks of standard

type  factories  consisting  of  269  units,  and

another  plan to build three blocks of 12 storey-flats  totalling 500 units of premises, including

shop premises on the ground floors. The Housing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>



and  Development Board has also a plan to  acquire

200  acres  of  land along the 5th  and  7th  mile

stretch  of  Upper Thomson Road for new industrial

sites and also to develop a marketing centre.  All

these  plans will definitely affect the livelihood

of the people living there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the vicinity of Sin Ming Road have

now accepted the new rates of compensation and  ex

gratia payments for resettlement announced by  the

Government.     Following    the    transportation

improvement planning and the development of  Upper

Thomson  Road  under  the road  expansion  scheme,

about  100  to  200 shop premises  there  will  be

affected.  However, the Government is planning  to

build  new  shop  premises and a marketing  centre

along  the  5th  mile and the 6th  mile  of  Upper

Thomson  Road,  so that alternative  accommodation

will  be  available. Those affected will  also  be

given  higher rates of compensation and ex  gratia

payments.  They are also satisfied  with  the  new

types  of  shop premises to be allocated to  them.

But they have one common request to make, that is,

the   authorities   concerned  under   the   house

ownership  scheme should enable them to buy  their

shop  premises  for  their own use  on  instalment

terms,  and  not  to allocate the  premises  on  a

rental basis. I would also request the Housing and

Development     Board    to    give    sympathetic

consideration to the requests of these people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a question relating to the problem of

hawkers, which requires a solution. At the  moment

the  Government is trying to resite  the  hawkers.

This  move calls for our support. According  to  a

report  by  the  Hawkers  Department, in  Thomson

Constituency  there are 236 hawkers  of  whom  155

live  there. The Housing and Development Board  is

building  a  market  at the 5 m.s.  Thomson  Road,

which  can accommodate 238 stalls including stalls

for  cooked food hawkers. 1 hope that the  Hawkers

Department  will  allow all  the  hawkers  in  the

Thomson area to move into this new market. I  also

hope  that the Housing and Development Board  will

give sympathetic consideration to the applications

of these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>



hawkers  so  that  they can  move  into  this  new

market,   thereby  satisfactorily  solving   their

problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on behalf of the people of Thomson

Constituency, I express my support and  thanks  to

the policy speech made by the President.



<br><br>3.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir., I rise to support

the  motion  in  the name of the  Member  for  Ulu

Pandan to express our thanks to the President  for

the  speech  which he delivered on behalf  of  the

Government at the opening of the Second Session of

Parliament on 21st July, 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two problems face all new countries regardless

of  whether  they  are in Asia,  Africa  or  South

America. The first is the problem of making  newly

independent countries economically viable, so that

with  a  rising Gross National Product the  people

can   enjoy   their  freedom  with  dignity.   All

indications  are  that we will  continue  to  make

greater  economic progress. A member of  the  U.S.

Presidential Commission on International Trade and

investment Policy, who is also the Chairman of the

First  National  City Bank of  Chicago,  recently,

remarked   "Singapore's  thriving   business   and

industry   have  become  a  model  for  developing

nations around the world." He also predicted  that

the  Asian  Dollar market in Singapore  will  grow

fivefold from U.S.$400 million to US$2 billion  in

the next two or three years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second problem is that of political and

social  stability. Without this there will  be  no

peace,  and without peace there can be no economic

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to dwell at length on the question of

political  and  social stability in  our  country.

Singapore  is  not  the only multi-racial,  multi-religious  aid multi-cultural society amongst  the

new countries in the world. We have inherited this

plural  society from the British,  and  since  the

PAP,  came  to power in 1959, we have persistently

carried  out  educational and  cultural  policies,

which are aimed at uniting the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the differences of race, culture,

language  and religion, Singaporeans have  by  and

large   accepted  the  realities  of  life.  Their

approach   to   problems   arising   from    these

differences  is  both tolerant and  pragmatic.  We

have  learned  to  live together  as  one  people,

despite  our  different racial origins,  cultures,

religions and languages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1959, the P.A.P. Government has from time

to   time  taken  firm  action  in  putting   down

communalistic,  chauvinistic  or   any   kind   of

extremist  agitation.  We  remember  vividly   the

riotous  days of 1964 when religion and  race  was

exploited.  This  brought death and  suffering  to

Singaporeans  of  all  races.  In  May  1969,  the

Government,  in quick anticipation,  quelled  what

could    have    been    a   nasty    inter-racial

conflagration. And in May this year the Government

took   drastic  action  against  journalists   and

newspapers  to  prevent what  could  have  led  to

violent riots similar to those of 1964.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to remain a united people, we must

concentrate on the factors which bind us  together

and not those, which will divide us. The events in

May  this  year showed that communalism  need  not

raise its ugly head from among the Malay community

only.   Communalism  and  chauvinism  can  equally

emerge  from the majority community in  Singapore.

It  was  therefore  necessary  for  Government  to

demonstrate  that majority chauvinism also  cannot

be  tolerated.  The  fact is that  all  groups  in

Singapore, whether majority or  minority,  should

avoid  excesses  in  the  interplay  of  politics,

whether   they  are  agitated  on  the  basis   of

religion,  culture or language.  Sensitive  issues

should never be allowed to be exploited by anyone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of nation building must never be

lost  sight  of.  This is all the more  imperative

because,  although we have made great  strides  in

economic development, there is still much to do to

foster  a political community of Singaporeans  who

must   first  be  Singaporeans  and  next  Malays.

Indians,  Chinese  and  others.  Only  if  we  are

assured of this can there be political and  social

stability.  It  is true that, as Malays,  Chinese,

Indians and Eurasians we differ in our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>



traditional  values  and  culture,   but   it   is

nevertheless  important  that  we  cultivate   the

common  denominators  which make  us  Singaporeans

with  our  own political territory and  object  of

loyalty.  Although Singapore is  situated  in  the

Malay  Archipelago,  our ancestors  came  to  this

island as immigrants and have made it what  it  is

today  -  a  bustling, energetic  and  progressive

state.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multi-lingualism in Singapore as practised in

our  schools in the four languages is aimed, among

other things, at giving cultural ballast and roots

for   our   multi-racial   Singaporeans.   Malays,

Chinese,  Indians and others must continue  to  be

culturally  rooted  in  their  own  languages  and

literature. Young Singaporeans who emerge from our

Malay,  Chinese,  Tamil and English  schools  will

also  know  their own mother tongue besides  being

equipped with English, a language which will  give

them  the extra quality of being in close  contact

with the scientific and technological advances  in

the modern world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum to the speech by the President,

the   policy  of  giving  increased  and  improved

language   teaching  in  the  first   and   second

languages  has  been spelt out very clearly.  More

time  will be allotted in the primary schools  for

the  teaching of languages. This will be  done  in

order   that   students  will  become  effectively

articulate  in the first and second  languages  to

prepare  them  for  secondary education.  In  this

connection,  the  training of teachers  will  also

have  to  be  adjusted to provide  more  effective

teaching  of  bilingual students. It is  also  the

Government's   policy  to   expand   and   develop

technical education and industrial training at the

secondary school level until our secondary  school

students  finish  their  Secondary  IV.  In  other

words,  the emphasis from now on will  be  on  the

upgrading of skills through apprenticeship schemes

and joint training programmes with industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the British were in power ruling Singapore

as  a colony, it was only those who completed  the

English  school  system  who  were  assured  of  a

future. Now that we are independent, this  can  no

longer be so. Any attempt to revert our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>



education system to make English the sole  medium

of  instruction can only be an illogical backward

step  at  a  time  when  Asia  is  forging  ahead

politically,  economically and  culturally  after

centuries of colonialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those people who say that Malay, Chinese and

Tamil   school-leavers   are   at   an   economic

disadvantage   in   terms   of   employment   are

unwittingly  taking a negative attitude.  On  the

other  hand, we  should  take  a  positive   and

realistic  stand  in facing the  problem  of  job

opportunities. Surely the most effective  way  to

improve   employment  opportunities  for   Malay,

Chinese and Tamil school-leavers is to equip them

with an effective working knowledge of English as

a  second language and a third language as  well.

It  is already a fact in Singapore that there are

school-leavers from the Malay, Chinese and  Tamil

stream  schools who are as proficient in  English

as those from the English stream. What we have to

do  now is to increase their numbers so that they

will  not  be  at a disadvantage regarding  their

employment opportunities in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A school system in Singapore where English is

the  medium of instruction will fall short of its

own  target. In actual practice, it is  not  that

less economic value is placed on the Malay-medium

certificate, but that some employers  might  have

felt  that  the Malay-medium certificate  holders

have  not come up to the level of English  school

certificate  holders in their  comprehension  and

expression of the English language. This possibly

also  applies  to  certificate holders  from  the

Chinese and Tamil stream schools,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore obvious that the remedy lies in

giving  extra attention by all concerned  to  the

teaching  of  English in the  non-English  stream

schools.  This  should include improved  teaching

methods  of  English as a second  language,  more

English  teaching periods per week,  more  Malay!

English,  Chinese  /  English  and  Tamil/English

integrated   schools,  and  perhaps   a   greater

consciousness all round by principals,  teachers,

parents and pupils alike of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>



need  to  write  and  speak better  English.  The

obvious  solution  is  for  Singaporeans  to   be

effectively bilingual or trilingual.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing basically wrong with our multi-stream schools in the four official languages.

But  any attempt to turn our multi-stream schools

into  English  schools and label  them  "National

schools"  would amount to self-deceit. Worse,  it

is  a  defeatist attitude which is well expressed

in  the  Malay  proverb which  says  that  it  is

pointless  to bum the mosquito net  when  one  is

only irritated by a mosquito.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Integration of the races in Singapore can best

come about when our children grow up imbibed with

a  sense  of  belonging, patriotism and  love  of

Singaporean values. A psychological make-up which

develops on the basis of common interests  and  a

common  destiny is what will jell a multi-lingual

and  multi-racial community into a united nation.

The  English  language might be a useful  vehicle

for progress in the process of modernisation, but

it  cannot  give  us  the  cultural  strength  or

identity,  which  the Malay,  Chinese  and  Tamil

languages can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Practical politics in the multi-racial society

in Singapore is such that if a school system with

English as the medium of instruction is forced on

the  people,  then the hands of  chauvinists  and

racialists in the various linguistic groups  will

be  strengthened.  It will, in  fact,  amount  to

handing them the golden opportunity of exploiting

racial   and  language  sentiments  amongst   the

Chinese, Malays, and Indians which can only  lead

to  riots, violence and bloodshed, as happened in

Singapore some years ago. The language and racial

chauvinists  will  seize on this  opportunity  to

whip up emotions and proclaim that Chinese, Malay

and  Tamil  education  is  being  suppressed   in

Singapore.  The Government recently  has  had  to

take  action  against journalists and  newspapers

for  precisely  this  reason.  For  the  sake  of

Singapore's  continued stability and  prosperity,

we simply cannot allow a situation to be created,

innocently  or  otherwise,  where  the  continued

stability of Singapore is threatened,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I would like to add a note to the chorus of praise

for the President's speech to this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech, the President warned us against

working  up  heat on the gut issues over  language,

culture  and religion. In our multi-racial  society

we  have more than our share of differences but  we

should  never  allow ourselves to be  engulfed.  We

need  to build bridges of understanding and pillars

of  tolerance so that all Singaporeans,  no  matter

the  race, can strive for a better future  together

in  peace.  Over the last 12 years, Government  has

sought to instil the necessary values and attitudes

for the building of a cohesive society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key features of Government policy is

bilingual  education,  where  each  child  achieves

proficiency  in his own mother tongue and  English.

This  is  a  vast  and vita' improvement  over  the

colonial-type of education which all of us in  this

House  underwent where, if you went to an  English-medium  school,  unless you  could  afford  private

tuition,  you  had  no opportunity  to  study  your

mother tongue. In fact, I recall that even the  use

of  one's  own dialect was severely discouraged  in

school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Asian languages are rooted in strong

cultures, the best features of which are  going  to

be  important  determinants of the  development  of

Asian countries. Social discipline, respect for the

older  generation and for authority, the  love  and

respect  for learning-all these provide  resilience

and  cohesiveness for a developing society. We need

such  values  as  antidotes to  the  disintegrating

forces of western hippie culture. At the same time,

we  need  mastery or English as a  tool  for  rapid

economic    development   since   many    of    the

technological innovations stem for English-speaking

countries,  in  our multi-lingual society,  English

a1so    provides    a   convenient    bridge    for

communication.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have peace and prosperity in our multi-racial

society  we  should therefore curb our  prejudices,

allay our mutual



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>



suspicions,  mute the voices of extremism  and  dam

the  tides  of  passion.  There  must  be  constant

vigilance  on  the  part of Government  to  prevent

extremists  from  destroying  the  fabric  of   our

society. We should stand firmly behind the  actions

taken by Government against those who seek to  play

up   racial,   language,  cultural   or   religious

differences for their own devious ends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a small country but we are no less

entitled to our independence -to the right to chart

our  own  destiny.  There  are  insidious  external

forces, which seek to manipulate public opinion  so

as  to  weaken  our  national  will  and  make  our

Government more pliable to their wishes.  The  mass

media   are   particularly  susceptible   to   such

manipulation.  We should not confuse actions  taken

by Government to preserve the autonomy of Singapore

with the denial of freedom of the press.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People, especially intellectuals of western

liberal  persuasion,  should be  more  positive  in

their  appraisal  of social policies.  They  should

bear in mind that in a developing country there  is

so  much  building to be done that  free  criticism

that  lack  perspective and responsibility  can  be

highly  detrimental to the best  interests  of  our

society.  We  are  also  a small  country  so  that

individual  actions  can have far  wider  and  more

significant repercussions than similar  actions  in

bigger  countries. A riot, for example, at  Nanyang

University or the University of Singapore would  be

of  grave  national  concern. In  America,  a  huge

country,   with   hundreds  of   universities   and

colleges,  a  riot at any one of them  is  a  local

problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore urge our intellectuals to be

more  realistic  and  to have greater  perspective.

They should not be so ready to hurl accusations  of

dictatorship  and  label  our  society   a   closed

society. People who do, remind me forcefully of the

fable  of  the boy who cried "wolf" when there  was

none,  and  nobody heeded him when a  wolf  finally

came  and  devoured  him. Our intellectuals  should

visit  countries where democracy does not exist  to

see the vital differences for themselves.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we develop, our level of literacy and

intellectual sophistication will grow. People will

ask more searching, more substantive questions  of

their  leaders.  We must learn to  adjust  to  one

another. Political leaders will need not  only  to

have  substance in their programmes  but  will  be

expected  to  have  appropriate  style  as   well.

Intellectuals outside the political arena must  be

constructive  and realistic if  they  wish  to  be

taken  seriously.  They should remember  that  the

problems  they perceive, though real and seemingly

urgent,  may lose priority to bigger ones they  do

not see within their horizon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To effect a proper and rational dialogue, the

press must play its part responsibly. The habit of

slanting  reports or putting an angle to  a  story

make sensational headlines and presumably interest

more  readership. By doing so, however,  reporters

and  editors do public figures grave injustice and

damage. Politicians are always subject to scrutiny

and  what they say is always discounted with  some

scepticism.  The  least  that  they   deserve   is

accurate  coverage. I, for one, do  not  mind  any

amount   of  criticism,  provided  my  views   are

recorded   accurately.  I   consider   it   highly

unethical,  if  not mischievous and  cowardly,  to

distort  anybody's  views and then  to  criticize,

especially  in  pseudonymous columns.  Let  it  be

known  to  such people that I am always  ready  to

debate with them publicly and fairly anywhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of society do we want- a society where

everyone,    regardless   of   race    or    other

distinguishing characteristics, can have  equality

of  opportunity, a decent job, a decent  home  and

clean  surroundings,  or one where  people  suffer

discrimination, talk in hushed whispers  and  walk

the  streets in fear? From time to time the under-currents  of intolerance emerge in the columns  of

our  newspapers.  Not too long ago, for  example,

there   were  a  spate  of  letters  from  readers

discussing the appropriate use or non-use of  non-Chinese  names  by Chinese. Do we want  a  society

where we measure the worth of a man by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>



kind  of name he has, or by the way he writes  his

name?  I  do not want such a society, and,  if  it

comes  to  be,  I  do  not want  my  children  and

grandchildren to live in it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a small country, Sir, but limited though

we   are   by  lack  of  land  and  other  natural

resources,  there  is  no limit  to  the  economic

heights  that we can attain, provided we  organize

ourselves  properly and peacefully to acquire  the

necessary skills and to apply the ingenuity of our

people.  With  economic affluence  we  shall  have

plenty  of  room  for cultural development.  There

will, in other words, be plenty of room for all of

us  and our children and grandchildren provided we

are willing to be tolerant and understanding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With firm and fair government, we are doing

well. Our economy is flourishing and will continue

to flourish provided we are able to project enough

confidence  to  the  investor,  whether  local  or

foreign,  so  that he will build  his  factory  to

provide  the jobs we need. Our standard of  living

will  rise in two stages. In the initial stage  we

earn  higher  wages  by learning  more  skills  as

technicians,  engineers,  managers  and  marketing

personnel.  Then, when our economy  grows  richer,

even  those  with  no skills  can  have  a  higher

standard  of living because we shall  be  able  to

afford it collectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic organisation of our economy, given the

peculiar conditions we have, is necessarily  based

on   a   capitalistic,  free  enterprise   system.

Government policy, at present and in the immediate

future,  has  to be geared towards  providing  the

infrastructure  and the inducements  to  stimulate

economic  activity. There is  a  danger  that,  in

pursuing  these  necessary  objectives,   we   may

produce   large   numbers   of   technocrats   and

bureaucrats   with   no   social   compassion   or

sensitivity. From time to time, therefore, we need

to  remind ourselves of our socialistic aims of  a

more  equal and more just society. We need to give

adequate thought to the problems of the poor,  the

weak,  the  disabled and the displaced.  Sometimes

policy  measures, though economically and socially

indispensable, bear harshly on certain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>



sectors.  In  this respect, I greatly welcome  the

Government's move to increase compensation for the

resettlement of farmers and shopkeepers and others

affected  by  urban renewal. Our national  welfare

can rightly be considered to have improved if, and

only  if, those who are made better off do so  not

at the expense of others, or, if they do, there is

adequate and fair compensation. The poorer classes

should,  as a matter of firm principle,  never  be

made  to  pay  for economic or social  development

unless they themselves are clear beneficiaries  in

the end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a society where the great majority of people

are  poor  and  oppressed, there is  yet  hope  of

redress via a revolution, because intelligent,  if

not   developed,  leadership  exists  among  them.

However, in a modern, technological society, where

much  of the brainpower has emerged into the upper

and  controlling strata of society, the poor  have

neither political power via the voting booth,  nor

articulate  leadership among  their  ranks.  In  a

developed    society,   clearly   the    political

leadership  must avoid the hegemony of the  middle

and upper income classes if the poor people are to

get a fair deal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us, therefore, work for a society in

Singapore  where,  on  the one  hand,  people  are

rewarded and promoted on strict merit, and, on the

other,  ample opportunities are afforded to  those

who  are hampered by poverty. In other words,  let

us  build  not  merely  a society  based  only  on

meritocracy,  but  let us have a  meritocracy-plus

society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key measures available to a

government  in  a  democratic country  to  promote

greater  equality is the judicious use of the  tax

system.  I think it is time we had a comprehensive

review  of our system of taxation to achieve  more

socialism  without  hurting  efficiency.   Certain

taxes  are  inherently regressive, that  is,  they

bear  on  people who can least afford them.  I  am

concerned  about the incidence of  such  taxes  as

taxes  on P.U.B, bills, for example. Although  the

tax  is  graduated  with a higher  tax  on  bigger

bills,   poor  people  with  large  families   and

therefore,  using  more  utilities  are  adversely

affected.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there should also be taxes to discourage

lavish  consumption.  The reasons  for  advocating

such  taxes  are both economic and socialistic.  A

widening  income  gap between  rich  and  poor  is

inevitable  in  a society with rapid  development,

unless  there is government intervention.  In  the

first   place,  low-income  people  can  be  given

greater   earning  power  through  education   and

training.  We  can justify the rich  having  more,

provided  most of the accretion goes into  further

investment  to provide more jobs. If, instead,  it

goes  into lavish consumption, then the Government

should introduce taxes to take some of it away  to

be   spent  on  the  poor.  Moreover,  if   lavish

consumption is not controlled or discouraged,  the

demonstration  effect may be upsetting  to  poorer

people and may affect their motivation to work and

to  save  adversely.  The  Government,  therefore,

should  seriously consider heavy excise  taxes  on

luxury-type  cars, luxury-type flats, houses,  and

so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like next to comment on

the programmes for a number of Ministries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first comment is in reference to the

development of higher education which comes within

the   purview  of  the  Ministry  of  Science  and

Technology.   I  am  wondering  if  the   Minister

concerned  has  in  mind an  optimal  size  for  a

university. Sir, administration becomes  difficult

and  impersonal when the student population  glows

too big.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, there are always dissidents in any

group,  but  in a large congregation the  absolute

number of such people becomes significant and  can

lead  to  the  kind of student unrest  we  see  in

western countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may, therefore, be more desirable to increase

the  number of universities rather than have fewer

large ones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Addendum to the Ministry of Labour lists a

number  of  important new policies.  In  addition,

perhaps  the  Minister  for  Labour  may  want  to

consider  the  status  of daily-rated  workers  in

Government  departments and statutory bodies,  Can

anything be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>



done  to,  perhaps, give them more  regularity  or

permanency in employment? Would the Minister  also

look  into  the  reorganisation of the  Employment

Exchange  in order to provide a better picture  of

the   unemployment  situation   so   that   better

placement  of people can be effected, and  perhaps

upgrading of local skills can be facilitated?  The

Minister  may also want to consider opening  other

`employment  exchanges to improve the  process  of

placing people into desired jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to the Ministry of Health,

especially with respect to hawkers. The allocation

of  $5  million to build new hawker centres  is  a

very  welcome  move.  Hawking  provides  jobs  for

unskilled   and   uneducated  people,   especially

widows,  older  people  and  people  affected   by

resettlement.  It is an important  social  welfare

supplement,  and  hence  a very  important  social

safety valve. It is important in keeping down  the

cost of living. Moreover, it is potentially a good

tourist  attraction. There should be efforts  made

to help improve health and cooking standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister may also wish to look into the

matter  of better collaboration with the  Hawkers'

Section  of  the  Housing and  Development  Board.

There  is  one particular anomaly, which adversely

affects  hawkers under the Housing and Development

Board's   jurisdiction.  This   relates   to   the

obligation of the Housing and Development Board to

pay  property  tax of 36 per cent  a  year,  which

thereby  raises the fees payable by  its  hawkers.

Those  hawker  centres which are  managed  by  the

Ministry of Health are exempt from property tax. I

would  appeal  to  the  Minister  for  Health   to

subsidize the Housing and Development Board on the

property tax on hawker centres so as to reduce the

licence  fees  payable by these hawkers  and  make

things more equitable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now wish to raise two matters relating to

the  Ministry of Finance. Sometime in  April  this

year, on my return from a trade mission to Japan,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>



I  made a number of recommendations in respect  of

export   promotion  and  financing.  Perhaps   the

Minister for Finance will inform this House in due

course what steps, if any, are being taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the major thrust of the Government

industrialization programme has been  towards  the

encouragement  of  foreign investment.  While  the

emphasis  is  correct, if we are  to  acquire  the

technological  sophistication, the managerial  and

marketing know-how in the shortest possible  time,

I think that with full employment in sight, we can

turn  part  of  our attention and  effort  to  the

active promotion of local enterprise. Perhaps  the

Government can help identify and preserve  limited

areas  of economic activity which local enterprise

and  capital  can  be encouraged  to  go  into  or

develop.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the President's speech he lamented the

recent   financial  coup  achieved  by  a  foreign

company.  May  I  ask  the  Minister  for  Finance

whether,  and what, measures are being  considered

to prevent a repetition of the incident?



<br><br>4.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak (Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Inche A. Rahim Ishak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as 1971 comes to

a close five months from today, Singapore, for the

first time in its history, will no longer have the

defence  umbrella to which it has grown accustomed

for the last 150 years. We shall, despite the Five-Power  Defence arrangement, have to be more  self-

reliant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As was stated in the Addendum to the

Presidential Address at the opening of the  Second

Session  of the Second Parliament on the  21st  of

July,  Singapore's  foreign policy  in  the  years

ahead will have to be more outward-looking than it

has  hitherto  been, because, among other  things,

external  developments will be more directly  felt

by  us.  Singapore, by virtue of its size,  cannot

expect  to  influence  international  events.  And

precisely  because  of  our  small  size  and  our

inability to influence world



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>



events,  we  might  have become inward-looking  as

well  as  insular in our concept and  practice  of

diplomacy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the rapidly changing international scene in

the  Pacific and Indian Oceans, we have to develop

the  capacity  to  play our role in  international

affairs  by  involving ourselves in intra-regional

or  sub-regional developments. We  can  no  longer

think of our own individual and national interests

as  the powers and super-powers around us make new

moves, and  take  on  new  alignments.  We   are

realistic   enough  to  know  that   international

politics  on  a  global scale is the  art  of  the

possible.  And  in line with this view,  we  shall

participate in international politics wherever and

whenever  it is judicious and possible to  do  so,

bearing in mind our own interests and those of our

immediate neighbours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of the above, there is, however, one

contribution Singapore can make in a positive  way

in  international relations. This is to  create  a

progressive,  dynamic and successful  society,  by

registering   successes  in   our   own   internal

development  programmes  and  thereby  influencing

other  states  and  societies by  sheer  force  of

example.  At the same time, our growing prosperity

and   continued  viability  will  ensure  a  self-confidence generated by our capacity to solve  our

own  internal  economic and social problems.  With

this,  we  hope  to  be a positive  force  in  the

international sphere in the hope that we would  be

freer  to order the kind of life, which we  think,

is  best  for our people. In other words, we  hope

that  non-interference in  the  affairs  of  other

nations,  which we believe in, will  similarly  be

practised by others in their attitudes towards us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From experience in international politics, we

know that in many cases if the big powers want  to

solve  international  problems,  irrespective   of

whether they are in the Middle East, Indochina  or

Africa,  they can solve them. But, all too  often,

it  appears as if the big powers sometimes have an

interest in not solving them, or in delaying their

solutions. In this regard, it is clear  to  us  in

Singapore  that the big powers in many cases  want

to make



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>



use   of   small   states  as   weights   in   the

international daching. Where we are convinced that

the  big powers are so motivated, we shall, to the

best   of   our   ability,  avoid  any   kind   of

involvement.   But  where  we   feel   that   such

activities  are  detrimental to our  own  national

interests, we shall counter any moves, which  will

compromise our independence and integrity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we have been independent for only six

years,  we have learned the bitter truth  that  it

would  be  disastrous for small countries  to  act

like major powers on the world stage, particularly

if  they  do  not  have the  capacity  to  do  so.

Therefore,  to  force ourselves on  to  the  world

stage  without really understanding the  aims  and

objectives of the producers and directors  of  the

current  play being performed, would mean breaking

our backs and seriously injuring ourselves. Events

in  the Middle East, Indochina and other parts  of

Asia  and Africa have persistently shown that  the

big powers want us to declare that we are on their

side   in  big  power  conflicts.  This  we   have

refrained  and  must refrain  from  doing  in  the

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Nixon's move as announced on the 16th

July  will, I think, lead to the establishment  of

relations  with  the People's Republic  of  China.

This  development is historically inevitable.  The

United  States can no longer ignore the  political

and legal existence of China, just as China has to

recognise -
