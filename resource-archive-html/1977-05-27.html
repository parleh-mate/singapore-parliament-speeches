  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon receiving a letter about his illness from the Leader of the House, I granted him leave of absence for all sittings of this House during March.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with considerable regret and sorrow that I have to inform Members that the Member has been in deep coma ever since the stroke which caused severe damage to his brain. He has been and is still unable to swallow nor move his limbs voluntarily, and is totally unaware of his surroundings.

  <!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Mr Ivan Baptist</b> asked the Minister for Health whether the treatment using electrostatic charges available in Singapore to sufferers of ailments like rheumatism, migraine, insomnia, mental fatigue, asthma, indigestion and skin trouble is efficacious and safe.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Health (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, ion generators are used to purify or sterilize the atmosphere. Microscopic particles such as bacteria, fungal spores, dust and smoke particles can acquire an electrostatic charge and remain suspended in the air. Particles which are
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> positively charged are neutralized by negative ions and negatively charged particles by positive ions. When fine particles are neutralized they aggregate or collect together to form larger particles that are too heavy to remain suspended in the atmosphere and are deposited or settle down on the ground by gravity.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The claim that positive or negative ions are effective in treating rheumatism, migraine, insomnia, mental fatigue, asthma, indigestion, skin diseases, constipation as well as diarrhoea and impotence is not substantiated in scientific or medical literature. If it were true that a wonderful instrument exists that can cure or treat such a variety of physical ailments, then hospitals all over the world would have installed such ion generators today.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The danger of untruthful advertising is that gullible patients who should really be receiving treatment from their medical doctors are led astray and, by avoiding medical treatment, they are exposing themselves to unnecessary risks and complications arising from their ill health.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I ought to add that the Ministry of Health is not involved in the licensing of clinics operating ion generators. I understand that there are six such establishments in Singapore. What is surprising is that they were allowed to open for business without the knowledge of Building Control Division and the PUB. Since we are concerned about the sale of unsafe electrical domestic appliances, I ought to inform the House that preliminary inquiries reveal that persons who patronize these so-called sanatronic clinics sit in an electrical field of several thousand volts in order to attract the negative ions that are generated to their bodies. They accumulate an electrostatic charge so that when they touch a person or object outside the treatment area which is earthed they experience a slight electric shock accompanied by a spark discharge. In layman's language the patient is acting like a lightning conductor except that the current passing through him is too small to electrocute him.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand a real danger exists if by any mischance the insulation system between patient and earth breaks down. Under these circumstances the patient will be sitting in an electric chair.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in the public interest that the operators of these sanatronic clinics should submit the technical specifications of their installation to the PUB for scrutiny.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the Ministry of Health is concerned, the whole business is nothing more than a fraud being perpetrated on a section of the public that is always gullible to fantastic claims.

  </div>
  <br>
  <br>

  <b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have mentioned that the licensing of these sanatronic clinics should have gone through the Building Control Division, and I am told that the Building Control Division will look into the matter. The Public Utilities Board likewise has asked for specifications of the installations in these clinics and I am sure that the problem will be solved quite early in the next week or so.

  <b>Mr Phey Yew Kok</b> asked the Minister for Labour, in view of the policy of the Government to reduce the need for Singapore to engage guest workers and in view of the effectiveness of the Government's medical health service in lengthening the working life-span of Singaporeans of both sexes, whether he will consider introducing legislation to raise the age of retirement to 60 years for all Singaporeans capable of working for several years beyond the age of 55.
  <div align="center">

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui) (for the Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the present retirement ages in the Civil Service, with the exception of Police personnel, are 55 years compulsory and 50 years optional for those who joined the Service on or before 1st July, 1956, and 60 years compulsory and 55 years optional for those who joined the Service after 1st July, 1956. Notwithstanding that, officers in the former category have to retire at 55 years. Selected ones may opt to extend their retirement age to 60 years or to accept re- employment for a period of five years after their retirement.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those working in the private sector, their retirement age is not stipulated under any law.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is a provision in the Central Provident Fund enabling those who have reached the age of 55 years to withdraw their CPF contributions, it does not, however, preclude them from continuing to work after the age of 55 years. In practice, as reflected in most collective agreements, the retirement age in the private sector is 55 years and in some instances 60 years. However, in those firms where the retirement age in the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 11</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> collective agreement is fixed at 55 years, there are also provisions to allow employees to work until 60 years, subject to mutual agreement and medical fitness.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member for Boon Teck that raising the retirement age to 60 years would be a natural development, as people nowadays generally tend to live longer because of better living conditions, improved diet and medical services. It will also be a measure to increase the national supply of manpower. By prolonging the working life- span of individuals, it will enable them to increase their CPF contributions, thus enabling them to retire in more comfortable circumstances. However, I think a non- legislative approach will serve the needs of our industries better than legislating the retirement age at 60 years. Legislation will be counter-productive in that it might force the employer to retain dead-wood employees. On the other hand, the voluntary acceptance of the retirement age at 60 years by employers will allow the worker to retire before the age of 60 years if his productivity has decreased for whatever reasons and will also enable the worker who is still physically and mentally fit and capable of high productivity to carry on even after 60 years. In time, market and social forces will condition the employers to accept the age of 60 years as the retirement age.

  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 12</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> electricity and water are only applicable to premises which are used exclusively as private dwellings. Where part of the premises is used in connection with any trade, business or profession or as a boarding house, school, place of worship, mess or for communal services, the non-domestic rate will be charged.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One essential point of consideration is the definition of the term "voluntary non-profit". There will be countless organisations claiming to be worthy of this description; for example, temples, churches, clubs, clans, associations, institutions, to name but a few. The situation could become unmanageable.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Utilities Board will charge the domestic rate if it can be established that the premises is used solely for residential purposes. For example, the Singapore Council of Social Service is being charged domestic rate for the 30 Housing Board flats in Bukit Merah and Ang Mo Kio estates which the Council has rented as homes for the aged under a special scheme.

  <!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as Singapore has limited land available for agriculture, we are dependent on foreign imports for a wide range of agricultural produce.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The joint enterprise between Singapore and Thailand will promote import of Thai agricultural produce into Singapore and export of fertiliser, agriculture insecticide and farm machineries from Singapore to Thailand. It is also proposed to establish a joint venture livestock farm in Thailand. It is envisaged that the farm will initially produce cattle for export to Singapore. Pigs will also be produced for export to other markets, but when there is a shortage of pigs in Singapore we can also import pigs from the farm. The joint enterprise should therefore not affect the livelihood of our farmers but will make available to Singapore a wider range of agricultural produce including animal feed ingredients required by our pig and poultry farms, as well as stabilising prices of meats in Singapore.

  <b>Mr Ivan Baptist</b> asked the Minister for National Development and Communications what steps are being taken to expedite the resettlement of pig farmers from Kranji to Punggol so that the water in Kranji reservoir can be fit for human consumption without incurring too much expenditure for purification.
  <br>

  <!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there were 2,926 farms within the Kranji Catchment area keeping a total of 217,000 pigs. 640 of these farms rear more than 100 pigs each, giving a total number of 178,045 pigs or 82% of the total pig population in Kranji. Farms with more than 100 pigs each were given the option to be resettled in Punggol while the smaller farms were required to phase out pig-rearing and to convert into other non-pollutive forms of farming.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a total of 209 pig farms have been allotted land at the Punggol and Jalan Kayu areas. Of these, 137 farms were allotted land under Phase I of the development scheme in Punggol while 72 of these will be resettled under Phase II of the programme at Jalan Kayu. It is estimated that the land at Jalan Kayu will accommodate another 20 odd farms in addition to the 31 farms which have been allowed to remain in the area.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lands at Jalan Kayu and Punggol are zoned for agricultural use. Prior to their development for intensive pig farming, there were altogether 211 farms and 1700 rural squatters. The farms which are being resettled in the area are the larger and more efficient farms which are better managed with modern husbandry practices and improved sanitation. They are required to provide proper waste management facilities on the farms which will control waste discharge. In addition to the 50,000 metres

  <b>Mr Ivan Baptist</b> asked the Minister for National Development and Communications whether his Ministry will be taking measures to stimulate the building construction industry in the private sector which is declining.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the general world economic condition is largely responsible for the decline in private sector construction activity. Demand for more residential and commercial facilities can only increase through renewed business confidence and economic growth. Therefore, so long as there is doubt about the world economic recovery, it would be difficult to stimulate private sector construction to pre-recession levels.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, my Ministry is continuing to encourage and assist private developers. There will be further sale of sites by the Urban Redevelopment Authority for commercial, residential, hotel and industrial developments. Processing of plans submitted by developers have been streamlined to reduce delays. Developers can now submit an outline application and obtain quick in- principle approval.

  <!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does the Hon.

Minister of State realise that we are losing many skilled guest workers? Unless steps are taken to get private developers to increase
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> their activities, such loss would be detrimental to Singapore.

  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the earlier stages of encouraging construction activity, the Ministry of National Development has given certain forms of incentives, such as property tax concessions and so on. But the very fact that the hon. Member has asked about the construction industry being in its doldrums at this moment must have indicated to him that there are offices, residential properties and commercial facilities left vacant. Hence, the private developers will know when to come into the market and whether it is time to go into additional activities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as we are concerned, if the Member is talking of incentives of a financial nature, such as concessions on property tax, income tax, and so on, then I suppose this matter can be referred to the Ministry of Finance for consideration. Attempts have been made by my Ministry to grant some form of incentives but this has been turned down by the Ministry of Finance. The hon. Member is probably aware that in this House some hon. Members have asked if CPF contributions could be used for the purchase of private residential properties and this has been turned down by the Ministry of Finance. I am not so sure what other forms of incentives that the Member has in mind, but if he has any idea of what these can be, we will be very happy to receive his suggestions and convey them to the relevant Ministry to see whether they can be agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his second question on the losing of skilled manpower, particularly in the construction industry, the hon. Member is aware that, as far as the public sector is concerned, i.e. the HDB and HUDC, there is rio slack in the building construction activity. In fact, this could be an opportunity to improve the quality of the finishes of the HDB flats because skilled labourers are still in great demand in the public sector.

  <br>
  <br> of State then willing to employ these very skilled workers who have lost their jobs in the private sector, and to consider upgrading the quality of HDB flats, because there have been a lot of complaints about their poor quality?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, I have mentioned that there is a lot of construction activity in the public sector. For example, the Airport development is another area of intensive construction activity and there are other public sector projects. Here, it is a matter of demand and supply. For example, if a skilled worker in the private sector is so spoilt as to demand very high wages for a particular type of building construction work, then I think it would be unrealistic if he expects to get the same rate of wages in a public sector project. What I am trying to assure the hon. Member is that as far as skilled manpower is concerned, the demand is there.

  <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the shop referred to by the hon.

This constitutes an assignment of the tenancy. In accordance with the Board's policy, such assignment can be allowed subject to increase in the rental to the prevailing market level. Such increase is normal practice in transactions such as this. Obviously the 'old' rental is no longer applicable and the prevailing market rental must apply to the changed tenancy.

The Board also has to ensure that alterations or additions carried out by flat owners do not cause any structural damage to the buildings. Such controls should not be interpreted as interference.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Window design is an integrated part of the building design. If left to individuals, each person will have a distinctive preference for window types and designs. This will result in irregularity and untidiness of the building as a whole and will mar its external appearance.

  <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, tenants/owners of HDB flats are not allowed to use their flats for conducting business as the flats are solely designed and intended for residential use.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question as to whether private houses will be allowed to be used as offices for business and other purposes depends on the following factors: -
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Master Plan zoning.

  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 24</b></font>

  <!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not advisable to allow the tenants to partition off a part of the common corridor as this would make the exterior of the building look irregular and unsightly and may in some instances affect the structure of the building.

  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Telecommunication Authority of Singapore plans to install two public telephones in Pulau Tekong, one at the police station and the other at the community centre by September this year when the radio equipment are delivered.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, owing to the very low demand for services, radio telephones have been used to extend telephone service to the off-shore islands. The cost is high because of the high unit cost of radio telephones. The TAS will absorb the high cost of installation of public telephone and will maintain the charge at 10 cents per call.

  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23.
  <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon</b> asked the Minister for Social Affairs, in view of the large number of high-rise office complexes in Singapore, what steps have been taken by the Singapore Fire Brigade to adequately equip itself and to train its personnel to fight fire in such buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 29</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Othman bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Othman bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore Fire Brigade is fully aware of the dangers of high-rise fires. The prevention of such fires depends on the built-in facilities in high-rise buildings such as automatic sprinklers, fire detectors, wet and dry rising mains, protected staircases for escape purposes, ventilated lobbies and fire lifts for use by firemen in emergencies, hose reels and extinguishers and the use of non- combustible building materials to control spread of fire.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the fire regulatory functions have been transferred to the Building Control Division since 1st August 1973, the high standards of fire prevention advocated by the Brigade have been maintained through the Fire Precautionary Code which was prepared by the Building Control Division in consultation with the Singapore Fire Brigade. We can, therefore, rest assured that all the high-rise office and commercial complexes in Singapore are adequately equipped with in- built fire protection facilities. The provision of such facilities is very important to the Fire Brigade because high-rise fires must be fought from within the building using such facilities. It would not be feasible to fight a high-rise fire by conventional methods as our high-rise buildings tower beyond the height of the tallest fire service ladders. Firemen of all ranks are now given specialised training for fighting high-rise fires. Regular fire drills are held in high-rise buildings to familiarise them with the structural layout of the building and the in-built fire protection facilities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Search and Rescue Squad was formed in February 1975 to conduct search and rescue in high-rise buildings. The Squad consists of 50 officers who were handpicked to undergo rigorous training in various methods of fighting fires in high-rise buildings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies have been made in co-operation with Mindef Air Staff on the possibility of using helicopters for rooftop aerial evacuations. The Alouette helicopter is of limited use for this purpose. There are also technical difficulties in rooftop landings.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 30</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Further studies are being made whether the larger Bell search-and-rescue helicopter of the RSAF would be a more suitable aircraft. In a high-rise fire, it would be safer to descend through the protected staircases rather than ascend to the rooftop where heat and smoke, or other conditions might make it impossible for rescue to be effected.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to improve their fire prevention efforts in high-rise buildings, the Brigade set up a High-rise Unit on 28th October 1976. The objectives of the Unit are as follows:-
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to carry out regular inspections and tests on fire-fighting and fire protection facilities of commercial type high-rise buildings:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to maintain up-to-date record of high- rise buildings;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to liaise closely with the Building Control Division and the Commissioner of Buildings to ensure that deficiencies and faults in fire protection systems are reported and rectified;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) to collate technical information on high-rise buildings and provide feedback to the Brigade's Operational Command and Communication Control Centre;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) to plan and organise training and evacuation programmes for fire safety personnel working in high-rise buildings; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) to draw up fire safety plans and formulate guidelines for occupants of high- rise buildings.
  <br>
  <br>A Fire Service Bill will be introduced in the near future to give the Chief Fire Officer wider powers, including powers to abate fire hazards in high-rise buildings and premises of special risks.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New equipment have also been purchased to strengthen the Brigade's operational efficiency. During the past three years, the Brigade purchased equipment amounting to more than $2 million. They include a breathing apparatus vehicle, one mobile control unit, five heavy water tenders, six light water tenders, one emergency tender, one high expansion foam generator and one life-saving air cushion. In addition, one 30- metre snorkel and two 30-metre turntable
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> ladders have been ordered at a cost of $1.3 million.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the hon. Member for Alexandra that the Singapore Fire Brigade will constantly review their facilities and training programmes to prepare for the new dangers of fighting and preventing fires in high-rise buildings.

  <br>
  <!-- Encik Othman bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Othman bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the site of the Sri Rama Temple is affected by the Changi Village Re-development Project, and according to the development plans of the Housing and Development Board, this temple was to be demolished in early 1976. Under the comprehensive re-development plans for the area, both sides of the Changi Road will be developed and a PWD Extension of Kuala Loyang Road Scheme will affect the temple site.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry officials met the Sri Rama Management Committee and the Hindu Advisory Board on a number of occasions on this matter. Originally, the proposal was to remove the temple to a disused Tamil school at Wing Loong Road. However, this proposal does not seem to be feasible because the school site will be affected by a JTC Changi Industrial Estate Project in 1980.

  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> study the time lag between the receipt of each query and the despatch of the relevant reply. This is a simple though time- consuming task because quite a number of letters are received every day. However, it would almost be impossible for me to identify which query was dealt with under normal circumstances and which was not, because normal circumstances defy a workable definition.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time taken to reply to a query depends very much on the nature of the query. For example, routine enquiries regarding the arrest of particular individuals should normally not take more than a week. Enquiries about the likely time of release of detainees would take a little longer as more checking is involved. However, enquiries in which there are serious allegations of abuse of power, assault or even death resulting from assault, will take even longer because to be fait to all parties concerned the allegations must be thoroughly investigated before a reply is given.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All officers in my Ministry have been given instructions to attend promptly to queries from Members of Parliament and the public. Generally, they should not take more than two weeks to give a reply unless it is a case requiring further investigation.

  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, I have already answered that question. It all depends on the nature of the complaint and how serious was the assault.

   <b>MISUSE OF DRUGS ACT</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Review of enforcement)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27.
  <b>Mr P. Selvadurai</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Education if he will review the working of the Misuse of Drugs Act (No. 5 of 1973) as the recent amendments of the said Act have in practice been found to be more punitive than preventive.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Kuo Chuan has not stated clearly whether he refers to drug traffickers or drug addicts when he alleged in his question that the 1975 amendments of the Misuse of Drugs Act have in practice been found to be more punitive than preventive. Members will recall that when I moved the Bill to amend the Act on 20th November, 1975, in this House, I said that unless drug trafficking and drug addiction were checked, they would threaten our national security and viability. To do this, both punitive and preventive measures must be taken. The Act was thus amended to provide enhanced penalties for traffickers, including mandatory death penalty for drug trafficking and manufacturing, and to give the Director of the Central Narcotics Bureau power to send persons whose urine specimen contained controlled drug to a Drug Rehabilitation Centre for treatment and rehabilitation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think the hon. Member for Kuo Chuan is referring to illicit drug manufacturers and traffickers because they deserve to be punished. Indeed they must be punished so severely as not only to deter them from persisting in their evil activities but also others from joining in.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if the hon. Member is referring to drug addicts, the measures which have been taken so far can in no way be considered more punitive than preventive.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Sending drug addicts to the Drug Rehabilitation Centres is a preventive move in more ways than one. First, the demand for drugs will be reduced. Second, the addicts, whilst undergoing treatment and rehabilitation in the Centres, are prevented from getting others into drug taking and aggravating the problem. Third, the addicts if not assisted to get rid of their drug habit in a drug-free environment and through a proper course of rehabilitation including compulsory aftercare, will never do so successfully on their own.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drug addicts are rehabilitated in the Drug Rehabilitation Centres through a phased programme. Initially, through 'cold turkey' treatment, the addicts rid their bodies of the toxic drugs. After a short period of rest they are put through exercises to tone up their bodies and make them mentally more alert. Then they are taught discipline, particularly work discipline, so that they can carry on normal working life when they leave.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon their discharge, they are put on compulsory aftercare for two years to prevent them from re-establishing contact with undesirables and relapsing into the drug habit. They are given constant counselling by probation and aftercare officers and periodic urine samples are taken from them for analysis to discourage them from resuming their drug habit.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operation Ferret which commenced on 1st April this year has for the first 56 days, that is up to 6.00 a.m. this morning, resulted in 1,531 drug addicts and abusers being sent to the Drug Rehabilitation Centres. As Operation Ferret progresses, more will be sent for rehabilitation. The number of persons with positive urine tests arrested in Operation Ferret reveal that we are facing a very serious drug problem which is rapidly deteriorating. It also proves that treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicts and abusers on a voluntary basis is ineffective.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the drug problem is not to get out of control, the measures to deal with it must not only be effective and flexible but also swift.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 36</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> The Misuse of Drugs Act will be further amended to strengthen its provisions. There are no soft options in solving the problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Kuo Chuan):</b> Sir, let me confine myself to drug traffickers. Could the Minister confirm that despite the punitive provisions of the present law, the number of drug traffickers are, in fact, on the increase?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, this is not a simple problem. It is a complex problem. It is a question of supply and demand. If we want to solve the problem, we must not only tackle the demand side but also the supply side. With heavy penalties and strict enforcement, we are able to contain the trafficking to some extent. But at the same time if the demand for drugs increases, it means that more and more drug addicts get into the scene. Then, of course, trafficking will also increase, as there is money to be made. Therefore, it is not possible to quanti!v, in answer to the Member for Kuo Chuan, whether as a result of these punitive measures on drug traffickers, including introducing the death penalty, that drug trafficking has decreased. I can safely say that if we had not introduced these strict penalties and had not enforced the Act strictly, the situation would be very much worse than it is today.

  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi</b> asked the Minister for Finance whether and when he intends to consolidate the various NWC increases into the basic salaries.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the recent Budget debate, I replied to a similar question raised by the Honourable Member for Moulmein. As I said then, the consolidation of NWC allowances into basic salaries is a major exercise and requires careful consideration. While some preliminary preparation has been made for such consolidation, we are not yet ready for this consolidation. When we are ready, instructions will be issued to Ministries and Departments at the appropriate time.

   <b>(Reassessment)</b>

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29.
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b>: To ask the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that when land prices were continually increasing prior to September 1973 the Comptroller of Property Tax continually increased the annual value of properties and whether, now that and prices have fallen, the Comptroller of Property Tax will correspondingly lower the annual value of properties.
  <br>

  <!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Question No. 29.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, the annual value of a property is the gross amount at which the property can reasonably be expected to be let from year to year. In the case of vacant land, the annual value is based on 5% of the market value of the land. Thus, the annual values reflect market conditions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Property Tax Department does from time to time review the annual values of properties and where warranted, reassessments have been made. In addition, property owners can raise objections at the time of reassessment or when the valuation list for the ensuing year is open for public inspection annually in August.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30.
  <b>Mr P. Selvadurai</b> asked the Minister for Finance (a) whether the current Central Provident Fund rate of contribution of 15 per cent is the ultimate limit; if not, whether it is intended to increase the rate of contribution yet further; and (b) whether he will consider increasing the Income Tax reliefs relating to CPF and Life Assurance payments from its present limit of $4,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, my colleague, the Minister for Labour has prescribed in the Schedule to the Central Provident Fund Act (Chapter 121) certain rates of contribution payable in respect of certain types of wages.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 38</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> The Act does not impose an ultimate limit of 15% nor is such limit imposed by economic or other circumstances. What rate is appropriate at any given time must depend on all the circumstances, including the state of the economy, at that time. If any variation in the rate is deemed justifiable or appropriate by me or other colleagues of the Minister for Labour, I have no doubt that he will give consideration to the arguments for such variation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the second part of the question, I have already, in the Budget Debate, answered it in the negative. It may well be that CPF contributions take up most of the $4,000 but this applies only to a small minority of taxpayers who are in the higher income group. Those who, as a result of the operation of this limit, are denied full tax relief on life insurance-premia are taxpayers who earn in excess of $24,000 a year, as their CPF contributions alone would be $3,600 a year. They, however, form only 10% or about 20,000 of the taxpaying population. The remaining 90% can still enjoy tax relief in varying degree should they take up life insurance policies. For many of them, the combined CPF contributions and life insurance premia are not likely to pierce the $4,000 ceiling.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum deduction of $4,000 which was first allowed in 1948 was grossly over- generous at that time as evidenced by the mere handful of taxpayers who took advantage of the allowance. Since 1968, contributions to the CPF have been raised progressively with the result that more and more taxpayers are now claiming deductions and the ceiling of $4,000 is still considered to be sufficient for income tax relief. This ceiling of $4,000 is by far the highest among ASEAN countries. Even in a developed country like Australia, the maximum tax relief given for superannuation contributions and life insurance premia is equivalent to $3,700.

  <font size="1"><b>Column: 39</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the heavy increases in road tax and Additional Registration Fees, the revenue earned will be used for better maintenance of existing roads and construction of more new and efficient roads and road transport systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, the Member for Kampong Kembangan should be aware of the general policy that all Government revenues are paid into the Consolidated Fund, and that drawings from such Fund are then made for all Government expenditures. This means also that no particular revenue or portion of the Consolidated Fund is earmarked for specific expenditures.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the Member's question, therefore, is in the negative. I am not conscious, however, of any lack of attention by the Public Works Department to the efficient maintenance of existing roads and the construction of more new and efficient roads and road transport systems. All requests for financing such works have been and will be given due consideration.
