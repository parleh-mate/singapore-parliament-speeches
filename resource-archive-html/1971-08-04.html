<div align="center"><b>WATER-CLOSET CISTERNS</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Replacement with direct-flow flush system)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b> asked the Prime Minister if

he   will  ask  the  Public  Utilities  Board  to

consider the feasibility of replacing the present

water-closet  cisterns with a  direct-flow  flush

system to economise water.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Lim Kim San) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I presume

the "direct flow flush system" referred to by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>



Member  is the spring-loaded flush valve  system.

If  so,  the  Public Utilities  Board  would  not

recommend   replacing  the  present  water-closet

cisterns with spring-loaded flush valves  because

they are much more expensive, costing about three

times   as  much  as  the  ordinary  water-closet

cisterns.  Besides, they go  out  of  order  more

easily,  resulting  in  water  being  wasted   as

leakage  from the valve flows directly  into  the

water  closet pan. Such leakage is also difficult

to  detect. Furthermore, the volume of  flush  is

usually greater and cannot be controlled. Another

objectionable feature of the flush  valve  system

is that, in the event of its malfunction, it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>



possible for contamination of water due to reverse

flow, to take place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board has, however, in some instances,

allowed the installation of flush valve systems in

institutional buildings. Very stringent conditions

to  minimise  waste and to prevent the possibility

of  contamination by the provision of  a  separate

storage  tank are laid down as conditions of  such

approval.

<div align="center"><b>OLD KALLANG AIRPORT ESTATE</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Construction of hawkers' emporium and high-rise flats)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Ng Yeow Chong -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To ask the Minister for Law and National

Development  when  work  will  commence   on   the

construction of a hawkers' emporium and  high-rise

flats  on  a  site in Old Kallang  Airport  Estate

which was cleared for redevelopment in early 1970,

and whether the flats will include 5-room units.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Hwang Soo Jin.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I have been asked by the

Member for Mountbatten to raise Question No. 2.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Board

proposed  to  build  a 2-storey hawkers'  emporium

together with 16-storey flats above on a  site  in

the  Old  Kallang Airport Estate. It has now  been

decided  to abandon the construction of  high-rise

flats   and  build  only  the  2-storey   hawkers'

emporium.  Investigations have revealed  that  the

soil condition in the area is extremely poor,  and

extensive  piling will be required  to  support  a

high-rise building. The Board will be calling  for

tenders  at  the  end of August to  construct  the

proposed  2-storey hawkers' emporium. The  project

is expected to be completed by early 1972.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, two

supplementary questions. First,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>



what will  be  the

capacity   of  the  proposed  hawkers'   emporium?

Second, can the Minister give an indication of the

estimated cost of piling per unit if the high-rise

flats were to be constructed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the emporium will comprise 136

lock-up  shops on the first floor and  176  hawker

stalls on the ground floor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the second question, the soil

investigations have revealed that  the  length  of

piling  for high-rise flats will have to  be  more

than  150  feet  deep. In the  circumstances,  the

piling cost for each 4-room flat in this area will

be  about  $6,000 as against the average  cost  of

about $1,500 for piling in other areas.

<div align="center"><b>(Effect on shipyards and slipways in Kallang Park Industrial Estate)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr

Ng Yeow Chong -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. To ask the Minister for Law and National

Development  whether development in  Kallang  Park

and  its  vicinity will affect the future  of  the

shipyards   and  shipways  in  the  Kallang   Park

Industrial Estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Hwang Soo Jin.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I have been requested by

the Member for Mount-batten to ask Question No.

3.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Kallang Park is

being   developed   into  a   major   sports   and

entertainment  centre. This development,  however,

does not affect the shipyards and slipways in  the

Kallang Park Industrial Estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the road network plan of the area includes a

major  expressway  over the East  Coast  reclaimed

land  into  the  city,  entailing  a  crossing  at

Kallang  Basin. Whether this crossing should  take

the  form of a bridge, a tunnel or a causeway,  is

being evaluated in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>



light  of  a plan to create a lake at the  Kallang

River  mouth for recreational purposes  and  as  a

probable additional source of water supply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retention of shipyards and slip-ways in the

Kallang  Industrial Basin area will give  rise  to

problems   of  water  and  visual  pollution   and

jeopardise the long-term plans for this  area.  It

is likely that existing shipyards and slip-ways in

the Kallang Park Industrial Estate will have to be

resisted elsewhere in five to eight years' time.

<div align="center"><h4>PRESIDENT'S SPEECH</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>Debate on the Address</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Fourth Day)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned debate on

Question [30th July, 1971],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That the following Address in reply to the

speech of the President be agreed to : -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Parliament of the Republic of

Singapore, express our thanks to the  President

for  the speech which he delivered on behalf  of

the  Government  at the opening  of  the  Second

Session  of  this Parliament.".'.-  [Dr.  Chiang Hai Ding].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>



yesterday just before the adjournment I was saying

that the President had in his speech commended the

Government  for its achievements in the  field  of

housing.  Through the agency of  the  Housing  and

Development  Board, it is planning to  build,  for

the  period  1971  to  1975,  one  flat  every  26

minutes, thus solving the housing problem  of  our

people.  From now on the Board is aiming to  build

20,000 units each year so that in five years' time

it  will  have built 100,000 units for our people.

In  addition to "quantity" housing, the Board will

now  pay attention to "quality" housing, that  is,

improvement in the design of the flats, and  there

will also be emphasis on the comfort of living  in

a  healthy environment. It is anticipated that  by

1975  there  will altogether be about 1.2  million

people  staying  in Housing and Development  Board

fiats;  that  is  to say, another half  a  million

people will

have  been moved into the Board's houses. In  this

respect, we can be both pleased and proud  of  the

Board's plans and achievements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am now reminded of certain problems

relating to the allocation of flats. In my  "meet-the-people"  sessions, I hear complaints  from  my

constituents that they had applied to the  Housing

and  Development  Board to rent  the  two-room  or

three-room  flats without getting any  allocation,

although  they had waited for two or three  years.

After repeated inquiries, the reply given was that

all  the newly-built two-room or three-room  flats

were mainly meant to be sold direct to members  of

the  public under the home ownership scheme.  Even

if  there are occasional vacancies in such  flats,

they  will first be allotted to families  affected

by  resettlement. People who are staying  in  one-room  flats  have to seek larger accommodation  if

the   membership  in  the  family  has  increased.

However,  on  applying  to the  Board  for  larger

flats,  their requests will usually be met with  a

similar answer. There will also be a long delay of

two  or  three  years before  a  reply  is  given.

Sometimes no reply is given. Even if they wish  to

buy such flats they will have to register



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>



afresh  and  queue  up. There is  no  priority  or

concession for them at all. At the earliest,  they

can  get  a new flat only after one or two  years'

waiting.  Usually, if everything goes  well,  they

will  be  able  to  get  new  accommodation  after

waiting  for three or four years. No wonder  there

are  complaints all round! I feel that the Housing

and  Development Board should first clear up these

"old accounts".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards those who are affected by urban

renewal,   rural  redevelopment  and  resettlement

schemes,   the  Government  has  announced   that,

because of our improved economic situation  and  a

better  capacity  to  pay the people  affected  by

them,  the rate of compensation will now be raised

to  a  more rational level. Although this is  good

news,  these  people have to live in  a  different

environment, and whether they have to change their

careers  or resume their old trade, the Government

should  make it a point to give them some sort  of

technical assistance in addition to financial  aid

or compensation. We know that usually in the past,

in   order  to  clear  up  a  piece  of  land  for

redevelopment  purposes within a stipulated  time,

the people staying on the land were cleared out by

the Resettlement Department in a haphazard manner.

Once  the people had been cleared out of the site,

the   move  was  regarded  as  a  success  by  the

department   concerned.  Whether  or   not   these

resettled  people  can live on  the  new  site  is

nobody's   business.  As  a  result,  we  received

complaints from these people that long after  they

had  moved  into the new site there was  still  no

water  supply  and electricity,  let  alone  other

sanitary  facilities. Even in their  newly-settled

areas, they were usually interfered with by  other

Government  departments  which  accused  them   of

putting  up  illegal structures  without  sanitary

facilities  or of not having obtained any  permits

from  the  Fire  Brigade. Some of them  have  been

asked    to   remove   again   very   soon   after

resettlement.  All  this  shows  the   result   of

insufficient  care  taken by  the  authorities  in

dealing  with people affected by resettlement.  In

respect of industrialisation, we have the Economic

Development Board to help the industrialists set



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>



up  factories.  Similarly, I hope  the  Government

will give the people affected by resettlement some

technical  assistance to help them  rebuild  their

homesteads and avoid unnecessary loss or wastage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the start the President has said in his

speech  that  after six years of  independence  we

have  shown  that  Singapore  is  viable.  She  is

gradually    developing   into   a   centre    for

manufacturing,   servicing,   communications   and

transportation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the total withdrawal of British

troops, which will be completed by the end of  the

year,  facts show that we not only will  not  have

large-scale  unemployment, but, on  the  contrary,

because  of  economic progress, will be  short  of

labour,  particularly skilled  technical  workers.

Therefore,  the  Government  has  adopted  a  more

liberal  policy  in  regard  to  the  question  of

issuing  work  permits to non-citizens.  This  new

policy  is  necessary  in  view  of  our  national

service  policy  which has absorbed  many  of  our

youths.  Many  non-citizens have been  engaged  in

these  jobs  instead, so that economic  production

and  growth may be maintained. However, we  should

consider  whether or not the issuance of too  many

work  permits  to  non-citizens  will  affect  the

employment opportunities of our own citizens after

they   have  completed  their  term  of   national

service.  In  spite of Government legislation  for

their protection, at present there are still  some

employers    who   employ   discharged    national

servicemen in an opportunistic manner because they

have  no  confidence in them.  So  the  Government

should  try to adopt proper measures to deal  with

this  situation so that employers will  have  more

confidence in discharged national servicemen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improvement will be made in the fields of

transportation  and  communications   to   achieve

efficiency  and  speed. In view of the  increasing

number of vehicles on the road, the Government has

plans  to  improve  the  traffic  system,  and  an

evaluation  of  a  mass rapid transit  system  for

Singapore  will  also be made. However,  with  the

increase  in  the  number  of  vehicles  and   the

increase in the number



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>



of   accidents  on  the  road,  the  question   of

insurance cover for vehicles and accidents is also

important.  There was a case of a  youth  who  was

knocked  down  by  a  car and half  his  body  was

paralysed.  The  court  awarded  the  youth  about

$100,000 as compensation. But the youth could  not

get  a  single  cent because the  driver  who  had

knocked him down had given false particulars  when

applying  for a policy from the insurance company.

On  this  ground, the insurance company disclaimed

liability  and  refused to pay the youth.  Similar

cases  have  happened before. Therefore,  I  would

like  to urge the Government to work out a  scheme

whereby victims of accidents or their families can

get the compensation due to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Presidential speech, mention has also been

made of the reorganisation and improvement of  our

social welfare services. This is, of course,  good

news.  But  I  would like to see a review  of  the

scheme  of public assistance paid to the poor  and

the   sick   by  the  Social  Welfare  Department.

According  to  the  present scheme,  the  guardian

parent  of the sick or poor can get $21 per month,

the  spouse can get $10, and those children  under

16  years  of  age can get $5 each, subject  to  a

maximum of $60 per month per family. We know  that

these  rates  were formulated in 1961.  Ten  years

have  passed. Following urban renewal  and  social

development,  many people have  moved  to  Housing

Board flats. The cost of living has also risen  as

a  result. This meagre sum of money is not  enough

to  pay  for food and rental. It can pay for  only

one  item. So I hope the Government can review the

present scheme of public assistance in order  that

our economic growth may benefit all our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion of thanks by the Member

for Ulu Pandan.



<br><br>2.51 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I consider it a great privilege to be able to

take this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>



opportunity  to  express our sincere  appreciation

and  thanks  to the President for his most  timely

statement touching on the work of the Ministry  of

Social  Affairs. We heartily welcome  and  endorse

His Excellency's statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now elaborate on the points raised by the

Member for Toa Payoh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has maintained an ongoing review of

existing  social welfare facilities and programmes

to  ensure  that their development is  in  keeping

with  national needs and aspirations. Towards this

end,  the Minister for Social Affairs and  I  have

personally  visited the various  governmental  and

voluntary  welfare organisations and have  held  a

series  of  meetings  and  discussions  with   the

officials   concerned.  While  we  are   generally

satisfied   that  existing  welfare  services   do

reflect the preventive, remedial and developmental

functions  in social welfare, there appear  to  be

still  a  few areas of need which may justify  the

intensification of efforts or the introduction  of

new  services, as, for example, the welfare of the

very young and the very old.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should stress, however, that the material and

manpower  resources at present  available  do  not

permit   a  rapid  expansion  of  existing  social

welfare  programmes; rather the aim should  be  an

ordered   transformation   of   existing   welfare

services  into well-organised operations involving

a maximum of community participation. This clearly

calls  for  a social development plan  with  well-defined  objectives. It is proposed to  set  up  a

Training  and Research Section within  the  Social

Welfare Department which will concentrate  on  the

production of a long-term plan for social  welfare

development. Apart from working out the strategies

for  timely  social intervention and provision  of

services consonant with demonstrated needs, it  is

also  intended  to  examine the  desirability  and

feasibility of decentralising some of the existing

welfare  services  for  the convenience  of  those

living in major residential areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, where the situation warrants it,

existing services will be expanded or new services

introduced. Already the number of creches operated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>



by   the   Social  Welfare  Department  has   been

increased to 11 - the latest being the Jurong Town

Creche  which was officially opened on 19th  June,

1971.  Another new creche in the shopping  complex

of  Toa Payoh New Town is expected to be ready  by

early 1972. The Government is also considering the

need  for new creches in other townships  such  as

Queenstown, Woodlands and Telok Blangah.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Construction of the new Junior Approved School

and    Remand   Home   for   the   training    and

rehabilitation of young offenders is  expected  to

be completed in September 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two new dormitories in Woodlands Home with

accommodation for 136 elderly female persons  were

officially  opened On  2nd August, 1971,  and  two

other similar dormitories will be built shortly to

complete the extension project in this Home.  With

these extensions, the Woodlands Home for the  Aged

will have accommodation for 840 elderly persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More realistic training facilities are also being

introduced in all the Welfare Homes with a view to

enabling  the  residents of  these  Homes  to  fit

themselves appropriately into the world of work on

their   discharge  from  the  Homes.  As  far   as

possible,   residents  will   be   provided   with

vocational   training  commensurate   with   their

interests  and aptitudes so as to equip them  with

the   necessary  skills  to  meet  the  needs   of

industries.   Aftercare   work   is   also   being

strengthened by the introduction of an  employment

placement service for the discharged residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rehabilitation service, including employment

placement,   has  recently  been  introduced   for

handicapped persons. Consideration is  also  being

given  to extending the existing Fostering  Scheme

to  provide  for more foster homes  for  neglected

children.  Improvements are  also  being  made  in

respect of adoption and family counselling work in

the Social Welfare Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of providing institutional

facilities  for non-destitute senior  citizens  on

payment has been carefully studied by officials of

my Ministry and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>



Social Welfare Department. As priority has  to  be

given  for the care of the needy aged, our present

thinking  is that the provision of homes to  cater

for the elderly citizens who belong to the average

middle   class   and   who  can   pay   for   such

accommodation and services should best be left  to

the private sector.

<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  we came to be independent in a strange  way.

Firstly,  independence came  by  merger  with  the

Federation  of Malaysia and later, on 9th  August,

1965, with our separation from the Federation,  we

experienced our second independence.  I  read  the

President's  opening  words  in  his   speech   to

Parliament  to  mean just this. Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

whilst  it  is common for nations to extend  their

domains  outwards, it is not quite understood  why

it  should  happen the other way round as  far  as

Singapore was concerned on that fateful  day,  9th

August,  1965.  The  other  new  states   of   the

Federation  were  warned of dire  consequences  if

they  thought fit to go the Singapore way. In  the

case of Singapore, it faced awesome troubles if it

did not separate. Was the action against Singapore

meant  to  squeeze the life out of it, or  was  it

simple    statesmanship?   Whatever    were    the

considerations, Singapore was jettisoned to  fight

for   its   own   survival.  Was   economic   ruin

inevitable,  and social discontent  and  political

upheavals   to  be  a  commonplace   affair?   Was

political  independence  expected  to   last   six

months, 0 six years for that matter?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should give us great pleasure to know that the

President has forthrightly and confidently  stated

that  our viability, our ability to progress,  and

our determination to remain independent is in good

state. The President's words reflect the heartfelt

aspirations of the people of our Republic and  the

motivations for our patriotic actions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, whilst it is important to engage

ourselves   in   economic   development,   it   is

nevertheless  imperative and vital  that  we  also

concentrate our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>



resources and energies on building up our  defence

capability. Independence is futile if a nation has

no  resolve  and capacity to fight to protect  its

national  sovereignty and integrity. Our  Republic

with its population of two million should have its

entire  people ready to serve the country  in  its

hour  of  need.  I  therefore  wholeheartedly  and

fervently  support  the  Government's  policy   of

making  use  of  all the precious  time  available

until  the  withdrawal of the  British  forces  to

intensify  the  building up of a reliable  defence

capability  which  can be reckoned  with  both  by

friend  and foe. In particular, our ground  forces

should possess the greatest striking capability to

occupy strategic ground to ensure the flow of  the

life-blood  of  our  island, should  circumstances

demand  this  action. To achieve  this  objective,

sufficient  support  of  our  ground  forces  with

armoured  vehicles  and  air  elements  should  be

readily  available.  However,  it  must   not   be

forgotten   that   our  70-mile  coastline   needs

constant  vigilance  against infiltration  in  the

form  of  illegal immigration and piracy.  I  must

express  my  concern over the gap in our  security

and would urge the Government to take all measures

necessary to overcome occurrences of this nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I note the Government is paying

due  attention to increasing our water  resources.

This  is  an  area  of strategic  importance  that

should be taken care of. Should we be made anxious

by  the  vagaries  of nature  and  the  whims  and

fancies  of man? Arising from this point, I  think

it  is important for every citizen to realize that

water is precious and that things should never  be

taken  for  granted. I would consider it  just  as

important  to prevent the pollution of  our  water

resources. Mr Speaker, Sir, you may recollect that

I   have   somewhat  strenuously  called  on   the

Government to take all possible measures  to  keep

our water resources pollution free. I am happy  my

appeals  have not fallen on deaf ears.  Therefore,

the  Government's intention to sewer the whole  of

Singapore, so that all the dirty



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>



polluted household water will go into sewers, is a

good  proposition. The pre-treatment of industrial

water  to  reduce  pollution  is  similarly   good

practice   for  industrial  countries  to   adopt.

Therefore,  it  is  an  opportune  time  for   the

Government to launch a campaign to bring  about  a

realisation  amongst the people of  the  strategic

importance of water.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next I wish to deal with the interests of our

second  line of defence - our citizen workers.  It

must not be forgotten that it was on the backs  of

the workers that the Government came to power time

and  time  again, and for that matter the People's

Action Party had been the most appropriate vehicle

for the workers to achieve a fair and square deal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to note that it will be the

Government's  future policy to take  all  possible

measures necessary to prevent the loss of valuable

skilled  hands through work accidents by  ensuring

that   basic  safety  and  health  standards   are

provided  and  maintained in factories  and  other

places of work. In view of the fact that education

and training are time-consuming and costly, it  is

imperative and necessary to prevent further losses

of valuable skills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Government's interest in this

direction, although overdue by a couple of  years,

is not too late. To achieve this, we should have a

`supremo' of some seniority governing this  field.

The   Government's  intention  to  strengthen  the

Factories  Inspectorate  with  suitably  qualified

officers   to  supervise  and  enforce  industrial

safety  is  welcomed. I recall in March this  year

the then Minister for Labour announced that 30-odd

officers   would   be  added  to   the   Factories

Inspectorate. In this regard, it might be recalled

that  I  had  earlier in December 1969  urged  the

Government to reinforce the Factories Inspectorate

to fully enforce the law. To my regret, my request

was  turned down. I think I have been proven right

that   the   Factories  Inspectorate   should   be

strengthened and that it should be reorganised  to

be a more effective enforcement arm.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other proposal that I made was that the

Factories Act, which was introduced in 1958 before

industrialization was thought of,  should  undergo

major   overhauling.  The  reply  was   that   the

Factories  Act was sufficiently comprehensive  for

safeguarding the health and lives of workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is now realised how far short are the

powers  of  the  Chief Inspector of Factories,  so

much   so   that  measures  have  been  taken   to

strengthen his hands soon. It is my humble opinion

that  he  should be a very senior man, comparable,

say, to the Director of Public Works, in the civil

service hierarchy. He should be properly guided by

a  policy to eliminate those establishments  which

are health and safety hazards to those working  in

them. He should have wide discretionary powers  to

call for the punishment of employers who callously

and   criminally  endanger  the  lives  of   their

workers.  Is this not an economic offence  of  the

worst kind?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A case in point is that of the Soon Seng Battery

Plates  Manufacturing  Company  (Private)  Limited

which  refused to comply with the requests of  the

Chief  Inspector  of  Factories  to  prevent  lead

pollution and thus directly led to a young factory

girl  of fifteen years of age to suffer from  lead

poisoning.  It  was found that the factory  had  a

lead  atmospheric content 745 times above the safe

standard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this girl's case came to the knowledge of

the competent authority, another worker, a male of

36  years  of  age, was admitted  to  hospital  in

December 1969 from lead poisoning. The Head of the

Industrial  Health Unit visited  the  factory.  He

then  carried  out  blood and urine  tests  on  29

workers,  the results of which showed  that  seven

had  severe signs of lead absorption bordering  on

lead poisoning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manager was then advised to carry out certain

preventive measures to overcome the possibility of

cases   of  lead  poisoning.  The  Head   of   the

Industrial  Health Unit reported the case  to  the

Chief  Inspector  of Factories  and  an  inspector

visited  the  factory.  The latter  confirmed  the

conditions as reported.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>



About  one  year after the discovery of the  first

case, another visit was made and it was found that

preventive   measures   had   still    not    been

implemented. Seventeen days after that visit,  the

15  year-old girl was hospitalised. She had worked

there  for  only one month and had been  poisoned.

Blood  and  urine  tests were carried  out  on  22

workers and four more showed signs of severe  lead

absorption bordering on lead poisoning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have taken the opportunity to cite this recent

case  because  I  wish to question the  Government

whether  it  would feel inhibited  in  taking  the

logical   action   of  punishing   employers   who

flagrantly  flout the law. In the case  cited  the

prosecution asked for no punishment. The  manager,

who appeared on his company's behalf, admitted all

the facts read out in Court. The Court ordered him

to   comply  with  all  measures  listed  in   the

Factories  Act within a month or face  prosecution

again.  At  the very least, I thought the  factory

should  have been closed down temporarily for  the

owner   to   comply   with   the   licensing   and

registration of the factory, and the compliance of

some health and safety provisions laid down by the

Court.   The   factory  was  not  registered   and

licensed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, 9th July, 1971, the manager's

photograph  appeared in the Straits Times  with  a

terribly happy grin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that this factory is

not  the only unlicensed and unregistered factory.

I  have  just received information that  there  is

another factory in the same neighbourhood which is

unlicensed  and unregistered. Why is  it  that  so

lenient  a  view  and  posture  is  taken  by  the

competent  authority? Is the  Ministry  of  Labour

working  under a constrained policy of  protecting

investment at all costs?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Japan, which we are sometimes asked to

emulate,  a girl suffering from cadmium  poisoning

plunged  herself under a moving train  to  relieve

herself  of bodily pains which she could stand  no

more.  The  Japanese Prime Minister  tendered  his

sympathies  and apologised tearfully in Parliament

and announced the payment of compensation to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>



bereaved  family.  I  hope we  will  not  have  a

similar   occurrence  and  performance   in   our

Parliament.  Compensation removes some  financial

hardship  for the bereaved family, but it  is  no

compensation for the loss of a dear one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is gratifying that our Prime

Minister has taken a personal interest to  combat

pollution  of  our air and waterways.  Under  his

direction  we hope the Anti-Pollution  Unit  will

eliminate,  if not all, then most of  the  health

hazards  of  pollutants.  I  am  happy  that  the

Government  is  wasting no  precious  time  after

early warning was given in Parliament in 1969. As

the   problem  of  pollution  is  of   so   vital

importance  to the general public,  I  think  the

Government should report to Parliament from  time

to  time on the matter. The importance which  the

Government  attaches to this problem  is  evident

from  the recent appointment of the Head  of  the

Anti-Pollution Unit as Head of the Public  Health

Division at the Ministry of Health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the addendum to the President's

speech  indicated  that  air  pollution  in   our

industrial estates is increasing. If we  fail  to

take urgent preventive and corrective measures fn

Jurong  Town  and others, I feel we could  suffer

the  same fate as Los Angeles or Tokyo. The first

sufferers  and victims would be our poor  workers

who stay in these estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrialization and urbanization also take

their  toll  of human lives. In the  construction

field  the  number  of industrial  accidents  has

risen  to such serious proportions as to make  it

necessary  for  the Government to  introduce  the

Building  Operations  and  Works  of  Engineering

Construction    Regulations   which    Parliament

approved  on  30th July, 1971. These regulations,

if  implemented firmly, could go a  long  way  to

remove   all  possible  known  hazards   in   the

industry.  In regard to these safety regulations,

the  competent  authority is the  Chief  Building

Surveyor. In regard to safety regulations at sand

and granite



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>



quarries  the  safety regulations applicable  are

embodied  in the Sand and Quarries Act  which  is

the jurisdiction of the Director of Public Works.

In  regard  to  safety regulations in  factories,

shipyards and other places of work, the competent

authority  is  the Chief Inspector of  Factories.

The  control  of  silicosis among granite  quarry

workers  is  a matter for the Chief Inspector  of

Factories. Mr Speaker, Sir, it can be  seen  that

if  the  competent  authorities  in  the  various

departments are guided by different policies,  it

is   possible  that  safety  regulations  may  be

enforced  with  different  emphasis.  It  is   my

sincere  view that a consolidation of the various

laws  mentioned and unmentioned could be  a  more

convenient   means   of   administering    safety

regulations. A case in point is that  any  member

of  the  public could walk into a building  under

construction,  or  a construction  site,  without

permission  if  he is willing to take  the  risk.

This  should  never  be  allowed  to  happen.  Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  I  understand  that   when   the

Government published the Building Operations  and

Works of Engineering Construction Regulations  in

March this year, the competent authority, in this

case the Chief Building Surveyor himself, was not

aware  that  he  was the authority to  administer

these regulations. He could deny it anyway.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as Chairman of the N.T.U.C.

Occupational Health and Safety Committee, I  must

say  the  Government has shown great interest  in

the   health  and  safety  of  the  workers.  The

Government's   concern   in   this   respect   is

demonstrated by the introduction of  work  safety

laws  and  an  increase  in  the  staff  of   the

Factories Inspectorate. The Government's  concern

is  clearly  expressed by the  President  in  his

opening  speech. It is one of the most dominating

features of the policy of the Ministry of Labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Workmen's Compensation Act will be amended

to provide for three times the present

compensation rate to meet the contingencies in

the case of death and total physical incapacity.

There will be provision for the payment of

compensation to those who are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>



afflicted   by  occupational  diseases.   However,

compensation  should not be 4 desired  thing.  The

purpose   of  compensation  rates  should   be   a

deterrent to employers not to be negligent. As  it

is.  $7,200  awarded  in the case  of  death,  and

$9,600 for permanent incapacity, is chicken  feed.

This  will  make  the  worst  employers  disregard

safety rules and regulations as they feel that  it

does not matter when labour is cheap and workmen's

compensation is cheaper still.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on 30th July. 1971. I had

occasion  to  cite the cases of accidents  at  the

Mandarin  Hotel Construction site and at Chartered

Industries, where workers downed tools after their

co-workers  died  in industrial  accidents.  These

were  unorganised  workers. The  conditions  under

which  they  labour  are  seldom  favourable   and

conducive  for  them  to take  retaliatory  action

against unscrupulous employers. Nevertheless, they

vented  their anger on the employer by  militantly

stopping  work unless their safety was ensured.  I

salute  them again and would urge all  workers  to

work  safely  and to care for the  enforcement  of

safety regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there should be provisions to make it

mandatory   to   the   establishment   of   safety

committees in factories and other places of  work.

The    Government   should   also   consider   the

establishment  of  a council of industrial  safety

and  health  to advise the Government  on  matters

pertaining to industrial safety, and also act as a

watchdog to see that the relevant safety laws  are

implemented by the various Government departments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to hear the statement from the

Government  that it is conscious of the sacrifices

and  contributions  made by labour  towards  rapid

economic growth, and has urged employers who  have

been  making  exceptional profits  to  pay  better

bonuses    in   recognition   of   the    workers'

contribution  to the present economic  prosperity.

There  is an economic boom and the employers  have

made  profits.  All too often, few  employers  pay

anything more than what the law requires  them  to

do so. It is still my opinion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>



now, just as it was at the time Parliament debated

the  Employment Act in 1968, that the question  of

bonus  must  not be a restricted negotiable  item.

The denial of the negotiation rights of workers to

share the fruits of their labour is a back-kick in

the  teeth  on the democratic rights of labour  to

free collective bargaining.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank the President for his

speech  and  look  forward to  the  day  when  our

defence  build-up  will reach its  optimum  and  a

greater  share  of our revenue will  be  used  for

education, health and social services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion of the Member for Ulu

Pandan.



<br><br>3.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I wish to associate myself with  the

motion standing in the name of the Member for  Ulu

Pandan. It is gratifying to note that almost every

Member  has in his speech, in this debate, touched

on  the  need to adapt to changes occurring around

us. This shows that we are still politically alert

and   that  our  senses  are  not  numbed  by  the

comparative  comfort and affluence  that  we  have

achieved in the past years. History is nothing but

a   record  of  changing  circumstances.   It   is

important  that we should not only  try  to  bring

about  changes  in  our society for  the  greatest

benefit  of  our  people,  but  we  must  also  be

constantly aware of the changes around us  and  be

prepared  to take action to adapt to them.  To  do

the former, that is, to bring about changes in our

society,  it  is necessary for us to convince  the

people  that whatever changes we seek to introduce

are for the ultimate good of our people. It is  in

their  interest  that we have so  acted.  In  this

respect, there is nothing more convincing than the

past  record of the P.A.P. We have been  in  power

for  exactly twelve years now and throughout  that

twelve-year  period, in the ups and downs  of  our

fortunes,  one thing is very clear.  We  have  not

done anything which is not for the interest of the

people, To us, everything is for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>



people.  There has been no consideration for  our

own  self-interest. And to correct the expression

used  by the Member for Kallang just now, we  did

not come into office on the backs of the workers.

We  never  sat on their backs. We came  to  power

with the support of the workers.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Figuratively speaking!



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> As to the latter, the need to

be  aware  of  the changes occurring  around  us,

there is one thing we should always bear in mind,

that is, in the midst of the turbulent changes in

this  region, one thing must never be allowed  to

change,  and that is the independent identity  of

our country and our people. This is the objective

which  keeps  us going in our fight for  survival

and  for a better material life. Once it is gone,

our  will to survive will be rapidly eroded,  and

Singapore will revert back to a fishing  `village

and  this time the fishing village will be poorer

than  the  one Stamford Raffles found  150  years

ago, because the sea water around us is much more

polluted  than before and there is less  fish  ip

the  water.  It  is therefore necessary  that  we

should  pool  all our resources and  stiffen  our

will to fight the under-current forces which  are

trying to pull our people apart. So far, we  have

been  able  to achieve certain successes  on  the

economic  front, because we have been  acting  as

one  people.  But the moment the divisive  forces

take  over,  all  our  efforts  will  come  to  a

standstill.  Our  people  will  be  embroiled  in

endless  tights  and quarrels, with  very  little

time  for work. This is not what we want. And  we

should  use all the powers that we have  to  stop

certain  persons from trying to push  us  towards

that direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes it may be good to be an ally of a

great  power, to have a big brother  behind  you.

But  there  is always the phenomenon  called  the

gravitational pull in the world of  physics.  The

closer  a  smaller object moves towards a  bigger

mass, the greater the gravitational pull



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>



exerted on the smaller object by the bigger mass,

until eventually the smaller object crashes  into

the bigger mass and the two become one, and there

is   no  more  of  the  smaller  one.  We  should

therefore  resist the temptation  of  moving  too

close  to  any  great power, whether  it  is  for

prestigious,   protect   ional   or   sentimental

reasons.  A  balance must be  maintained  in  our

efforts   to   remain  a  free   agent   in   the

international arena.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between now and May next year, we will be able

to  witness  a  period of great changes  in  this

region.  The  President of the United  States  is

going to Peking to meet Chou En-lai. They will be

playing  a  game of chess on the huge  chessboard

which   is   Asia.  The  nations  in  the   Asian

continent, big and small, are the pieces on  this

chess-board. Whatever we do, we must try to avoid

becoming a pawn in other people's game of  chess.

It is true that we have no means to influence the

great  powers  when  they  make  decisions,   and

whatever  they decide concerning other  countries

may have far-reaching effects on us. But the fact

still  remains that if we are to get the greatest

benefit out of this unprecedented change  in  the

international  climate,  we  should  not   commit

ourselves  too early to any side,  and,  best  of

all, should not commit ourselves at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the international scene

is  changing  as a result of China's new  policy,

and  if  we  must  respond to these  changes,  we

should  do  so in a dignified manner and  in  the

best interest of our country, not just because it

is  the  fashion of the day and that other people

are  doing  the same thing. We should  not  allow

ourselves to be rushed onto the band-wagon. It is

important  that we should have friendly relations

with  all the countries in the world, and  having

friendly relations with China has always been one

of  our  aims.  But it is unrealistic,  and  even

foolish,  to  expect that having  good  relations

with  China will solve all our problems.  When  a

great power acts, it does so in its own interest.

All  considerations  for the  interest  of  other

countries  or  parties are just coincidental  and

are part of its moves to improve its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>



international standing. Our immediate  problem  is

and  has always been the Communist threat  in  our

midst. From the long-term point of view, the armed

struggle  of the M.C.P, in the jungles of northern

Malaysia will have a very serious bearing  on  the

security of our country. It is foolish to  believe

that  having  friendly relations with  China  will

cause  the  M.C.P, to abandon their fight  in  the

jungles, or our local Communists to give up  their

so-called "outside Parliament" struggle.  We  must

therefore  watch  very carefully the  developments

both  inside  and  immediately outside  Singapore.

Right  now,  the  mouth-piece of the  M.C.P.,  the

Voice  of  Malayan Revolution Radio, has increased

its power, output and frequencies. It can only  do

this with the help of a great power sympathetic to

its  cause. So I leave it to you to draw your  own

conclusions  as  to whether or  not  having  close

relations  with  China, or any great  power,  will

help  us to solve our immediate problems. What  is

important  here is that we should  not  allow  our

wish  to have closer and friendlier relations with

China  to jeopardise our efforts to curb the local

Communists in their mischievous deeds to turn  our

society into a lawless one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pace must be set by the elected government of

the  day.  If  there is going to be  a  change  of

policy,  that policy, whether foreign or domestic,

must be decided by us here, the representatives of

the  people.  However, there are some  people  who

believe  very foolishly that they also  have  that

right  to  decide for the people. They think  that

because  they are controlling the mass media,  the

newspapers,   they  should  have  the   right   to

influence  the people, who will in turn  influence

the  policy of the Government. We must state  here

very  emphatically  that they  do  not  have  that

right.  They  represent only themselves  and  they

speak only with their own voices, whereas we speak

here  with the voices of the people and  with  the

authority  of the electorate behind us. These  men

are  fond of saying, "We, the people." But we must

ask, who are the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>



people? Are they the people who elected us, or  do

they   just   consist  of  newspaper  owners   and

editorial writers? it is one thing to reflect  the

views  of  the  people in a paper  and  to  report

truthfully  what is going on in Singapore  and  in

the  world.  But  it is definitely  another  thing

trying  to  mount  a campaign by omitting  certain

things  and exaggerating others in order to  force

the  Government to change its course to  suit  the

taste  or  the purpose of the owner of the  paper.

The  Government is the one to decide which way the

country  should be heading and it is then for  the

press to assist in explaining why that course  has

to be taken. The dissenting voice should be heard,

but it must he in proportion to the views of other

people  and it should not be exaggerated. This  is

the  kind  of  relationship we would like  to  see

between the Government and the press.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a lot of talk about the freedom of

the  press.  But  we must be frank and  realistic.

Singapore has never had freedom of the press as it

is   understood  in  the  Western  world.   Making

comparisons  with  the so-called  freedom  of  the

press  in other countries, particularly the  West,

is  misleading. The circumstances of the press  in

these countries are very much different from those

in  Singapore. For instance, no one is allowed  to

run  a Communist newspaper here. The last one  was

closed  down 20 years ago during the emergency.  A

few  persons who now write for newspapers here are

very   fond  of  reminding  the  readers  of   the

turbulent  years in the fifties. But in  spite  of

all   this,   the  restriction  against  Communist

newspapers still stands. The organ of the  Barisan

Sosialis,  the  Chen  Sien  Pau,  is  a  different

matter.  It  is deliberately allowed to  carry  on

because  we  want the people to see for themselves

how  foolish the lines of the Barisan Sosialis can

be.  It also serves as a constant reminder of  the

Communist  threat in our midst. In this  case,  we

also  have  to  be  frank. We  are  tolerating  it

because its circulation is small, reaching only  a

small section of the people, particularly the die-hards



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Barisan  Sosialis who  are  dwindling  in

number.   But  the  moment  it  becomes   a   mass

circulation daily, it would be a different  thing.

We  will  then have to deal with it as a  security

problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, futile to try to draw a

comparison between the case of the New York  Times

and the case of the newspapers in Singapore. There

is no similarity between the two. It is a waste of

time  writing endless editorials here  harping  on

the freedom of the press with the model of the New

York Times in mind. In the first place, we do  not

have such traditions. In the second place, in  the

United  States  riots  can happen  every  day  and

everywhere, and yet the country remains stable and

prosperous. But in Singapore, one bloody riot will

wreck  the whole country. We have been responsible

for  bringing  about  the present  good  order  in

society  and the modest prosperity for the people.

We  are definitely not going to sit idle and watch

our  achievements being cancelled out by poisonous

writings in the papers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, how many countries in the world can

afford  the  luxury of unlimited  freedom  of  the

press? Or is it a myth that there is such a  thing

called  freedom of the press? In Russia, in China,

and  in  other Communist countries, the  press  is

part of the propaganda machinery of the state. The

press serves the interest of the Communist regime.

It  may  be  argued here that since the  Communist

party is the owner of the press and the party  has

the  greatest  freedom to do  whatever  it  wants,

including  the  use of the press  to  achieve  its

political  purposes,  therefore,  freedom  of  the

press  in  its  truest sense exists  in  Communist

countries. But, I do not think this is the kind of

freedom that the press wants in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the older countries with

established  social orders, or, as the  Communists

would  like to call them, the capitalist countries

such as Britain, France, the United States and  so

on,  the case is slightly different, but the  fact

still  remains that even in these countries  there

is no unlimited freedom of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>



the  press  in  terms  of  a  blank  cheque  where

journalists  can  say  what they  like.  In  these

countries, the newspapers and other mass media are

controlled  by  big  financial groups.  In  almost

every  one of these countries there exists a  hard

core of people who form the establishment, or,  to

use a Communist terminology, the ruling class. The

people working in the press share the views of the

establishment.  They have the same social  values,

tastes  and  outlook on life. The members  of  the

establishment do not belong to just one  political

party. They have no party lines. They can be found

in  all  the  major political parties and  in  all

walks  of  life  and  invariably  hold  very  high

positions. So political parties may come and go in

these  countries,  but  the establishment  ensures

that  its  views and social values prevail.  These

are  reflected in their press. All newspapers must

toe  the line of the establishment and those which

do   not  are  subtly  dealt  with,  not  by   the

withdrawal  of the printing licence,  as  we  have

done  so in the case of the Singapore Herald,  but

by   the   quiet   and  effective  withdrawal   of

advertisement  and  financial support.  There  may

exist  one  or two small newspapers, Communist  or

otherwise,  which  contain  drastically   opposing

views.  But they are merely tolerated there,  just

as  we  are tolerating the Barisan newspaper here.

They  also  serve as trappings to the  make-belief

that  there is such a thing called freedom of  the

press.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have had too short a time for

any  establishment to evolve. We  have  only  just

come to the sixth anniversary of our independence.

In  these  circumstances, the P.A.P, assumes  the

leadership  of  the country and it represents  the

interest  of the people. There may be extreme  and

conflicting  views existing among the people,  but

we always take the middle course and represent the

majority of them. We therefore must have the right

to  lay down the lines for the people, because  we

are   for   the  time  being  charged   with   the

responsibility of looking after their welfare.  We

must  have  the right to say that it is our  views

that should prevail and not those of the Communist

party



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>



or those belonging to the establishment group of a

foreign  country. There may be a group  of  people

who  think that they can ignore this rule. I think

it  is  time that they should open their  eyes  to

realities   and   not  allow  themselves   to   be

overwhelmed by the myths and fictions belonging to

a different society. If they do not do so, then it

is  going  to  be very difficult for us  and  very

troublesome for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps all this talk about taking over the

Government and pulling the P.A.P, down arises  out

of an innocent belief perpetuated by some quarters

that  we are getting old and that we are about  to

give  up. It may be beneficial for all parties  if

we  are to state here that we are not getting old.

Older  maybe  in age, but not in mind and  spirit.

The  good  knife is not blunted yet, as a  Chinese

saying  goes, "Pau tau wei lau." We have our  ears

and  eyes  always on the ground listening  to  the

voice  of the people and always catering for their

needs.  It is also necessary for us to state  here

that  we  are  not likely to give up our  task  so

easily.  There might have been a time in the  very

remote   past  when  we  considered   giving   up.

Immediately after the defeat in the Hong  Lim  by-election,   which  I  can  still   remember,   for

instance, there was a passing thought, and it  was

even  discussed among some of us, that perhaps  it

might be a good idea if we were to give up for the

time  being.  But  then we  were  aware  that  the

British were in active control. There was a safety

net  at the bottom of everything and we knew  that

things could not go too far wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But things are different today. We cannot afford

to give up and we do not intend to do so. There is

nothing  at the bottom to save us now.  If  we  go

down, we will go right down and this time it  will

be  worse  than the confrontation days,  the  days

when  we  were  in  Malaysia,  the  days  of   the

Emergency and the days of the Japanese occupation.

The   lives  of  two  million  people   would   be

endangered if we were to fail in our task. History

will   judge  us  as  the  greatest  cowards   and

criminals if we were to abdicate our duties now at

this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>



crucial  moment of Singapore's development  as  an

independent country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, to those who have the ambition to succeed us,

I  have  this  advice  to offer.  They  must  stop

talking  about  taking over the  Government.  This

only  serves to demonstrate their greed and  their

ambition.  That  is no good for  them.  They  must

first show to the people of Singapore how they can

be  worthy of their support. They must first  tell

the  people  of Singapore how they can  do  things

better  than  the P.A.P. The people  of  Singapore

want as their leaders persons who are serious  and

with   a  sense  of  responsibility  towards   the

ultimate  well-being  of the  country.  They  want

persons who can withstand the toughest trials  and

tribulations in time. They do not want clowns  and

entertainers in the political arena. They  do  not

want   people  who  start  scrambling  for  spoils

immediately after they have formed a party and who

resign  as  soon as a so-called crisis  occurs  in

their midst.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  let  me  also add my voice to those  of  the

honourable  Members in thanking the President  for

his  speech  to Parliament made on the 21st  July,

1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are once again approaching a critical point in

the  history  of  this nation and  state  when  it

becomes incumbent upon every thoughtful citizen to

reflect  and  decide  upon the  character  of  the

social order that we are consciously building  for

ourselves.  In  the  1940s and  1950s,  the  great

question   was   the   problem   of   colonialism.

Thereafter until 1963, the principal enemy of  the

people  were the local Communists and the question

at  issue was whether we established for ourselves

a political system that ensured a periodically and

freely  elected  government or  succumbed  to  the

Communist system of government by terror;  whether

we  had a government that was centred in Singapore

and  ruled  in the best interest of the people  of

Singapore, or one that took its orders



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>



from foreign centres of political power. From 1963

to  1965,  the critical question was  whether  the

character of our politics was to be a function  of

race and language. The birth of the nation in 1965

symbolised  the  rejection  of  racism   and   its

attendant  linguistic barbarities as the  criteria

of  political  policy and behaviour. The  decisive

question  in  the I 970s would be whether  we  are

able  to  forge a secular political  community  in

which economic and social questions determine  our

politics  out  of  the  disparate  linguistic  and

cultural   groups  of  human  beings   that   form

Singapore society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rational policies formulated by Government and

disciplined effort on the part of the people  have

resulted  in  the  ostensible  wealth  that  today

glitters  around us. The indications are  that  we

have  achieved the enviable target  of  near  full

employment  which, paradoxically, has created  new

problems  relating  to manpower  which,  unsolved,

would stunt the further growth of our economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time is fast approaching for us also to

initiate,  side by side with policies designed  to

develop to the full the nature and quality of  our

economic  forces of production, measures aimed  at

humanising    society    and    state.     Despite

opportunities for employment, there are dark areas

of  human  hardship  and suffering  that  must  he

overcome if we are to retain our self-respect. The

criteria  used  by the Ministry of Social  Affairs

should  be  carefully re-examined to  see  if  the

levels  of public assistance allowances meted  out

are  sufficient to enable a destitute to  maintain

body  and soul together. This, however, is not  to

decry  the  hitherto good work done by the  Social

Welfare  Department. The enormity of  the  problem

was  acute enough to entice an honourable Member,

himself  a  noted  economist, to suggest  in  this

House  a wealth tax to soak the rich, despite  the

stern  imperatives  of quick economic  development

and the industrial transformation of our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the only aim of soaking the rich is to display

our socialist credentials, it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>



would be an exercise in futility and bring in  its

wake  growing  frustration and disenchantment.  If

the  objective  is  one  of fairly  and  equitably

distributing the new wealth produced, it cannot be

beyond   our   wits  to  evolve  a  self-adjusting

mechanism with proper legal sanctions through  our

collective   bargaining   machinery   that   would

effectuate   such  distribution  of  wealth.   The

fundamental problem, however, would be to evolve a

system  of ethical and cultural values that  would

provide   the   solvent  to  dissolve   the   many

contradictions that currently operate in  society.

While  bilingualism  and multi-cultural  tolerance

provide   the   lowest  common  denominators   for

cultural  integration, there  is  much  more  that

could  be  done  in  the  way  of  providing   the

organisational  and  physical  framework  for  the

interaction of the highest classical traditions in

art,  literature, music and culture  of  the  many

traditions of civilisation that have moulded  this

nation.  Human  minds belonging to  the  different

traditions  must  meet to discover  one  another's

wealth and diversity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a tendency of late on the part of

some  to define human beings and human society  in

mechanistic  terms in an effort to categorise  the

human  digit in purely physical, measurable terms.

This type of quantitative analysis may or may  not

provide the ultimate answers, but it would be well

to  remember that the human being possesses within

himself the factor of indeterminacy which provides

the  creative  impulse for  great  works  of  art,

literature and music. It is precisely this  factor

that  is killed in totalitarian states and  it  is

this factor that our social order should carefully

nurture. As our society evolves into higher  forms

of  endeavour, cohesion and excellence, we  should

consciously seek to transform force into law, fear

into  respect,  coercion into  consent,  necessity

into   liberty  and  superstition  into   rational

consciousness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are able to achieve the many things we have

set  ourselves,  it is imperative  that  there  be

peace  and  order both internal and  regional.  We

already



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>



have  indications  that the  exigencies  of  power

politics  would  militate  against  this  regional

peace and order that every power pays homage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from time immemorial, big powers

have  interfered in the internal affairs of  small

states; and being a small state ourselves, we must

gird ourselves to meet this situation. In the name

of  building an anti-imperialist front, one  great

power  would  seek to penetrate our  trade  unions

and,   in   the  name  of  fundamental  democratic

freedoms,  another  great  power  would  seek   to

influence   our   intelligentsia   and   religious

organisations. The net result of these  activities

would   be  the  erosion  of  the  power  of   the

government and state to stand up to the  pressures

and  behests of these great powers. We can end  up

as puppets. In combating the effects of this game,

we  must, from time to time, take the people  into

our confidence in order that maximum vigilance and

cohesion  are  maintained  at  all  times.   Human

corruptibility would always be a weakening  factor

in  any polity. The Herald and Nanyang affairs are

reminders of unsolved problems within ourselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, a word must be said about the new

Woodlands  satellite town now  being  constructed,

and   about  our  water  problem.  In  scope   and

dimension it is to be the biggest town yet, and we

must expect that past errors in planning would not

be  repeated here. We understand that the new town

would  have  the  most  up-to-date  amenities  for

social and cultural life. We welcome this, as also

the new compensation terms recently announced. The

problem  of compensating absentee owners, however,

remains  unsolved; but this is not something  that

cannot be solved by quiet diplomacy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Utilities Board's call to the people

to  conserve  water  and the magnificent  response

from  the  people  has once again highlighted  the

water  problem.  A  cursory look  at  the  figures

reveal a curious but interesting picture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average rainfall for the whole island is

about  750 million gallons per day. As our maximum

consumption is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>



around 130 million gallons per day, we should have

at  our disposal about 620 million gallons per day

provided  that  we are able to collect  our  total

daily rainfall.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of ways in which this could be

done. The obvious thing to do would be to increase

the  capacity  of  the  impounding  reservoirs  by

building   new   reservoirs   or   expanding   the

capacities  of  the  old  ones.  The  capacity  of

Seletar Reservoir has been increased considerably.

Extension works are being done at Pierce. The same

thing  should  be  done  to  MacRitchie.  Two  new

reservoirs  are being built at Bedok  and  at  Ulu

Pandan/Kranji. Side by side with this development,

the  water  filtration capacity of the  filtration

plants should also be increased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two reservoirs in Sentosa. Pulau Tekong

and  Pulau  Ubin have primitive water conservation

schemes,  and  Pulau  Brani  receives  water  from

Singapore.  The total water resources of  all  our

smaller islands should also be developed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other exciting possibilities. We could

build  breakwaters at the mouths of our many small

rivers,  drain  out  the  sea-water,  prevent  its

seepage  and  let in fresh river  water  into  the

reservoirs so constructed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, some of our islands could be joined to

Singapore  in  such a way as to  provide  us  with

reservoirs  fitted in between these small  islands

and  Singapore. Once again the sea-water could  be

drained  out  and  fresh water  collected  in  its

place. This method could be pursued with advantage

with regard to the islands off Jurong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industries should be encouraged to use industrial

water  in place of P.U.B, potable water for  their

processes. At present, we have two sewage  plants,

one  at  Jurong  and another next  to  Paya  Lebar

Airport. Every gallon o industrial water used is a

gallon  of  potable water saved  and,  on  present

calculations,  it  would appear  that  40  million

gallons  of industrial water per day go to  waste.

The recent decision of the Minister for Finance to

withdraw the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>



50  cents  sewer  tax  on industrial  water  is  a

welcome move. This tax has been a needless  burden

on  the  woodworking  and  textile  industries  in

Jurong.  With  the establishment of petro-chemical

industries in Jurong, the water needs of the petro-chemical industries, together with the woodworking

and  textile  industries alone, would  be  in  the

region  of three to four million gallons per  day.

This  demand  should be met entirely  out  of  our

industrial water capacity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a concomitant to the plan to use industrial

water,  a  double  distribution  system  for   the

distribution  of  industrial and  even  sea  water

should  be  experimented with, preferably  in  new

housing  and  industrial estates  that  are  being

built near the sea. The Woodlands New Town and the

East Coast Reclamation Scheme come to mind in this

regard.  We  could  try  the  double  reticulation

system and use coloured taps (red, green, etc.) to

distinguish the potable water from the  industrial

or sea water. Sea water could he used to flush our

toilets.  There may be technical problems involved

in  conducting  sea  water. But modern  technology

should provide us with new materials so fabricated

as  to  be able to withstand the corrosive effects

of sea water.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more expensive though exciting project that

could be put in hand immediately is the nuclear de-salination of sea water. This process is  becoming

a  commercial reality in other parts of the  world

with water scarcity problems. It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>



also  has the added advantage of providing us with

a  new  source of electrical power for  industrial

and other purposes. The scheme would enable us  to

train   our  people  in  the  uses  of  this   new

technology. De-salination has a great  future.  It

could  solve  our  water  problem  radically.  De-salinated water would probably cost $3 to  $4  per

1,000  gallons as against the $1 per 1,000 gallons

now  charged  by the P.U.B. I would  suggest  that

this  differential is not prohibitive and a  small

plant  to  produce, say, five million gallons  per

day should be started. Posterity would commend the

wisdom of the move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, we must once again thank the people of

Singapore  for  having responded magnificently  to

the  P.U.B.'s  call  to discipline  their  use  of

water. We now know that in any future emergency of

whatever form or nature, the proper response would

be forthcoming from our people.
