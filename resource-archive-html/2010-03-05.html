Let me first declare my pecuniary interest as I have been engaged by the Government to design and conduct Community Engagement Programme (CEP) workshops.&nbsp; But it is precisely because of this experience that I feel I have gained some insights to recommend what might be useful next steps for this increasingly important programme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the last few years, the CEP Directorate in MHA has directly, or through other agencies, engaged hundreds of community and grassroots leaders including CCC and IRCC leaders.&nbsp; Similar workshops were conducted for all Cluster Superintendants, school principals and key HODs.&nbsp; Apart from gaining specific skills in accurately sensing anomalies and dealing with them, feedback from participants indicated that what they benefited most&nbsp;was the opportunity to share openly about issues that are generally considered highly sensitive, even taboo.&nbsp; The feeling was that hearing the viewpoints of the trainer and other participants in a "safe" and closed-door <p align=left>Column: 3052</p>setting, heightened their awareness and sensitivity.&nbsp; This is, in turn, helped to build and deepen trust, which is critical for community engagement and harmony.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What was instructive was that some participants shared their surprise and sense of awakening that in spite of having been born and bred in multi-racial Singapore, there were many aspects that&nbsp;they were not aware of or inadvertently had been deaf to.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This got me thinking: if those who have&nbsp;lived here all their lives are struggling to understand the nuances of multi-culturalism, imagine the challenges faced by our new immigrants!&nbsp; Likewise, if these community and school leaders who are in their late 30s and 40s, on average,&nbsp;not&nbsp;sufficiently clued-in on the deeper aspects of key historical events such as the 1964 racial riots, how can we expect youths to understand this?&nbsp; The truth is, if we do not have a deep enough understanding of racial and religious issues as well as other social fault lines, true community engagement would be impossible.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most effective way to engage youth and new immigrants is by reaching out to leaders in these two groups:&nbsp; (i) Youth Leaders&nbsp;&ndash; we need to start with leaders within the school system, which could include student leaders at secondary, JC, ITE, Polytechnic and University levels.&nbsp; We should also work with organisations such as People's Association (PA) and other prominent non-Government groups to identify youths who hold leadership positions outside the MOE catchment.&nbsp; (ii) New immigrants&nbsp;&ndash; this is likely to be a more amorphous and diverse group.&nbsp; I envisage the leaders of this constituency would be identified in collaboration with PA, National Integration Council (NIC) and religious groups.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To conclude, the pace at which we are seeing new immigrants and the increased exposure, especially for our <p align=left>Column: 3053</p>youths through the Internet, make it even more challenging for us to build a collective consciousness, sensibility and reflex as a society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</B> I thank the Members who have spoken on the MHA issues and for giving me and my colleagues the opportunity to address them.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the threat of terrorism remains real in our region, and so it remains real for Singapore too.&nbsp; We are an open society and we cannot insulate ourselves from the situation in our region or other parts of the world.&nbsp; Mr Alvin Yeo is right to point out that the threat of terrorism remains.&nbsp; This is notwithstanding the slew of arrests by regional authorities which Mr Christopher de Souza has noted.&nbsp; Indeed, despite&nbsp;such successes, the terrorist threat, which Mr de Souza and Mr Hri Kumar talked about, remains significant.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, this is because the appeal of extremist and terrorist ideology is still very much alive.&nbsp; While the majority of people reject it, terrorism remains, and it needs only a handful as its vanguard.&nbsp; Therefore, so long as radicalisation and self-radicalisation of individuals continue to occur, terror groups remain capable of recouping their losses with new recruits.&nbsp; In Indonesia, for example, the death of Noordin Top has not discouraged those he had recruited from continuing with their terrorist acts.&nbsp; More recently, the arrest in Malaysia of 10 terror suspects, which included individuals from Yemen, Nigeria, Jordon and Syria, are a reminder of our vulnerability to terrorist threats coming from beyond the region.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, terrorist trade-craft and methods are evolving even as&nbsp;security systems improve.&nbsp; Whether it is liquid bomb or binary bomb created to defeat <p align=left>Column: 3054</p>detection technologies or explosives in shoes or underwear, we continue to see the creative determination of terrorists to circumvent security defences.&nbsp; The intent of terror groups to stage violent attacks has not diminished, even if the opportunities to do so, especially for mega attacks, are fewer than before because of a general hardening of potential targets by the authorities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Christopher de Souza asked about the steps to make Singapore and Southeast Asia safer.&nbsp; The most critical factor in enhancing the security of the region and, therefore, Singapore is strong intelligence and operational cooperation between our security and intelligence agencies and their regional and international counterparts.&nbsp; Intelligence shared between the countries has helped in the prevention of attacks and in the arrests of terrorists.&nbsp; We have also deployed Police liaison officers in Jakarta and Manila to facilitate cooperation and timely intelligence exchanges with these two countries.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, border&nbsp;security is another&nbsp;key line of defence.&nbsp; Mr Hri Kumar asked whether the security measures at our checkpoints are at pace with new terrorist threats and methods.&nbsp; We have established a range of physical security measures at all our checkpoints and regularly review these measures.&nbsp; For instance, checks at our airports were immediately stepped up after the foiled Christmas Day attack on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 in Detroit.&nbsp;&nbsp;But being an island, our borders are porous.&nbsp; Those determined to sneak into or out of Singapore may sometimes succeed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our border security is about more than just our checkpoints.&nbsp; Maritime security, therefore, is something&nbsp;we must continue to pay attention to.&nbsp; Given the current security climate, we cannot assume that an intrusion&nbsp;is criminal and is not terrorist related.&nbsp; The Mumbai incident which saw the terrorists covertly entering the city by <p align=left>Column: 3055</p>the sea tells us clearly that such an assumption could make us dangerously blinkered.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>12.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Police Coast Guard (PCG) works very closely with the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) to have an integrated picture of the maritime domain.&nbsp; The PCG has also started to renew its fleet to enhance its detection and interception capabilities.&nbsp; In recent months, the PCG has achieved several successes against smuggling syndicates.&nbsp; This underscores its ability to prevent intrusion through our coastline.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will not tolerate any sea-borne threat to our domestic security.&nbsp; If an intruding vessel refuses to stop despite repeated instructions to do so, the PCG will shoot at the engine of non-compliant vessels to stop them at sea.&nbsp; Such disabling fire will be employed only when absolutely necessary, and the Police's response will be proportional to the threat posed.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Safeguards are in place to ensure that the responsible use of force&nbsp;is being complied with.&nbsp; The PCG officers have undergone intensive proficiency training and will appraise the ground conditions carefully before employing disabling fire.&nbsp; Disabling fire will not be employed if there are any reasonable risks&nbsp;to innocent vessels or persons.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we are constantly seeking out new technologies to strengthen our borders security. At our Tuas Checkpoint, for instance, we have developed a facility for our&nbsp;frontline officers to test and detect suspicious chemical, biological, radiological or explosive substances.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ultimately, however, our most important asset in security is still our people. Public vigilance is&nbsp;key to deterring terror cells from taking root in our community, a concern raised by Mr de Souza. Singaporeans need to play their <p align=left>Column: 3056</p>part by being our eyes and ears on the ground and reporting any suspicious happenings that they see. Indeed, individuals in any potentially targeted domain have local knowledge and instincts which are useful to tap on and are of a security value.&nbsp; If they&nbsp;can be trained and&nbsp;sensitised to look out for potential security risks, they will expand the community of security vigilance in our domain.&nbsp; By involving the community, we are also educating and preparing Singaporeans against a terrorist attack, which Mr Hri Kumar has correctly pointed out is key.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In line with this approach, we have piloted over the last year an initiative called Threat-Oriented Passenger Screening Integrated System (TOPSIS). This initiative involves the Home Team working in an integrated manner with frontline officers&nbsp;and the stakeholder entities at each of these checkpoints to better identify and respond to suspicious individuals. For instance, the non-security communities such as the airport check-in counter staff are trained to assist security agencies to identify suspicious passengers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such an approach is not new.&nbsp; We have always emphasised how important it is to mobilise our public to be vigilant and prepared. Hence, we have always sought to work closely with our public and private sector partners.&nbsp; Whether it is for high profile events like the coming Singapore Youth Olympic Games, or protecting critical infrastructure or private developments such as the IRs, the best way to balance security with other important considerations is to factor in security considerations from the outset in the planning for these events and&nbsp;developments.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was indeed the approach that we took with the IR which Mr Arthur Fong asked about. The Home Team engaged the IRs from the design stage to ensure <p align=left>Column: 3057</p>that the safety and security requirements are addressed. We have also enhanced our response capacity for the IRs&nbsp;&ndash; for instance, the Marina Bay Neighbourhood&nbsp;Police Centre is already operational and the Fire Station will be operational next year.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ensuring public vigilance and crisis preparedness of the community - a matter raised by Mr de Souza and Mr Arthur Fong&nbsp;&ndash; is a&nbsp;continuing effort of the Home Team. As Mr de Souza also mentioned, complacency of Singaporeans is always a concern. The more we are free from a terrorist incident or even a natural disaster, the more people are inclined to take security for granted.&nbsp; Be that as it may, we must persist with efforts to enhance crisis awareness and contingency preparedness at all levels.&nbsp; I would urge Singaporeans not to be complacent and to take their security and safety for granted.&nbsp; They must do their part.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last July, we conducted Exercise Northstar VII. This involved Government agencies, the private sector and the community.&nbsp; In August last year, we launched&nbsp;a workshop series on crisis management. The first workshop was customised for senior security executives in the hotel industry. We will be conducting further workshops later this year to reach out to other corporate sector partners.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the level of the general public, we have been developing the Community Engagement Programme (CEP). Now in its fourth year, the CEP has reached more groups than ever. The constituencies' CEP-Ready certification programme, for instance, has seen the development of baseline crisis response capabilities in almost every constituency.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr de Souza asked how we can stop terrorist ideology from infecting our <p align=left>Column: 3058</p>community.&nbsp; Here, we have very good work being done in the countering of extremist and terrorist ideology.&nbsp; The persisting threat of self-radicalisation makes these efforts even more critical today.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, I commend the efforts of our various local Muslim groups and scholars and the Religious Rehabilitation Group.&nbsp; Understanding the vulnerability of the young and that their medium of choice is often the Internet, many of these Islamic scholars are working through their websites and blogs to counter the toxic influence of extremist ideology propagated through the Internet.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I assure Members that we will do everything reasonable and practicable to prevent a terrorist incident and to mitigate its consequences, especially on our communal harmony and social cohesion, if it occurs.&nbsp; It is important therefore that Singaporeans play their part and continue to strive to be vigilant and prepared, and to nurture the bonds of trust within our community.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ultimately, however, Sir, we need to be always realistic and balanced when we deal with security.&nbsp; On the one hand, we should not be in denial. The threat is real and we are not immune from it.&nbsp; On the other hand, we must recognise that no security system can be completely foolproof.&nbsp; Risk-based judgments and trade-offs must be made at all times.&nbsp; Life must go on despite the continuing threat of terrorism.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam):</B> Sir, I will deal with the questions raised on Home Team resources, law and order at the Integrated Resorts (IRs), race classification, maintaining religious harmony and irresponsible Internet behaviour.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Mr Alvin Yeo's speech that we cannot neglect Homeland <p align=left>Column: 3059</p>security.&nbsp; Mr Yeo observed little or no manpower increases in the Home Team this coming year.&nbsp; That comment has to be seen in context.&nbsp; In 2009-2010, the Home Team saw significant increases to establishment for&nbsp;Police (1,315 or 11%), &nbsp;ICA&nbsp;(1,275 or 33%), CNB&nbsp;(64 or 10%) and SCDF&nbsp;(205 or 10%).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving forward, we are looking to increase ICA manpower at the checkpoints and staffing a new cruise terminal.&nbsp; For SCDF, we will have a new fire station for Tuas View and a new Fire Post at Sentosa. More manpower will also be allocated for frontline policing and key operational roles like investigation and intelligence.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a limit to how much additional resources can be pumped in to the Home Team.&nbsp; However, there are pressures, like an&nbsp;expanding&nbsp;population, as pointed out by Mr de Souza, an increase in mega events and a more complex security environment.&nbsp; Thus, as I had shared in last year's COS debate, it is important for us to deal with these constraints in a holistic manner.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, there must be force multipliers, like technology, to maximise the utility of limited resources. Second, we should partner the private sector to augment the security force and also free up Home Team officers to perform more critical functions. Third, we need to forge deep and meaningful collaborations with community partners.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The long-term solution cannot be to continue growing the size of the Home Team indefinitely.&nbsp; Instead, our resources must be allocated to areas that best optimise their training capabilities. And this must be to combat crime and not to do pest control like catching snakes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the IRs, Mr de Souza, Mr Arthur Fong, Mr Ang Mong Seng and Dr Ong Seh <p align=left>Column: 3060</p>Hong were concerned about issues relating to vice, loansharking and other social menaces.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have been focusing on the different potential threats faced and beyond issues relating to regulating the casinos. Being iconic, the IRs are potential targets for terrorists. We are also mindful, given the experience of other jurisdictions, that the casinos may attract criminal elements including organised crime, vice, moneylaundering and loansharking.&nbsp; We have from the outset built capabilities to deal with multi-faceted threats.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Casino Regulatory Authority (CRA) was set up in April 2008. The Casino Crime Investigation Branch (CCIB) was set up to deal specifically with casino-related crime. The new Marina Bay NPC and Bukit Merah West NPC will oversee general law and order at the Marina Bay Sands and Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) respectively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to vice activities which Mr de Souza asked about, the Police has increased the number of officers available to deal with vice. Police Land Division officers have been vested with the same powers as those from CID to curb vice-related activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the casinos started operations, the law and order situation has generally remained under control. It is early days yet but we will monitor the situation closely.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the issue of problem gambling, that is under MCYS' purview.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will&nbsp;now turn to Ms Irene Ng's question which can be broken down into two distinct points. One, that there should be a new category of 'Singaporean' in the 'race' field of the NRIC.&nbsp; And two, we should ensure a level playing field for all citizens regardless of race, language or religion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 3061</p>I will now respond to each of her points.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the&nbsp;idea that there should be a new category of 'Singaporean', for those who prefer to state that, rather than ethnic identity.&nbsp; An idea like this has to be realistic, acceptable to the majority, and capable of being implemented effectively. The reality is that ours is a multi-ethnic society. Our people are&nbsp;heirs with several cultures which have long, proud and rich traditions, stretched over thousands of years.&nbsp; Ethnicity and culture identity, and identification along those lines, are not going to disappear by doing away with it in our NRIC or providing an option for people to avoid stating their ethnicity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The example of France and many other countries tells us that.&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, in the Singapore context, there is much to be said for openly accepting our ethnic differences and celebrating our ethnic and cultural diversity. That diversity can be melted into great strength if properly handled&nbsp;&ndash; witness our ability to span across Asia and take part in the rise of China, India and parts of Southeast Asia.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, we must not lose sight of one basic fundamental ideal which really underlines Ms Ng's point. While we acknowledge our different ethnicities and cultures, underlying&nbsp;this is&nbsp;the ideal that they are all Singaporeans first and foremost&nbsp;&ndash; this has to be the foundation for our society. We will support each other and fight for each other.&nbsp; The Singaporean national identity has to be nurtured and strengthened into a powerful unifying force. The Singaporean identity has to be made stronger than the individual ethnic identities.&nbsp; But that ideal is not going to be achieved by us ignoring our ethnic diversity, nor would our ethnic diversity go away because we do not reflect it in our NRICs.&nbsp;Even in countries with highly egalitarian ideas, with far longer history than ours, race still continues to be a central tenet and fact of <p align=left>Column: 3062</p>society.&nbsp; It does not go away easily, even over hundreds of years.&nbsp; Thus, it is best to be pragmatic and realistic while not losing sight of achievable ideals.&nbsp;While race does not always equate&nbsp;to culture, it most often does.&nbsp; Policy has to be based on the norm rather than the exception.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me deal with Ms Ng's second point on ensuring a level playing field for all citizens regardless of race, language or religion.&nbsp; I agree entirely.&nbsp; I said earlier that, as a society, we can in fact be stronger if we celebrate our diversity and draw strength from that diversity.&nbsp; It will however not be possible to draw such strength if any ethnic group is discriminated against.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our pledge sets out what our ideals are. As a Government and as a society, we have striven&nbsp;to achieve those ideals.&nbsp; Nevertheless, in a society like ours, from time to time, there will be perceptions of discrimination as well as actual cases where discrimination occurs. That happens in every multi-ethnic society.&nbsp; And discrimination on some differential basis occurs in every society.&nbsp; That is the reality of social organisation.&nbsp; The key is that our Government and public institutions, as a matter of public policy, do not tolerate such discrimination. We do our best to ensure a level playing field based on meritocracy.&nbsp; By and large, we have been successful, though&nbsp;in&nbsp;issues like this, it is always work in progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a society whose fundamental tenet is meritocracy and all ethnic groups have made substantial progress. We have a good foundation for our society to move further forward to achieve the vision in our pledge.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p>&nbsp; <META content="MSHTML 6.00.2900.3660" name="GENERATOR"> <LINK title="/iw/ewebeditpro20/ektnormal.css" href="/iw/ewebeditpro20/ektnormal.css" rel="stylesheet"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now move on to religious harmony.&nbsp; Dr Ong Seh Hong spoke about the need for religious tolerance and harmony.&nbsp; Singapore's peaceful communal relations are the result of the careful management of relations between the various racial and religious groups by the <p align=left>Column: 3063</p>Government and the commitment of our people to the ideals and value of communal harmony.&nbsp; At the core is the policy that the Government of Singapore is secular and that the secular law is supreme.&nbsp; This ensures that all races and religions are given equal protection under the law.&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</p><p>12.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite this, we occasionally face incidents of conflict and tension, as pointed out by Dr Ong.&nbsp; Ethnic and religious diversity pose some challenges to social order as different groups pursue their interests, sometime over enthusiastically and passionately.&nbsp; Our approach towards resolving such disagreements is that they should be mediated or resolved on the ground through&nbsp;common sense and moral suasion using the collective efforts of the community, grassroots and religious leaders.&nbsp; However, there may be times when such efforts are not enough.&nbsp; In such instances, the authorities will step in to deal with the problem, and I do not think that&nbsp;anyone doubts the will and resolve of the Government to deal with these issues effectively and quickly.&nbsp; Dr Ong suggested sending out a&nbsp;stronger and clearer&nbsp;signal for every breach.&nbsp; Ideally, such action by the authorities&nbsp;should be few and far between.&nbsp; The long-term solution to religious disputes must reside in mutual understanding and trust among the different groups and their leaders.&nbsp; Dr Ong's suggestion that religious clerics undergo a course&nbsp;on religious harmony is really a matter for MCYS to consider.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will end by addressing the&nbsp;issue&nbsp;raised by Dr Maliki about irresponsible Internet behaviour.&nbsp; The&nbsp;Government has generally taken a light touch approach on regulating the Internet.&nbsp; However, we do take a serious view of those who take advantage of the anonymity offered by the Internet to do harm to&nbsp;others or to the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not hesitate to take action in such cases.&nbsp; Should the&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3064</p>Government go&nbsp;further and criminalise more irresponsible Internet behaviour?&nbsp; In&nbsp;France, it is an offence for anyone to broadcast images of certain classes of&nbsp;violent crimes, including severe beatings or rape.&nbsp; While Singapore does not have such a law, we will monitor developments and review our practices and laws where necessary.&nbsp; Ultimately, the Internet cannot be a&nbsp;place where the law is suspended.&nbsp; There has to be accountability&nbsp;for actions on the Internet as well as in the physical world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</B> Mr Chairman, I will address issues on loansharking, drug abuse and the law and order situation in Singapore.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On loansharking, Mr de Souza and Mr Ang Mong Seng asked if the new measures introduced recently have deterred loansharks.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I moved the amendments to the Moneylenders Act in January, I said that we should not view the enhanced measures as a silver bullet or a panacea.&nbsp; While&nbsp;the strong endorsement in this House signalled clearly our collective resolve to tackle this scourge, much more work remained to be done by all stakeholders.&nbsp; Since the passage of the Bill, which came into force on 11th February, I am gratified that more hands have come on&nbsp;deck to deal with this scourge.&nbsp; The fact that MPs have raised this topic at this COS is a warning to all loansharks and their runners that our sights are set on them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on enforcement, Police has pressed on with its ground efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrest figures remain high, 958 arrests last year, a 90% increase compared to the year before.&nbsp; Arrests reached a high of 132 in January this year compared to a monthly arrest rate of 80 last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;That shows that Police is pressing on the ground too.&nbsp; This is achieved through ground operations to disrupt the runners as well <p align=left>Column: 3065</p>as intelligence-led ones targeting syndicates.&nbsp; The number of harassment cases, after spiking from around 11,400 in 2008 to 17,883 last year, has shown signs of stabilising.&nbsp; So, in response to Mr de Souza, there are encouraging signs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On prosecution, three persons have been charged for loansharking activities committed after the amended Moneylenders Act came into effect.&nbsp; If convicted,&nbsp;they will be subject to enhanced penalties and we will publicise these cases as a warning to others.&nbsp; On preventive education, the National Council on Problem Gambling has intensified its outreach to warn against over-extending oneself in gambling.&nbsp; Mr Ang asked if loanshark syndicates have acquired smaller operations to increase their strength. &nbsp;I think he was citing an article in the Chinese press on what&nbsp;is allegedly happening in Malaysia.&nbsp; Sir, Police has not observed such a trend and would be happy to receive any information on it.&nbsp; Even if it happens, Police is able to counter it.&nbsp; On whether CCTVs can be installed at households harassed by&nbsp;loansharks, Sir, we are already doing so.&nbsp; Police procured more CCTV systems this&nbsp;year and are working with households to install them, especially innocent households which have been harassed many times.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for his other&nbsp;suggestion, the Court now already has&nbsp;the powers&nbsp;to order a convicted loanshark to compensate&nbsp;the victim&nbsp;for damage done to the unit.&nbsp; However, as we all know in this House, a more practical approach is&nbsp;the current one where the Town Council expeditiously rectifies the damage, so that the impact is minimised.&nbsp; That is&nbsp;a key point.&nbsp; As rampant harassment&nbsp;affects not just the harassed households', but the neighbourhoods' sense of well being as well, it is quite in order to tap Town Councils' funds for this purpose.&nbsp; After all it can be&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3066</p>your&nbsp;neighbour's unit being harassed today, it can be your own unit harassed tomorrow.&nbsp; So, it is a collective effort.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Arthur&nbsp;Fong, Mr Christopher de Souza and Dr Ong Seh Hong are concerned&nbsp;that the casinos will attract more loansharking activities.&nbsp; The recent amendments&nbsp;arm us&nbsp;with more powers to cripple the loansharks and impose tougher penalties on the perpetrators.&nbsp; Measures to ensure&nbsp;that licensed moneylenders do not venture into loansharking activities have been enhanced.&nbsp; In addition, under the Casino Control Act,&nbsp;a casino operator must take all appropriate steps to ensure that unlicensed moneylending or related activities are not conducted by his employees, patrons or any other persons inside the casino.&nbsp; Exclusion orders will prohibit those with serious criminal backgrounds, including loansharks, from entering the casinos.&nbsp; Hence, let me assure them and Mr Ang that Police is ready to meet this challenge.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in summary, tackling the loanshark scourge is really work in progress. The Ministry&nbsp;of Home Affairs&nbsp;will closely monitor the impact of the enhanced measures.&nbsp; And as I have said, if necessary, we will adopt additional measures to tighten the noose around the loansharks.&nbsp; Meanwhile, let us all work together to combat this scourge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I now turn&nbsp;to drug and inhalant abuse. The context is how our drug and inhalant abuse situation has evolved over the past decade. The start point should be the year 2000, that is, pre-Subutex days, not 2005, which is the height of the Subutex phenomenon.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I assure Mr Alvin Yeo and Ms Sylvia Lim that the drug abuse situation is well under control. In the year 2000, we arrested 3,157 drug abusers. Arrest figures dropped to a low of 793 abusers in 2005, but picked up thereafter, reaching 1,883 abusers last year which is <p align=left>Column: 3067</p>a 2% decrease from the 1,925 abusers arrested in 2008.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Members of this House will recall that there was a distortion in the drug situation between the years 2002 and 2006, caused by the availability of Subutex as a legal prescription drug for the treatment of opiate dependence. Many who used Subutex indiscriminately during that period were heroin abusers who had switched to Subutex as a legal alternative.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our classifying Subutex as a controlled drug in August 2006 resulted in an upswing in the number of drug abusers arrested, from the artificial low of 793 in 2005 to 2,211 in 2007. This is because CNB aggressively conducted enforcement action to arrest Subutex abusers, as well as Subutex users who had reverted to heroin arising from the tight supply of Subutex in the illicit drug market. So, indeed, there was displacement.&nbsp;But the&nbsp;point to note is that the total number of opioid abusers, ie, heroin and Subutex abusers taken together, has been decreasing since 2007.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, heroin has remained the most popular drug of abuse over the decade. However, proportionately, its abusers amongst all drug abusers actually decreased from over 90% in the early 1990s to 81% in the year 2000 to 57% last year. With 1,080 abusers arrested last year, the situation in fact is much improved compared to the 2,557 abusers arrested, pre-Subutex phenomenon, in the year 2000. So, notwithstanding the Subutex phenomenon, the situation has improved over the years.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now on the socio-economic profile of heroin abusers, 90% arrested in 2009 had Secondary qualifications or below. About&nbsp;four in 10 (43%) were employed at the point of arrest &ndash; the majority being cleaners, labourers or holding related lower-income jobs.&nbsp; Eighty percent&nbsp;of them had criminal antecedents.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3068</p> Sir, on the high percentage of repeat abusers, we will continue to galvanise the community, addicts&rsquo; families and employers to tackle this challenge. In fact, the numbers have decreased because of the improved relapse rate, down to 14% from 37% in the year 2000.&nbsp; Last year, 17% of arrestees had previously been on Long Term Imprisonment, or LT. Whilst rehabilitative opportunities are available to addicts willing to change, the fact is that there will always be a group of hardcore abusers who persist in their addiction. So, a key focus is to prevent people from getting on to the slippery slope in the first place. And to the credit of all of Home Team agencies which are engaged in preventive education, including NCADA, the number of new abusers arrested remains low, at 553 last year, or 29% of all abusers arrested.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on inhalant abuse, in 2000, we arrested 133 inhalant abusers, a far cry from the peak of 1,112 inhalant abusers arrested in 1987. The inhalant abuse problem had steadily improved after the Intoxicating Substances Act was implemented in 1987. However, the number of inhalant abusers arrested increased between 2005 and 2007, peaking at 644 in the year 2007.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CNB then acted decisively by stepping up preventive education and enforcement. As an average of seven out of 10 inhalant abusers arrested each year were youths, of whom about 50% were students, CNB worked with MOE and MCYS to resolutely tackle the problem. Sir, as with other youth problems, it is correct to address parents as they can play a role, both in prevention and detection of aberrant behaviour in their children.&nbsp;These efforts arrested the spike in numbers and stabilised the situation. So last year, 600 inhalant abusers were arrested, down from the peak of 644 in the year 2007.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as to whether the Malay community is disproportionately represented compared to the other racial <p align=left>Column: 3069</p>groups, in the year 2000, Malays formed half of all drug abusers and 26% of inhalant abusers. Last year, Malays formed less than half, at 44% for drug abuse and 37% for inhalant abuse. Now even though they are over-represented in these statistics, what is encouraging is that the number of Malay drug abusers arrested dropped from 1,575 in the year 2000 to 832 last year. In fact, this 47% decrease over the decade is the largest registered across all racial groups. The number of Malay inhalant abusers arrested has also declined by 14% from its peak of 258 in the year 2007 to 222 last year.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Yeo is concerned that the integrated resorts and bustling nightlife in Singapore could result in more abuse of psychotropic drugs. To prevent the drug culture from taking root, CNB conducts regular raids at nightspots. The National Council Against Drug Abuse&nbsp;(NCADA) also actively engages entertainment outlets to play their part in keeping their premises drug-free in their annual Clubs Against Drugs campaign. Overall, the psychotropic drug situation is under control.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>12.45 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A key challenge is to keep illicit drugs out of Singapore. This is because of the ready supply of drugs in the region and the proximity of methamphetamine production activities near our borders. But CNB will remain vigilant, aiming to disrupt or cripple drug trafficking syndicates and their runners who target our local market. As a society, we cannot go soft on drug abuse. I am confident that our long-term drug and inhalant abuse situation will remain under control, even though there could be fluctuations in abuse rates, if we all keep our resolve to keeping Singapore drug-free. I say this because just like crime rates, drug abuse rates cannot keep on declining all the time.&nbsp; There may be some fluctuations. But over the long term, I think we are on the right track.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 3070</p>Sir, on our crime situation &ndash;a point&nbsp;Mr Christopher de Souza makes &ndash;&nbsp;let me assure him that the general law and order situation is good. Indeed, Singapore has one of the lowest crime rates in the world. I assure him that the increase in number of foreigners in Singapore has not led to a rise in crimes. On the contrary, with strong enforcement by the Police, tapping technology and with proper training for its officers, and working with a vigilant public, the overall crime reported in Singapore has actually declined over the past five years. Overall, crime decreased from 37,093 cases in 2005 to 32,968 cases last year, despite our population is&nbsp;increasing. On a per 100,000 population basis, the overall crime rate fell from 870 in 2005 to 661 in 2009, a reduction of 24%. Indeed, the crime rate last year was the lowest in the past seven years.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on criminal records, Dr Maliki is correct that a key part of our crime reduction strategy is to help ex-offenders who genuinely want to change and gain a fresh start in life after they have paid their debt to society.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In October 2005, we implemented a second chance policy. Someone who has committed minor offences will have his criminal record marked as "spent" after a period of time, so that he can reply "no" when asked if he has a criminal record, even though the fact that he has been convicted remains. This is not the same as "expunging" the record, which is also what Dr Maliki talked about, which goes further to obliterate even the fact of the conviction,&nbsp;an approach we did not adopt.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to strike a balance between the interests of ex-offenders, employers and society at large, only records of less serious crimes where the offender receives a light punishment qualify to be rendered spent. This is why, to maintain this balance,&nbsp;for sensitive vocations like <p align=left>Column: 3071</p>security officers and airport employees, applicants are screened for past criminal records. But let me assure Dr Maliki that even for security officers, Police takes a calibrated approach, taking into account the nature of the offence and how long ago it was committed. So in line with the Yellow Ribbon movement, we have in fact allowed ex-offenders to work in the security industry.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 2005, more than 142,000 persons' criminal records have been rendered spent. As to how many of these persons have subsequently re-offended, based on Police records on reoffending in Singapore, the re-offending rate is less than 2%.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Dr Maliki asks if there is any intention to expand the "spent" regime. As it has been five years since its implementation, just like the Home Detention scheme which we expanded after operating it for several years,&nbsp;the Ministry of Home Affairs&nbsp;will monitor the scheme to see if there is a need to widen the criteria.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me conclude on these cuts. The issues of loansharking, drug abuse, and crime are matters which concern all Singaporeans. The Home Team will press on resolutely to tackle these problems, explore new and pragmatic measures and approaches to sharpen its arsenal. Ultimately, however, what the Home Team can achieve depends not only on the professionalism and dedication of its officers but on the support they enjoy from a public who shares their commitment to keep Singapore safe and secure.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M):</B> <p>Sir, I will now touch on recidivism, road safety and safe cycling and the Community Engagement Programme.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3072</p> Dr Maliki asked about the recidivism rate in Singapore, defined as the percentage of local inmates who are imprisoned again for a new offence within two years of their release.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore's recidivism rate has declined over the years from about 44.4% for the cohort released in 1998 to an all time low of about 23.7% for the cohort released in 2004. Although the recidivism rate has since increased slightly to about 26.5% for the cohort released in 2007, this is still low by international standards.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The general decline in recidivism over the last decade is the result of concerted efforts by Prisons, the</p><p>Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises (SCORE) and community partners.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the institutions, Prisons has a classification framework which assesses offenders' risk of re-offending and rehabilitation needs. Specialised Treatment Programmes also address specific risk factors such as substance abuse, criminal thinking and sexual offending behaviour.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In parallel, SCORE has various activities to enhance inmates' employability. This, as Dr Maliki has</p><p>emphasised, is an important protective factor for ex-offenders. SCORE conducts training in workplace literacy and numeracy skills and offers certified courses in retail, electronics and IT skills. Potential employers are also invited into Prisons to help offenders secure jobs even before their release.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2009, SCORE offered employment assistance to a total of 1,344 inmates and ex-offenders. Of this number, employment was secured for almost 85%. If an ex-offender is sincere and does not have unrealistic expectations, SCORE will be able to find him a job. It may not be the <p align=left>Column: 3073</p>best paying job but it will be a fair wage based on his skills and competencies. More importantly, he will have a stable income until a better job offer comes along.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final and arguably most critical part of the equation is ensuring that offenders can successfully re-</p><p>integrate into the community after their release. Prisons partnered with the Singapore After-care Association (SACA) and the Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association (SANA) in 2001 to provide offenders with aftercare assistance to adjust to life outside prison.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order for re-integration to succeed, the community must be willing to support and accept ex-offenders who want to change for the better. The Yellow Ribbon Project, which started in 2004, has achieved progress on this front. Many volunteers have since stepped forward to help by providing religious counselling for inmates, assisting their families and employing ex-offenders.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What more can be done. It took us almost a decade to build up our structured rehabilitation and reintegration regime, and to achieve our low recidivism rates, we have to garner the support of dedicated volunteers and partners. We note Mr Alvin Yeo's concern on the rising trend of recidivism, and will continue to monitor this and endeavour to keep it down. However it is not realistic to expect our recidivism rates to continue to fall indefinitely and there will be fluctuations from time to time.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding the relatively low recividism rate, we continue to explore how our programmes can be improved and whether they can be refined to better reach specific target groups such as youths. Likewise, while the recidivism rate for Malay and Indian offenders has <p align=left>Column: 3074</p>decreased over the years, it is still higher than the general recidivism rate. This is something we have recently been studying together with various relevant agencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now on cycling, Mr Michael Palmer asked about educating cyclists on cycling regulations and safe cycling behaviour. The Traffic Police (TP) has already been doing this through road safety talks and exhibitions in schools, workplaces and neighbourhoods. The talks cover a pre-riding checklist, safe cycling tips and case studies of accidents involving cyclists.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through these platforms, cyclists are reminded about safe cycling behaviour as well as the need to abide by all road traffic rules, including the Road Traffic (Bicycles) Rules. These rules include hand signals showing the intention to stop, riding close to the left hand edge of the road, riding in an orderly manner, and carrying a lamp with white light at the front of the bicycle during hours of darkness.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Palmer asked why cyclists are not required by law to wear helmets. The practice of mandating the use of bicycle helmets varies from country to country. The experience of other countries has been that education and community-based programmes, as opposed to legislation, have been more effective in promoting the use of helmets.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TP&nbsp;will continue to work with organisations such as the Singapore Amateur Cycling Association and the Safe Cycling Task Force, to promote the wearing of protective cycling gear. TP will monitor the situation and assess if there is a need to mandate the use of helmets in future.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to public education efforts, TP also takes enforcement action against errant cyclists who flout the rules by cycling on footways of roads. In 2009, <p align=left>Column: 3075</p>more than 600 summonses were issued to such cyclists compared to 115 issued in 2008. The current penalties are usually a composition fine of $20. We are reviewing whether to increase the composition amount for greater deterrence.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, most Town Councils have by-laws prohibiting cycling on HDB common property such as pavements, and open spaces such as void decks. Action can be taken against cyclists who disregard these laws.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2009, there were 583 accidents involving cyclists resulting in fatalities or injuries compared to 604 for 2008. This is a decrease of 21 cases, or 3.5%. The number of fatalities involving cyclists who died in accidents also went down by 22.7% from 22 to 17.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding this modest improvement, cyclists have been identified as a key target group in TP's</p><p>educational efforts in 2010. We will continue to work with&nbsp;the Ministry of Transport&nbsp;and&nbsp;the Land Transport Authority&nbsp;to raise safety awareness through public education programmes, and create a safer environment for cyclists by providing adequate infrastructure and facilities.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me touch on Mr Viswa's speech and cut on Community Engagement Programme (CEP). Mr Viswa suggested that the CEP engage youth leaders, both within the school system and outside, as well as PRs and new citizens.&nbsp; These are indeed important constituencies that we have reached out to under the CEP.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have adopted a multi-pronged youth engagement approach to engage not just youth leaders but youths in different sectors. &nbsp;Within the school system, we work with the Ministry of Education to engage principals and teachers in workshops where they are equipped with CEP-related skills such as <p align=left>Column: 3076</p>mediation, which may come in useful in a school environment.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before this, we have been building awareness of CEP through talks and interactive projects at youth camps. The recent SG United Jamboree held in January 2010 provided students with an opportunity to interact with peers of other races and increase their understanding of terrorism, emergency preparedness and safety and security issues. Most of the helpers and participants in the Jamboree had also previously participated in Home Team-related camps which included a CEP dimension.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another approach is to tap on existing youth-based structures and their activities. For example, students from the National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (NCDCC) are engaged through the CEP Badge, which they can earn by performing CEP-related activities.

After a certain point, and that can be multiplied&nbsp;over the generations, it becomes entirely artificial.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I am&nbsp;asking the Minister to open his mind to just consider the possibility that there might be, may be not many, a&nbsp;few Singaporeans who are stuck, and they might want to choose another category for their own race which may not be the dominant ones&nbsp;&ndash; a new category&nbsp;called "Singaporean".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This&nbsp;is not as far-fetched as it sounds. For instance, the <I>Babas</I> and&nbsp;Peranakans, originally from China, settled in the Straits for a long time.&nbsp; But they imbibed the Malay culture, there were inter-marriages, they assimilated into the western culture, spoke English, formed their own culture and, <p align=left>Column: 3078</p>today, it is a very distinct racial group from the Chinese. Similary, the Eurasians.&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you look at other national groups, for instance, the Filipinos, they are also of a mixed tribe.&nbsp; But when we look at them in the identity card, we call them Filipinos.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sir, I just raising the idea and, of course, I did not expect the Minister to agree today.&nbsp; But I just wanted to raise the idea that there is a possibility that there are some people who want to opt for the category of "Singaporean".&nbsp; We should not deprive them of this option if that is what they should wish for.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other point I was making is that we should, as far as policy is concerned, try to emphasise a national consciousness rather than a racial consciousness in terms of our approach to solving national problems. Again, this is not a call to ignore the influence of culture on behaviour or to ignore the strength of the influence of culture on performance.&nbsp; Rather, it is a call for a national approach so that we solve problems based on individual's situation, or&nbsp;maybe even class&nbsp;&ndash; because it is a whole class of people who are poor, under-performing, suffering from low esteem&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;and&nbsp;based on those traits not the colour of the skin or what you see in their identity cards.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I take courage that although it seems unrealistic to the Minister &ndash;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Ms Ng, could you make your question brief?</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</B> Sir, one last point.&nbsp; I take courage that, at least, I am not entirely alone because the founding leader, Mr Rajaratnam, also espoused this very strongly.&nbsp; I am not here to hold a brief but it is something I hold strongly as well.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman</B>: Could I remind Members that clarifications are what they are, and&nbsp;not to make speeches that you cannot make during your cuts.&nbsp; This will <p align=left>Column: 3079</p>allow us&nbsp;to take as many clarifications as possible.

We have to emphasise the Singaporean identity. That is the ideal. This is a society built on those ideals.&nbsp; As for problem-solving, as for dealing with, say, a class of poor, we solved it and tackled those problems in a number of ways.&nbsp; From the governmental perspective, we treat them as people who need help and we give a variety of assistance which is completely blind to race, religion or language.&nbsp; It is need-based.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, at the same time, we are practical enough to realise that voluntary help often comes, for example, if you look at the self-help groups, which are based along ethnic lines.&nbsp; Some people disagree with them, but they have a tremendous success.&nbsp; And that is the reality.&nbsp; People come out and volunteer more often. There are others whom they are helping with whom they can identify and race is a fairly strong identification factor.&nbsp; But if you look at the ethnic groups, they do have a substantial percentage of volunteers who are not of the same ethnic group.&nbsp; For example, SINDA has about 10%-11% who are non-Indians. And that is a trend that we want encourage. But at the same time, we must be practical <p align=left>Column: 3080</p>enough to realise that you can bring in people if you can give them a sense of identity.&nbsp; So it is a multi-pronged approach.&nbsp; But I think underlying it, the Government and Ms Ng are <I>ad idem</I>.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member):</B> Sir, I have two clarifications for the Senior Minister of State regarding drug abuse.&nbsp; The first is: in his response earlier, he mentioned that of the heroine abuses arrested, about 17% were previously released from long-term imprisonment.&nbsp; I wonder whether he can also tell us if we use those offenders who had been released from long-term imprisonment&nbsp;(LT)&nbsp;as a denominator.&nbsp; How many of those who had been released from long-term imprisonment actually have gone back to drugs?&nbsp; Does he have that data for us, ie, the percentage re-offending after coming out of&nbsp;LT?<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A second clarification is regarding the socio-economic profile of the heroine arrests: he mentioned that four in 10 were employed, meaning that six in 10 were unemployed.&nbsp; He also mentioned that 80% had criminal antecedents.&nbsp; I would like to ask him whether this actually indicates a real problem with re-integrating people who have previously been involved in crime or drugs back into society. Where&nbsp;is&nbsp;the source of that problem lies?&nbsp; Is it to do with the offender's physical condition, perhaps?&nbsp; Is it to do with employers or a&nbsp;lack of skills?&nbsp; Is the Ministry satisfied with this situation or is it the aim of the Ministry to try to improve the socio-economic re-integration of people involved in crime and drugs?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</B> Sir, I take the second point first.&nbsp; I think the point is taken in terms of the socio-economic profile of those who take heroine that many are unemployed. Even those who are employed, they are on low-paying jobs.&nbsp; And some, in fact, do not have family support. These are people who are <p align=left>Column: 3081</p>hard-pressed. Perhaps that is the reason why some of them take drugs.&nbsp; In devising programmes for these people, yes, the target group and how the programmes can relate to them, that is taken into account.&nbsp; For example, community groups out there are roped in,&nbsp;because community groups, like Mr Shanmugam has said, understand the ground situation better.&nbsp; For example, for the Malay drug addicts, both MENDAKI and AMP and even groups like&nbsp;4PM, Ain Society, and working with halfway houses like Pertapis and Jamiyah&nbsp;&ndash; all these are roped in.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in terms of the messaging, I think Ms Lim will know that over the years,&nbsp;the messages sent to prevent people from taking drugs or prevent people who have gotten onto the drug slope to get out&nbsp;are very direct.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also because some leeway is given to the National Council Against Drug Abuse to produce messages that have impact, not overly sophisticated which will hit even people with low education background and who may not as&nbsp;sophisticated.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Ms Lim on this point that we do take into account the target group when we devise programmes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The other point Ms Lim talked about is repeat abusers.&nbsp; Yes, this is something that we are grappling with. I have mentioned that, perhaps, because arising from our very successful preventive drug education programme, the percentage of new abusers is very low.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is quite right because it is a&nbsp;slippery slope and once you get on to the slope, it is not easy to get off. Some succeed but others may not. And we know that heroine, from research, is&nbsp;a very addictive drug.&nbsp; So this is one area which the Ministry has been working&nbsp;on&nbsp;together with all the other agencies. That is also why after the Committee came up with its report about 15 years ago, that was in 1994 or 1995, shortly after that, we implemented the LT <p align=left>Column: 3082</p>scheme.&nbsp; The LT scheme not only is a deterrent for those who have gone in from re-offending, it is also a scheme where&nbsp;those who have been taking drugs and who possibly may influence others to take drugs, they are taken out of the system for a few years.&nbsp;In that sense, they will not contaminate the ground.&nbsp; So, first timer&nbsp; sent to DRC; second timer sent to&nbsp;DRC and then we have got LT1 where you are in for&nbsp;three-and-a-half years after remission and after that, LT2.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;a system that we have employed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I have said in my speech, about 13% of those who were arrested last year had been through LT1.&nbsp; In terms of the numbers for last year, the total arrested was 1,883 and those who went onto LT2, because they had been through LT1,&nbsp;was&nbsp;315 (17%). &nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Yes, Ms Ng.

Well, we have to look <p align=left>Column: 3085</p>at the number of people who were arrested for drug addiction, and the number has gone down drastically.&nbsp; Despite all the efforts that we have, including the intelligence, surveillance, arrests, etc, there will still be people who want to take drugs, and they have to watch out that they&nbsp;do not get caught.&nbsp; If they do, they will have to pay a price.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman:</B> Any more clarifications?

We were not sure how long the crisis was going to last, whether it was going to be a U-shaped or a V-shaped recovery, or some even said a W-shaped recovery.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the security perspective, the Minister for Defence informed this House last year that there were three implications of the crisis that MINDEF was concerned with.&nbsp; These were, firstly, the accelerated geopolitical shifts; secondly, the social stresses which arise during a recession that may lead to increased instability; and, lastly, the threat of terrorism that overlays the first two concerns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this year's Committee of Supply debate, the situation is quite different.&nbsp; Yes, the threat of terrorism remains, but the economic climate throughout the world is very different.&nbsp; Countries are starting to recover.&nbsp; Certainly, in Asia, there is a sense of optimism.&nbsp; We have also seen a distinct shift in the countries that are leading the recovery.&nbsp; Economic power is no longer solely within the domain of the West.&nbsp; The US and Europe acknowledged that Asia, in particular, <p align=left>Column: 3087</p>countries like China, India, South Korea and even ASEAN as a region, will play a pivotal role in the recovery process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; China appears to be playing a greater role in terms of the regional security environment.&nbsp; In Tuesday's edition of the <I>Straits Times</I>, I read an article entitled "China should aim to be World No. 1".&nbsp; It was a report about a book entitled, <I>The China Dream,</I> which was written by one of the People's Liberation Army's senior officers.&nbsp; The book contains a call for China to abandon its modesty about its global goals and sprint to become World No. 1.&nbsp; What struck me about this book was not the bold words used but the fact that it was a declaration that China had in fact goals to be World No. 1.&nbsp; This was followed by yesterday's announcement of a reduction in the increase of its defence budget from the usual double digit increase to a 7.5% increase from last year.&nbsp; But this is an increase to a budget that is in excess of $100 billion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also found it interesting it that in the recent disaster relief efforts in Haiti, the news reported that the Chinese humanitarian relief was deployed long before the US humanitarian efforts and, in fact, was already hard at work while Washington was still offering to send relief.&nbsp; India has, on the other hand, remained rather quiet while South Korea has been preoccupied with its neighbours to the north.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We got another wake up call to the threat of terrorism just yesterday when our own Navy together with those of Malaysia and Indonesia announced that they would be stepping up patrols in the Straits of Malacca after receiving warnings of possible terror threats against oil tankers plying the Straits.&nbsp;

Will the change in the balance of economic power, given Asia's rising economic power, affect the regional security environment?&nbsp; Specifically, how does MINDEF see China's role as a regional security power in general and, specifically, <I>vis-a-vis</I> the US?&nbsp; Will China be expected to take and will it take a larger role in the regional security envionment?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the recent arms sales issue between the US and Taiwan, China strenuously opposed the US' arms sale to Taiwan.&nbsp; Is this a sign that China is likely to play a more dominant role in the region?&nbsp; Interestingly, China's Parliamentary spokesman said at the unveiling of the defence budget that this was like when two brothers are embracing, someone gives one of them a dagger,&nbsp;what is the motive in that?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What will MINDEF's position be <I>vis-a-vis</I> the US and China as regional security powers?&nbsp; Does MINDEF see India or South Korea playing a part in the regional security environment and, if so, what role would that be?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This is particularly so since the September 11 attacks in the United States.&nbsp; The radicalisation of certain segments of the Muslim faith coupled with the separatist movements within the region have made Southeast Asia a hot bed for terrorism.&nbsp; From the Philippines to Indonesia and Southern Thailand, security forces have been placed on high alert against possible terrorist bombings&nbsp;or insurgent attacks.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quite apart from these security threats, our region has also been affected <p align=left>Column: 3089</p>by piracy, particularly along the Malacca Straits.&nbsp; While I agree that the action taken by the littoral states have helped to reduce the incidence of piracy in recent years, it nonetheless is still a threat to shipping in the region if we are not careful.&nbsp; Against the broad canvas of security situation that the region is faced with, there is a constant need for ASEAN states to work and cooperate closely to deal with these threats, to an extent that there should be an over-arching framework within which robust, efficient, effective cooperation is managed, whether in the form of information sharing or support in the deployment of security forces.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would therefore like to ask the Minister to give this House, firstly, an update of his assessment of the security environment in the region; secondly, the state of the security architecture in the region and its effectiveness; and, finally, Singapore's present and future contribution to the challenge.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</B> Mr Chairman, Mr Michael Palmer had remarked that much had changed since the last COS but one thing has not changed, which is that the world and, in particular, this region has not become any less dangerous.&nbsp; Like Mr Palmer, I noted&nbsp;with some concern the Navy advisory to be on the alert for possible maritime terrorist attacks.&nbsp; And what we have in this region is Singapore, a small dot in the middle of it, surrounded by other states where they are affected by their own geopolitical developments.&nbsp; We note, for example, that Thailand's relationship with Cambodia is the subject matter of some concern.&nbsp; And then we have India and China on the rise.&nbsp; We have Korea, we have Japan and, of course, our Southeast Asian neighbours.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The recent nuclear and missile tests in North Korea, continuing terrorist attacks and growing political tensions in our neighbouring countries have posed new challenges to our regional security.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to nuclear weapons threats, Singapore is the first to sign the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) which aims to halt the trafficking and spread of nuclear weapons.&nbsp; But there is still much to be done to seek the co-operation of other countries to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction.&nbsp; Regional security forums, such as ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), the Six-party talks, and the Annual Shangri-La dialogues have also provided useful platforms for countries to stay engaged to further enhance security.&nbsp; Despite that, the security architecture in our region remains challenging as many of these forums have been criticised to be mere talk shop forums.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as a concerned member of security risks, Singapore has undertaken a number of initiatives to engage the global community.&nbsp; We have been actively engaging many countries in both diplomatic relations, and defence co-operation.&nbsp; We have also signed defence co-operation agreements with Australia,<p align=left>Column: 3091</p> New Zealand, India, China and Vietnam.&nbsp; Such arrangements provide many opportunities for our defence forces to interact and strengthen our relations with countries in the region thus enhancing security.&nbsp; I wish to ask the Minister what more can Singapore do to further enhance our security.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Singaporeans may be happy with the latest development but we know that the capture of Mas Selamat would not put to rest the ever-present threat to security that Singapore is faced with.&nbsp; Indeed Singapore is known to be a prized and high-profile target not just for terrorists from the region, but I believe, Sir, also terrorists from outside it as well.&nbsp; It is often said that the odds are not with us.&nbsp; We have to get it right all the time whereas the terrorist has to get it right only once.&nbsp; Indeed, our assessment of the security threat has led us to deploy forces as far away as the Middle East.&nbsp; We know that Members of the Jemaah Islamiah (JI),&nbsp;a known terrorist group, received training in Afghanistan.&nbsp; I believe that&nbsp;ensuring the peace and stability of Iraq and Afghanistan will help to remove these places from the list of places that potential terrorists such as JI can turn to for help.&nbsp; So far, our contribution has been confined&nbsp;to building&nbsp;and medical <p align=left>Column: 3093</p>assistance.&nbsp; The contribution may be small in comparison to others, it is nonetheless&nbsp;significant for a small country like Singapore.&nbsp; On the homefront, I am grateful to note that the SAF has also stepped up its efforts to protect our vital installations and they were quick to respond to the new intelligence that our vital&nbsp;shipping interests&nbsp;are now under threat of attack, as we have heard and found out in today's papers.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The aim was to become a leaner and more potent fighting force that will use technology as leverage to deal with threats.&nbsp; As part of this transformation,&nbsp; the SAF invested in a range of hardware; the RSS Archer submarines, the G550 AEW aircraft, leapa rd tanks, formidable class stealth frigates, F15, SG fighters, to name a few.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our 3G SAF, the power of this technology lies not only in the fact that we have it, it lies in the network capabilities of these machines thereby giving the force most speed, precision and mobility.&nbsp;

I believe that the SAF must prepare its people with the appropriate mental attitude and skill-sets needed to ensure that the platforms and systems available are used with the maximum of efficiency&nbsp;and effectiveness.&nbsp; They need to be multi-skilled, flexible and be able to adapt to a wide range of constantly changing demands&nbsp;on the ground.&nbsp; The people that make up our SAF must have a "never say die" spirit.&nbsp;

These changes centre around introducing periods and types of training for recruits,&nbsp;who fall in different physical employment status&nbsp;(PES). For PES A and B recruits, they will continue to undergo the nine-week BMT. Those PES&nbsp;A and B recruits who are not up to the mark in terms of their physical fitness will have to undergo an eight-week physical training phase (PTP), in addition to the nine-week&nbsp;BMT. Other key changes&nbsp;include a 19-week BMT for PES B recruits, or&nbsp;four-week BMT for PES E recruits, a nine-week BMT for PES C recruits, and nine-week BMT for PES B2 recruits. May I ask the Minister to please explain the rationale for these changes, what is the broader training philosophy behind BMT, and are these changes part of that philosophy? I believe that the PES A and B recruits who have scored a silver or above their national physical fitness awards (NAPFA) test are exempted from the eight-week PTP. What percentage of enlistees in each intake actually qualify for this exemption? I also understand that statistics show that the students from the polytechnics have the lowest number qualifying for the eight-week exemption from the PTP.

It is estimated that about 10% of the recruits will fall into this category. Also, the other <p align=left>Column: 3102</p>group that will be affected will be those with medical conditions which is estimated to be about 6%. For the latter group, the training will now be increased to nine weeks.

Over the years, new methods and equipment for fitness training as well as a better understanding of exercise physiology have evolved.&nbsp;Although it has been useful over the past two to three decades, I believe it is due for a&nbsp;review to examine its relevance to our 3G SAF servicemen.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) What are the objectives of the various exercise stations in IPPT and how effective and relevant are they in measuring the overall fitness of our servicemen; and&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) With the 3G SAF, what physical attributes in servicemen are deemed important and how can these attributes be assessed appropriately?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Operationally ready National Service liability and tertiary education</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast):</B> Mr Chairman, with Singapore's diverse education landscape and choice for tertiary and degree education, more students are studying full-time in institutions like SIM, uniSIM, MDIS, Kaplan, PSB Academy, LaSalle, SOTA and <p align=left>Column: 3103</p>many other private institutions. For these students who have Operationally Ready National Service (ORNS) liability, to be called up for In-Camp Training (ICT) during the regular school term&nbsp;would imply that these students will have to be away from their studies for two to three weeks of ICT. This does have&nbsp;an impact on their course of study during the period that they are away. I have seen several cases during my Meet-the-People Sessions when they come to request for my assistance to appeal after the initial requests for deferment are not successful. And in a couple of these cases, the students are quite anxious, as they were in preparation for examinations. As I understand currently, students in the three mainstream universities &ndash; NUS, NTU and SMU &ndash;&nbsp;are not called up during school term for ORNS liability. In line with the spirit of the Budget 2010, which calls for a culture of learning, innovation, increase productivity and inclusive growth for Singapore, can MINDEF review the relevance of the current deferrment policy of ICT for ORNS liability for full-time tertiary students during their school term? While we need to ensure that operational readiness of the SAF is not adversely affected and this will require more coordination and planning with the institutions, I do hope that MINDEF will give this consideration, examining how this can be done to align to the greater choices of university and tertiary education that are available for our students in Singapore.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Viswa Sadasivan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Full-time National Servicemen enlistment and NS call-up policies</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Viswa Sadasivan:</B> Recognising the impact of National Service, MINDEF has been fine-tuning the policies and practices governing enlistment and NS call-ups to cater as much as possible to the diverse interests of those affected.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, I have two specific suggestions.&nbsp; &nbsp;First, enlistment for full-time National Servicemen. I would suggest that <p align=left>Column: 3104</p>MINDEF gives greater thought&nbsp;to how we can make it less inconvenient and stressful for those residing abroad. Firstly, we should be pleased that they are committed enough to do National Service.&nbsp;It is important that this goodwill and appreciation is conveyed during the various interactions which start when the enlistee turns 17. This is also the time when the enlistee and his parents are pre-occupied with university admission &ndash; which can be stressful as most overseas universities may not be sympathetic to&nbsp;National Service&nbsp;commitment and the need to defer studies for&nbsp;two years.&nbsp;The enlistment paperwork can be quite intense, often requiring them to make trips to Singapore, which&nbsp;can be&nbsp;costly.&nbsp;Finally, exactly when he is enlisted is a matter of significance.&nbsp;Typically, the university term overseas starts in September. If the enlistee is assigned to an intake after September, say, in February, he would miss the university enrolment date two years down the line.&nbsp; This means he loses an additional year, on top of the two-year National Service.&nbsp;Besides, some universities may not keep the vacancy for an additional year. Yes, we need to treat all enlistees fairly.&nbsp;But the opportunity cost&nbsp;for overseas enlistees, I believe, is higher.&nbsp;Would MINDEF consider giving greater assurance to affected enlistees that they can defer a few months before&nbsp;so that they would not have to miss university enrolment?&nbsp;This would provide much needed comfort and peace of mind &ndash; resulting in the enlistee doing&nbsp;National Service&nbsp;in a positive frame of mind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, call-ups for NSmen. There are instances where NSmen are called up for in-camp training twice in a calendar year, which can be very disruptive for the NSmen and their employers.&nbsp;This happens because MINDEF works on a fiscal year basis which means that if you are called up in January and then again after March &ndash; it registers as two separate years.&nbsp;But <p align=left>Column: 3105</p>for the NSman and his employer, work commitments and leave are based on the calendar year.&nbsp;This anomaly needs to be rationalised as they can erode goodwill and commitment in good NSmen and employers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to end by acknowledging that it is not easy to cater to the interests of such a large and diverse group.&nbsp;But when we see a policy or practice inadvertently affecting a significant number of enlistees which could erode commitment, we need to go the extra mile.&nbsp;The system should send a strong signal to those who evade, and an equally strong signal to those who step forward to serve.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman:</B> Mr Chiam is not around.

Many appreciate the peace and harmony we enjoy in today's politically stable environment. Unfortunately, many youths <p align=left>Column: 3107</p>have not seen political instability and bloodshed, and thus cannot understand their roles in defending Singapore. Although National Service has been introduced for more than 30 years,&nbsp;many young Singaporeans may not know how to&nbsp;take defence very seriously. Sir, this is indeed a very worrying trend and calls for more engagement of the youths to increase the operational readiness of Singapore in Total Defence.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the concept of Total Defence is that all Singaporeans should play a role in defending Singapore. There are&nbsp;five key pillars in Total Defence namely: Military defence, Civil defence, Economic defence, Social defence and Psychological defence. We need a framework to measure our achievements in Total Defence. How do we measure the Total Defence operational readiness of our people?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, another challenge in Total Defence is the inculcation of values among our youths to take the defence of our country seriously.

The youths of our future and&nbsp;their attitudes will shape their actions and have serious implications on the future of Singapore.&nbsp; Today, I think, the issues of defence will only appear on the radar screen of our youths when boys near the age of NS enlistment.&nbsp; Even then, I guess the discussion will revolve around how to cope with the physical demands of basic military training.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there is more that MINDEF can do to engage youths to take a greater stake in our country's defence.&nbsp; Our youths are exposed and interact with many youths from other countries, either through exchange programmes or simply through interaction with foreign students studying here.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year, we will play host to the inaugural Youth Olympics.&nbsp; We should engage our youths to ensure that they do not take our defence and security for granted and, perhaps, provide a better perspective on Singapore's world view as <p align=left>Column: 3110</p>they interact with their foreign counterparts.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can the Minister provide an update on MINDEF's programme in engaging young Singaporeans constructively in defence and security issues, and what more can be done to increase the level of interest amongst young Singaporeans on the role they can play in our defence?<br></p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence (Mr Teo Chee Hean)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence (Mr Teo Chee Hean):</B> <p>Mr Chairman, Sir, I would like to thank the hon. Members for their comments and questions, and also for their continued commitment to Singapore's defence and security.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Michael Palmer, Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mr Sin Boon Ann asked for our assessment of the regional security environment.&nbsp; The strategic realignments that began before the economic crisis have continued apace. Asian economies have weathered the crisis relatively well, especially so for India and China. While the US will continue to be pre-eminent over the next few decades, in economic, military and technological terms, the balance of global economic weight has shifted eastwards.&nbsp; The strategic weight of Asian powers, particularly China and India, will grow.&nbsp; These two countries will become more confident and will want to play a greater role in global and regional affairs. As their economic ties with our region strengthen, they would also have a greater stake in regional peace and stability.&nbsp; Indeed, both these countries are actively engaging countries in the Asia-Pacific, both bilaterally and multilaterally. These are positive developments. Within our region, countries such as Vietnam, along with Indonesia, will play a larger role in the years to come as they continue with their restructuring and modernisation.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the coming decades, therefore, the Asia-Pacific will inevitably become the <p align=left>Column: 3111</p>strategic area of focus for the major powers. South-east Asia, with its strategic sea-lanes, resources and markets, sits at the centre of the region and is the arena where their interests intersect.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key question, of course, is how the US-China relationship will develop in the coming years. While there have been strains in the US-China relationship in recent weeks, both countries clearly see it in their interest to have stable and cooperative relations in the long term.&nbsp; In the joint statement released during President Obama's visit to China last November, both sides recognised they have, I quote, "an increasingly broad base of cooperation and share increasingly important common responsibilities". On our part, we do hope that the US and China will maintain a positive and cooperative relationship as this is critical to maintaining regional stability, which provides the foundation for economic development and prosperity.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo Ho Pin asked about our response to the increased strategic competition amongst the major powers.&nbsp; An open regional security architecture plays an important role in sustaining long-term regional peace and stability by encouraging countries to engage constructively.&nbsp; As new patterns of strategic relations are formed, the regional security architecture must continue to develop apace. This will facilitate the peaceful rise of emerging powers, promote responsible norms of international behaviour and manage potential flashpoints.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Indranee Rajah and Mr Sin Boon Ann asked about MINDEF's role in strengthening the regional security architecture.&nbsp; Sir, in the past year, the ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting (ADMM) is one area where ASEAN countries have focused our efforts. The ADMM has moved in the direction of practical cooperation. For instance, we reached agreement on cooperation in <p align=left>Column: 3112</p>humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, an important non-traditional security issue.&nbsp; The ADMM has also made significant headway in evolving the ADMM-Plus, which facilitates ASEAN's defence engagement with our partners in the larger Asia-Pacific region at the ministerial level. Vietnam, which is the chair of ASEAN in 2010, will take the ADMM-Plus process forward later this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Shangri-La Dialogue (SLD) that is held in Singapore annually, and attended by 27 countries in 2009, has also grown from strength to strength. The ninth SLD will be held in June this year.&nbsp; The SLD remains the only defence forum in Asia that brings together Ministers, senior officials, industry leaders and academics for a frank exchange of views on defence and security issues, which will help to create mutual understanding and shared norms.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our multilateral engagements are supported by an extensive web of bilateral defence relations, which Ms Indranee Rajah asked about.&nbsp; Our defence ties with Malaysia and Indonesia are important and longstanding. The SAF and Malaysian Armed Forces engage in regular interactions, including bilateral exercises, high-level visits and professional exchanges. Both armed forces also collaborate closely in the Malacca Strait Patrols and the Five Power Defence Arrangements. At Malaysia's invitation, two F-16 fighters and two Apache helicopters from the RSAF participated in the flying display at the Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace exhibition last year.&nbsp; Senior Malaysian defence officials also attended the Singapore Airshow this year.&nbsp; When Defence Minister Zahid Hamidi and I met on the sidelines of the Singapore Airshow, we both agreed to expand our bilateral defence exchanges and interactions.&nbsp;&nbsp; As an example, I met General Rodzali, the RMAF Chief who is here on a visit this <p align=left>Column: 3113</p>morning.&nbsp; He and our Chief of Air Force are discussing initiatives to increase exchanges and interactions between our two air forces.&nbsp; All these interactions have further enhanced our friendly bilateral defence ties with Malaysia.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are regular and wide-ranging interactions between the SAF and the Indonesian National Defence Forces.&nbsp; These include longstanding exercises between our two armies, air forces and navies, as well as bilateral meetings, the cross-attendance of courses and other professional exchanges.&nbsp; The two armed forces also cooperate closely in maritime patrols and maritime information sharing.&nbsp; As this House is aware, after the South Sumatra earthquake last September, the SAF sent medical and engineering teams to assist in the relief efforts. We are also working with the Indonesian defence establishment to explore opportunities to expand cooperation for mutual benefit.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Brunei and Thailand, and increasingly with Vietnam, we also enjoy especially close defence relations.&nbsp; Besides our neighbours, we have similarly built up our defence ties with key players in the Asia-Pacific.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The US remains one of our strongest and closest defence partners. We continue to welcome a strong US presence in our region, which provides an important stabilising influence.&nbsp; US forces visit Changi Naval Base and Paya Lebar Air Base regularly, and we conduct high-end professional exercises with them.&nbsp; Since the conclusion of the Strategic Framework Agreement in 2005, professional exchanges between the US and Singapore armed forces have expanded.&nbsp; Last year, we inaugurated Peace Carvin V, our F-15SG detachment in Mountain Home, Idaho. The detachment joins our existing F-16, Chinook and Apache training detachments in the US. Our naval <p align=left>Column: 3114</p>helicopters are currently undergoing integration training in San Diego together with one of our frigates.&nbsp; One indication of the many exchanges we have is this morning, again, I received a call from the Commander of the US Pacific fleet who is here on a visit.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also strengthened our defence relationship with China, holding the first bilateral training exercise between Singapore and China last June. This was a joint training exercise focused on the conduct of security operations for major events, in which the Chinese forces have a lot of experience in after the Beijing Olympics. The training exercise provided a platform for developing mutual understanding between both armed forces.&nbsp; With India, our relations continue to develop very productively with all the three Services conducting exercises together with their counterparts in India.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore has also deepened our defence relations with other key regional partners. We signed bilateral defence cooperation agreements with Japan, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand and Vietnam last year.&nbsp; These agreements reflect the commitment of the parties to further cooperate in bilateral areas of mutual interest.&nbsp; With Australia, we renewed the Shoalwater Bay Training Area Memorandum of Agreement, which allows the SAF to train at Shoalwater Bay for another 10 years.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singapore is very grateful to our friends for their support for the SAF's overseas training, an issue which Mr Michael Palmer asked about.&nbsp; Today, the SAF trains in about a dozen countries around the world, which has enabled us to overcome our land and airspace constraints and to address the SAF's training needs.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mr Sin Boon Ann asked about the security challenges confronting us. Indeed these challenges <p align=left>Column: 3115</p>are varied, complex and fluid.&nbsp; Allow me to elaborate on two challenges &ndash; maritime security and terrorism.</p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By endangering the freedom of navigation and the safety of international shipping, threats to maritime security such as piracy and maritime terrorism can impact the global economy and international security. As a maritime nation, such threats are of utmost concern to Singapore.&nbsp; Many&nbsp;Members&nbsp;have read in the newspapers today that our Navy had received information on possible terror threats against vessels in the Malacca Strait.&nbsp; The Navy has stepped up the frequency of patrols in our waters.&nbsp; Commercial ships are also encouraged to take proactive security measures in the meantime.&nbsp; The relevant Singapore agencies have also been working closely with our regional partners to address this potential risk.&nbsp; The Maritime Security Task Force has also been coordinating a whole-of-Government response with the relevant Singapore agencies, such as the Police Coast Guard and Maritime and Port Authority, to step up measures to address this potential threat.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As this issue illustrates, threats to maritime security continue to be real and immediate.&nbsp; Countering this threat requires a coordinated effort&nbsp;&ndash; by governments acting alone and also in cooperation with one another.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our immediate region, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand have been conducting coordinated patrols to enhance the security of the Malacca Strait.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>2.15 pm</p> In addition to such operational arrangements, it is important to improve information sharing for the early detection of maritime threats and to coordinate responses.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To this end, Singapore has established an Information Fusion Centre <p align=left>Column: 3116</p>(IFC) at the Changi Command and Control Centre. The IFC has been purpose-built as a maritime security hub&nbsp;to collate and analyse information shared among an international network of partners, to facilitate timely and effective responses to maritime threats. Thus far, six countries, including countries as&nbsp;far away as&nbsp;France, have stationed liaison officers at the IFC. We expect more countries to do so in the coming months.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond our region, piracy in the Gulf of Aden, which is a key shipping lane, remains an international concern. While the SAF&rsquo;s focus continues to be the security of the Straits of Malacca and Singapore, we are also playing our part in the&nbsp;Gulf of Aden. This is because we recognise that it is not possible for any one country to protect its own shipping in all the world&rsquo;s key sea lanes. All countries therefore have to depend on cooperative efforts to secure the sea lanes for everyone&rsquo;s use. From April to July last year, we deployed a Task Group comprising a Landing Ship Tank and two Super Puma helicopters to contribute to the counter-piracy efforts. The Task Group worked within the framework of the multinational Combined Task Force 151 (CTF 151) to enhance the security of ships transiting through the Gulf of Aden.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We remain committed to these counter-piracy efforts. As I speak, a senior Singaporean naval officer &ndash; supported by an SAF command team &ndash; is in command of CTF 151. We had accepted the invitation by the Combined Maritime Forces HQ to assume command of CTF 151 for a period of three months, from mid-January to mid-April this year. This invitation illustrates the high regard in which other armed forces hold the SAF. As a signal of our continued commitment to this international effort, Singapore has decided to deploy a second Task Group comprising a Landing Ship Tank with two Super Pumas from June to October this <p align=left>Column: 3117</p>year, as well as a Maritime Patrol Aircraft from December 2010 to February 2011.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, another key security challenge confronting us is terrorism, something which Ms Ellen Lee and Dr Lily Neo raised. Mr Sin&nbsp;and Dr Lam&nbsp;also asked about our deployments for international security operations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terrorism remains a persistent threat to all nations, and cannot be resolved by just any one nation acting on its own.&nbsp; Afghanistan remains a key arena for the international effort against terrorism. In December last year,&nbsp;the US&nbsp;announced the&nbsp;new Afghan strategy, ordering the deployment of 30,000 more US troops to Afghanistan. We support the US&rsquo; continued commitment in Afghanistan. This will help stabilise the country and prevent extremists from again using Afghanistan to export terrorism to rest of the world, including our own region, with direct implications for our security. We are committed to contributing, within our means and in a useful way, to the multinational efforts in Afghanistan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We currently have a Weapon Locating Radar detachment and a medical team deployed in Oruzgan province. In April this year, following the completion of our medical team's deployment, we will deploy a surgical team to Oruzgan for the first time.&nbsp; I had the opportunity to visit our soldiers in Afghanistan last November and saw first-hand the contributions of our personnel. The feedback I received from the International Security Assistance Force&nbsp;(ISAF) commanders showed that our deployments are making a valued contribution towards the stabilisation and reconstruction efforts. We also continue to deploy construction engineering teams&nbsp;in Bamiyan province.&nbsp; We have also&nbsp;informed our coalition partners that we are prepared to deploy a KC-135 aerial <p align=left>Column: 3118</p>refuelling tanker and an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Task Group to Afghanistan.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here at home, the SAF continues to work closely with the homefront agencies to defend against increasingly sophisticated terror threats against Singapore. I will elaborate further when I speak about how the SAF is restructuring to meet more complex security challenges.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, every international deployment that the SAF undertakes is carefully considered. Such deployments do involve risks to our servicemen, which can be significant. However, where there is real and important work to be done, there will be attendant risks. Therefore, we must make sure that our servicemen are well equipped and trained, and receive additional training specific to their mission and area of operation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, even as we contribute to international and regional security, the primary mission of the SAF remains to deter any threats, and to defend Singapore.&nbsp; I reported to this House in March 2004 that the SAF had embarked on a transformation journey to ensure that it meets current and future operational requirements.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Michael Palmer,&nbsp;Dr Maliki,&nbsp;Dr Teo&nbsp;and Dr Lam Pin Min asked about the SAF's transformation and&nbsp;build-up plans.&nbsp;The key building blocks of the 3rd Generation SAF are now in place. While there is still work to be done, we now have&nbsp;a firm foundation for the continued development of the 3rd Generation SAF.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three building blocks form the foundation of the 3rd Generation SAF. First, acquiring new equipment and building new units to transform the SAF into an advanced, networked force. Second, re-organising the SAF into new operational command structures to deal with an expanded spectrum of operations, at home and overseas.&nbsp; And, third, developing our&nbsp;people through new and <p align=left>Column: 3119</p>enhanced career schemes as well as revising training&nbsp;and curriculum, so that we have capable and committed people to meet the requirements of the 3rd Generation SAF.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me elaborate on the transformation of the SAF into an advanced, networked force.&nbsp; The most visible part of this transformation is the progressive introduction of newer and more capable systems into the SAF which I think some Members are familiar with.&nbsp; Less visible but just as important is the integration of land, maritime and air forces into a network-centric force that can seamlessly tap on each Service's capabilities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me elaborate. The Navy's new frigates are able to dominate a larger sea area, a much larger sea area, than the 1970s-era missile gunboats which they replaced. They have&nbsp;Sikorsky S-70B naval helicopters, which further adds to the frigates' ability to undertake anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare missions at longer ranges. Each frigate's sophisticated command, control and communications suite thus allows it to network with a wide variety of SAF assets, including air-borne sensors and land-based sensors. This increases force-level awareness and mission effectiveness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Army's Terrex combat vehicles which are now coming into service are also equipped with a Battlefield Management System. This allows each vehicle to network with other parts of the SAF, and bring to bear firepower from land and air platforms, such as our new High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System and Apache helicopters. The Air Force&rsquo;s new Gulfstream Airborne Early Warning aircraft, with its extended detection range, allows the SAF to detect and track aerial targets at greater distances. This provides the whole SAF&nbsp;with more&nbsp;response times to deal with aerial threats <p align=left>Column: 3120</p>and enhances the robustness of our networked air defence system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In November last year, I visited Exercise Forging Sabre in the United States, one of a series of exercises to validate the SAF's integrated strike capabilities. Networked command centres relayed real-time information from "sensors", such as our Commando forces&nbsp;and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, to "shooters" such as F-16 fighter aircraft, Apache helicopters and our artillery rocket systems.&nbsp;The result is an enhanced ability to rapidly&nbsp;bring to bear precision firepower from various SAF strike platforms in an integrated&nbsp;way upon targets in the battlefield.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now talk about the second building block of the 3rd Generation SAF, to address Mr Palmer's question&nbsp;about operational readiness&nbsp;and also Ms&nbsp;Rajah and Dr Fatimah Lateef's&nbsp;question about restructuring to meet the complex security challenges&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the increasingly complex security environment has imposed heavier operational demands on the SAF. Besides its primary role of safeguarding Singapore against conventional threats, the SAF is also contributing to international security operations, humanitarian and disaster relief missions and providing support for homeland security operations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, I updated this House that the SAF was restructuring to better respond to current and future security challenges. These organisational changes have since been implemented and have made the SAF more flexible and responsive. This is the second building block of the 3rd Generation SAF. Let me give&nbsp;Members one example.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAF's High-Readiness Core comprises units on a heightened readiness posture.&nbsp; They are fully manned and equipped to meet operational&nbsp;contingencies, that may occur with little or no <p align=left>Column: 3121</p>warning. These units are structured into integrated Task Forces, that can draw&nbsp;from forces from all three Services.&nbsp; This reflects the cross-service and inter-agency approach we are taking to address the cross-domain nature of today's security challenges.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Island Defence Task Force carries out peacetime security operations such as the protection of key installations &ndash; Jurong Island, Changi Airport.&nbsp; As I mentioned earlier, the Maritime Security Task Force works to protect Singapore against maritime threats, and the Special Operations Task Force provides the SAF with an expanded capacity to carry out counter-terrorism and other contingency operations. Where operationally relevant, the Task Forces also work closely with Homefront and other Government agencies like the Maritime and Port Authority and Singapore Customs to keep Singapore safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;These organisational changes have given us a strengthened capability to respond to more sophisticated security threats to Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the third building block of the 3rd Generation SAF is developing our people. We recognise that our people are the key resource that will enable us to realise our transformation efforts.&nbsp; This means&nbsp;we have to attract and retain the best people, which Dr Maliki Osman asked about.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is with this in mind that the SAF conducted a fundamental review of the SAF career schemes to better match the increasingly complex demands of the 3rd Generation SAF with the needs and aspirations of our servicemen. The SAF&rsquo;s new&nbsp;career schemes will allow the SAF to attract, retain and groom people with the right values, motivation and abilities to deal with current and future security challenges.&nbsp; Dr Ng will elaborate on these initiatives when he speaks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 3122</p>Dr Maliki Osman and Dr Lam Pin Min asked about defence spending. Building effective defence capabilities takes many years. The transformation of the SAF has been possible, because of our steady and prudent long-term approach to defence spending over the years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government's policy on defence spending and the defence budget remains the same.&nbsp; The SAF will continue to build its capability in a systematic, prudent and disciplined fashion &ndash; selectively adding important new capabilities, through the most cost-effective solutions; extending the lifespan of our current equipment by maintaining them well and upgrading where possible; and investing in networks and technologies to serve as force multipliers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lam&nbsp;asked about&nbsp;defence R&amp;D. We invest about 4% of our defence budget on R&amp;D.&nbsp; This is a necessary and important investment as the technologies we need may not be available on the open market or those which are available may not&nbsp;fulfil our requirements. We have reaped healthy returns from this investment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our R&amp;D efforts have led to the successful indigenous development of advanced systems such as the Pegasus Lightweight Howitzer, the Bronco All-Terrain Tracked Carrier and the command and control systems of our frigates.&nbsp; These have received widespread publicity and attracted the notice of professionals, both locally and internationally over the last year.</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our R&amp;D efforts in the airborne area have also paid off.&nbsp; The Defence Science&nbsp;Organisation (DSO)&nbsp;started R&amp;D into Unmanned Aerial Vehicles about a decade ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;It worked towards developing a man-portable mini tactical UAV called the Skyblade whose primary mission is to support Army battalion operations.&nbsp; These <p align=left>Column: 3123</p>UAVs provide the battalion with real-time video images of its area of operations, including those areas on the "other side of the hill",&nbsp;which you cannot see by direct observation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Development of such mini-UAVs was technically very challenging as all the sub-systems had to be small and light-weight, yet robust and reliable.&nbsp; DSO engineers had to work on a design, within a very tight budget, that would include optical devices with sufficient resolution, pointing accuracy and stabilisation so that it can deliver clear video imagery.&nbsp; A miniaturised communications data-link had to be incorporated to transmit the video back in real time to the users.&nbsp; The mini-UAV also needed a good engine and a high-capacity battery pack for meaningful mission time and range, and a non-trivial problem, it had to be robust enough to survive repeated take-offs and landings in the field in very rough conditions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After extensive trials and evolution, the design was refined and transferred to ST Engineering to produce the Skyblade III.&nbsp; ST Engineering then&nbsp;developed the production model successfully, and these UAVs are&nbsp;now being&nbsp;fielded in the Army.&nbsp;&nbsp;Following this success, R&amp;D on UAVs is continuing with the development of a 60 kg class of tactical UAV called Skyblade IV, for use at the brigade level.&nbsp;&nbsp; Research is also ongoing with industry partners to develop unmanned underwater vehicles for underwater surveillance and mine counter-measures, and we are also looking at ground robots.&nbsp; These programmes illustrate the pay-offs from the investments into DSO's R&amp;D capabilities which are a key part of the SAF's 3rd Generation transformation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the ability to defend Singapore forms the basis of our existence as an independent nation.&nbsp; It is for this reason that we have invested steadily in defence, and are continuing to build a 3rd Generation SAF capable of safeguarding <p align=left>Column: 3124</p>our sovereignty and vital interests for many years to come.&nbsp; The effectiveness of the SAF depends ultimately on our men and women, both in-service personnel and National Servicemen. At the same time, our defence also rests on the resolve and determination of all Singaporeans to defend what is ours&nbsp;and our support for the men and women in uniform. Dr Ng will now elaborate on our human resource, National Service, and training initiatives to bring out the best in our people.&nbsp; Prof. Koo will later elaborate on our wider public engagement initiatives to enhance Singaporeans' commitment to defence.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Second Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Second Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</B> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, before I address Members'&nbsp;specific comments, I echo Deputy Prime Minister Teo's appreciation to Members of this House for their continuing support for our defence efforts.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Dr Maliki Osman and Mr Michael Palmer&nbsp;asked for an update on the SAF's 3G transformation, in particular its impact on human resource, their&nbsp;deployment and their productivity.&nbsp;&nbsp;And indeed as they have projected,&nbsp;our changes and our additions of platforms and the different ways we do things have had an impact.&nbsp; We&nbsp;require each SAF serviceman to take on added responsibilities and acquire new skill sets to respond adequately to a wider spectrum of threats.&nbsp;&nbsp; Deputy Prime Minister Teo said that we have undergone&nbsp;a fundamental review of our human resource constructs to meet these challenges.&nbsp; And Members will remember that during the debate on the SAF (Amendment) Bill in November last year,&nbsp; Deputy Prime Minister Teo explained the rationale behind the new Military Domain Experts Scheme (MDES), the Enhanced Warrant Officers Scheme and the Enhanced Officers Scheme.&nbsp; Let me provide an update to Parliament, but&nbsp;first, let me say that&nbsp;the response in general&nbsp;has been positive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 3125</p>The take-up rate of the current personnel eligible for conversion to MDES was high at 95%.&nbsp; One of our in-service personnel who will be converting to MDES is Lieutenant-Colonel Goh Nai Chuan, a branch head in the Navy.&nbsp; He said,&nbsp; "The MDES Scheme means that I can develop greater in-depth knowledge in my field of professional interest &ndash; logistics and supply systems &ndash; impart my experience and knowledge to the younger generation, and serve the SAF better."&nbsp;&nbsp; The initial response from the public to recruitment is also encouraging&nbsp;with entry-level recruitment at the&nbsp;Military Expert1 (ME1) level increasing by 10% in the period April to December 2009, compared to recruitment in the same period&nbsp;in 2008.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Enhanced Warrant Officers Scheme and the Enhanced Officers Scheme have also been well-received.&nbsp; SAF Warrant Officers and Specialists (WOSpecs) have welcomed the expanded roles and responsibilities, as well as the opportunities for professional development under the Scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give one example&nbsp;&ndash; Staff Sergeant Warner Poh is an Army Specialist, who says that the new 3rd Warrant Officer rank "signifies the Army's trust in the abilities of WOSpecs to take up heavier job responsibilities earlier in [their] careers."&nbsp; SAF Officers have also welcomed the Enhanced Officers Scheme.&nbsp; In particular, the option of a longer career in the SAF allows them to further deepen their expertise as leaders and commanders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the SAF has started new programmes which provide opportunities for our servicemen to take the initiative to upgrade, so that they can better meet the complex demands of the 3rd Generation SAF while fulfilling their personal aspirations.&nbsp; A year ago in this House, I spoke about the new partnerships that the SAF has formed with local universities to support our Continuing Education <p align=left>Column: 3126</p>programmes.&nbsp; Under these partnerships, relevant modules within SAF courses&nbsp;&ndash; some Members are familiar with the Command and Staff Course, for example&nbsp;&ndash; can be accredited and counted towards degrees awarded by NTU or UniSIM.&nbsp; I am pleased to report that to date, about 60% of last year's Command and Staff Course graduates have applied for this programme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Warrant Officers and Specialists alike have also shown a keen interest in continual learning and skills upgrading.&nbsp; Dr&nbsp;Maliki and Mr Michael Palmer asked about&nbsp;these aspects.&nbsp; Since the SAF's tie-up with UniSIM last February, the enrolment of Warrant Officers and Specialists in UniSIM degree programmes has increased by almost 30%.&nbsp; At a Continuing Education Awards Ceremony in January, we awarded sponsorships for degrees, diplomas and certificate level studies at various local institutions to 152 Warrant Officers and Specialists.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just give&nbsp;Members one example, how this is affecting people on the ground.&nbsp; 2WO Vijaikumar &ndash; he works in&nbsp;the Air Force&nbsp;as a Warrant Officer &ndash; I presented&nbsp;an award to him&nbsp;at that ceremony.&nbsp; In fact, this is his second Continuing Education Award, this time in the pursuit of a full-time degree course.&nbsp; His first was in 2005 where he had an&nbsp;award&nbsp;to pursue a diploma in Mechanical Engineering at Ngee Ann Polytechnic.&nbsp; This was an oldish guy, he went to the Polytechnic &ndash; I met him after the ceremony &ndash; and he did very well.&nbsp; He graduated with a 4.0 GPA, which means a perfect score, earning him a place on the Dean's List.&nbsp; Last year, Vijaikumar did the SAF proud again when he became the first overseas candidate to top the US Non-Commissioned Officers course in Hawaii.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Michael Palmer and Dr Fatimah Lateef asked about the broader training philosophy behind&nbsp; Basic Military Training <p align=left>Column: 3127</p>(BMT).&nbsp; I know many of us have gone through the BMT but let me just reiterate that is a critical part of our military training system.&nbsp; It engages recruits at the physical, intellectual and emotional levels.&nbsp; It prepares&nbsp;them physically for the next phase of their NS.&nbsp; It equips them with the professional knowledge&nbsp;to move on to more advanced military and vocational training.&nbsp; Just as important, it helps prepare them&nbsp;emotionally, for their overall well-being,&nbsp;to give them a sense of purpose and a positive identification&nbsp;with&nbsp;what NS stands for.&nbsp; These objectives continue to underpin our approach to BMT, even as we refine&nbsp;certain programmes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Members have pointed out, both Mr Palmer and Dr Fatimah,&nbsp;the majority of our recruits are graded with a Physical Employment&nbsp;Status (PES) of A or B.&nbsp; There is&nbsp; no&nbsp;change to their nine-week BMT course.&nbsp; There was an&nbsp;extension to the Physical Training Phase (PTP) from four weeks to eight weeks which I had announced in this House last year.&nbsp; And the aim is a simple one&nbsp;&ndash; to improve the fitness of our PTP recruits so that they can reach a&nbsp;level comparable to their direct-BMT peers at the point of entry because&nbsp;we found that four weeks were insufficient.&nbsp; Even after four weeks, there were some still&nbsp;lagging behind&nbsp;those who have gone direct, so we added another four weeks.&nbsp; And this has been implemented since December 2009.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another change is the recently announced new 19-week BMT for obese recruits.&nbsp; The rationale is the same.&nbsp; Studies of previous cohorts have shown that they needed this extra time. This gives&nbsp;extra time&nbsp;for our&nbsp;obese&nbsp;recruits to improve their fitness levels and achieve better weight loss.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other refinements are the&nbsp;programmes for PES E and PES C recruits which are now four and nine weeks respectively.&nbsp; &nbsp;These&nbsp;will provide&nbsp;the necessary training to prepare them for <p align=left>Column: 3128</p>deployment in Combat Service Support vocations after BMT.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically and overall,&nbsp;these refinements&nbsp;ensure that our recruits are committed, confident and ready to take on the next stage of their NS after they pass out of BMT.&nbsp; I should add that the overall duration of the full-time NS remains unchanged at two years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now move on to the topic of physical fitness among NS-liable students.&nbsp; This was a point raised by Mr Michael Palmer.&nbsp; MINDEF works closely with our junior colleges, polytechnics and the Institute of Technical Education (ITEs) and they want to encourage their students to achieve a high standard of physical fitness.&nbsp; He asked what percent of PES A and B&nbsp;enlistees achieved a Gold or Silver in the National Physical Fitness Award.&nbsp;&nbsp;50% do.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such enlistees qualify for a two-month reduction from the NS duration of two years.&nbsp; MINDEF will continue to work with the schools to further improve the physical standards of our pre-enlistees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lam Pin Min&nbsp;asked whether the Individual Physical Proficiency Test&nbsp;(IPPT) continues to remain relevant.&nbsp; It has been around for a long time and&nbsp;many of us remember it.&nbsp; The key&nbsp;attributes they test for&nbsp;are&nbsp;muscular strength and endurance of the upper and lower body, co-ordination, speed, agility and cardiovascular fitness.&nbsp; Despite modern technology, is it still relevant?&nbsp; We think so&nbsp;&ndash; it is as&nbsp;good a test as any.&nbsp; But there was a more important part which I thought he and Mr Palmer raised.&nbsp; It was whether in this process of the 3G transformation &ndash; indeed as they rightly pointed out, where we leverage&nbsp;on technology &ndash; what is the requirement? And I would say that it in no way reduces the physical fitness attributes required of our soldiers.&nbsp; We talked about Afghanistan,&nbsp;very rugged terrain. I have not been there, Deputy Prime Minister Teo went there.&nbsp; It is renowned for the ruggedness of the terrain.&nbsp; Conditions of terrain,&nbsp; and the <p align=left>Column: 3129</p>tempo of operations will continue to demand a high fitness state for our soldiers in the execution of their combat tasks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, Ms Jessica Tan and Mr Viswa Sadasivan asked about MINDEF's policies on NS enlistment and deferment.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are clear, fundamental principles upon which these policies are based.&nbsp; First, NS must be for meeting a critical national need, and that&nbsp;critical need is our national security and our survival.&nbsp; We have specifically narrowed the scope because we know that it imposes considerable costs both to the individual and to the nation&nbsp; And we acknowledge&nbsp;that.&nbsp; As Ms Jessica Tan and Mr Viswa Sadasivan have pointed out,&nbsp;some people will have to defer educational pursuits, work&nbsp;or even reduced their income.&nbsp; So that critical need for national security and our survival is the only basis upon which we will impose NS.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From time to time, there have been calls to extend NS beyond this remit, to fulfil laudable social objectives.&nbsp; And I am referring to Mr Palmer's and&nbsp;Mr Seah Kian Peng's suggestion that NS should be for new citizens, those beyond the NS call-up age, so that they can better fulfil their role as responsible citizens.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>2.45 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not in any doubt that this is a laudable social goal, but it is an inadequate reason for us to impose NS to beyond that remit of critical national security and survival. Even though these social goals are laudable, they do not meet the critical need&nbsp;to impose National Service.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, other agencies do have existing programmes to integrate new citizens to help them better understand the importance of national defence.&nbsp; For <p align=left>Column: 3130</p>instance, the People's Association organises visits for new citizens to the Army Museum.&nbsp;And MINDEF also organises visits for new citizens to the Basic Military Training Centre in Pulau Tekong.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second fundamental principle of our NS is universality.&nbsp;All young Singaporean males who are fit to serve are conscripted. And this is easy to understand. If we have a system in which some are conscripted but others are not, there will be strong feelings of unfairness, which will undermine the commitment of our National Servicemen. This is a true test, not just maintaining their goodwill, but not undermining the commitment, because you have not been&nbsp;universal or fair.&nbsp; And the third fundamental principle of our NS is equity. That means that our NS policies are applied equitably to everyone regardless of background or status.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These three principles apply to the enlistment.&nbsp; They apply to every&nbsp;National Servicemen, including those who have returned from overseas. And they are subject to the same enlistment policies as their peers who are living or studying in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain the context of our enlistment procedures.&nbsp; It is based&nbsp;on a number of&nbsp;factors, such as the individual's medical fitness, the type of training he will undertake in BMT, and our training and operational requirements.&nbsp;And Members are right, we do enlist a large number.&nbsp; And&nbsp;it is not possible for enlistees to be assigned their preferred enlistment date, regardless of whether they are studying in Singapore or&nbsp;overseas.&nbsp;&nbsp;All pre-enlistees have to wait for their turn for enlistment which takes place every quarter, and the wait-time will vary, depending on the intake they are scheduled for.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Jessica Tan and Mr Viswa Sadasivan also asked if MINDEF can be <p align=left>Column: 3131</p>flexible in granting NSmen deferments from their In-Camp Training (ICT), to minimise disruption to their work and studies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NSmen from the same unit are called back for ICT at the same time.&nbsp;And the reason is simple, this is to enable them to train as a cohesive unit so that the unit can remain operationally ready.&nbsp;And that is the key priority. Nevertheless,&nbsp;MINDEF will help our NSmen balance their work and academic commitments with their NS obligations, where it is possible to do so. For NSmen studying in NUS, NTU and SMU, we schedule their ICT call-ups during their academic vacation period. This is possible because a sizeable pool of our NSmen who are pursuing full-time studies&nbsp;are in these universities, and they share a common vacation period.&nbsp;For NSmen pursuing full-time studies in private educational institutions, their requests for deferment from their ICT have to be considered on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NSmen are given at least&nbsp;three to&nbsp;six months' advance notice of their NS call-ups.&nbsp;And I think this should be enough time for them to inform their employers, to work with them to adjust and re-prioritise their work schedules.&nbsp;Each NSman has a role to play and the unit is affected if he is deferred from his In-Camp Training.&nbsp; There is a need to strike a balance between the inconvenience caused to the NSman, the company&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;the impact on the unit if the NSman is granted deferment.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, we recognise that there are some circumstances where we have exercised flexibility in the granting of&nbsp;deferment for NSmen. For example, there may be situations where an NSman finds it difficult to adjust his work commitments because a few of his colleagues who could cover his duties are also being called up.&nbsp;In such circumstances, the commander on the ground, who is often <p align=left>Column: 3132</p>an NSman himself, is in the best position to make the judgment, because it is the commander who is held accountable for the readiness of his unit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of full-time National Servicemen and enlistment, our prevailing principle that underscores these principles of equality and fairness ensures that if you are enlisted and when you finally do&nbsp;go to&nbsp;university, you do not go to university later than your peers within the same cohort.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Defence (Assoc.

Prof. Koo Tsai Kee):</B> Mr Chairman, Ms Ellen Lee asked for an update on the implementation of the recommendations of RECORD V.&nbsp;The Government had accepted all the 18 recommendations and I am pleased to inform this House that we have already implemented about half of the recommendations.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The recommendations to increase the rank and combat allowances of our NSmen were implemented since October last year.&nbsp;From 1st April this year, Sir, the rank allowance increments for NSmen will be implemented.&nbsp;NSmen will also get their increments earlier, after one work year instead of attending 40 days of NS In-Camp Training.&nbsp;In addition, key command appointment holders will receive the new Command&nbsp;add-on allowance.&nbsp;This will better recognise the heavy responsibilities of our NS commanders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, another recommendation was to help NSmen balance their military training and work demands during In-Camp Training.&nbsp; To facilitate this, we are enhancing the business centres in the three largest training institutes where NSmen have their In-Camp Trainings.&nbsp;These are the Infanty Training Institutions at Jurong Camp II, Armour Training Institute at Jekung Camp and Army and Logistics Training Institute in Kranji Camp. <p align=left>Column: 3133</p>NSmen can bring in their laptops and PDAs to use them at these business centres after training hours.&nbsp;These business centres will be equipped with Wireless Internet Access to enable our NSmen to connect to their workplaces.&nbsp;We have received very positive feedback from our NSmen regarding this initiative and they are looking forward to the implementation next month.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SAFRA has also begun work with the Town Councils to incorporate IPPT in community training facilities into the fitness corners in the Town Council&nbsp;neighbourhoods.&nbsp; This will be an added convenience for our NSmen to train for their IPPT.&nbsp;The first IPPT training facility in Hillock Park at Bukit Purmei estate is already ready for use, and another nine facilities in areas such as Bishan-Toa Payoh, West Coast, Tampines, Yishun and Tanjong Pagar will be ready over the next few months.&nbsp;I am heartened by the warm responses from the various Town Councils and NSmen for this project. CPL (NS) Poh Yong Cheng, an NSman whom I spoke to two days ago at the launch of the first IPPT training facility at Bukit Purmei, told me that the facility has made it easier for him to train for his annual IPPT.&nbsp;This is because the facility brings together all the five IPPT stations, and is also very near his home. I encourage Members of this House to speak with your constituents and explore setting up more of such facilities in your town. SAFRA is waiting to hear from you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The remaining RECORD V's recommendations, such as the introduction of Family Recognition Vouchers for NSmen and ORD mementos for NSFs, will be implemented in the next financial year.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House would have received a copy of <I>PIONEER</I> magazine, in which you will be able to find a progress report on the implementation of the RECORD V's recommendations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3134</p> Sir, on Total Defence. Ms Ellen Lee asked if our approach to Total Defence has changed and how the Total Defence message can be further entrenched.&nbsp;This is also related to Dr Lily Neo&rsquo;s question on integrating all citizens into our efforts to defend Singapore against terrorism.&nbsp;I would also like to thank Dr Teo Ho Pin for asking how we are engaging Singaporeans, in particular our youths, in Total Defence.&nbsp; Sir, today, Total Defence has become even more relevant, it is part of our life.&nbsp;Total Defence&nbsp;provides us with a whole-of-nation framework for overcoming potential threats and challenges, whether they are terrorism, pandemic outbreaks or economic downturns.&nbsp;It is wrong to say that Total Defence is a responsibility of the SAF, it is the responsibility of all&nbsp;agencies and everybody in Singapore. It is critical that all Singaporeans understand that everyone has a role to play in defending Singapore and in building a strong nation that is vigilant, prepared and resilient.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am pleased to note that the message of Total Defence is being spread by Singaporeans from all walks of life, young and old. Instead of it being a top-down message from the Government, and certainly not just from SAF, but from all the Government agencies, it is now "viral", with Total Defence messages created and spread by the people from all walks of life.&nbsp; The Total Defence campaigns in 2009 and 2010 merely provided the platforms &ndash; ie, traditional and new media &ndash; especially new media these days, for Singaporeans to express themselves. Building on the "What Will You Defend?" campaign last year, the "I Will" campaign this year will ask Singaporeans to make a pledge to act on what is important to him/her,&nbsp;and to all of us. Singaporeans have responded enthusiastically. A total of about 27,000 pledges, mostly from schools and the grassroots, were made through various channels like the "I Will" website, pledge cards and roadshows. More, of course <p align=left>Column: 3135</p>will be explored.&nbsp;More can be expected. The website remains open, and more roadshows will be held at the various constituencies over the year. This gives us the confidence that our young men and women understand the importance of Total Defence and will play their part when we are faced with any crisis or challenges.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have also been engaging young people. Young people are very important,&nbsp;through projects such as N.E.mation (National Education&nbsp;animation)&nbsp;&ndash; Dr Teo mentioned that. It is an annual animation&nbsp;competition that allows them to express in their own ways what Total Defence means to them. In this year&rsquo;s competition, the top 10 finalist teams were able to rally support for their clips through the use of Facebook. The teams posted behind-the-scenes photos and videos to show the progress being made in the production of their clips.&nbsp; As a result, the clips this year garnered some 57,000 votes from the public, almost double the number in the first competition.&nbsp;Many of the clips were of the highest quality. Two clips worthy of mention, first clip "Just Because" from CHIJ St. Joseph&rsquo;s Convent and second clip, "Nation Moulders" from Jurong Junior College &ndash; won the Phoenix Award, for "Most Outstanding Film for a Product or Cause by a Student", in 2007 and 2008 respectively. The Phoenix Award is an annual competition in Asia that recognise creativity and professional skills in the production of commercial films, video and digital images.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These Total Defence efforts represent part of an overall layered approach to engage youths.&nbsp;We first start in schools with National Education, and when they are in junior colleges, polytechnics and ITEs, all male and female students will visit SAF camps to have a first-hand experience of what the SAF and NS is all about.&nbsp;During their full-time NS stint, besides being trained to become fighting <p align=left>Column: 3136</p>soldiers, the males are given further insights into the defence of the country.&nbsp;And after their ORD, we continue to engage our NSmen during their annual In-Camp Training. Surveys in recent years have consistently shown that more than 90% of our people would defend Singapore should it come under threat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Indranee Rajah and Dr Maliki Osman asked&nbsp;how we can&nbsp;ensure that Singaporeans, especially the young, remain committed to defence, and how we are enhancing Singaporeans&rsquo;, and particularly young Singaporeans&rsquo;, appreciation of the role played by the SAF in safeguarding Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MINDEF will continue to use creative means to engage Singaporeans and enhance their personal commitment to defence.&nbsp;Events like the annual Total Defence campaign that I just touched on and the National Day Parade are just some examples of how we have sought to engage Singaporeans on a personal level.&nbsp;Many&nbsp;Members would remember the 8.22 pm pledge moment at last year&rsquo;s NDP, that means 8pm 22 minutes, which sought to bring our entire nation together to re-affirm our commitment to Singapore by saying the pledge together.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To better foster commitment to defence among Singaporeans and let them have a better sense of what is going on in the SAF, we ought to reach out to the public, particularly our young people, through the use of new media.&nbsp;A good example is our cyberpioneer TV channel on YouTube.&nbsp;There, viewers can learn more about the SAF by watching short video clips on life in the SAF.&nbsp;We started the channel in December 2008, and today we have about 140 video clips garnering a total of almost 420,000 views.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last August, MINDEF also gave our PIONEER magazine a makeover so that its content would appeal to a wider audience,&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3137</p>thereby spreading the message of Total Defence. PIONEER now not only has a new and more vibrant layout, but also helps the families of our NSFs and NSmen appreciate the importance of what they are doing.&nbsp; We received a letter from Ms Jennifer Chow, a girlfriend of an NSF, who wrote, &ldquo;I am very happy with the new PIONEER because it presents a variety of information from military to lifestyle.&rdquo;&nbsp;Perhaps from that magazine, Ms Indranee's colleague picked up the news about her, sitting&nbsp;on a tank, with a tank top or without a tank top. [<I>Laughter</I>.]&nbsp; She said, "I&nbsp;introduced it to my female colleagues".&nbsp;Similarly, Ms Stephanie Ang, a mother, wrote, &ldquo;Now with the revamp of the PIONEER magazine, I can entertain myself and still be well informed of the SAF.&nbsp; I also have a better time communicating with my son about his army life.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have been fortunate that there is strong public commitment to defence and to National Service.&nbsp; However, we should not take this for granted. MINDEF will continue to engage all Singaporeans to strengthen their commitment to the defence of Singapore.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>3.00 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Any clarifications?

And, obviously, we recognise that with so many people who are enlisted and called up,&nbsp;it is difficult to address specific wants and concerns.&nbsp; Basically, we apply whether it is for enlistment or call up for ICT, three principles of universality for a critical need and for equity.&nbsp; In terms of that particular example, I ended my reply by saying that we want to ensure, in terms of equity, that no enlistee will enter a university later than his peers, in general. That will be the principle in which we apply.&nbsp; Because there are different starting terms, depending whether you are in the southern hemisphere in Australia, and with private institutions, really you could start anytime. So whatever your starting month, it is subsumed under this principle that we try to ensure that wherever the majority of the cohort enters university for that year, that those who are subsequently enlisted later will enter the university the same year as their cohort.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the second point about the two call-ups within the same year because of the financial year, we will take that into account, look into that and respond to Mr Viswa when ready.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman</B>: Any more clarifications?&nbsp; Mr Sadasivan.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Viswa Sadasivan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Viswa Sadasivan:</B> I thank the Minister for his detailed elaboration of the 3rd Generation Force transformation efforts by the SAF&nbsp;&ndash; it is entirely impressive.&nbsp; My concern is this.&nbsp; As we transform and build up&nbsp;our capabilities, especially with higher profile inter<p align=left>Column: 3139</p>nationally and in the region, and being involved in multilateral and bilateral exercises as well as being a lot more involved in humanitarian operations overseas, even though our objective for building up capabilities is as a deterrent, I am just wondering whether this has caused any anxiety or discomfort amongst our neighbours.&nbsp; And if so, how have we handled that?</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Chee Hean--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Teo Chee Hean:</B> Sir, our defence policy is based on diplomacy and deterrence.

The plan was centred around eight values which were meant to unite the people under the One Malaysia banner.&nbsp; This was a direct reaction to the poor showing in the general election which had been, in part, caused by the discontent in UMNO along racial lines.&nbsp; Unfortunately, One Malaysia does not seem to have had the intended effect. The torching&nbsp;of churches and <I>suraus</I> has ensued and the Anwar's trial has not helped to unite the country.&nbsp; In light of this, may I ask the Minister what is the status of Singapore's relationship with Malaysia and how he sees Singapore's relationship with Malaysia developing, given the very fluid and seemingly uncertain political climate in Malaysia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indonesia&nbsp;&ndash; the situation was almost the reverse for President Bambang Yudhoyono. At the last Indonesian general election, he took office for a second term with a strong majority.&nbsp; Unfortunately, that situation has unravelled. His approval ratings are down and he is under intense political pressure over the Bank Century&nbsp;bailout.&nbsp; In last Thursday's <I>Straits Times</I>, it was reported that President Yudhoyono had accepted responsibility for the decisions made in respect of the bailout, even though he said that he was not directly involved.&nbsp; That does not seem to <p align=left>Column: 3145</p>have stemmed the tide of politicians calling for their prosecution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the international front, President Yudhoyono&nbsp;has been playing up Indonesia's role in international affairs.&nbsp; May I ask what is the status of Singapore's relationship with Indonesia and how does the Minister see Singapore's relationship with Indonesia developing? How does the Minister see Indonesia's role in the region developing?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Myanmar&nbsp;&ndash; I had the privilege of travelling to Myanmar last year when Daw Aung San&nbsp;Suu Kyi was in the midst of her trial.&nbsp; I witnessed the country under serious international pressure. Since then, things have evolved and in the international community, the United States, in particular, has taken a softer, more open and engaging approach to Myanmar.&nbsp; May I ask what is the status of Singapore's relations with Myanmar? Does Singapore envisage that the elections will be open and fair?&nbsp; Has the new approach adopted by the United States in respect of Myanmar led to better engagement&nbsp;between Myanmar and the West?&nbsp; What about&nbsp;Aung San Suu Kyi? Will she be released in time for the elections?

The question is:&nbsp; have there been any significant changes in our relationship under the Obama Administration. We have about a year now to assess where the relationship is going and how it is developing. There is a new Ambassador who has been appointed to Singapore. How does the Foreign Minister see this relationship developing?&nbsp; I would also like to ask the Foreign Minister for his views on our economic and trade ties with the United States post the 2008 financial crisis.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Relations with China, India and Japan</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to ask the Foreign Minister about our relationship with China, India and Japan.&nbsp; China and India are, of course, the rising countries in Asia.

We have tried to make ourselves useful both to these two large behemoths in the region.&nbsp; What I would like to ask the Minister is for his views on our political relationship with the Chinese and Indian governments and also whether he sees us deepening and strengthening our trade ties and how he sees the relationship with these two countries with whom we share a great culture and ethnic affinity&nbsp;developing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Also with respect to Japan which is another strong power in Asia, what opportunities does he see for us to deepen and strengthen our ties with Japan?</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lam Pin Min--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Relations with China and Japan</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lam Pin Min:</B> Mr Chairman, China and Japan are key strategic partners in ensuring economic and political security in the region.

There was a strong spirit of cooperation which we hope will also suffuse the coming meetings, first,&nbsp;in Yokohama, then in Honolulu,&nbsp;then Vladivostok.&nbsp; And we are working with the incoming Chairs in particular Japan and the US in ensuring that what we have done in Singapore will be followed through into the next two venues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As APEC accounts for roughly half of global trade and production, it is the most important regional organisation in the Asia-Pacific.&nbsp; Promoting greater regional economic integration and fighting trade protectionism are the major challenges in our common effort to achieve the Bogor Goals of a region of free and open trade and investment by 2010 for developed <p align=left>Column: 3151</p>economies and 2020 for all the economies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important initiative which can help get us there is the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), which was given a strong push forward during the Singapore Meeting.&nbsp; Before US President&nbsp;Obama arrived in Singapore, he affirmed his Administration's support for this initiative.&nbsp; By drawing the US, Singapore, Brunei, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Peru and possibly Vietnam as well into one large regional free trade area, the TPP will generate positive momentum in APEC towards the achievement of the Bogor Goals, as well as towards a possible Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific.&nbsp; Although negotiations for the TPP will not be easy, Singapore will work hard along with other countries to move the process along.&nbsp; APEC leadership will also be crucial as part of the global concerted effort in addressing the challenges of climate change, globalisation and macro-economic imbalances.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Singapore Meeting, international financial reform was a major item on the agenda.&nbsp; As 10 of the 21 APEC Economic Leaders had attended the G20 Meeting in Pittsburgh two months before, the discussions on financial reform flowed naturally into the Singapore Meeting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Josephine Teo and Dr Fatimah Lateef asked about the importance of the G20 to us and of our participation in it.&nbsp; Singapore has a strong interest in good global governance, not least because we are a major international financial centre.&nbsp; We see the G20 as an important agent of positive change.&nbsp; For this reason, both in ASEAN and in APEC, we support strongly the G20 process and contribute in whatever way we can.&nbsp; Finance Minister Tharman participated in some of the meetings, and we hope to be able to continue participating in future meetings <p align=left>Column: 3152</p>at the highest level possible.&nbsp; As a global financial centre, we believe we have a useful contribution to make.&nbsp; At the UN, we have helped form a group of countries called the 3G countries which means Global Governance Group, a name coined by the Liechtenstein Foreign Minister which&nbsp;we contracted to "3G" so that it does not sound too grandiloquent.&nbsp; We participate in this 3G process in order&nbsp;to help the G20 assume greater legitimacy in&nbsp;the global community of nations.&nbsp; It is to improve the G20's interaction with the general membership&nbsp;in the UN, which in turn would build wider support for G20 actions.&nbsp; It is important that the decisions of the G20 take into account the interest of other countries and are supported by them.&nbsp; The G20 process should strengthen the UN and other international organisations, not weaken them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann asked about Singapore's goals in the UN.&nbsp; What we do to help the G20 is an illustration of the general approach we take in the UN to improve global governance.&nbsp; A world governed by rules of civilised conduct, where might does not equal right, is crucial for our well-being.&nbsp; This was the position we took when we were in the Security Council in 2001-2002.&nbsp; Happily, many countries in the UN share our worldview.&nbsp; While maintaining good links to the major powers, we have been very active in building coalitions among smaller countries so that our interests are also protected.&nbsp; Over the years, we have promoted an informal Forum of Small States (FOSS), consisting of countries with populations of less than 10 million people.&nbsp; These countries make up half the membership of the UN.&nbsp; By sharing information, exchanging views and occasionally acting together, FOSS has become a significant grouping.&nbsp; Every year at the General Assembly, I host a <I>makan kecil</I> for members of FOSS.&nbsp; And when we meet each other, we say, half in jest, that "The FOSS is with you".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3153</p>Mr Michael Palmer asked how ASEAN is shaping the larger regional architecture.&nbsp; Dr Lily Neo and Dr Mohamad Maliki&nbsp;are concerned about ASEAN's effectiveness and its usefulness to Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite severe challenges last year during the Thai Chairmanship, ASEAN has not only held together, it continued to make progress, although not as much as we would have hoped for.&nbsp; The Charter is being implemented; the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights has been established; a Committee of Permanent Representatives now meets regularly at the ASEAN Secretariat in Jakarta and 33 countries have accredited ambassadors to ASEAN; a currency swap arrangement called the Chiang Mai Initiative Multi-lateralisation was signed with China, Japan and Korea; FTAs were concluded with Australia and New Zealand, India and Korea; the first Summit Meeting between ASEAN Leaders and the US President was held in Singapore last November; ASEAN and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Foreign Ministers met for the first time in Bahrain; we embarked on a major project to draw up a masterplan for connectivity along all dimensions, within ASEAN, and between ASEAN and the wider region; and a comprehensive FTA with China came into force at the beginning of this year, by far the biggest&nbsp;market in the world encompassing a combined population of almost two billion people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relative peace in the region and the enlargement of our economic space have made possible Singapore's continuing economic development.&nbsp; For this reason, a strong ASEAN is at the heart of our foreign policy and our economic policy, and both MFA and MTI work very closely together to ensure that our objectives are met and&nbsp;our interests&nbsp;safeguarded.&nbsp; Singapore and a number of other ASEAN countries would like to see the ASEAN <p align=left>Column: 3154</p>Flag flying side by side with national flags at the overseas missions of all ASEAN countries in the world.&nbsp; And&nbsp;I hope we can do that by the time we establish an ASEAN Community in 2015.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major powers are all friendly to ASEAN and want to see us do well because our unity and development are in their interest.&nbsp; All of them see ASEAN playing a central role in the evolution of the regional architecture.&nbsp; At the G20 Summits in London and Pittsburgh last year, the ASEAN Chair was invited because of the importance given to ASEAN as a regional grouping.&nbsp; This recognition of ASEAN's role is in fact a triumph of our diplomacy but it also puts on us a heavy responsibility to pull our weight and respond in a timely way to new challenges and I think it also puts a particular responsibility on us to resolve our&nbsp;bilateral problems in a peaceful manner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Palmer and Dr Lam asked specifically about ASEAN's response to Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama's proposal for an East Asia community and Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's proposal for an Asia-Pacific community, both with&nbsp;small "c"s.&nbsp; At our recent retreat in Da Nang, ASEAN Foreign Ministers affirmed the centrality of ASEAN.&nbsp; To the extent that new proposals strengthen, not weaken, ASEAN and our&nbsp;position in the regional architecture, we are prepared to consider them with a positive spirit but our strong preference is to be in the driver's seat, not because we think we are the best driver, but because we are the driver&nbsp;acceptable to all the passengers.&nbsp;&nbsp;And we are working with Vietnam&nbsp;and we strongly support Vietnam as the&nbsp;present ASEAN Chair as we now strive to do all the things necessary to establish a full-fledged ASEAN Community by 2015.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Palmer asked about the status of our bilateral relations with Malaysia and <p align=left>Column: 3155</p>Indonesia, and about the situation in Myanmar.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Prime Minister Najib, our relations with Malaysia are very good and their domestic challenges do not really affect this bilateral relationship.&nbsp; In May this year, Prime Minister Lee and Prime Minister Najib will be having a retreat to discuss how we can strengthen bilateral cooperation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been in discussion with Foreign Minister Anifah&nbsp;on the implementation of the Points of Agreement on Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad (KTMB) land and I am hopeful of a win-win outcome which will open up new areas of cooperation between the two sides.&nbsp; In particular, through the Joint Ministerial Committee, both sides have been discussing further cooperation in Iskandar Malaysia, including Singapore's investment in an iconic project and the possibility of linking the two urban rails together.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Support of the Johor ground is a necessary pre-condition.&nbsp; When Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew visited Johor Baru to pay his final respects to the late Sultan of Johor, the new Sultan, Sultan Ibrahim, expressed clearly his wish for stronger relations between Johor and Singapore.&nbsp; Our new consulate in Johor Baru is already busy with work.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Indonesia, the re-election of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono last year was good for bilateral relations.&nbsp; Prime Minister attended his inauguration in October and President Yudhoyono made a bilateral visit to Singapore the following month.&nbsp; Earlier in the year, I signed an agreement to de-limit the maritime boundary in the Western part of the Singapore Strait with Foreign Minister Hassan.&nbsp; Later this year, Prime Minister and President Yudhoyono will hold a retreat to review our bilateral relations and explore new areas of cooperation.&nbsp; As to whether the present challenges in Jakarta, <p align=left>Column: 3156</p>particularly on Bank Century, will affect our bilateral relations with Indonesia, I do not think so. But these challenges reflect a post-Soeharto, much more fragmented power structure in Indonesia which is a new reality we have to accept and work with.&nbsp; It means not only dealing with Ministers and leaders in Jakarta, but also with different branches of government, and with local governments at the provincial level, and at the level of the <I>kabupaten</I>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.00 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be a critical year for Myanmar.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

The present Government promises that the elections will be "free and fair".&nbsp; Critical to its legitimacy will be the spirit of national reconciliation among the many ethnic groups in the country and the participation of the National League of Democracy and other opposition parties.&nbsp; We know&nbsp;there are ongoing discussions between Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the generals, and hope that both sides will show flexibility and compromise.&nbsp; Singapore supports the ASEAN position calling for the release of&nbsp;Daw Aung San Suu Kyi&nbsp;and&nbsp;her participation in the coming elections.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is no reconciliation and the elections outcome is not seen as legitimate, especially by Myanmar's neighbours, then ASEAN will have a problem.&nbsp; At the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' retreat in Da Nang, we expressed our concerns and&nbsp;our hopes in no uncertain terms&nbsp;to the Myanmar Foreign Minister.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bilaterally, our relations with Myanmar are good.&nbsp; Myanmar Prime Minister&nbsp;Thein Sein made his introductory visit to Singapore in March&nbsp;last year&nbsp;and Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong visited Myanmar in June 2009 at the invitation of Prime <p align=left>Column: 3157</p>Minister Thein Sein,&nbsp;and in&nbsp;Nay Pyi Taw,&nbsp;he also met Senior General Than Shwe. &nbsp;Singapore continues to do our part in helping Myanmar build up its capacity.&nbsp; We have provided technical assistance through the Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP) and under the Initiative for ASEAN Integration.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Indranee Rajah, Dr Lam Pin Min and Mr Sin Boon Ann asked about relations with the US, China, India and Japan.&nbsp; Our links with the Obama Administration are very good.&nbsp; Our relations with the US have remained stable, positive and warm.&nbsp; There continues to be high-level exchanges between both sides.&nbsp;&nbsp;The slowdown in the US economy has not affected Singapore-US economic ties in a significant way.&nbsp; The strong economic relationship is underpinned by the Singapore-US Free Trade Agreement (FTA) which came into force in the year 2004.&nbsp; Although two-way trade fell from S$86 billion in 2008 to S$67 billion last year, the decline is consistent with the overall decline in global trade.&nbsp; The US remained our&nbsp;third largest trading partner in 2009, after Malaysia and China, and both Singapore and the US are also significant investors in each other's countries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Obama, together with several members of his Cabinet, visited Singapore for the APEC Leaders' Meeting in November last year.&nbsp; At the invitation of President Obama, the Prime Minister will be visiting the US in April to attend the Nuclear Security Summit.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite&nbsp;many preoccupations, the US has made efforts to re-engage ASEAN.&nbsp; President Obama's attendance at the first US-ASEAN Summit despite his concerns about Myanmar, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's regular attendance at ASEAN meetings have sent a strong signal which is appreciated throughout the <p align=left>Column: 3158</p>region.&nbsp; Later this month, President Obama will be making an official visit to Indonesia, where he spent a part of his childhood, and will have the opportunity to use his Bahasa.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of us in ASEAN know that we need a strong long-term US presence in the region for our continuing peace and development.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our bilateral relations with China are excellent, underscored by strong economic ties, regular exchange of visits by leaders on both sides and a high level of people-to-people exchanges.&nbsp; President Hu Jintao's first State Visit to Singapore last November has raised our bilateral relationship to a new level.&nbsp; Four MOUs were signed during the visit which included the establishment of a China Cultural Centre in Singapore and the loan of a pair of giant pandas.&nbsp; We also celebrated the 15th Anniversary of the Suzhou Industrial Park last May.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Over the years, we have steadily broadened and deepened our relations with China through various bilateral mechanisms like the Singapore-China Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, we announced a three-way collaboration involving the new Singapore University of Technology and Design, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Zhejiang University.&nbsp; We launched the China-Singapore Forum on Leadership Selection and Development, which is&nbsp;a new platform&nbsp;enabling political leaders and senior officials from both sides to exchange experiences and ideas on leadership development. We also established the Singapore-Guangdong Collaboration Council (SGCC) which will open new opportunities for our companies in the Pearl River Delta&nbsp;&ndash; one of the fastest growing regions in China.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year marks the 20th Anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations with China and it is&nbsp;a significant <p align=left>Column: 3159</p>milestone in our bilateral relationship.&nbsp; Both sides are jointly planning a series of commemorative activities to mark the occasion, and we look forward to the ground-breaking for the China Cultural Centre in Singapore.&nbsp; Singapore is also participating in the Shanghai World Expo.&nbsp; The Singapore Pavilion will showcase our "urban harmony"; an area where we have shared our experience with China over the years.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our bilateral relations with India are also excellent and multifaceted.&nbsp; All the major pillars of our bilateral relations&nbsp;&ndash; political, economic, defence and regional cooperation&nbsp;&ndash; have grown stronger.&nbsp; Institutional linkages have been established across several sectors at various levels and each side&nbsp;has become&nbsp;a significant investor in the other.&nbsp; Although bilateral trade declined with the global economic downturn last year, this is temporary.&nbsp; Defence and security exchanges have continued apace.&nbsp; In terms of people-to-people relations, tourist figures both ways remain healthy, and there have been frequent exchanges among scholars.&nbsp; Just yesterday, I was talking to Mr Iswaran&nbsp;about the new Integrated Resorts (IR) and how it will greatly increase&nbsp;the number of Indian tourists coming to Singapore.&nbsp; They are now talking about perhaps even&nbsp;two million tourists from India every year.&nbsp; We are now working on new areas of cooperation in education, culture and urban management.&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new DPJ Government has broken a long period of LDP rule, a point made by Dr Lam Pin Min, the full implications of which are still not clear.&nbsp; Regardless, we expect Singapore-Japan relations to remain strong as we share many common strategic interests.&nbsp; Bilateral relations have also broadened in recent years to include cooperation in various non-traditional areas such as defence, anti-piracy and export control.&nbsp; In fact, there is such an ease in relations that when Ministers and officials meet, we can discuss new areas <p align=left>Column: 3160</p>of cooperation.&nbsp; Last year, President Nathan made a State Visit following the successful visit of Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko to Singapore in 2006.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister&nbsp;also made a working visit to Japan last October.&nbsp;And the Prime Minister&nbsp;was one of the first foreign leaders to meet with the new Japanese Prime Minister.&nbsp; The Prime Minister's visit also set the stage for future cooperation in areas like green technology and ensuring a global free trade system through the APEC agenda.&nbsp; In addition, during Prime Minister Hatoyama's visit to Singapore last November to attend the APEC meeting, the Japan Creative Centre was launched by the Prime Minister and Prime Minister Hatoyama.&nbsp; And we hope that through this Centre, we can help Japan increase its soft power in the region.&nbsp; These visits and initiatives symbolise the close relationship between our two countries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Fatimah Lateef asked for an update of our Middle Eastern account.&nbsp; On the whole, it is growing nicely.&nbsp; In fact, from not very much six years ago, we now manage a sizeable portfolio, all the way from the Maghreb&nbsp;to Iran.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-oil domestic exports&nbsp;in the Middle East have doubled from about S$2 billion in 2003 to S$4 billion&nbsp;last year.&nbsp; Our direct investment in the Gulf countries has quadrupled from S$213 million in 2003 to S$850 million in 2008.&nbsp; Our companies have secured S$25.5 billion worth of projects in the Middle Eastern region in total.&nbsp; New projects in the Gulf include Sembcorp's S$1.5 billion project to build an integrated water and power plant in Salalah in Oman.&nbsp; And beyond the GCC, we have also made good progress in Libya where we secured projects worth some S$4.3 billion in the past two years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FDI from the GCC has also increased significantly, totalling S$2.3 billion last year.&nbsp; We&nbsp;hope to attract much more.&nbsp; The GCC has become a major economic <p align=left>Column: 3161</p>partner of Singapore and we hope, eventually, with ASEAN as a whole.&nbsp; Last year, the GCC countries were collectively Singapore's&nbsp;nineth largest trading partner comprising 5% of Singapore's total trade.&nbsp;

Only&nbsp;9% of Singaporeans lived in flats.&nbsp;Since then, the HDB has constructed and made available some 880,000 homes to Singaporeans. This was no happenstance. It was the result of a bold vision, meticulous planning and swift execution.</p><p align="left"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our achievements in public housing can be attributed to the strong Government support and financial commitment. HDB has subsidised, financed and housed an entire nation. In the last 10 years, from financial year 1999 to&nbsp;2008 alone, HDB <p align=left>Column: 3164</p>ran a total home ownership deficit of $7.3 billion. That means the sales revenue where it collects from selling the flats, fall short of its cost for land and construction by $7.3 billion in the last 10 years. HDB&nbsp;also carries a housing loan of $47 billion as of the end of last financial year and these are the amount that were used to finance HDB flat owners.</p><p align="left"><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When compared to public projects, say&nbsp;in Bronx, Manhattan or Hackney in East London or Mong Kok in Hong Kong, our public housing estates are envied by many.&nbsp;And it is not just about flats. It is our ability to provide every migrant family then, who had arrived here from many shores, a stake in the country&nbsp;&ndash; a reason for them to sink their roots here and call Singapore home. That is why while they were taken as scapegoats, we must continue to enable our new migrants,&nbsp;PRs, citizens,&nbsp;to own homes even if they had caused prices to creep up.</p><p align="left"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My plea to the critics of MND and HDB is a simple one.&nbsp;Let us see it in the right perspective. Put it in context and do not politicise the issues.</p><p align="left"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mission of the HDB is to provide affordable housing, but I believe that allowing HDB flat prices also to appreciate gradually over time, must also be one of its objectives and desired outcomes.&nbsp;In fact, what sets public housing in Singapore apart from public housing in the rest of the world is the "wealth creation effect" of HDB housing over the years.</p><p align="left"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider the converse&nbsp;&ndash; a&nbsp;crash in HDB prices, that&nbsp;will be a disaster!&nbsp;If we over-correct the current situation of a&nbsp;creeping up of prices and over-built right now, we run this risk of creating an even bigger problem.&nbsp;This is exactly what is happening in the US sub-prime market which has sparked off a world recession.&nbsp;So, broadly speaking, a gradually appreciating HDB flat is a good thing and we really do not want "falling prices".</p><p align="left"><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 3165</p>To achieve this objective though, we must do a better job at forecasting demand so as to match the supply accordingly. After all, prices are determined through&nbsp;supply and demand interactions.&nbsp;I recognise that this is not easy.&nbsp;For example, some of the factors contributing to the recent spike in resale HDB flats.&nbsp;Prices are high liquidity in the marketplace, very low interest rates and the lack of attractive alternative investments.&nbsp;These factors are very difficult to forecast, even sentiments. However, other factors like the number of couples getting married each year, number of new citizens and PRs expected and number of upgraders to bigger units etc. These&nbsp;could have been forecasted with reasonable confidence. If we do this well, we can avoid HDB flat price&nbsp;volatility and therefore maintain a reasonable Debt Service Ratio (DSR) so that first-timers can continue to afford HDB flats.</p><p align="left"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister about the past trend of new flat sale prices. Over the last 10 years, for each class of new HDB flats, are they sold at prices that have grown faster than the median household income?&nbsp;How has this debt service ratio changed over the last 10 years? How does it compare with DSRs in other developed cities? This will give us a sense of whether or not HDB flats continue to be affordable by Singaporeans.</p><p align="left"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More importantly, will the Minister assure prospective first-time buyers that new HDB flats that are coming on-stream will be priced at a level that will be within their reach and if need be, a higher subsidy (compared to resale market prices) will be provided so that the DSR will remain largely the same as in recent years?</p><p align="left"><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is another concern for buyers of&nbsp;new HDB flats;&nbsp;that, the time taken to obtain one is about&nbsp;three years.&nbsp;This is <p align=left>Column: 3166</p>considered too long.&nbsp;Could, for example, the Minister consider that the&nbsp;BTO threshold be lowered to, say, 40%-50% instead of 70% before construction can begin?&nbsp;Also, could the&nbsp;construction time be shortened by way of&nbsp;piling in advance of need or pre-fab fabrication construction&nbsp;methods that are faster, more productive in order to bring new flats to the market more speedily?&nbsp;I think this would&nbsp;allay a concern of many.&nbsp;In order to reduce the supply lead time, another method which may be worth considering by the Ministry, is to construct&nbsp;a "base load" of units under Build-to-Sell (BTS) scheme rather than Build-to-Order, in other words, you build ahead of demand, but only a base load.&nbsp;This base load&nbsp;could be determined, for example,&nbsp;by looking at past demand and drawing a line where it is a&nbsp;"safe level" of supply across the property cycle that will be met with demand without inundating the market.&nbsp;If you do that, this will become a ready stock for prospective HDB buyers. Then, the BTO scheme which is really constructing to demand, can&nbsp;then be layered-on to meet fluctuations of demand at each stage of the property cycle. I would like the Minister to consider whether this is viable.</p><p align="left"><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people consider the inability to afford the cash downpayments or cash-over valuations&nbsp;as an "affordability issue". I see this more of a financing issue and this leads me to my next cut.</p><p align="left"><br><I>Financing of HDB flats</I></p><p align="left"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, MND and MAS have reduced the Loan to Value (LTV) from 90% to 80% recently for all buyers &ndash;&nbsp;private properties&nbsp; as well&nbsp;as bank loans.&nbsp;I would like MND to consider allowing newly married couples under the age of say 32 years old, who are buying their first owner-occupied homes, to be able to obtain a higher LTV, of say, 90%-95% if they pass credit evaluation test.&nbsp; This is a group of buyers who has a genuine need for a first home and they are clearly not <p align=left>Column: 3167</p>speculators.&nbsp;Also, because they have many years of working career ahead of them, they could repay these loans better than older couples and their DSR will decline over time as most would enjoy some degree of salary increases.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other issue&nbsp;is&nbsp;COVs,&nbsp;this is the other&nbsp;"bugbear"&nbsp;which has been bothering many prospective buyers. In a rising property market, valuations of properties lag behind the prevailing prices, which is climbing day by day. If valuations were conducted "real-time",&nbsp;that can be done. Then they should reflect that prevailing transacted prices and logically there should not be a Cash-Over-Valuation. The reason that Cash-Over-Valuation has happened was because of the lack of the timing of valuation versus the market place happenings.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman:</B> You are running out of time, Mr Foo.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng:</B> So, I would like to know if HDB can improve the "price recovery mechanism" by disclosing transaction of past HDB resale flats prices more regularly.

Affordability is define by the dictionary as, "one is able to pay". However MND defined affordability&nbsp;as the amount of&nbsp;loan instalment for the flat as <p align=left>Column: 3168</p>not exceeding the 30% of the household income of&nbsp;a family. The Minister replied to a PQ in January 2010, using an&nbsp;example of a family with income of $4,000, and the family can easily afford to buy a flat costing $333,000 &ndash;&nbsp;using his 30% definition of affordability.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Minister assumes income is static over the loan period of 20 to 30 years. For young couples, one can expect the CPF income to increase. But for an upgrader, who is middle aged, one would expect the income to come down. Many would struggle to pay the loans when they are over 50&nbsp;or 60 years, when health and income decline. Cash-over-valuation is part of the affordability ratio, but this is not taken into account. The other concern of affordability is location pricing. Here, HDB has priced&nbsp;its flats according&nbsp;to location. However, we are talking about public housing, basic housing for the people. We know some of these flats at convenient locations, where parents stay are&nbsp;not affordable at all. HDB should also review its floor pricing. Many young couples complained that these&nbsp;are their first flats they are buying and they want to select the best flat. Floor pricing should deviate enough to attract young people to buy, instead of penalising these young people for not selecting these flats.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For supply of flats, HDB is only supplying flats in the future, using the BTO system. Flats&nbsp;are only available in three to four years, and not presently. That is clearly future supply and not current supply. Although in 1997, HDB has 31,000 excess flats. Now in 2010, there is zero or no ready flats available, except resale flats. HDB is really going to extreme measures for the supply of ready flats. I am pleading to HDB once again to build some ready flats for market demand. There are many buyers for ready flats in a year &ndash;&nbsp;those who want to get married and cannot&nbsp;wait for&nbsp;three to four years, those families that break up, growing families <p align=left>Column: 3169</p>may need to shift due to the need for bigger space and to be closer to&nbsp;schools, aged parents, need extra bed space due to medical reasons. Even the Minister stressed the fiance and fiancee scheme.&nbsp; To get to know the other party, it takes at least three years, before you can say, "hey, we can consider getting together". The couple then&nbsp;applies for BTO, and wait another four years. It takes a total of eight years.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Chairman:</B> I would like to appeal to Mdm Phua to finish your speech.

And the median Cash-Over-Valuation (COV) is $24,000 for the fourth quarter of 2009. For flats in the more mature estates, the COV is much&nbsp;higher.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not everyone who wishes to buy a HDB flat is in a position to wait approximately three years for BTO flat. In&nbsp; today's fast-paced environment in Singapore, citizens want to have choices and also speed. Many residents have expressed that they need a completed flat because they are ready to start a family, or that they want to have the personal space to build their relationship with their spouse. Not everyone has the luxury where they can stay with their parents <p align=left>Column: 3170</p>whilst waiting for BTO flat because their parents' flat may simply be too small.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even for BTO flats, unless you are a first-time buyer entitled to the CPF Housing grant, these new flats are not that affordable. Hence, people like divorcees, who have sold off their matrimonial flat would struggle with the purchase price for a BTO flat. Likewise, for citizens who have lost their jobs and needed to downgrade. After selling off their first HDB flat and paying off their mortgage loan and other debts, they too may have difficulties paying for a&nbsp;three- or four-room BTO flat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, may I ask the Minister what else can HDB do to manage the rising prices of HDB flats and to keep such flats affordable?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a start,&nbsp;may I suggest that HDB goes back to its&nbsp;objective which is to provide basic housing for the citizens of Singapore. May I ask the HDB to consider concentrating on building smaller flats like three- or&nbsp;four-room flats to cater to the group of lower-income citizens who simply need a basic home to live in. Provide a larger amount of housing subsidy to this group of citizens buying a smaller flat. If there is a need to build larger flats like five-room flats, HDB should&nbsp;consider increasing the minimum occupation period&nbsp;for these&nbsp;larger flats, from five years to maybe six or seven years. Buyers of such larger&nbsp;flats should buy them for their own long-term occupation. Price these new larger flats at a lower price because of the longer minimum occupation period. The reality is that the property market uses the selling price of new HDB flats as a base to set their prices.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>4.30 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, Sir, may I ask the HDB not to allow flats bought in the open market to be sold unless the flat owner has occupied the flat for a minimum of&nbsp;two <p align=left>Column: 3171</p>and a half&nbsp;or even three years.&nbsp; Revoke the policy which allows HDB flats to be sold within one year simply because they do not have any HDB loan for the flat or that they have not taken any housing grant from the Government. This is to deter speculation in HDB flats by the richer citizens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, leave the construction of Design&nbsp;&amp; Build flats like City View&nbsp;in Boon Keng or flats in prime locations like Pinnacle@Duxton to private developers.

How could HDB further tighten the huge drop-out rate? How long does it take for HDB to sell off all the remaining flats not taken up by the original applicants under the BTO programme?&nbsp; Are they to be sold at a higher price or lower than the original price?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister said the BTO programme will be intensified as per demand. Will the supply be able to meet the demand, given that Singapore's population is expected to increase by another one million to six million in another 10 years? Will the Minister be able to give us the total number of registered applicants, seeking to purchase flats from the HDB?&nbsp; The Minister has said the BTO system is the best way to address Singapore's housing needs. But in the face of pent-up demand for HDB flats on the ground, is it possible to re-implement the Build-to-Sell system? If there is no full U-turn, as indicated by Minister in his response to my Parliamentary Question in February, can there be a half U-turn?&nbsp;&nbsp; Will HDB immediately consider reducing the three-year waiting time under BTO to achieve better productivity for all, including young couples eagerly waiting to start a family?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the basic principle of affordable housing does not extend to fulfilling the aspirations of young families but the fact of the matter is that HDB can ill afford to ignore managing the growing expectations and aspirations of younger Singaporeans. This group will grow to form a significant cohort of HDB<br> dwellers in land scarce Singapore. Granted housing options are limited in mature estates with all their basic amenities, we should continue building more affordable Dawsons, Pinnacle or Sri Geylangs in pockets of land in mature estates. There is quite a bit of land available in a mature estate like Boon Lay. HDB could consider building<p align=left>Column: 3173</p> more Boon Lay Meadows.&nbsp; But please keep the prices within the reach of ordinary Singaporeans.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, high Cash-Over-Valuation (COV) is a dampener for many going the resale market route. The average COV in the first quarter of 2009 was $4,000.&nbsp; But in the fourth quarter 2009, it was $24,000, six times more than first quarter 2009.&nbsp; The COV is a cash hurdle for many young couples who are only eligible for 80% loan of the selling price. How does Minister intend to resolve the COV issue?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, although PRs constitute a mere 5% of households, the fact of the matter is that this percentage can have a significant impact on the limited supply in the HDB resale market. Should HDB consider extending the debarment period for resale of flats by PR dwellers, so as to minimise speculative tendencies by PR HDB owners?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, many private owners are buying resale flats. We cannot deny them their fundamental right to be a HDB flat owner. But there should be proper checks to ensure that they buy flats to stay and not to rent out so as not to deprive those who genuinely need to buy a resale HDB flat, in view of the limited supply.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Your time is up, Mdm Ho.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, the woes of families who are caught in financial&nbsp;quagmires&nbsp;due to housing issues has been widely publicised and discussed. While the HDB has helped home owners facing large arrears, such assistance often comes a little too late as these families have already landed in financial troubles. Some of these families face huge arrears because they bought flats that were beyond their means or experienced a <p align=left>Column: 3174</p>change in their circumstances that led to their inability to manage their loans. Then, there are those who sold off their flats in order to settle some debts and end up not being able to afford buying another flat, renting from the market or are unable to make any alternative housing arrangements.&nbsp;&nbsp;For buyers&nbsp;taking up HDB concessionary loans, they have to obtain a Housing Loan Eligibility (HLE) to ensure that they can afford the flat they are buying.&nbsp; Buyers taking up bank loans are given a letter of offer by the banks.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask if HDB could consider implementing further measures to ensure that home owners taking bank loans are not given offers that are beyond their means. Also, what measures are in place to assist families who have sold their flats and are unable to buy another flat?&nbsp; How can HDB further inculcate financial prudence in home buyers and sellers?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p align="center"><strong>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Matthias Yao Chih) in the Chair]</strong></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I> ):[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2010/20100305/20100305VS_171925.pdf"">Appendix A</a>*</I>] Currently, HDB allows buyers who did not take loans from HDB to sell their flats on the open market within a year of purchase, without any conditions.

To <p align=left>Column: 3175</p>differentiate the housing benefits between PRs and citizens, I have the following&nbsp;two suggestions:</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, HDB should restrict PRs such that they can only buy&nbsp;resale flats once&nbsp;from the open market.

As demand increases, the price will rise at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some low-income families already feel that HDB flats are beyond their means. To help this group, I suggest to sell them the flats with a shortened lease of 60 years. This will lower the price of the flat and provide another option for our people, so that every Singaporean will be able to have a flat that is within his means.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr width="50%">*Cols. 3255-3256.<BR></div></P></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang):</B> Sir,&nbsp;at the recent HDB 50th Anniversary celebration, Prime Minister&nbsp;announced that HDB will be building its&nbsp;one millionth flat soon and reiterated HDB's commitment to provide Singaporeans with affordable housing.&nbsp; Our current Singapore resident population is 3.58 million (ie, Singaporean and Permanent residents). Assuming 80%&nbsp; (2.87 million) resides in HDB flats, each HDB dwelling unit is housing only an average of 2.87 persons. What is the target number of flats HDB will build for Singapore residents and what is the target person per dwelling unit?&nbsp; Will there be a glut in the near future if we continue to build more flats?&nbsp; Is there really a shortage of flats for Singapore residents?<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB's pace of building will have to slow down and prospective flat buyers will have to buy available resale flats in the open market. However, the current Cash-over-Valuation (COV) is a significant barrier to many new home buyers despite of&nbsp;generous Government grants. Hence, most prefer to wait for HDB new flats and laments on the lack of new flats.&nbsp; I <p align=left>Column: 3176</p>suggest MND review the COV system. As the name implies, to sellers, it is cash OVER valuation and not UNDER valuation, although there are brief periods where COV was negative. COV represents an inefficient market valuation system that lags behind the real-time home prices. In a perfect system, the COV should be zero or close to zero.&nbsp;&nbsp;How often does HDB update the valuation? And how many months does the valuation lag behind the market?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there&nbsp;are enough flats for Singapore residents, then what are the causes of high HDB resale prices?&nbsp; I understand many HDB home owners do not stay in their flats but choose to rent out their flats due to high rental yields. Many of these flat owners now are currently staying in private properties. There&nbsp;was even a&nbsp;recent newspaper report that featured a landed property owner who bought a resale HDB flat and sold it at a decent profit even without&nbsp;physically staying in the flat at all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB flats should be homes for Singapore residents. Except for the retired elderly, HDB flats should not be rented out to foreigners for rental income. For Singapore residents who have done well and upgraded to private properties, they should not be allowed to keep their HDB flats for rental yields. They should release their flats so prospective new home buyers will have sufficient supply. I urge HDB to do a thorough review on HDB ownership and rental and keep to the commitment to provide Singaporeans with affordable housing.<br></p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Home Ownership</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</B> Sir, my parents bought their first and only HDB flat in 1976 for $30,000.&nbsp; It was the first house they ever owned.&nbsp; It helped them raise nine children in a stable home. My parents passed on some years ago but the house remains with my family.&nbsp; Most <p align=left>Column: 3177</p>of us had got married and moved out but our old flat would always be home to us.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All over Singapore, there are countless similar stories.&nbsp; The houses HDB built improved the lives of the majority of Singaporeans. They provided us with a good home and financial security.&nbsp; Most importantly, it gave us a stake in this great nation of ours.&nbsp; It also allowed the Government to promote national policies such as racial integration and even marriage.&nbsp; But the HDB's success, with their current success, there is also some disquiet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the complaints we have read and heard about&nbsp;&ndash; high prices, unavailability of flats&nbsp;&ndash; are politically driven&nbsp;&ndash; but some,&nbsp;not all.&nbsp; The important question is whether the current situation continues to promote our national policies.&nbsp; If a couple puts off marriage because their flat will only be ready in three years and they cannot afford a resale flat, how does that help them and how does it help Singapore?&nbsp; How does it help integration if different ethnic groups are allowed to congregate by renting flats near each other?&nbsp; And would my parents have been able to buy a flat and raise a family today?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not asking HDB to re-write its policies. There is no need to.&nbsp; But I do urge the HDB to implement rules which encourage home ownership and not property ownership.&nbsp; It should significantly advantage first-time owners and have no room for those who wish to speculate or invest in it.&nbsp; I have four suggestions to make this happen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; First, let us start with the policy principle. Let any Singaporean who wants to buy a HDB flat do so.&nbsp; Lift or do away with the salary cap.&nbsp; Those who earn high salaries will probably buy private properties anyway.&nbsp; But that may be high <p align=left>Column: 3178</p>earners who, for various good reasons, wish to start off with an HDB flat. They may want to be financially prudent and we should encourage them. They may have other commitments like raising aged parents and children and we should recognise that.&nbsp; If they wish to live in public housing, let them.&nbsp; But the right to buy public housing must come with restrictions. That is only fair. We should therefore disallow individuals who own private properties from purchasing HDB flats including resale flats.&nbsp; Why should an individual be allowed to live in an HDB property and get rental income from a private house and vice-versa?&nbsp; Those who have the means and wish to buy or invest in private properties should not take public housing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the HDB should maintain a small but ready stock of flats reserved for first-time owners so that those who wish to get married may get a flat more quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, there should be more control over subletting of HDB flats. Currently, there is very little control and that goes against racial integration.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, there should be an increase in the time bar before an HDB flat bought in the resale market can be sold. It currently stands at one year.&nbsp; The one-year bar encourages speculation. The point is not whether the unit is bought with a subsidy or concessionary loan.&nbsp; Public housing is public housing &ndash;&nbsp;whether it is new or resale. They should all be treated alike.&nbsp; Resale flats give the buyer more choices in terms of location and immediate availability and he pays a premium for that.&nbsp; There should be no other difference or advantage. I ask the HDB to make it five years, just like new flats.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, just a couple of points on private properties.&nbsp; For private properties, market forces should be the prime driver.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 3179</p>Although I appreciate the Government has to, from time to time, step in to implement temporary measures to address bubbles, but there are two things I would like the Government to consider doing on a permanent basis. First, we should discourage foreigners from speculating in our property market. I have no difficulties with genuine investors.&nbsp; It is the flippers that we should target. How do we benefit from their activities?&nbsp; I therefore ask the Government to impose a capital gains tax on foreigners who sell their properties within, say, three years of purchase.&nbsp; Second, we need to address the issue of option flipping.&nbsp; Buying and selling options&nbsp;are purely speculative activities.&nbsp;They add absolutely no value and only serve to drive up prices.&nbsp; I urge the Government then to make options non-transferrable or impose a tax and profits scheme on transfer.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Nevertheless, I am pleased to note that HDB is taking proactive steps in ensuring that there is no room for speculation in public housing by emphasising that HDB flats are meant as roofs above our heads.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, will MND&nbsp;be able to share with us some rules and regulations that are being studied to curb speculative behaviour of public housing?&nbsp; Among others, I have proposed in my Budget speech to revert to the old scheme where CPF gets priority over banks for sales proceeds and to lock in sales gains at least for some sector of our population.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My reason for asking is that, while I acknowledge that the resale market <p align=left>Column: 3180</p>should be allowed to operate on the basis of a free market&nbsp;&ndash; with prices set on a "willing buyer, willing seller" basis &ndash;&nbsp;we need to ensure that whatever actions we take will not affect adversely certain quarters of HDB dwellers, especially those of the lower income, whose assets are largely vested in their HDB homes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At one end, citizens would be able to gain from the capital appreciation of their HDB flats especially when downgrading to smaller units when most of their children have their own home and use the net sales proceeds for retirement.&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, it is imperative for us to know whether the concrete steps to curb speculative activity of HDB flats that MND is currently mulling, could result in less-than-desired outcomes and affect citizens' aspirations to unlock the value of their flats when they reach retirement age.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, on the other hand, these assets can pass on to cash-rich PRs and private property&nbsp;owners&nbsp;&ndash; Singaporeans included&nbsp;&ndash; who are also allowed to purchase HDB flats and can turn them into investment vehicles, to primarily earn rental income rather than to live in them.&nbsp; This only creates an artificial upward rise of HDB resale flat prices and jeopardise other sections of citizens who are in genuine need to buy HDB flats.&nbsp; To address this, a system of effective checks and balances to weed out speculators is paramount.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issue of owner-occupation of HDB flats, some residents whom I met during the Meet-the-People sessions explained that they cannot afford to buy resale flats or&nbsp;rent&nbsp;flats in the open market owing to the eligibility criteria that they do not meet, and, of course, affordability issues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to admit that this group of residents are usually in the low-income bracket,&nbsp;sometimes unemployed for a&nbsp;long time and usually&nbsp;is saddled with <p align=left>Column: 3181</p>difficulties in financing their bills like utilities and monthly mortgage payments.&nbsp; Hence, one of the practical ways to address their problems is through the sale of their HDB flats.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, when they do this, the task of getting a smaller flat for their families becomes onerous&nbsp;&ndash; no thanks to the increased prices of HDB resale flats.&nbsp; As the HDB flats in the resale market are out of their reach, renting of rooms or flats is equally challenging given the high monthly rents quoted by the lessees.&nbsp; They&nbsp;often wonder and ask if their challenges are attributed to the practice of some flat lessees subletting their flats out illegally.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, can the Minister cite some cases of HDB flat owners who contravene the rules and regulations stipulated of subletting their flats out illegally and the actions HDB has taken to address this?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Public housing has always been a hot topic, but it is especially hot this year as can be seen by the exceptionally high number of cuts for MND, particularly for housing this year.&nbsp; But I just want to say that I appreciate Members raising these concerns because these are the concerns that people have on the ground and I thank them for this opportunity to respond.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Cedric Foo reminded us just now, HDB celebrates its 50th Anniversary this year.&nbsp; It has been an outstanding half century for HDB. Recently, the international&nbsp;news service, AFP, described HDB as a powerful agency whose projects have taken Singaporeans out of the slums and ghettos&nbsp;that once blighted the island <p align=left>Column: 3182</p>and into multi-storey apartment buildings surrounded by shops, markets, banks, transport links and other essentials.&nbsp;&nbsp;International news agencies are not usually prone to writing good things about Singapore.&nbsp; So I thought this was particularly relevant.&nbsp; The UN and the World Bank have also commended our success in achieving quality&nbsp;public housing but, as Mr Hri Kumar noted just now, with success comes new challenges.&nbsp; And what is the challenge for HDB?&nbsp; Having to house over 80% of the population.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not 10%, not 20%, not even 50%&nbsp;&ndash; as&nbsp;in Hong Kong, which is the next highest.&nbsp; 80%&nbsp;of the population means that HDB has to cater to a very broad spectrum of flat applicants, from the low income to the high income.&nbsp; And we are talking about the upper middle-income households.&nbsp; From the young couples, first timer couples, to the elderly, and to the upgraders.&nbsp; From singles to new immigrants and to others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So our housing policies will have to cater to the demands of all these groups, not just one particular group.&nbsp; And that is why we cannot just build the standard flats of the 1960s or the&nbsp;3-room flats or 4-room flats only, as suggested by the Member, Mr Lim Biow Chuan just now.&nbsp; We need a wide variety of housing to meet the diverse aspirations.&nbsp; From the BTO flats to the DBSS (Design, Build and Sell) flats to the Executive Condominiums, with different features, different sizes and&nbsp;different locations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through our home ownership policies, growing up in HDB flats is a common Singapore experience for many of us and Mr Hri Kumar's story of his family home that was bought in 1976 is one that I think&nbsp;many of us in one way or another are familiar with.&nbsp; Take my own story.&nbsp; When I was young, I lived in various places with my mother, who was a domestic servant. I lost my father when I was three years old, so we moved around a lot.&nbsp; We stayed in&nbsp;a kampong&nbsp;in Lorong <p align=left>Column: 3183</p>Ah Soo, which today&nbsp;has become&nbsp;HDB flats in Mdm Cynthia Phua&rsquo;s constituency.&nbsp; Every time I go to visit the flats there, I still remember where that kampong house was.&nbsp; Then we moved to a shophouse in High Street.&nbsp; My mum was working for a&nbsp;High Street merchant at that time.&nbsp; Today, that is where MTI and MOF are.&nbsp; Then we moved to&nbsp;a room in Bugis Street.&nbsp; Today, it is&nbsp;Bugis Junction. There were 10 of us living in that room. We had one bed which slept five. Then we raised the bed, put it on stilts, so that another&nbsp;five of us&nbsp;could sleep underneath. So 10 of us in that room.&nbsp; Then, I moved to Kim Keat Avenue with my aunt and her family &ndash; eight of us in a 3-room flat, sharing one toilet and bathroom.&nbsp; My mother stayed in a 1-room rental flat in Whampoa Road. Later, we upgraded to a 4-room flat in Toa Payoh. Recently, my aunt who passed away, left the flat to the cousin.&nbsp; The cousin sold the 4-room&nbsp;flat, and moved to a studio apartment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is&nbsp;a typical Singapore story for my generation. Start in a modest flat, work hard, accumulate savings,&nbsp;upgrade.&nbsp; Then if you&nbsp;need to,&nbsp;right size to a smaller flat.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But times have changed. Our rapid progress has brought a new generation of HDB flat buyers who start from a different baseline. It is no longer a rental flat or a kampong house.&nbsp; Most probably a 3-, 4- or 5-room flat, or even a landed&nbsp;property.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The challenges we are tackling in public housing today&nbsp;is not&nbsp;just about providing a basic simple roof over the head, but also about meeting these rising expectations.&nbsp; Some Singaporeans&nbsp;worry that&nbsp;their children&nbsp;would not be able to afford their own homes. These are the concerns that Members have reflected in this House.&nbsp; I understand these concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope in the next&nbsp;30 minutes or so,&nbsp;to allay some of these concerns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me start off by addressing the issue of adequacy of housing supply.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr <p align=left>Column: 3184</p>Cedric&nbsp;Foo and Mdm Cynthia Phua both commented on this.&nbsp; I want to start by giving a very categorical assurance to all Singaporeans, especially young couples buying their homes&nbsp;&ndash; their first homes&nbsp;&ndash; that the Government is committed to helping you. We will provide enough new flats&nbsp;to meet demand.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the height of the last boom, that is, between 2006&nbsp;and 2008, HDB offered a total of 36,400 new flats, or an average of about 12,000 flats per year. The actual take-up was&nbsp;10,400&nbsp;flats per year on average.&nbsp; In other words, there were&nbsp;1,000 to 2,000 new flats&nbsp;left unsold every year.&nbsp;And this is at a time when everybody&nbsp;is saying that there are not enough flats.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the unsold flats that we are able to&nbsp;offer for sale in the Sale of Balance Flats exercise every year.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 2009, we started conservatively with a smaller planned supply of 6,000 BTO flats.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because when we started in January 2009, some people thought that the world&nbsp;was going to collapse.&nbsp; Economies were in disarray, governments all over the world were coming up with very huge rescue packages.&nbsp; Singapore was not spared.&nbsp; Under those circumstances, we decided, "Let us continue to build but build 6,000 flats."&nbsp; But in the second half of last year, 2009, sentiments improved sharply, against all expectations.&nbsp; What did we do?&nbsp; We responded swiftly by increasing BTO supply to 9,000 units and then together with the DBSS and&nbsp;the surplus flats that we had over the previous few years, we offered 13,500 new flats&nbsp;in 2009. Again, not all of them were taken up, and I will explain later.&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 2010, we will provide 12,000 new BTO flats or more if there is demand. This is a substantial number.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to give you an idea of what this means.&nbsp; Clementi and Jurong East &ndash; each&nbsp;town has about 23,000 flats.&nbsp; So at the rate we are building, we are going to build another Clementi or <p align=left>Column: 3185</p>another Jurong East in two years' time.&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB will launch at least one BTO project each month for the next few months. In addition, they will be launching new&nbsp;EC sites and also&nbsp;new DBSS sites for sale. So for&nbsp;2010, I expect that the total flat supply&nbsp;will be in excess of 12,000.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, flat buyers really need not fear that there are not enough flats.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are flats that will be built in various locations, spread out throughout Singapore &ndash; be it Sembawang, Punggol, and if you look at Chart 2*, you will see them in&nbsp;Sengkang, Yishun, Woodlands, etc. And when we&nbsp;fully&nbsp;build up Punggol, we can consider&nbsp;opening up&nbsp;new areas such as Tengah and Simpang which are the areas marked in yellow on the map.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So why this perception that there are not enough flats?&nbsp; Perhaps it is because of the high application rates for recent BTO launches&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;three times,&nbsp;four times, five, even&nbsp;six times of the flat supply. But these high application rates do not reflect the true demand for flats and I will explain why.&nbsp; First of all, about one-quarter, 22% of the applications for the BTO projects in the last&nbsp;four months&nbsp;are repeat applications.&nbsp; In other words, they apply every month and that is quite all right because we have BTOs every month.&nbsp; Second, and more importantly, I believe that not all applicants are in urgent need of a flat.&nbsp;&nbsp;The true test of the demand is not when they apply for&nbsp;the flat, but when they actually book&nbsp;the flat.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr width="50%">*Cols. 3247-3248.<BR></div></P></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>5.00 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;difference between actual booking and invitation to apply is called the drop-out rate.&nbsp; HDB monitors the drop-out rates for BTO flats.

Take the most recent BTO project that <p align=left>Column: 3186</p>completed selection &ndash; Fernvale Palms. When Fernvale Palms was launched in October 2009, the application rate was&nbsp;four times the flat supply.&nbsp; But if you look&nbsp;at Chart 3*,&nbsp;by the end of the selection exercise just this week, 44% of first-timers who were invited to select a flat did not do so.&nbsp; They were given the chance, they went, they saw, they said, "No.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I don't want it."&nbsp; Even when all the flats were available on the first day, 34% of applicants gave up their chance to select a flat.&nbsp; They had all the flats to choose from and one-third of them said, "No, thanks."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results were similar for the most recent selection exercise which has completed first-day selection for all flat types, which is at Boon Lay Meadows. One-third of the applicants dropped out on the first day. This is quite consistent in all the recent BTO launches.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When asked for their reasons, the applicants told us that their choice units were taken, or they were considering other housing options&nbsp;&ndash; whatever that means.&nbsp; I can only conclude that these applicants were not in urgent need of a flat and preferred to wait for their choice flat. Unfortunately, they do drive up the application rates, and they do&nbsp;create this heightened sense of&nbsp;anxiety.&nbsp; So when you see headlines about four or five times over-subscription, understandably people get concerned.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that greater clarity about the situation will help to allay some of these concerns.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have also received appeals from MPs and the public who tell me that they cannot get a flat, despite many attempts.&nbsp; I am sure&nbsp;many Members of this House would have heard similar stories in their MPS. &nbsp;I ask HDB to review all these cases carefully to ensure that our commitment to our first-timer Singaporeans is met. In the last&nbsp;six months, we received 477 such appeals.&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-nine&nbsp;cases or 6% of these applicants genuinely did not have <p align=left>Column: 3187</p>a chance to choose a flat in at least two BTO exercises in non-mature estates. We will figure out how to give them more&nbsp;tickets, so that their chances of getting a flat will be much higher.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest of the appellants were either only interested in flats in the mature estates, which were in short supply, or they had given up one or more chances to select a flat.&nbsp; Let me share a recent case with you.&nbsp; Mr C wrote to me complaining about his lack of success in getting a flat after several tries. HDB checked and found that he had indeed submitted&nbsp;four flat applications, one of which was for a BTO flat in a non-mature estate, the other three were not so.&nbsp; What was even more astonishing was that he had actually been offered flats on&nbsp;three occasions, but he rejected them all. When HDB pointed this out to him, he replied, and I quote:&nbsp;" ... you are right, however, those we are asked to select is not of our choice. So how would one want to proceed when choice units we would like to select is taken?"</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was puzzled, so I asked HDB to find out what does he&nbsp;mean by "choice units"?&nbsp; Chart 5*&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;his first chance was in February 2009, there were 121 flats in Punggol and Sengkang available for his selection. He turned all of them&nbsp;down because he was, and I quote: "targeting the unit in Buangkok which is just opposite to where I am putting up."&nbsp; So he wanted only a flat opposite to where he is currently staying with his parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 2009, he was offered BTO flats in Punggol, which he also rejected, despite having 143 units to choose from,&nbsp;virtually the whole of that&nbsp;project to choose from.&nbsp; His reason was that "the units that are left are those facing the mosque." But HDB tells me that there were actually 118 units remaining that were not facing the mosque.&nbsp; On his third chance in July 2009, there were 14 units available for his selection, in Serangoon, Yishun, Ang Mo Kio, Tampines and Woodlands. Again,<p align=left>Column: 3188</p> he rejected his chance to select, because these were not his "choice" flats. Within a span of&nbsp;six months, he rejected&nbsp;three chances to select a flat, when there were many flats available for his selection.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;I can understand flat buyers wanting to get the best flat available, if they can. After all, buying a flat is a major investment. However, they also have to be realistic. The Government is committed to helping Singaporeans own their first homes. But it is not possible to promise every applicant who buys direct from HDB his "choice" flat, at the floor of his choice; at the place of his choice; at the time of his choice; and at the price that he wants. Our land is limited, especially in the mature estates.&nbsp; So is our housing budget, generous as it is.&nbsp; Buyers have to decide on the tradeoffs they want to make&nbsp;&ndash; whether they should keep on trying for their "choice" flat, and delay setting up their home, or to settle first for one that is within their budget and move to a better flat&nbsp;when they have built up their finances.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, 10,228 Singaporean families bought new flats, of which&nbsp;8,200 were first-timers. 3,500 of these first-timers bought their flats under the Fiance/Fiancee scheme. They should be able to move into their new homes soon after they get married.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me address some of the other questions that Members have raised, for example, the issue of lead time&nbsp;&ndash; whether&nbsp;the lead time for the supply of new flats can be shortened.&nbsp; As I have explained in this House earlier, it is better for building plans to be based on real demand as shown by the booking of flats. Because if we build ahead of demand, we would end up with a large stock of unsold flats if that demand disappears, which it can.&nbsp; The only way to assure ourselves that this demand is real is when they actually book these flats.&nbsp;&nbsp; By the same token, if we were to pile in advance, we could also <p align=left>Column: 3189</p>end up with idle sites with a lot of piles in the ground.&nbsp; I think that is going to be an even more unsightly and unwelcome experience for our residents.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I would take up the Member's suggestion&nbsp;to see whether we can&nbsp;reduce the hurdle rate for new BTOs in order to build&nbsp;up some buffer flats.&nbsp; There is already a buffer&nbsp;stock in existence today.&nbsp; This is because we do not wait until it is 100% subscription rate before we start a BTO project.&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, we start between&nbsp;60%&nbsp;and 70%.&nbsp; So, if we reduce that further to 50%, that, in essence, builds up a buffer stock along the lines that the Member suggested.&nbsp; And it is because of this&nbsp;that we are able to offer every year, or thereabouts, a stock of flats that are either ready to move in or almost ready to move in.&nbsp; But that cannot be our mainstay, because if that was our mainstay, then we are&nbsp;going back to the time when we tried to anticipate the demand, and we built a large stock. Obviously, when these flats are put up for sale, because they are near completion or because they are in mature estates, the&nbsp;subscription rates for them are&nbsp;much&nbsp;higher than the four, five times that I talked about.&nbsp; So we have to have both the BTO as well as the&nbsp;balance flats for sale as part of our overall sales programme.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three years to get a BTO flat &ndash; is that unreasonable?&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, we can shorten it further, as I said,&nbsp;by moving the subscription rate down from 70% to less, and we will examine that.&nbsp;But&nbsp;three years is probably the fastest time frame if you add in the lead time for all the other things to build an average development.&nbsp; Some of the developments can be built&nbsp;faster &ndash; the smaller ones, the simpler ones&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;and some of them will probably need more time.&nbsp; But, on average, I submit that&nbsp;three years is a reasonable time for somebody to wait for a flat because it is a significant decision in life, whether you <p align=left>Column: 3190</p>are planning for marriage or whether you are buying a flat.&nbsp; It is a very major decision, and it is not something that you do not plan for.&nbsp; Yes, we can shorten it further.&nbsp; But it is not possible nor&nbsp;is&nbsp;it a good idea&nbsp;to have a situation where flats are available straightaway, the moment somebody wants it or flats that are available on the shelf waiting for somebody to&nbsp;walk in and book.&nbsp; Of course, for those who cannot wait, there is the resale market.&nbsp; But, as we all know, the resale market fetches a premium in the form of higher Cash-Over-Valuation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now move on to this other hot topic of affordability, a topic which many Members have spoken about&nbsp;&ndash; Mdm&nbsp;Ho Geok Choo,&nbsp;Mr Lim Biow Chuan, Mr Ang Mong Seng, among others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;my assurance again to all Singaporeans is that we will provide sufficient flats that are priced within their reach.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of affordability, there is already a&nbsp;very generous housing subsidy framework&nbsp;in place, and this housing subsidy framework is skewed towards the lower-income group. In other words, we give more to those who need the subsidy more.&nbsp; We have a basic&nbsp;CPF Housing Grant of $30,000 or $40,000. On top of that, we have the Additional Housing Grant (AHG) which was introduced in 2006.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that we enhanced the AHG for a second time last year, extending it to those earning up to $5,000, increasing the maximum grant to $40,000. As at 31st January this year, we have disbursed a total of $330 million in AHG alone, which is a very significant sum.&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty thousand families have benefited from&nbsp;AHG. Last year, 9,400 families received $176 million in AHG.&nbsp; So this is a very significant additional help given especially to the lower-income to buy their first HDB flats.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we measure affordability? There are many suggestions and articles <p align=left>Column: 3191</p>written about affordability.&nbsp; What does affordability mean?&nbsp; Many Members here have also expressed their own views about affordability.&nbsp; One generally accepted way is to compare the&nbsp;house price&nbsp;with the income.&nbsp; So if you compare, say,&nbsp;the median house price to the median&nbsp;annual household income, you end up with a housing price-to-income ratio.&nbsp; That is one way of measurement.&nbsp; I am not suggesting that this is the ideal way.&nbsp; But I am just mentioning it as one way.&nbsp; If you take that as one measure, how does Singapore fare?&nbsp; Our house price-to-income ratio&nbsp;is 5.8; in other words, for the price of the house, it takes about 5.8 years to buy one house.&nbsp; In Hong Kong, the corresponding figure is 19.8, it takes you 19.8 years to buy an average house; in London, 7.1.&nbsp; I stress again this is not the only way of measuring affordability.&nbsp; This is a very rough ballpark rule&nbsp;of measuring affordability across disparate cities. &nbsp;Another well-established and a more commonly used benchmark of housing affordability is how much of&nbsp;your household&nbsp;income is spent on your&nbsp;mortgage loan to service&nbsp;your housing mortgage.&nbsp; This is what is known as&nbsp;the Debt-Service Ratio (DSR), which Mr Cedric Foo&nbsp;talked about just now.&nbsp; Generally, financial planners&nbsp;recommend that households should have a DSR of less than 30% or 35%, as a benchmark of affordability.&nbsp;</p></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>5.15 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of new HDB flats in non-mature estates, the average mortgage payment for new flats in non-mature estates sold in 2009 was 22% of monthly household income.&nbsp; In other words, our average DSR for last year was 22%.&nbsp; How has it moved over the last decade?&nbsp; The levels in the last decade hovered between 20%&nbsp;and 21%.&nbsp; So, we have moved from about 20% to 22%, still well within the affordability benchmark of 30% to 35%.&nbsp; In Singapore's case, this 22% figure means that 80% of Singaporean <p align=left>Column: 3192</p>new flat buyers are able to service their housing loans completely through their CPF Ordinary Account without any cash payment because the CPF Ordinary Account is 23% of their salaries.&nbsp; Eighty percent of Singaporeans do not use any cash or any of their take-home pay to service their HDB mortgage loans.&nbsp; I think this is a very significant fact and that is a very real measure of affordability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me walk the House through an actual example of a couple.&nbsp; If you look at Chart 6*, this is Mr and Mrs S.&nbsp; They have a monthly income of $4,500.&nbsp; They bought a new 4-room flat in Punggol, priced at $297,900.&nbsp; I quoted this example because I met the couple when I went to HDB to visit the sales counter.&nbsp; They received $10,000 in AHG to offset the price of the flat, so they took a loan of $268,100.&nbsp; This is the 90% loan from HDB at concessionary rate.&nbsp; The monthly instalment came up to $1,073, 24% of their income.&nbsp; They used $1,035 from their CPF to service the instalment and paid $38 in cash.&nbsp; So he belongs to the 20% who had to use some cash to pay for&nbsp;their mortgage loan, but he paid $38.&nbsp; So this, basically, leaves him with the bulk of his take-home pay for other expenses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to stress one other point, and that is, when I talk about housing affordability, it is also about how people make choices.&nbsp; I mentioned earlier that HDB builds a wide variety of flats&nbsp;&ndash; different sizes, different locations, different designs, different features, etc&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;from basic 2-room flat in Yishun to the Pinnacle.&nbsp; Why we do this?&nbsp; It is because we need to cater for&nbsp;this wide variety of&nbsp;buyers who come to us with different aspirations and different budgets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I just want to assure Mr Lim Biow Chuan that we will continue to build&nbsp;basic flats.&nbsp; Indeed, the bulk of our flats&nbsp;is actually 2-room, 3-room and 4-room flats.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3193</p> But, surprisingly, the ones that are in the greatest demand, ie, the ones where the queue is the longest, are the larger flats&nbsp;&ndash; the 4-room and&nbsp;5-room flats.&nbsp; The 2-room flats, in fact,&nbsp;are undersubscribed.&nbsp; So, any of your residents who want to buy a 2-room flat, can come and see me, and we will give them a flat straightaway.&nbsp; For 3-room flats, similarly, it is&nbsp;just barely even.&nbsp; But the 4-room and&nbsp;5-room flats,&nbsp;especially, are in the greatest demand.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you come to&nbsp;developments, like the Pinnacle and Dawson there is a&nbsp;huge demand.&nbsp; Very high prices but huge demand.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because it represents the greatest value for money.&nbsp; So, we have to build basic flats and we will continue to build basic flats, but we will also need to build some of the more premium flats,&nbsp;the better designed flats and the DBSS flats.&nbsp; They will not represent the bulk because it constitutes&nbsp;only 10% of the flat supply and they are indeed built by the private developers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I talk about affordability, I am also talking about buying a flat that is within your means.&nbsp; Buyers must exercise financial prudence.&nbsp; They must carefully consider what they can afford, taking into account their income and other commitments.&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at Mr and Mrs S, the couple I mentioned earlier, who bought&nbsp;a flat at Punggol with&nbsp;a monthly income of $4,500.&nbsp; If they did not buy the new 4-room flat in Punggol, they could have chosen from other BTOs or any of the resale flats: a&nbsp;3-room flat, smaller but better location, in Bukit Merah&nbsp;at&nbsp;$300,000; a 4-room flat in Yishun, which is slightly cheaper; or a&nbsp;5-room flat in Jurong West, a bigger flat at&nbsp;$370,000.&nbsp; So there&nbsp;are choices&nbsp;&ndash; new flats, resale flats, different locations, different sizes,&nbsp;but there are tradeoffs to be made and this is the decision that every flat buyer has to make.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ahmad Magad and Mdm Ho&nbsp;Geok Choo asked about families in difficulty.&nbsp; I <p align=left>Column: 3194</p>think we all know that these are families who have over-stretched themselves.&nbsp; They have bought flats which are bigger than they could have afforded or they have run into financial difficulty in the course of servicing their loans.&nbsp; HDB helps them in many ways&nbsp;&ndash; reducing their loans, deferring their loan instalments; in some cases, even offering them another loan to right-size their housing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Cedric Foo and others have been asking whether we can provide loans for those who wanted to downgrade.&nbsp; Some MPs also gave me feedback that by providing that second concessionary loan to households only for upgrading, it may inadvertently drive them to upgrade even though it may be prudent for them not to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also personally come across cases&nbsp;where in trying to get a second loan so that they can cash out of their flat&nbsp;&ndash; because they cannot get a loan when they downgrade&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;they say they will upgrade, which is not a very wise decision&nbsp;&ndash; But given the circumstances, they thought that it was the right thing to do at that time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we are now seeing a situation of greater economic volatility where&nbsp;the flexibility to right-size&nbsp;becomes more&nbsp;important and we need to maintain that flexibility.&nbsp; Therefore, I have decided to remove this upgrading condition for the second concessionary loan.&nbsp; What this means is that in future, both upgraders as well as&nbsp;those who downsize will be eligible for the second HDB loan,&nbsp;with the focus on helping families to right-size their housing choices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I know many Members have been pressing for this for a long time.&nbsp; I hope that their residents will also take that second loan carefully and cautiously.&nbsp; But just in case they do not, to further&nbsp;encourage financial prudence, HDB will reduce the second concessionary loan quantum&nbsp;&ndash; by the full CPF balance, and <p align=left>Column: 3195</p>half of the cash proceeds from the sale of the first flat.&nbsp; The household will get to retain at least $25,000 in cash proceeds, and this will give them some cash in hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me illustrate what this means.&nbsp; Look at Chart 8*.&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;if a couple sell their flat and receive $60,000 in CPF refund and they had $80,000 in cash proceeds, they will need to use their full CPF refund of $60,000 and half of their cash proceeds, in other words,&nbsp;$40,000, to pay for their next flat.&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB would&nbsp;grant them a loan, which is $100,000 less than what they would have got.&nbsp; In this case, the household would retain $40,000 in cash proceeds for their use.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the changes to the second concessionary loan will help Singaporeans right-size to a home that they can sustain over the long term. It will help homebuyers manage their finances for their flat purchases upstream so&nbsp;as to&nbsp;avoid financial difficulties downstream.</p><p><br><I>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now talk about&nbsp;Members' concerns on&nbsp;maintaining the owner-occupation status of HDB flats.&nbsp; I want to&nbsp;emphasise that HDB flats are provided primarily for owner-occupation.&nbsp; They are not for speculative profit or&nbsp;rental return.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Mdm Ho Geok Choo were concerned about high prices and&nbsp;COV levels and they asked what can be done to curb speculation. &nbsp;Mr Masagos Zulkifli also asked about the outcome of our review to curb speculation and&nbsp;whether PRs (Permanent Residents) are driving up flat prices, and how we have dealt with illegal subletting.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I think we have to decide whether we want to control resale flat prices or we do not.&nbsp; If we control HDB resale flat prices, basically we are&nbsp;going back to a regime where we say we will sell&nbsp;it to you at a certain&nbsp;price,&nbsp;and you sell it back to us at a&nbsp;certain price.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a regime which we had many years ago. There is no capital appreciation, no profit to be <p align=left>Column: 3196</p>enjoyed.&nbsp; The&nbsp;flat is not an asset.&nbsp; Basically, what you are doing is that you are collecting rental upfront, which&nbsp;is akin to a rental scheme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the&nbsp;Home Ownership Scheme, where we sell the flat to the resident, we allow the resident to sell the flat after a certain minimum occupation period and to keep that profit&nbsp;or retain that flat until retirement, and then cash out and use the proceeds for retirement.&nbsp; That is the Home Ownership Scheme.&nbsp; That is what makes Singapore's public housing scheme different from any other scheme in the world.&nbsp; And I believe, that, that&nbsp;is the best scheme for Singaporeans.&nbsp; That is the reason why I believe that we should not interfere in the resale market.&nbsp; The moment you interfere in the resale market, and you say that we will ban COV, we will limit COV or&nbsp;we will not allow COV, I think that is the day when we are controlling the market, and that means we will be moving backwards and that will be to the detriment of&nbsp;800,000 HDB flat owners or more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, why&nbsp;high COVs?&nbsp; Very simple.&nbsp; Because people are willing and prepared to pay for that particular flat.&nbsp; If we were to say no COV for their flat, how is the&nbsp;seller going to decide who to sell to.&nbsp; Can we force the seller to say you must sell to this person or that person?&nbsp; Obviously not.&nbsp; So the person who comes up with the&nbsp;COV that the seller asks for or&nbsp;close to that&nbsp;gets to buy the flat.&nbsp; That is free market at play &ndash; negotiation between willing buyers and willing sellers.&nbsp; If the buyer cannot or does not want to&nbsp;pay the COV, he&nbsp;just walks away.&nbsp; So let us keep the system as it is.&nbsp; Ultimately, as I have said, COVs do not rise indefinitely.&nbsp; They have been zero, they have been negative.&nbsp; Not too long ago, just one year ago, COVs were at zero.&nbsp; Today, on average, they are about $22,000 to $24,000.&nbsp; Will they keep going up?&nbsp; I do not know. Will they come down?&nbsp; I believe so, one day.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 3197</p>Mr Hri Kumar&nbsp;asked about subletting,&nbsp;and whether private property owners (PPOs) should be allowed to own flats.&nbsp; The majority of resale flat buyers are citizens who do not own&nbsp;private property.&nbsp; So I do not think we want to go&nbsp;chasing after private property owners.&nbsp; Only those who are eligible&nbsp;get CPF housing grants to buy resale flats.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have any evidence that specific buyer groups, like PRs and PPOs, are driving up prices. The median COV paid by PRs has been the same as the overall median COV paid for resale flats for the last two quarters.&nbsp; In other words,&nbsp;PRs are not more cash-rich than other Singaporeans.&nbsp; There are&nbsp;reports of PRs paying high COV but these are&nbsp;the exception, not the rule.&nbsp;</p></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr width="50%">*Cols. 3251-3252; 3253-3254<BR></div></P></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think Ms Sylvia Lim made mention of&nbsp;this yesterday in one of her interventions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty-seven thousand&nbsp;resale transactions in 2009&nbsp;&ndash; 58 cases had COVs exceeding $70,000.&nbsp; Of these 58 cases,&nbsp;eight cases&nbsp;involved PRs, and the rest of the 50&nbsp;were Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words,&nbsp;there is no&nbsp;empirical&nbsp;evidence to suggest that PRs are more prone to paying higher COVs&nbsp;or pushing up resale flat&nbsp;prices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.30 pm</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the same thing for Private Property Owners (PPOs).&nbsp;&nbsp;They do&nbsp;pay higher COVs in general but&nbsp;their numbers are exceedingly small and&nbsp;not large enough to drive up prices. There is a very populist or common suggestion that we should&nbsp;ban Private Property Owners from buying&nbsp;resale flats.&nbsp; The issue is not just Private Property Owners buying resale flats.&nbsp; What about HDB flat owners buying private properties?&nbsp; Do we also disallow HDB flat owners from upgrading to private property?&nbsp; Surely not. And if we allow HDB flat owners to buy private properties, why do we stop Private Property Owners <p align=left>Column: 3198</p>from buying HDB flats?&nbsp; So long as the owner occupation condition is satisfied&ndash;in other words, they must stay in the HDB flat that&nbsp;they can buy.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I&nbsp;urge that we take a longer-term view and do not over-react and do things&nbsp;that we may have to unwind sometime down the road.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although flats are mainly for owner-occupation, we do allow flat owners to sublet their flats if they meet the Minimum Occupation Period (MOP).&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the&nbsp;MOP policy&nbsp;allows&nbsp;flat owners&nbsp;to sublet their entire flat after&nbsp;three or&nbsp;five years, depending on whether their flat purchase was subsidised. Of the 682,000 flats that have fulfilled the MOP and are eligible for subletting, only 23,200 or 3% are actually&nbsp;subletted. So&nbsp;the extent of subletting the whole flat is not as prevalent as many would suggest.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most flat owners are really buying flats for occupation, and not for rental.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But just to make sure, I have asked HDB to step up enforcement against unauthorised&nbsp;subletting&nbsp;of flats.&nbsp; HDB has the power to compulsorily acquire flats or impose a heavy fine on those found subletting without authorisation. Members of the House, members of the&nbsp;public, if you know&nbsp;of any such cases, you can help HDB by reporting such cases to me.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, several Members have asked us to review the&nbsp;one-year Minimum Occupation Period (MOP) for resale of flats bought without subsidies. While there has been an increasing trend of flat owners selling their flats shortly after the&nbsp;MOP, especially&nbsp;those who have bought non-subsidised flats where the MOP is either&nbsp;one or two-and-a-half years, the numbers are not large.

Actually, I wanted to talk about helping the downgraders&nbsp;&ndash; give them a loan.&nbsp; Sir, I really welcome Minister's announcement that there is loan for the downgraders.&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp; Really, I feel there is warmth, not heat, just like a Chinese saying, "<I>ren jian you wen nuan</I>".&nbsp; Perhaps we can do more.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flat compulsorily acquired, for example&nbsp;&ndash; because of a non-payment of instalments, the flats were being compulsorily acquired.&nbsp; What are the reasons they defaulted on their payments?&nbsp; It could be that the breadwinners are struck with sudden serious illnesses, met with serious accidents or lost their jobs.&nbsp; Are they the typical delinquent pay masters?&nbsp; Not necessarily.&nbsp; They cannot pay because their dreams were shattered unexpectedly.&nbsp; Hence, I urge the Ministry to look into the merits of each case so <p align=left>Column: 3200</p>that those who want to repay when their health improves or when they have found jobs, give them another chance to do so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, I came across one of my residents;&nbsp; she was very ill.&nbsp; She could not work and, hence, lost her job.&nbsp; And recently, she has recovered totally and&nbsp;has found a job, started to work, and she went down to HDB as&nbsp;she wanted to pay but she was rejected.&nbsp; That was what she told me.&nbsp; And HDB told her that the flat no longer belonged to her.&nbsp; So can HDB give her another chance?&nbsp; We should provide housing with a heart.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, it pains me whenever I hear from residents that HDB forces those who are terminally ill and unable to pay their instalments to vacate their flats.&nbsp; The worst thing to do for them in their hour of need is to tell them they would not even have a roof over their heads.&nbsp; Is the terminal illness not enough stress and burden for them?&nbsp; Do we need to crack the whip at them when they are crawling on the last leg of their life journey?&nbsp; Where is the heart in providing a home to the people?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, can Minister update us on the various measures that MND introduced last year to help the needy and elderly such as the Lease Buyback Scheme, tightening the rental eligibility criteria, etc?&nbsp; If MND says that they have helped the truly needy, then why are there still people sleeping on the beaches or the void decks?&nbsp; Can the Ministry review the Lease Buyback Scheme to allow more elderly to benefit from the scheme?&nbsp; I have an elderly resident who owns a 4-room flat, which is fully paid up.&nbsp; She cannot work and has a handicapped son.&nbsp; And she has been appealing for lease buyback but got rejected.&nbsp; HDB asked her to sell away her flat and get a smaller flat if she needs money.&nbsp; However, for older residents, it is very stressful for them to shift.&nbsp; I can understand.&nbsp; Can HDB be more flexible and <p align=left>Column: 3201</p>extend the Lease Buyback Scheme to residents like her?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last but not least, I would like to urge the Ministry to consider introducing tiered subsidy for applicants who are earning more than $8,000 a month, instead of cutting them off totally and telling them that they cannot buy new HDB flats directly from HDB.&nbsp; We need to be realistic, especially given today's&nbsp;market, where two graduates starting a family are likely to hit this ceiling quite easily.&nbsp; Moreover, very likely, these young couples will have many other financial obligations such as repayment of university study loans, taking care of the aged parents and possibly children's education expenses, etc.&nbsp; Should this policy not be updated?&nbsp; I hope the Minister will help the people to dream their dreams and provide housing with a heart.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Why did they come to see me?&nbsp; They were going to vacate their current room with a&nbsp;friend, because they have been staying with the friend for about a month, and they were extremely anxious and helpless because they were waiting for their rental flats to be allocated to them but the wait is going to be about a year or more.&nbsp; Being from MCYS, I am actually quite reluctant to even recommend a temporary shelter because you have to split up the family.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also other stories of similar nature and these are low-income families that could not afford a flat and have to wait for a while to get their rental flats.&nbsp; And if they had sold their flats, the proceeds would probably have been used to repay other debts and they also cannot <p align=left>Column: 3203</p>afford a flat at&nbsp;the market rental rate.&nbsp; Time is of the essence for them to be able to get a flat and, in this case,&nbsp;a rental flat.&nbsp; So while they are waiting and they cannot afford anywhere or to live anywhere else, they end up living outdoors.&nbsp; But when I saw the strong reaction of the residents whose flat will be affected by the newly built rental flat, I was actually very concerned because I am worried whether or not&nbsp;HDB will go ahead to built those rental flats.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Recently, a resident came to see me to appeal for a rental flat.&nbsp; When I asked her whether she has children who could accommodate her in their home, she answered that one of her daughters had asked her to stay with them.&nbsp;

<p align=left>Column: 3204</p>I wish to appeal to HDB to re-consider its policy.&nbsp; HDB should not engage in social engineering by forcing applicants to stay with their children when they may not be welcomed or&nbsp;their presence in the flat may cause strain in the family relationship.&nbsp; If the applicant is eligible to rent a flat and wishes to stay in a rental flat,&nbsp;allow them to join the queue and peg their rental based on the applicant's income.&nbsp; If the concern is that of abuse of rental flat, HDB should tighten up&nbsp;its rules and inspect these rental flats more regularly, and this would ensure that&nbsp;rental flats are occupied by the applicant at all times.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I think we need to tweak the system such that nobody gets offended. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> Sir, earlier, I talked about what HDB does for families looking to set up their first home.&nbsp; Let me&nbsp;now, at this stage of the debate,&nbsp;focus on some of the&nbsp;specific groups, namely, the lower-income, the elderly, and&nbsp;PR issues which Members have raised.&nbsp;<p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Helping people buy their flats is one part of the story.&nbsp; But we all know that after buying, some people run into trouble.&nbsp; I have spoken about the upstream measures that&nbsp;help to manage this problem.&nbsp; Er Lee Bee Wah asked about downgraders and compulsory acquisition and, generally, called&nbsp;for HDB to have a kinder heart.&nbsp; The HDB that I know&nbsp;&ndash; and I hope it is the same HDB that Members are familiar and worked with&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;spares no effort in helping households to find a long-term solution to their arrears problem.&nbsp; Right-sizing their flat is one key solution. &nbsp;I have announced changes to HDB's loan policies to help families do so, and I believe that this will go some way to helping the low-income families, particularly those with financial difficulties, to right-size their homes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compulsory acquisition only comes into the picture when all other options are exhausted, and households repeatedly ignore HDB's efforts.&nbsp; Sir, I can assure the House that HDB's heart is in the right place.&nbsp; But sometimes I wonder&nbsp;whether they are a little too compassionate, so <p align=left>Column: 3213</p>much so that people do take advantage of HDB's kindness.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>6.00 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have come across many cases, because all appeal cases come to the Ministry, where residents fall into arrears for years, not months, but years and some&nbsp;as long as three to four years. &nbsp;And they still refuse to accept&nbsp;offers&nbsp;to solve their problem on a longer-term basis,&nbsp;to rent out a room, to sublet their flat, to&nbsp;add family members&nbsp;to pay for the loan, for spouse to work or for children to work or, ultimately, to downgrade.&nbsp; And when they downgrade, HDB does offer them help with loans.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a matter of showing compassion.&nbsp; I think the compassion is already there.&nbsp;&nbsp;There needs to be some reciprocity on the part of the lessee to be willing to make adjustments in their life and lifestyle, and to be able to contribute towards finding&nbsp;a solution.&nbsp; It is not enough just to say,&nbsp;"No, I&nbsp;refuse&nbsp;to move, I don't want to move, I don't want to downgrade, I don't want to do this, I don't want to do that.&nbsp; HDB should just allow me to stay on.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because I am in financial difficulty."&nbsp; Obviously, that is not a tenable solution and that is the reason why HDB had to deal with non-performing loan portfolio&nbsp;of close to 9% at one stage.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, with all these upstream measures&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;HLE, credit assessment, etc&nbsp;&ndash; as well as downstream measures&nbsp;helping them to right-size, HDB has managed to bring the arrears situation down, as I have mentioned in this House, to something like 7%,&nbsp;which is still very high.&nbsp; Included in this group are many who are caught in very long-term arrears situation.&nbsp; But even as&nbsp;HDB tries to resolve these NPL (non-performing loan) arrears cases, it still exercises a lot of compassion, a lot of <p align=left>Column: 3214</p>forbearance, and I am surprised to hear the case that&nbsp;Er Lee Bee Wah&nbsp;mentioned just now about&nbsp;a terminally-ill person&nbsp;being asked to quit.&nbsp; There is another part of the story somewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know what it is but I am almost certain that&nbsp;there is another part of the story which has not been told, and I would dearly love to hear what the other part of the story is.&nbsp;If the Member could please pass me the details, I will look into that case personally because&nbsp;I do know for a fact that HDB does grant a lot of leeway and forbearance to such hardship cases, particularly when the financial difficulty&nbsp;is through no fault of their own&nbsp;&ndash; ie, illness,&nbsp;loss of job, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please be&nbsp;rest assured that the HDB will continue to be the housing authority with a heart.&nbsp; But compassion has to be reciprocated and the other party also needs to do something.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope Members will&nbsp;help to solve their residents' problems, not just by asking for forbearance but also persuading them to try to come&nbsp;up with&nbsp;a long-term solution.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But despite this help that HDB gives, I know for a fact that there will still be families who cannot afford to own their homes and&nbsp;HDB will help those who are in genuine need, with no&nbsp;housing options, by the provision of a subsidised rental flat.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho Geok Choo asked if rental flats are going to the truly needy and Mr Teo Ser Luck also asked about supply, and the rental queue.&nbsp; If Members remember last year's COS debate,&nbsp;I announced&nbsp;that HDB will adopt a two-pronged strategy.&nbsp; One,&nbsp;increase supply; and two,&nbsp;manage demand. &nbsp;I also explained that if I just increase supply and&nbsp;not manage demand, the queue is just going to&nbsp;get longer and longer, including some of those cases that various Members have brought up&nbsp;here.&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB revised the eligibility criteria last year for&nbsp;the Public Rental Scheme and now, in addition&nbsp;to an&nbsp;income limit, HDB also&nbsp;looks at an applicant's assets and <p align=left>Column: 3215</p>whether he has family support, because income alone is not a sufficient criterion to assess whether that applicant really deserves a rental flat.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Lim Biow Chuan suggested that strained family relationships should be considered for rental flat applications.&nbsp; I think he knows the Government's philosophy, which is not just reflected in housing policies but reflected in many other policies as well, is that the family must be the first line of support.&nbsp; It is almost self-evident that if you have a family, if you have children, the family or the&nbsp;children, and not&nbsp;the Government, should provide&nbsp;for the parents, whether it is housing or whether it is financial help&nbsp;if they are able to.&nbsp; So when we&nbsp;look at availability of alternative housing for rental flat applicants,&nbsp;we&nbsp;look at the kind of flats that they own, we&nbsp;look at whether&nbsp;they&nbsp;have rooms available, whether the family or whether the children are capable of looking after the parents.&nbsp; And in many cases, we find children living in 5-room flats, with spare rooms, 4-room flats with spare rooms, even landed property&nbsp;and private property.&nbsp; And in those cases, we say, "Sorry, you cannot join the rental flat queue."&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that is eminently reasonable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rental flats are heavily subsidised. And that is one of the reasons why&nbsp;the queue is so long. Because we charge $30 or $40 for a flat, and the flat is very comfortable.&nbsp; If you look at the new flats that are being built, they are very, very comfortable, not like the old days.&nbsp; Thirty dollars, a flat of your own, who does not want? &nbsp;Everybody wants to join the queue. &nbsp;If you are an elderly retiree with&nbsp;no income, under the old criteria, you could have joined the queue.&nbsp; No questions asked and then when your turn came, you got&nbsp;the flat.&nbsp; If we had continued with that, no amount of new rental flats that we build will be&nbsp;sufficient.&nbsp;Our position is that if you have&nbsp;family support, if you can stay with your families, please do not <p align=left>Column: 3216</p>compete with the truly needy for these flats because they are really for those who have no other housing option.&nbsp;&nbsp;In that particular case where the old lady had a daughter who was willing to take&nbsp;her in, we would say "go and stay with your daughter."&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that you want to be independent is not a good reason for you to come and ask&nbsp;HDB for a rental flat.&nbsp; For those families who do not&nbsp;or&nbsp;cannot get along,&nbsp;we will refer them to the Family Service Centre to see whether&nbsp;they can provide counselling to make sure that the family can at least try to accommodate one another.&nbsp; In some cases, we do exercise compassion, for example, where there is a history of family violence.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the supply side, HDB is building 7,000 more rental flats over the next three years and this will&nbsp;increase its stock to 50,000.&nbsp; By next year,&nbsp;we should&nbsp;have 20% more rental flats.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of this two-pronged approach&nbsp;&ndash; increase supply, manage the demand&nbsp;&ndash; the waiting time for a rental flat for those who&nbsp;need them has been reduced by 50%, or halved, from 21 months a year ago to&nbsp;12 months today.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this effort to build more rental flats is not as&nbsp;plain sailing as we would have hoped.&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, you all know that HDB came under fire from some residents who were unhappy that new rental blocks are springing up in their neighbourhood. &nbsp;I think their concerns are quite real. &nbsp;But in land-scarce Singapore, I would appeal for their understanding that we need to build these rental flats to meet demand and we need give-and-take in a city like Singapore where land is so scarce, where it is&nbsp;necessary to make space for other groups in our society.&nbsp; I am glad to see that this is a view that is shared both inside and outside the House, as reflected by views expressed by Members as well as by writers, reactions&nbsp;in the media and other forums.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 3217</p>Let me now touch on another group of HDB residents and that is the elderly.&nbsp; One of the benefits I have always said about owning a HDB flat is that you have a&nbsp;valuable&nbsp;asset that you&nbsp;can use&nbsp;for your retirement.&nbsp;&nbsp;You have two valuable assets in your old age&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;your&nbsp;CPF and&nbsp;your HDB flat&nbsp;&ndash; and both of them combined together can provide an elderly Singaporean with a comfortable retirement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We introduced the Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS) in&nbsp;March&nbsp;2009 and this allowed elderly lessees the twin advantage of&nbsp; continuing to live in their flat&nbsp;&ndash; because we do know that the elderly do not wish to move if they can&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;at the same time they&nbsp;receive a lifelong stream of income.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Er Lee Bee Wah and Mr Teo Ser Luck asked if&nbsp;LBS is working well and can&nbsp;be expanded. &nbsp;I am glad to announce that we will revise the criteria to allow more elderly lessees to benefit. Lessees who had previously owned 4-room or larger HDB flats can now apply for the LBS.&nbsp; We have excluded these lessees in the past but now we are prepared to include them.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also allow lessees with an outstanding loan exceeding $5,000 to apply for the LBS, so long as the amount available for the purchase of an Immediate Annuity is at least $60,000. &nbsp;So the relaxation of these two criteria will allow another 3,800 elderly lessees to be&nbsp;eligible for&nbsp;LBS.&nbsp; HDB will announce&nbsp;details later.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now touch on permanent residents.&nbsp; Mdm Ho Geok Choo, Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Mr Ang Mong Seng all raised questions about PRs buying HDB flats. The first point I want to make is that in the purchase of HDB flats, Singaporeans always come first.&nbsp;&nbsp;PRs can buy HDB flats, resale flats, not new flats.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because they&nbsp;also need a roof over <p align=left>Column: 3218</p>their heads.&nbsp; If we do not&nbsp;allow them&nbsp;to buy resale flats, and if the private property market is out of their reach, they have to rent. &nbsp;When they buy resale flats,&nbsp;they get no subsidies, no grants, no concessionary loans from HDB.&nbsp; They have to go to the banks to get a loan.&nbsp;They have to pay whatever the banks ask of them.&nbsp; Only&nbsp;Singaporeans can get new flats, only Singaporeans can get grants for buying resale flats.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But PRs are long-term residents in Singapore.&nbsp; They live, they work, and they study in Singapore. &nbsp;Their experience here is a major factor in whether they take up citizenship and we want them to take up citizenship.&nbsp; My Ministry will adjust our public housing policies to nudge them in this direction.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, a PR married to a citizen can enjoy exactly the same housing benefits as Singaporean couples for homeownership flats. To provide an incentive for PRs to take up citizenship, we will withhold $10,000 of the subsidies for citizen/PR households, that means&nbsp;one member is a citizen and one member is a PR, when they buy a HDB flat.&nbsp; This will&nbsp;reinforce the principle that Singaporeans are our priority.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What this means is that if such a couple buys a resale flat and is eligible for a CPF Housing Grant, we will hold back $10,000.&nbsp; So if their grant previously was $30,000, it will now be $20,000. &nbsp;If it was $40,000 previously, it will now be $30,000 if they are staying near their parents.&nbsp; And if they buy a new flat from HDB, they will pay $10,000 more&nbsp;on top of HDB's subsidised selling price.</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>6.15 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the PR converts to citizenship or when they have a Singapore-citizen child, we will return the withheld subsidy. The full $10,000 will be refunded into their <p align=left>Column: 3219</p>CPF accounts if they convert, or if they have a citizen child.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These measures will give greater assurance to citizens that they are our priority, and at the same time encourage our permanent residents to view citizenship more favourably. HDB will release further details soon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Cedric Foo, Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Mr Christoper de Souza also raised concerns about foreigner enclaves in HDB estates. Let me say that, currently, this is not a major problem. Last year, PRs made up 14% of our resident population.&nbsp;But PR families owned only 5% of HDB flats. PRs buy flats all over Singapore. However, there are some towns in the western and northern regions where the proportion of PRs owning flats is slightly higher than the national proportion of 5%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said,&nbsp;PR enclaves are not a problem today, but we try to look ahead. If we see&nbsp;a trend, we should put precautionary measures in place early. Otherwise, it may be&nbsp;too late&nbsp;when the&nbsp;problem&nbsp;is already there and you have to unravel the problem later. It is also important that PRs integrate well in our local communities as they are long-term residents in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To prevent enclaves from forming, HDB will introduce a new quota for PR families buying resale flats. PRs will be subject to quotas of 5% and 8% at the neighbourhood and block levels respectively. In other words, a PR family cannot buy a flat if the neighbourhood or block already has 5% or 8% of flats owned by other PR families. This quota will only apply to non-Malaysian PRs. Why? Because of our&nbsp;close historical and cultural links.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The quota will be applied on top of the Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP).&nbsp;This means that a PR family will have to fulfil both the EIP quota and the new SPR quota. Details will be provided by HDB shortly.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3220</p>Finally, I want to talk about the issue of racial harmony in HDB estates. I think, as Mr Cedric Foo rightly pointed out, the importance of racial harmony cannot be overstated.&nbsp;Mr Foo and Mdm Ho asked if the EIP has been effective in preventing ethnic enclaves.&nbsp;I think the answer is to be found in any of our HDB estates today.&nbsp;We do not see ethnic congregations anywhere. But that is not to say that it will not happen if we do not implement this EIP policy vigorously. We do implement it vigourously.&nbsp;As a result of doing so, some transactions cannot take place because the EIP quota&nbsp;has been&nbsp;reached.&nbsp;We need to work hard to maintain this racial harmony. Although the EIP limits are reviewed periodically, they have not been changed since 1989.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In line with demographic shifts since then, we will raise the Indian and Others limit from 10% and 13% at the neighbourhood and block levels respectively, to 12% and 15% &ndash; by two percentage points for the block as well as the neighbourhood. The overall proportion of Indian and Others households in public housing has grown over the years to about 10% in 2009, which is pushing at the current neighbourhood limit. That is the reason why we have to tweak&nbsp;the numbers and revise them. This revision will allow the EIP limits to better reflect current demographic situation.&nbsp; Based on HDB's projections, the limits should remain relevant until 2020.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will not change the Malay and Chinese limits because the current limits still provide a reasonable margin of flexibility relative to the Chinese and Malay share of public housing. In other words, these will remain at 22% at the neighbourhood level and 25% at the block level for Malays, and 84% and 87% respectively for Chinese.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my Parliamentary Secretary will now address queries on other groups such as divorcees and families in distress.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman--><p align=left>Column: 3221</p><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</B> Mr Chairman, Minister Mah has spoken at length about how HDB caters to the needs of different groups to ensure an inclusive home for Singaporeans.&nbsp;Let me now focus on the specific groups with immediate housing needs as raised by some Members.<p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho Geok Choo and Dr Ahmad Magad asked about help for families who are now unable to afford another flat as they have spent away all the money from the sale of their previous subsidised flat.&nbsp; Ms Sylvia Lim highlighted the housing needs of divorced parents with children, who may be earning only slightly above the $1,500 income ceiling and thus cannot qualify for HDB&rsquo;s Public Rental Scheme.&nbsp;While Mr Low Thia Khiang called for the Government to support the housing of homeless families.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, for all of these groups, their housing woes are often a manifestation of deeper underlying problems, for example,&nbsp;inadequate income or family disputes. Our approach in helping such families is to work with MCYS and Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) to understand the root of their problems and to then help them to look for a sustainable housing solution for the long term.&nbsp;Wherever possible, HDB will strive to help families work towards home ownership.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the interim, HDB will help the families to identify temporary housing options to meet their immediate needs. Wherever possible, families should be the first line of support. If they have no family support and are unable to rent from the open market, interim housing options such as Interim Rental Housing (IRH) and Transitional Shelters run by VWOs would then be considered. Within the context of this approach, let me now address the specific comments from Members.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Helping with underlying problems &ndash;&nbsp;Ms Lim asked for "broader financial <p align=left>Column: 3222</p>assessment for housing loan eligibility" so as to help divorced parents achieve home ownership.&nbsp;However, granting a larger loan is not an appropriate option if families are unable to afford to service the loan. This is not in their interest as it may lead to spiralling debts.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fundamentally, these families need to improve their earning capacity and financial situation first. HDB can help to refer families to the Community Development Councils (CDCs), which can then provide financial assistance, help in job matching and skills upgrading.&nbsp;HDB will help these families to buy a flat when they are financially ready, by providing them a second or even third mortgage loan on a case-by-case basis.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For other families, such as the "homeless" mentioned by Mr Low, their housing problems are often also a manifestation of deeper issues, such as unemployment or strained family relationships.&nbsp;HDB has looked into the housing history of those who overstayed at our beaches and parks.&nbsp;Many have enjoyed housing subsidies in the past and sold their flats with sufficient proceeds to buy a new flat or rent one from the open market. More than half of them have other housing options.&nbsp;Some of the "homeless" have even been allocated rental flats by HDB or are already listed as current owners, tenants or occupiers of sold flats, but chose not to stay in them.&nbsp;Others have families whom they can stay with.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to look at their problems holistically and address the root cause of their housing woes, including referring them to Family Service Centres for counselling on family relationship problems.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interim housing support &ndash; while these families work towards their long term housing solution, HDB will also assess how best to address their immediate <p align=left>Column: 3223</p>housing needs. Often, it is in their interest to stay with parents or siblings temporarily if possible, while they build up their finances. Alternatively, they may consider renting a flat or room in the open market.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where families are unable to afford renting a room in the open market, Interim Rental Housing (IRH) could then be offered. Dr Faishal had asked about this. IRH is a temporary shelter let out by managing agents to help families who cannot afford market rent. To keep the rents low,&nbsp;two families will generally share a 3-room flat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Faishal said that some of his constituents in financial difficulties were offered IRH, but were rather reluctant to take up this offer. He mentioned the changes to the routine of these families if they were to take up the IRH. I would like to emphasise that IRH is not meant to be a permanent housing solution.&nbsp; Compared to living in your home, the IRH arrangement is certainly less ideal. It is no different, however, from having to rent a room in the open market, but with the advantage of lower rents in the IRH.&nbsp; Families have to be willing to make some temporary adjustments as they work towards their permanent homes. They may be referred to CDCs and FSCs for help and counselling where necessary. Where possible, the managing agent will take into account the characteristics of families in pairing them. Families may also be referred to transitional shelters run by VWOs, where social workers will work with the families on their underlying social and employment problems.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we recognise that there are families with housing difficulties due to various reasons. Our approach is holistic and pragmatic.&nbsp;We aim to help the families address their underlying problems and to stand on their feet again. We will help these families work towards home <p align=left>Column: 3224</p>ownership, where possible. However, this will also call for hardwork and adjustments on the part of families. For genuinely needy cases who do not have family support and cannot afford their own homes even in the longer term, HDB will help them with a public rental flat.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ahmad Mohd Magad--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP)</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ahmad Mohd Magad:</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, the Lift Upgrading Programme has been in operation since 2001 and benefited many residents of HDB estates, including those in my constituency.&nbsp; Many more of my residents have been asking, "when is it their turn for the LUP?"

However, with changes in demographics and shifting desires of HDB dwellers, the Lift Upgrading Programme came about with the aim to improve the flats' access and provide personal convenience. What is noteworthy regarding this programme is of course the availability of heavy subsidies. Sir, my residents welcome LUP programmes and we thank HDB for these.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year some time in the early period of the global financial crisis, HDB announced that efforts on lift upgrading would be stepped up. If I recalled correctly&nbsp; by as much as 12%, and the move&nbsp;was designed to stimulate the sluggish economy by creating business for smaller contractors then.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certainly, the increased momentum to accelerate the LUP last year could be considered a two-pronged approach &ndash; benefiting the citizens and at the same time, capitalising on the low construction cost to level up the LUP.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A year has since passed and it would be good for us to know what progress has been made.

One such example is wet markets and hawker centres.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hawker centres have become a feature of Singapore and provided fairly inexpensive food for the people due to the relatively low rental. If we apply the principle of maximising economic benefit from the land occupied by hawker centres and wet markets, these iconic features of Singapore would become supermarkets and food courts in no time.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current trend of the Government to release land for tender by private developers to build and operate markets and hawker centres is worrying.&nbsp; When private developers bid for the land for wet<p align=left>Column: 3227</p> markets and hawker centres, they are out to maximise profits. In a competitive bidding exercise, especially during times of economic growth, private developers compete against one another to secure the tender. The highest bidder who is successful would need to recover their investments and recoup their returns through higher rentals charged to individual stall lessees.&nbsp; In the end, these high rentals tend to translate into higher prices which consumer would have to pay for their cooked food and market produce.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government should continue the practice of building markets and cooked food centres at new locations for NEA to operate to ensure Singapore remains a liveable and at the same time affordable city.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim:</B> Sir, since the 1970s, the developments of our first few satellite towns witnessed the emergence of planned retail facilities in new towns which aimed to provide residents with self-sufficient daily and essential needs.&nbsp; Many Singaporeans saw the developments of traditional HDB Neighbourhood Centres in housing estates, such as Toa Payoh, Queenstown, Ang Mo Kio, Bedok and Clementi.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These centres were the shopping haven and meeting points of our residents in the 1970s, 1980s and possibly in 1990s.&nbsp; Today, with better connections via an efficient transport system, the attraction of newer, bigger and up-to-date retail centres which are easily accessible by public and private transport are likely to dominate the shoppers' choice of retail destinations.&nbsp; Shoppers may give their shops at the neighbourhood centre a miss for other retail centres which are able to provide a large variety of goods and services, as well as a more entertaining shopping experience.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 3228</p>In addition, quite a number of the housing estates which these neighbourhood centres are located have seen a change in the demographic structure of the residents, which implies the change in the purchasing power and shopping patterns of the residents.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowing that I will be making this cut, I made a conscious effort to gather feedback relating to this issue.&nbsp; Essentially,&nbsp;youths feel disconnected to these centres and hope that it can be remade to enhance its relevance in connecting the generations who live there, as well as provide a space for them to be engaged at their neighbourhood.&nbsp; Other Singaporeans feel that the retail space provided at few of these neighbourhood centres far exceeds the demand of the residents today, thus, resulting in vacant retail shops, which sometimes results in below optimal and inappropriate uses.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also arguments which direct the problem to the shopowners who are not able to keep up with the changes in the expectation of the shoppers.&nbsp; Residents are surprised to observe that a few of these shopowners are operating the same way they used to operate a few decades ago.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am aware that that there have been some improvement and restructuring works at some of these traditional neighbourhood centres.&nbsp; However, there are still others which are grappling to survive in this changing retail climate.&nbsp; Therefore, I would like to call for an urgent need for a re-look at the relevance of these centres in our society today.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel that these centres do not reflect the highest and best use of the sites, thus, not resulting in an optimal use of space in our land scarce city-state.&nbsp; Finally, we need to refine the current ownership and management structures to ensure its continuous relevance in today's fast changing world.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah--><p align=left>Column: 3229</p><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Linkway</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Er Lee Bee Wah:</B> Sir, many of you may be surprised&nbsp;that I am speaking on this topic&nbsp;&ndash; "linkway."&nbsp; I know that linkway is a common structure linking one HDB block to another.&nbsp; However, not every resident enjoys the comfort of&nbsp;a linkway. Today, I want to highlight the plight of the residents in my constituency living in blocks 858 to 864 in Nee Soon South who are confronted with hindrances as soon as they step out of their homes.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, these seven blocks are linked to one another. However, they are separated by a temple and a petrol kiosk.&nbsp; And hence, while they enjoy the convenience of living near amenities like the Khatib MRT station, coffeeshops and NTUC Fairprice, there are no shelter linkways from their flats to these amenities.&nbsp; This makes walking difficult for them, especially when it rains. I brought up this issue&nbsp;in Parliament at last year's COS and the Minister told me then that there&nbsp;were such things&nbsp;as umbrellas.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there are such things&nbsp;as umbrellas but it does not mean that when we need them, we have them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only the old but also the young who come back from schools and from the MRT stations get caught in the rain.&nbsp; May I ask&nbsp;the Minister&nbsp;to reconsider allocating some funds to construct linkways from the above mentioned blocks to the nearest HDB block&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I am not asking to link to the MRT station&nbsp;&ndash; so that they can walk home even in the rain.&nbsp; Let us link them with the heart.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien):</B> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, Sir, Singapore's good public housing is not only about delivering an adequate supply of affordable flats but also about making sure that existing flats and housing estates are regularly upgraded and rejuvenated to sustain their value, and to ensure their accessibility and relevance to our changing population.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3230</p> Dr Ahmad Magad and Mr Masagos Zulkifli spoke about the importance of the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) for our ageing population and asked about its burden on town councils (TCs). I am glad to update the House that we have selected more than 90% of the eligible blocks for lift upgrading so far, with works in 50% completed or ongoing. The programme is on track and HDB will select the remaining 400 plus blocks over the next&nbsp;two years or so for completion by 2014, as earlier announced.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the lift upgrading solutions for different blocks are firmed up, we have gained a better understanding of the financial burden of the LUP on town councils. Many of the middle-aged blocks require more complex and costly lift solutions as these were designed in the 1980s to allow greater privacy amongst residents. Lift upgrading in middle-aged blocks tend to be more costly per benefiting unit. Newer blocks built after 1990 would not require LUP as they would have been built with direct lift access from the start. The older blocks prior to 1980 may have benefited from lift upgrading under earlier programmes such as Main Upgrading Programme (MUP).&nbsp; So you can say that the burden on the middle-aged blocks is probably largest if you compare the three types of flats.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though Government bears the bulk of the cost of the programme at $5.5 billion, the LUP co-payment by TCs totalling about $360 million is not a small sum. It can pose a significant burden for some TCs, especially those with a high concentration of flats built in the 1980s.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the LUP was introduced, TCs had asked to help make lift upgrading more affordable for residents by sharing in the co-payment. The principle of co-payment by TCs is well-intended for the benefit of residents and should be upheld. However, we must ensure that the LUP <p align=left>Column: 3231</p>co-payment does not overstrain the TCs' ability to meet other cyclical works, which are also for the benefit of residents. We are therefore considering a one-off LUP Assistance for the TCs. The amount of LUP subsidy given to each TC will take into account the complexity and scale of works to be undertaken by the TC for the entire LUP. In addition, we will consider the extent each TC would have saved on lift upgrading, arising from earlier upgrading programmes such as MUP. We estimate that the LUP Assistance will cost Government about $130 million. We will notify all TCs later this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On neighbourhood renewal, Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim and Mr Low Thia Khiang asked about the development of neighbourhood facilities such as shops, wet markets and cooked food centres. Today, we have a variety of upgrading programmes to support the renewal of estates. These include the Neigbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP) and the Community Improvement Projects Committee (CIPC) scheme. The Prime Minister also unveiled HDB's first batch of town-wide rejuvenation plans under the Remaking Our Heartland (ROH) programme in 2007. We are considering the next batch of towns for the ROH programme and will announce the list later this year.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim had asked about the future of neighbourhood shops and centres, particularly in older estates. I assure the House that neighbourhood centres and shops will remain important community nodes for HDB residents. As our population ages, neighourhood shops will remain relevant due to their proximity to residents. However, as Dr Faishal rightly pointed out, shopping habits have also changed over time. The number and business mix of our neighbourhood shops have to change to remain relevant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 3232</p>Currently, we have the Revitalisation of Shops (ROS) Scheme to help shops upgrade and enhance their competitiveness to better serve residents. Under the scheme, shops receive co-funding for the upgrading of common areas and promotional activities. HDB retailers must do their part and constantly adapt their businesses to meet changing needs.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issues are similar for wet markets and cooked food centres. With the changing lifestyle of Singaporeans and changes in demographics, demand for traditional wet markets and hawker centres may change over time. Singaporeans are increasingly turning to modern amenities like supermarkets for their groceries. The Government will have to review the needs from time to time, help businesses to exit where the demand is dwindling, inject new opportunities where there is new demand, or change the mix of tenants to inject vibrancy.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generally, the Government sets aside land in the new towns for commercial development by the private sector. This gives private operators the flexibility to decide on the type of eating and marketing facilities to meet the changing needs of residents.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Er Lee Bee Wah asked for more covered linkways to improve the quality of HDB living for residents. She mentioned the specific case in Nee Soon South. This is already covered under programmes such as CIPC and NRP. HDB also constructs covered linkways as part of the design of new public housing developments. Linkways beyond HDB boundaries can be provided by agencies such as LTA and TCs. For the specific proposed linkway at Nee Soon South, it can be nominated for evaluation under existing channels.&nbsp; I understand that a significant portion of the linkway would have to be elevated as it traverses&nbsp;two vehicular driveways to the blocks and&nbsp;two <p align=left>Column: 3233</p>access roads to the petrol kiosk. Its cost-effectiveness would therefore have to&nbsp;be carefully studied.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; It is time for clarifications now.&nbsp; The clock will show the remaining time.&nbsp; I will allocate about 20 minutes for clarification.&nbsp; Mr Cedric Foo.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>6.45 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng:</B> Sir, I thank the Minister for addressing many of the points that I have raised and even agreeing to one or two of them.&nbsp; But nevertheless, there were two points which I had raised which the Minister had not replied to.

they rise sometimes, they may fall.&nbsp; The point I was making was: how do we keep the COVs as low as possible?&nbsp; Not by interfering with market forces but by providing the market with more prompt data.&nbsp; As I understand it, HDB today provides transaction prices for resale flats quarterly.&nbsp; So, my point is, if we can do this, say, monthly, would the market be able then to reflect&nbsp;better valuations, thereby having a smaller gap between the transacted price and the valuation price which may result in lower COVs.&nbsp; Could the Minister help us address this point?</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> Thank you, Mr Chairman, Sir.&nbsp; I am sorry and I apologise that I have not answered all the Members' questions, so it is good that we have a lot <p align=left>Column: 3234</p>of time for clarifications.&nbsp; I will&nbsp;take each of those points that I have missed, in turn.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, Mr Cedric Foo's point about LTV.&nbsp; He mentioned that I have only been able to say "yes" to a few of his suggestions.&nbsp; The&nbsp;good news is that I can tell him that there is "yes" for this suggestion of his.&nbsp; In fact, it is already being done.&nbsp; What do I mean?&nbsp; For young couples who are buying their flats for the first time,&nbsp;there is already a&nbsp;bias towards such young first-timers buying their first flats.&nbsp; We set aside the bulk, 95% of the flats, for them so that they do not have to compete with the second-timers.&nbsp; We also give them additional tickets, additional chances in the draw &ndash; two tickets if they are first-timers, another two more if they are near their parents, etc.&nbsp; But, as far as the LTV&nbsp;is concerned, I think he may have had the wrong impression that the reduction of LTV from 90% to 80% applies to these young couples &ndash; they do not.&nbsp; The reduction of LTV from 90% to 80% only applies to bank loans, not HDB loans.&nbsp; HDB will continue to give such couples 90%.&nbsp; In addition to that,&nbsp;for young couples&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;this may not be&nbsp;well known&nbsp;&ndash; there is a scheme known as the Staggered Downpayment Scheme, and this applies&nbsp;only to young couples buying for the first time.&nbsp; Under this scheme, instead of paying the 10%,&nbsp;they only need to pay 5% of the deposit upfront in cash or CPF when they book their flats.&nbsp; In other words, they get&nbsp;a 90% loan, they pay 5% in cash or CPF and the remaining 5% will be paid when they collect their keys.&nbsp; They can save up for the remaining 5%.&nbsp; It is like a deferred payment for the 5%.&nbsp; So, the Member's&nbsp;wish has been granted.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point was about valuation&nbsp;&ndash; whether we can actually give information faster, monthly instead of quarterly.&nbsp; I think HDB can do that but, frankly, I do not&nbsp;think that will address the crux of the problem.&nbsp; The crux of the <p align=left>Column: 3235</p>problem really&nbsp;is in this kind of market,&nbsp;people are either worried about prices going up and are prepared to pay more or did not buy in the past and therefore now have to buy.&nbsp; In other words,&nbsp;pent-up demand, and also having to pay more.&nbsp; So, that is&nbsp;a real fundamental issue &ndash; the supply and demand issue.&nbsp; We can speed up or make the valuation publications more frequent, that is not a problem.&nbsp; But my worry is that that may not address the problem.&nbsp; In fact, when the supply and demand situation becomes more stabilised and as&nbsp;the anxiety about prices going up or&nbsp;about not enough flats, etc, abates, I think that is when the COVs will start to come down.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

if I understand it, either of them below the age of 30 years old&nbsp;&ndash; purchasing&nbsp;a new HDB flat&nbsp;and, in that case, their&nbsp;LTV will be at 90% and they can pay 5% upfront at, I guess, booking, and the last 5% on collection of keys.&nbsp; But for couples who are buying a private property, that would not apply to them because they will be taking a&nbsp;bank loan, so they will have 80%.&nbsp; So, I would like the Minister to also address that group of people as well as those who are buying resale flats, in which case the staggered downpayment does not really address it.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

My point on COV is not to control the overall market price.&nbsp; If you like, there is a valuation and there is a COV, so this is the total price that a&nbsp;particular buyer needs to pay.&nbsp; The problem is that if the COV grows, the buyer can only finance the basic valuation without the COV, so <p align=left>Column: 3236</p>there is a financing burden&nbsp;to him.&nbsp; My suggestion of having more frequent data releases is to reduce the COVs, so that he is more able to finance it but not necessarily to try and control the overall market price.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> Let me take the second one first because it&nbsp;is counter-intuitive in a way.&nbsp; If we were to say that you can&nbsp; get financing for the&nbsp;COV as well, ie,&nbsp;in addition to the valuation, what will happen?&nbsp; Prices will go up even further.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because what the seller is asking for, really, is what you can afford to pay&nbsp;over and above&nbsp;what the valuation is.&nbsp; So, whatever the valuation is, the buyer is just going to ask for more cash.&nbsp; And the moment&nbsp;we allow for higher cash or we allow for loans to pay for the COV, that is just going to&nbsp; chase prices up even further.&nbsp;&nbsp;So,&nbsp;rather than helping the buyer, by giving him more loans, you are actually not doing him a favour.&nbsp; The Member asked&nbsp;why do we not have valuations which are closer to the actual price.&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is that there is always a lag because the valuation is always based on transactions.&nbsp; Even if those transactions were done yesterday, there is still a lag and you need those transactions to be able to find out what the valuation is.&nbsp; That is what valuation means.&nbsp; So, once you do that valuation based on transactions yesterday, whatever that number is, the seller says, "I would like Cash-Over-Valuation, who can afford to pay me this?"&nbsp; And that is what will happen.&nbsp; So, we can do all these things, but my point is that this is not going to help.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will ask HDB to study it, but please do not get your hopes up and that this will solve the problem.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On LTV for young couples who are buying private property,&nbsp;I am afraid the rules for private property will have to apply to everybody, whether young couples or others.&nbsp; My responsibility is to help young couples who are buying HDB flats for the first time to own their own <p align=left>Column: 3237</p>homes and this is what we will do.&nbsp; For resale flats, the same applies &ndash; if you get a HDB loan for the resale, of course, you enjoy the 90%; if you get a bank loan you enjoy 80%.&nbsp; So, we do not make any distinction when it comes to getting a bank loan.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is a prudent thing to do because, by definition, those who&nbsp;go to the bank for loans are usually those who are not able to enjoy HDB loans, either because of income ceiling or because they have enjoyed many HDB loans, or they are PRs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The other question I want to ask is&nbsp;this.&nbsp; What is the proportion of first-time home buyers buying a resale flat versus going for a new&nbsp;BTO flat now?&nbsp; Can we have a mechanism now to shift people more to think about buying a resale flat?&nbsp;

I think fixing the COV problem is not really fixing the problem.&nbsp; The real issue is whether there are sufficient flats for first-timers who want to buy, whether it is new or resale, ie, the overall demand.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the overall demand for housing, we calculate based on long-term projections:&nbsp;household formations&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;what is the projected new household formation.&nbsp; We also take into account new arrivals, ie, new immigrants, how many new Singaporeans&nbsp;there are.&nbsp; We also take into account the PRs.&nbsp; We model this on a medium- to long-term basis.&nbsp; As a result, we get a certain base number of flats that we need to build.&nbsp; It ranges from 10,000 to 12,000.&nbsp; But&nbsp;ultimately it is still a projection because there are other factors that come into play for demand: the state of the economy, the liquidity in the market, the jobs situation.&nbsp; I give you an example.&nbsp; Before 2006, between 2000&nbsp;and 2005, HDB flat prices were languishing.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you took 1999 as the&nbsp;reference point&nbsp;&ndash; all the way from 1999 to 2006 &ndash; flat prices were&nbsp;below the 1999 level.&nbsp; So, that was the index.&nbsp; Salaries were also languishing but salaries were higher than that.&nbsp; If you take the salaries compared to 1999, they were higher than the 1999 levels.&nbsp; So, affordability was very good.&nbsp; But the demand for flats was low.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; We had flats&nbsp;waiting for people to buy.&nbsp; I have had people who come to me and say, "I could not buy a flat in 2003, 2004", yet there were many flats available.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So,&nbsp;the actual&nbsp;demand for flats is not just a result of an arithmetical computation where you put these numbers in and out comes&nbsp;the demand.&nbsp; The real demand&nbsp;&ndash; the people who really book the flats&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;varies from year to year.&nbsp; So, that is the difficulty.&nbsp; Yes, we do have a computation.&nbsp; We roughly estimate that the demand for flats is met&nbsp;between half to two-third by resale flats and the rest by new flats.&nbsp; Half to two-third depending on the market.&nbsp; The market is high, the ratio comes down; if the&nbsp;market is low, the <p align=left>Column: 3239</p>ratio goes up.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we will always factor in a certain amount of that demand to be met by resale flats, precisely for the reason that the Member mentioned, that we do not build a new flat for every couple or family that wants a flat because, otherwise, there will be a glut.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;want to assure the Member that this is part of our planning philosophy.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The question is whether 50% is too high or too low.&nbsp; We will see after we have implemented the scheme.&nbsp; Is it net?&nbsp; Yes, it is.&nbsp; It is net of cost, net of stamp fees, net of legal fees,&nbsp;etc.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Young couples&nbsp;&ndash; fiance/fiancee scheme&nbsp;&ndash; yes, we did have interim rental housing.&nbsp; The problem with that, of course, is that&nbsp;we have to set the rental pretty high.&nbsp; It cannot be at $30, just like the subsidised rental scheme.&nbsp; So, instead of that scheme, we have decided that we will let them buy in the market and allow them to sell when their new flat is ready.&nbsp; In other words, they do not have to satisfy the minimum occupation period.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is equivalent to buying a flat for three years or so, and then sell it.&nbsp; If they make a profit after three years, good luck to them.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Secondly, I would like to ask whether the Government is concerned with the competitive bidding system of tendering out the land.&nbsp; It will, in time to come, jack up the price of food at the hawker centres and wet markets as well.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien:</B> Sir, I think this argument has been quite attractive to some quarters of society&nbsp;&ndash; the fact that it is a commercial tender, therefore, it must&nbsp;drive up&nbsp;the price of rental because of the tender process.&nbsp; As a result, it will definitely lead to higher prices.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would just like to remind Members that we are talking about different factors at play.&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, it is the cost of operating&nbsp;a hawker centre.&nbsp; While it is a tender process, we have also stipulated that the building specifications have to be&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3241</p>minimal that is required for the kind of facilities.&nbsp; So, in the case of Sengkang, we have actually stipulated that it is not going to be&nbsp;air-conditioned and so forth.&nbsp; That is one part of it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, we have seen that in some cases, even in the traditional hawker centres, some&nbsp;tenants, who are able to sublet at a higher rental, have done so, and I think we should not fault the tenants.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because, if they have medical problems or they are getting on in age, and if they can find someone else to take over their stalls,&nbsp;or if they can rent it out and get a higher rental, that is something that we should allow them to do.&nbsp; So, it does not mean that going by the traditional mode of having stalls at a low rental,&nbsp;we can assure that the cost will be always low.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, it is about the price of the food.&nbsp; Here again, we cannot&nbsp;assume that the consumers have no choice but to accept high prices.&nbsp; The food has to be good and&nbsp;has to be competitive with what is being offered in the vicinity.&nbsp; We have looked at the prices at Sengkang.&nbsp; I have been there personally.&nbsp; I have looked at the prices and they are comparable to any hawker centre in the neighbourhood&nbsp;&ndash; $3 for a plate of chicken rice and&nbsp;90 cents for a cup of coffee.&nbsp; I do not think&nbsp;we can consider that exorbitant.&nbsp; But, most importantly, by having a single tenant to manage, we can assure that there is a good standard of cleanliness, because there is one person that we can hold responsible. We can also be assured that there is a good standard of service, because they are able to have 24 hours' operation.&nbsp; That master tenant is able to manage the tenants such that enough stalls are open for 24 hours, and providing much better service to the residents in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; If we&nbsp;go there in the early hours,&nbsp;we will&nbsp;find it to be quite crowded.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 3242</p>So there are advantages&nbsp;in having a master tenant&nbsp;who is able to adjust the tenant mix, so that it remains relevant.&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the&nbsp;hawker centre in Hougang, before we demolished it, we&nbsp;were looking at tenancy with 34% vacancy.&nbsp; That is not a very vibrant mode of community gathering.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty-four percent&nbsp;of the stalls were&nbsp;vacant.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because NEA, as the regulator, is very hard pressed.&nbsp; It does not have the role to micro manage the tenants' businesses.&nbsp; Whereas the commercial operator will be able to do that and has the incentive&nbsp;to do that.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman:</B> Since this is a very hot topic, we&nbsp;will carry on till 7.15 pm.&nbsp; Er Lee Bee Wah.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Er Lee Bee Wah:</B> Sir, I would like to show the Senior Minister of State this two-kilometre long linkway along Woodlands Avenue 2 and Woodlands Avenue 9, whereas in my area I am asking for a&nbsp;160-metre long linkway.&nbsp; I would like to know how I can make use of CIPC funding, because I have explored with the Town Council and I was told that using CIPC will not provide&nbsp;sufficient funding for this linkway.&nbsp; I have also asked HDB to look into extending the NRP to include this area.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien:</B> This is a very specific case.&nbsp; Without knowing the full details of the case, I would not go too much into the details. Let me say that, in general, for CIPC and NRP, there are certain cost guidelines that the Government&nbsp;imposes, and that is to&nbsp;avoid a situation where certain installation of facilities costs too much&nbsp;to build.&nbsp; For example, if the Member is talking about a linkway that crosses two roads leading to a petrol kiosk and a religious organisation like a Sikh temple, I would imagine that the covered linkway would be fairly high in order to allow trucks&nbsp;to gain access to the petrol kiosk.&nbsp; I also would imagine that it would not be very effective because if it is a high covered linkway&nbsp;and if it&nbsp;rains, it  <p align=left>Column: 3243</p>is not going to shelter&nbsp;residents&nbsp;very much.&nbsp; It probably needs to be quite broad in order to allow cars to go through without any obstruction, and therefore piling and a heavy structure will have to be built.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I am saying here is that there is a certain limit or cost norms in order&nbsp;to apply for CIPC.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is to ensure that installations and facilities are basically provided on a&nbsp;cost effective manner across the entire nation, including&nbsp;Nee Soon&nbsp;South.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Liang Eng Hwa--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I would like&nbsp;to ask whether the HDB wants to review this system perhaps to see whether it is the best system to manage the flat orders, especially when&nbsp;we have a high subscription rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;We may send the wrong signal to the market that there is a demand in the market, and then the resale market starts to move up as well.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly,&nbsp;the Minister also mentioned that many of the applicants who dropped out&nbsp;said that it was not a flat of their choice.&nbsp; Perhaps the HDB may want to look at what is the flat of choice&nbsp;of many of the applicants.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> Sir, on whether the BTO exercise is the best system, basically, I think what the Member is asking is&nbsp;instead of balloting, whether we should have another system.&nbsp; Essentially, it is back to this perennial issue about allocation of a scarce resource.&nbsp; You either ballot or you queue up, which is what we have done in the past.&nbsp; We used the queue system.&nbsp; Or&nbsp;we allocate by price, which is basically what the resale market does.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 3244</p>The resale market is really allocating a scarce resource by price.&nbsp; Whoever pays the highest gets it.&nbsp; So these are the three ways.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going by price, obviously, is out of the question, because we are talking about subsidised public housing.&nbsp; Going by queue, we have done it before.&nbsp; We have done that.&nbsp;&nbsp;Applicants&nbsp;join the queue.&nbsp; The first one in the queue will get it.&nbsp; The last one in the queue will have to wait.&nbsp; Say, if there are 5,000 people in the queue and 500 or 1,000 flats available, then they have got to wait.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The balloting system is not ideal but I think it is a fair one.&nbsp; It allows us to allocate this scarce resource in a way which is equitable.&nbsp; Some people have&nbsp;suggested that we should go&nbsp;on the basis of need&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;in other words, who need it more should get it.&nbsp; The problem with that is&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;who determines need?&nbsp; The first one&nbsp;comes to us and says, "I've just got married.&nbsp; I want to have a house.&nbsp; I need it more."&nbsp; Another guy says, "I've been married for five years and I don't have a house to stay.&nbsp; I need it more."&nbsp; And when&nbsp;we add up all these people with legitimate needs,&nbsp;we find the queue is back again, and then we are back to square one&nbsp;&ndash; how do we allocate a scarce resource?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, if the Member or anybody else has any ideas&nbsp;for&nbsp;a better system to allocate this scarce resource, I would be very happy to consider.&nbsp; But, in the meantime,&nbsp;we have tweaked the system.&nbsp; We have favoured the first-timers more than the second-timers.&nbsp; We have added one extra parameter, which is closeness to family by giving them additional tickets.&nbsp; We can tweak it a little bit more but, finally, it is still the number versus the queue.&nbsp; And the length of the queue really is not determined by the need, as I said, but by the attractiveness of the project, which brings me to the second point that the Member raised.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3245</p> He said let us look at more flats of choice and reduce the drop-out rate.&nbsp; Earlier, I went through&nbsp;an example in some detail.&nbsp;&nbsp;This applicant&nbsp;did not want a flat which is not next to his house.&nbsp; I cannot be building all new flats just next to each other's house.&nbsp; He did not want a flat which is&nbsp;next to a mosque, or&nbsp;next to anything that is inconvenient.&nbsp; It is not possible.&nbsp; In every space in Singapore, we will have to build&nbsp;a place of worship, rental flats, schools, whatever.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, what is a flat of their choice?&nbsp; Some have&nbsp;argued that we should not be building flats on the second floor, because nobody wants a second floor flat.&nbsp; So should&nbsp;we only build flats like some private condominiums do today, starting off from the fifth or six floors?&nbsp; The rest will be empty?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some others have suggested why&nbsp;not have community centres on the lower floors and flats on the higher floors.&nbsp; Basically, that means in land scarce Singapore, we have to allocate more land for public housing.&nbsp; Ultimately, my point is that there will be some flats which are not "ideal" and buyers will have to make their decision and trade off.&nbsp; We cannot promise everybody a flat of their choice.&nbsp; If we go on that basis, then I think the queue will be even longer.&nbsp; But, again, I welcome any good ideas from Members of this House on how we can actually build more flats of their choice.&nbsp; There is a limited resource, which is land.&nbsp; There is limited budget.&nbsp; We will&nbsp;build within&nbsp;these limits&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3246</p>to&nbsp;fulfil our commitment, which is&nbsp;to make sure that young Singaporeans have a flat.&nbsp; But to have a flat of their choice&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;that part is not so easy to achieve.&nbsp;&nbsp;When people say that they have not been able to get a flat, I think what they mean is that they have not been able to get a flat that they would like to have.&nbsp; I think there is a difference between the two.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
